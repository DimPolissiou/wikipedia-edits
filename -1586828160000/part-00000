The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades.

[[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment. Seabee Naval Training Centers were named for former heads of the Civil Engineer Corps and BuDocks: RADM. Mordecai T. Endicott, RADM. Harry H. Rousseau, RADM. Richard C. Hollyday,  RADM. Charles W. Park.<ref>[https://navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/chiefs-short-bios-since-1898.pdf NAVFAC website Washington Navy Yard, DC]</ref>  Camp Peary was named for RADM. [[Robert Peary]].  The Seabees also named a Training Center for the first CEC killed in action, Lt. Irwin W. Lee and Lt. (jg) George W. Stephenson of the 24th CB.<ref>{{cite |title=Camp Lee-Stephenson Monument at Quoddy Village, Eastport, Maine |publisher= CEC / Seabee Historical Foundation |url=http://seabeehf.org/resources/memorials-monuments/camp-lee-stephenson-monument-at-quoddy-village-eastport-maine/}}</ref> Between tours units be would return to the Recuperation and Replacement Center at [[Camp Parks]], CA.\n\nA pressing issue for the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) was command of CBs.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> [[United States Navy Regulations|Navy regulations]] stated that command of naval personnel was limited to line officers of the fleet. BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== CB rates ===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April 1945, p. 46</ref>\n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for unofficial trades like souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], [[Float (nautical)|float pontoons]], [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== CB rates ===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.

The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April 1945, p. 46</ref>\n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.

{"title_page": "History of the United States (1789\u20131849)", "text_new": "{{History of the United States}}\n[[George Washington]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1789|elected]] the first [[President of the United States|president]] in 1789, worked with the heads of the departments of State, Treasury, and War, along with an Attorney General (the Justice Department wasn't created until 1870), the group of which later became known as his [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]]. Based in New York, the new government acted quickly to rebuild the nation's financial structure. Enacting the program of Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], the government assumed the Revolutionary War debts of the states and the national government, and refinanced them with new federal bonds. It paid for the program through new tariffs and taxes; the [[Whiskey Rebellion|tax on whiskey]] led to a revolt in the west; Washington raised an army and suppressed it. The nation adopted a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as 10 amendments to the new [[Constitution of the United States|constitution]]. Fleshing out the Constitution's specification of the judiciary as capped by a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] established the entire [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]]. The Supreme Court became important under the leadership of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] (1801\u20131835), a federalist and nationalist who built a strong Supreme Court and strengthened the national government.\n\nThe 1790s were highly contentious, as the [[First Party System]] emerged in the contest between Hamilton and his [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] party, and [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his [[Democratic-Republican|Republican]] party. Washington and Hamilton were building a strong national government, with a broad financial base, and the support of merchants and financiers throughout the country. Jeffersonians opposed the new national Bank, the Navy, and federal taxes. The Federalists favored Britain, which was embattled in a series of wars with France. Jefferson's victory in 1800 opened the era of [[Jeffersonian democracy]], and doomed the upper-crust Federalists to increasingly marginal roles.\n\nThe [[Louisiana Purchase]] from [[Napoleon]] in 1803 opened vast [[Western United States|Western]] expanses of fertile land, which exactly met the needs of the rapidly expanding population of [[Plain Folk of the Old South|yeomen farmers]] whom Jefferson championed.\n\nThe Americans declared war on Britain (the [[War of 1812]]) to uphold American honor at sea,<ref>Norman K. Risjord, \"1812: Conservatives, War Hawks, and the Nation's Honor\". ''William And Mary Quarterly'' 1961 18(2): 196\u2013210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]</ref> and to end the Indian raids in the west, as well as to temporarily seize Canadian territory as a negotiating chip. Secretary of State  James Monroe said in June 1812, \"It might be necessary to invade Canada, not as an object of the war but as a means to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion.\" <ref>J.C.A. Stagg, \"James Madison and the coercion of Great Britain: Canada, the West Indies, and the War of 1812.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1981) 38#1: 3-34.</ref>  Despite incompetent government management, and a series of defeats early on, Americans found new generals like [[Andrew Jackson]], [[William Henry Harrison]], and [[Winfield Scott]], who repulsed British invasions and broke the alliance between the British and the Indians that held up settlement of the Old Northwest. The Federalists, who had opposed the war to the point of trading with the enemy and threatening secession, were devastated by the triumphant ending of the war. The remaining Indians east of the Mississippi were kept on reservations or moved via the [[Trail of Tears]] to reservations in what later became Oklahoma.\n\nThe spread of democracy opened the ballot box to nearly all white men, allowing the [[Jacksonian democracy]] to dominate politics during the [[Second Party System]]. Whigs, representing wealthier planters, merchants, financiers, and professionals, wanted to modernize the society, using tariffs and federally funded [[internal improvements]]; they were blocked by the Jacksonians, who closed down the national Bank in the 1830s. The Jacksonians wanted expansion\u2014that is \"[[Manifest Destiny]]\"\u2014into new lands that would be occupied by farmers and planters. Thanks to the annexation of Texas, the defeat of Mexico in war, and a compromise with Britain, the western third of the nation rounded out the continental United States by 1848.\n\nHowe (2007) argues that the transformation America underwent was not so much political democratization but rather the explosive growth of technologies and networks of infrastructure and communication\u2014the telegraph, railroads, the post office, and an expanding print industry. They made possible the religious revivals of the [[Second Great Awakening]], the expansion of education and social reform. They modernized party politics and sped up business by enabling the fast, efficient movement of goods, money, and people across an expanding nation. They transformed a loose-knit collection of parochial agricultural communities into a powerful cosmopolitan nation.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815\u20131848'' (2007), which is dedicated to the memory of John Quincy Adams.</ref> Economic modernization proceeded rapidly, thanks to highly profitable cotton crops in the South, new textile and machine-making industries in the Northeast, and a fast developing transportation infrastructure.\n\nDuring 1791 and 1838, 13 new states were formed. \n\nBreaking loose from European models, the Americans developed their own high culture, notably in literature and in higher education. The Second Great Awakening brought revivals across the country, forming new denominations and greatly increasing church membership, especially among Methodists and Baptists. By the 1840s increasing numbers of immigrants were arriving from Europe, especially British, Irish, and Germans. Many settled in the cities, which were starting to emerge as a major factor in the economy and society. The Whigs had warned that annexation of Texas would lead to a crisis over slavery, and they were proven right by the turmoil of the 1850s that led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>[[Joel H.

All the leaders of the new nation were committed to [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], and the doubts of the [[Anti-Federalists]] of 1788 were allayed with the passage of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as the first ten amendments to the Constitution in 1791.<ref>Forrest McDonald, ''The Presidency of George Washington'' (American Presidency Series) (1988)</ref>\n\nThe first census, conducted by Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], enumerated a population of 3.9 million, with a density of 4.5 people per square mile of land area. There were only 12 cities of more than 5,000 population, as the great majority of the people were farmers.\n\nWhereas the Constitution only defined the judiciary as vested in one Supreme Court and in various inferior courts that Congress was to define, Congress passed the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], which established the entire [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]]. The act provided for the Supreme Court to have six justices, and for two additional levels: three [[United States circuit court|circuit courts]] and 13 [[United States district court|district courts]]. It also created the offices of [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]], Deputy Marshal, and [[United States Attorney|District Attorney]] in each [[United States federal judicial district|federal judicial district]]. The [[Compromise of 1790]] located the national capital in a district to be defined in the southern state of Maryland (now the District of Columbia), and enabled the federal assumption of state debts.<ref>Charles Warren, ''The Supreme Court in United States History, Vol. 1: 1789\u20131821'' (1926)</ref>\n\nWashington had hoped that his Secretary of the Treasury would be [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], celebrated Philadelphia merchant and so-called \"financier of the Revolution\", but he declined and instead the post went to the president's young former aide-de-camp [[Alexander Hamilton]] who with Washington's support and Jefferson's opposition, convinced Congress to pass a far-reaching financial program that was patterned after the system developed in England a century earlier. It funded the debts of the American Revolution, set up a national bank, and set up a system of tariffs and taxes. His policies had the effect of linking the economic interests of the states, and of wealthy Americans, to the success of the national government, as well as enhancing the international financial standing of the new nation.<ref>Max M. Edling, and Mark D. Kaplanoff, \"Alexander Hamilton's Fiscal Reform: Transforming the Structure of Taxation in the Early Republic,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'', October 2004, Vol. 61 Issue 4, pp 713-744</ref>\n\nMost Representatives of the South opposed Hamilton's plan because they had already repudiated their debts and thus gained little from it. But more importantly, there were early signs of the economic and cultural rift between the Northern and Southern states that was to burst into flames seven decades later, being that the South and its plantation-based economy resisted the idea of a centralized federal government and being subordinated to Northeastern business interests. Despite considerable opposition in Congress from Southerners, Hamilton's plan was moved into effect during the middle of 1790. The First Bank of the United States was thus created that year despite arguments from Thomas Jefferson and his supporters that it was unconstitutional while Hamilton declared that it was entirely within the powers granted to the federal government. Hamilton's other proposals, including protection tariffs for nascent American industry, were defeated.\n\nThe [[Whiskey Rebellion]] happened in 1794\u2014when settlers in the [[Monongahela Valley]] of western Pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey, which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money. It was the first serious test of the federal government. Washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court. By August 1794, the protests became dangerously close to outright rebellion, and on August 7, several thousand armed settlers gathered near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Washington then invoked the [[Militia Law of 1792]] to summon the militias of several states. A force of 13,000 men was organized, and Washington personally led it to [[Western Pennsylvania]]. The revolt immediately collapsed, and there was no violence.<ref>George E. Connor, \"The politics of insurrection: A comparative analysis of the Shays', Whiskey, and Fries' Rebellions,\" ''Social Science Journal'', 1992, Vol. 29 Issue 3, pp 259-81</ref>\n\nForeign policy unexpectedly took center stage starting in 1793, when revolutionary France became engulfed in war with the rest of Europe, an event that was to lead to 22 years of fighting. France claimed that its 1778 alliance with the US meant that the latter was bound to come to their aid. The Washington administration's policy of neutrality was widely supported, but the Jeffersonians strongly favored France and deeply distrusted the British, who they saw as enemies of Republicanism. In addition, they sought to annex Spanish territory in the South and West. Meanwhile, Hamilton and the business community favored Britain, which was by far America's largest trading partner. The Republicans gained support in the winter of 1793\u201394 as Britain seized American merchant ships and impressed their crews into the Royal Navy, but the tensions were resolved with the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794, which opened up 10 years of prosperous trade in exchange for which Britain would remove troops from its fortifications along the Canada\u2013US border. The Jeffersonians viewed the Treaty as a surrender to British moneyed interests, and mobilized their supporters nationwide to defeat the treaty. The Federalists likewise rallied supporters in a vicious conflict, which continued until 1795 when Washington publicly intervened in the debate, using his prestige to secure ratification. By this point, the economic and political advantages of the Federalist position had become clear to all concerned, combined with growing disdain for France after the Reign of Terror and Jacobin anti-religious policies. Jefferson promptly resigned as Secretary of State. Historian George Herring notes the \"remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains\" produced by the Jay Treaty.<ref>George C. Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776'' (2008) p. 80</ref><ref>Stanley M. Elkins, and Eric McKitrick, ''The Age of Federalism: The Early American Republic, 1788\u20131800'' (1994), ch. 9</ref>\n\nContinuing conflict between Hamilton and Jefferson, especially over foreign policy, led to the formation of the [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] and [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|Republican]] parties. Although Washington remained aloof and warned against political parties in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]], he generally supported Hamilton and Hamiltonian programs over those of Jefferson. The Democratic-Republican Party dominated the Upper South, Western frontier, and in parts of the middle states. Federalist support was concentrated in the major Northern cities and South Carolina. After his death in 1799 he became the great symbolic hero of the Federalists.<ref>James Sharp, ''American Politics in the Early Republic: The New Nation in Crisis'' (1995)</ref>\n\n===Emergence of political parties===\nThe '''[[First Party System]]''' between 1792 and 1824 featured two national parties competing for control of the presidency, Congress, and the states: the [[Federalist Party]] was created by [[Alexander Hamilton]] and was dominant to 1800. The rival [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican Party]] (Democratic-Republican Party) was created by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], and was dominant after 1800. Both parties originated in national politics but moved to organize supporters and voters in every state. These comprised \"probably the first modern party system in the world\" because they were based on voters, not factions of aristocrats at court or parliament.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ''The First Party System: Federalists and Republicans'' (1972) p. v</ref> The Federalists appealed to the business community, the Republicans to the planters and farmers. By 1796, politics in every state was nearly monopolized by the two parties.\n\nJefferson wrote on Feb. 12, 1798:\n\n<blockquote>Two political Sects have arisen within the U. S. the one believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support; the other that like the analogous branch in the English Government, it is already too strong for the republican parts of the Constitution; and therefore in equivocal cases they incline to the legislative powers: the former of these are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition: the latter are stiled republicans, whigs, jacobins, anarchists, disorganizers, etc. these terms are in familiar use with most persons.<ref>Francis N. Thorpe, ed \"A Letter from Jefferson on the Political Parties, 1798,\" ''American Historical Review v.3#3 (April 1898) pp 488\u201389</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Federalists promoted the financial system of Treasury Secretary Hamilton, which emphasized federal assumption of state debts, a tariff to pay off those debts, a national bank to facilitate financing, and encouragement of banking and manufacturing. The Republicans, based in the plantation South, opposed a strong executive power, were hostile to a standing army and navy, demanded a limited reading of the Constitutional powers of the federal government, and strongly opposed the Hamilton financial program. Perhaps even more important was foreign policy, where the Federalists favored Britain because of its political stability and its close ties to American trade, while the Republicans admired the French and the French Revolution. Jefferson was especially fearful that British aristocratic influences would undermine [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. Britain and France were at war 1793\u20131815, with one brief interruption. American policy was neutrality, with the federalists hostile to France, and the Republicans hostile to Britain. The [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794 marked the decisive mobilization of the two parties and their supporters in every state. President Washington, while officially nonpartisan, generally supported the Federalists and that party made Washington their iconic hero.\n\n===Adams Administration: 1797\u20131801===\n{{Main|Presidency of John Adams}}\n[[File:JohnAdams 2nd US President.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Adams]],<br/>Second U.S. President]]\n[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Hamilton]],<br/>First U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nWashington retired in 1797, firmly declining to serve for more than eight years as the nation's head. The Federalists supported Vice President [[John Adams]] for President. Adams defeated Jefferson in the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 presidential election]], who as the runner-up became Vice President under the operation of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] of that time.\n\nEven before he entered the presidency, Adams had quarreled with [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014and thus was hindered by a divided Federalist party.<ref>Ralph A. Brown, ''Presidency of John Adams (American Presidency Series) (1975)</ref>\n\nThese domestic difficulties were compounded by international complications: France, angered by American approval in 1795 of the [[Jay Treaty]] with its great enemy Britain proclaimed that food and war material bound for British ports were subject to seizure by the French navy. By 1797, France had seized 300 American ships and had broken off diplomatic relations with the United States. When Adams sent three other commissioners to Paris to negotiate, agents of Foreign Minister Charles Maurice de [[Talleyrand]] (whom Adams labeled \"X, Y and Z\" in his report to Congress) informed the Americans that negotiations could only begin if the United States loaned France $12 million and bribed officials of the French government. American hostility to France rose to an excited pitch, fanned by French ambassador [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]]. Federalists used the \"[[XYZ Affair]]\" to create a new American army, strengthen the fledgling [[United States Navy]], impose the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] to stop pro-French activities (which had severe repercussions for American [[civil liberties]]), and enact new taxes to pay for it. The [[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]], which changed the residency requirement for citizenship from five to 14 years, was targeted at Irish and French immigrants suspected of supporting the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The Sedition Act proscribed writing, speaking or publishing anything of \"a false, scandalous and malicious\" nature against the President or Congress. The few convictions won under the Sedition Act only created martyrs to the cause of civil liberties and aroused support for the Republicans. Jefferson and his allies launched a counterattack, with two states stating in the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] that state legislatures could nullify acts of Congress. However, all the other states rejected this proposition, and [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]]\u2014or as it was called, the \"principle of 98\"\u2014became the preserve of a faction of the [[Jeffersonian Democracy|Republicans]] called the [[Quids]].<ref>Kevin Gutzman, \"The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions Reconsidered: 'An Appeal to the Real Laws of Our Country,'\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 66 (2000), pp 473-96.</ref>\n\nIn 1799, after a series of naval battles with the French (known as the [[Quasi-War]]), full-scale war seemed inevitable. In this crisis, Adams broke with his party and sent three new commissioners to France. [[Napoleon]], who had just come to power, received them cordially, and the danger of conflict subsided with the negotiation of the [[Convention of 1800]], which formally released the United States from its [[Treaty of Alliance (1777)|1778 wartime alliance]] with France. However, reflecting American weakness, France refused to pay $20 million in compensation for American ships seized by the French navy.<ref>Alexander De Conde, ''The quasi-war: the politics and diplomacy of the undeclared war with France 1797\u20131801'' (1966).</ref>\n\nIn his final hours in office, Adams appointed [[John Marshall]] as chief justice. Serving until his death in 1835, Marshall dramatically expanded the powers of the Supreme Court and provided a Federalist interpretation of the Constitution that made for a strong national government.<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1996)</ref>\n\n==Thomas Jefferson==\n{{Main|Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian democracy}}\n[[File:ThomasJefferson.jpg|thumb|Thomas Jefferson,<br/>Third U.S. President]]\n\nJefferson is a central figure in early American history, highly praised for his political leadership, but also criticized for the role of slavery in his private life.  He championed equality, democracy and republicanism, attacking aristocratic and monarchistic tendencies.  He was a leader in American independence, advocated religious freedom and tolerance, and opposed the centralizing tendencies of the urban financial elite.  He formed the second national political party and led it to dominance in 1800, then worked for western expansion and exploration.  Critics decry  the contradiction  between his ownership of hundreds of  slaves and his famous declaration that \"all men are created equal\", and argue that he fathered children with his slave mistress.<ref>Annette Gordon-Reed, 'Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings: An American Controversy' (1997)</ref><ref>Francis D. Cogliano, ''Thomas Jefferson: Reputation and Legacy'' (2006)</ref>\n\nUnder Washington and Adams the Federalists had established a strong government, but sometimes it followed policies that alienated the citizenry. For example, in 1798, to pay for the rapidly expanding army and navy, the Federalists had enacted a new tax on houses, land and slaves, affecting every property owner in the country. In the [[Fries's Rebellion]] hundreds of farmers in Pennsylvania revolted\u2014Federalists saw a breakdown in civil society. Some tax resisters were arrested\u2014then pardoned by Adams. Republicans denounced this action as an example of Federalist tyranny.<ref>Whitman H. Ridgway, \"Fries in the Federalist Imagination: A Crisis of Republican Society,\" ''Pennsylvania History'', January 2000, Vol. 67 Issue 1, pp 141-160</ref>\n\nJefferson had steadily gathered behind him a great mass of small farmers, shopkeepers and other workers which asserted themselves as Democratic-Republicans in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]]. Jefferson enjoyed extraordinary favor because of his appeal to American idealism. In his inaugural address, the first such speech in the new capital of [[Washington, DC]], he promised \"a wise and frugal government\" to preserve order among the inhabitants but would \"leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry, and improvement\".<ref>LaGreca, Gen.

Believing America to be a haven for the oppressed, he reduced the residency requirement for naturalization back to five years again.\n\nBy the end of his second term, Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] had reduced the national debt to less than $560 million. This was accomplished by reducing the number of executive department employees and Army and Navy officers and enlisted men, and by otherwise curtailing government and military spending.\n\nJefferson's domestic policy was uneventful and hands-off, the administration mainly concerning itself with foreign affairs and particularly territorial expansion. Except for Gallatin's reforms, their main preoccupation was purging the government of Federalist judges. The president and his associates were widely distrustful of the judicial branch, especially because Adams had made several \"midnight\" appointments prior to leaving office in March 1801. In ''Marbury vs Madison'' (1803), the Supreme Court under [[John Marshall]] established the precedent of being able to review and overturn legislation passed by Congress. This ruling by leading Federalist upset Jefferson to the point where his administration began opening impeachment hearings against judges that were perceived as abusing their power. The attempted purge of the judicial branch reached its climax with the trial of Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]]. When Chase was acquitted by the Senate, Jefferson abandoned his campaign.<ref>Frank Thompson Jr, and Daniel H. Pollitt. \"Impeachment of Federal Judges: An Historical Overview.\" ''North Carolina Law Review'' 49 (1970): 87-121, especially pp 92-100.

A few weeks afterward, war resumed between Britain and [[Napoleon]]'s France. The United States, dependent on European revenues from the export of agricultural goods, tried to export food and raw materials to both warring [[Great Power]]s and to profit from transporting goods between their home markets and Caribbean colonies. Both sides permitted this trade when it benefited them but opposed it when it did not. Following the 1805 destruction of the French navy at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], Britain sought to impose a stranglehold over French overseas trade ties. Thus, in retaliation against U.S. trade practices, Britain imposed a [[Orders in Council (1807)|loose blockade]] of the American coast. Believing that Britain could not rely on other sources of food than the United States, Congress and President Jefferson suspended all U.S. trade with foreign nations in the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], hoping to get the British to end their blockade of the American coast. The Embargo Act, however, devastated American agricultural exports and weakened American ports while Britain found other sources of food.<ref>Marshall Smelser, ''The Democratic Republic: 1801\u20131815'' (1968) ch 7-8</ref>\n===War of 1812===\n{{Main|war of 1812}}\n[[James Madison]] won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1808|U.S. presidential election of 1808]], largely on the strength of his abilities in foreign affairs at a time when Britain and France were both on the brink of war with the United States. He was quick to repeal the Embargo Act, refreshing American seaports. Unfortunately, despite his intellectual brilliance, Madison lacked Jefferson's leadership and tried to merely copy his predecessor's policies verbatim. He tried various trade restrictions to try to force Britain and France to respect freedom of the seas, but they were unsuccessful. The British had undisputed mastery over the sea after defeating the French and Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805, and they took advantage of this to seize American ships at will and force their sailors into serving the Royal Navy. Even worse, the size of the U.S. Navy was reduced due to ideological opposition to a large standing military and the Federal government became considerably weakened when the charter of the First National Bank expired and Congress declined to renew it. A clamor for military action thus erupted just as relations with Britain and France were at a low point and the U.S.'s ability to wage war had been reduced.\n\n[[File:Battle erie.jpg|thumb|right|340px|''Battle of Lake Erie''; American victory in 1813 meant control of the Northwest; painting by [[William H. Powell]] (1865)]]\n\nIn response to continued British interference with American shipping (including the practice of [[impressment]] of American sailors into the British Navy), and to British aid to [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] in the [[Old Northwest]], the [[Twelfth United States Congress|Twelfth Congress]]\u2014led by Southern and Western Jeffersonians\u2014declared war on Britain in 1812. Westerners and Southerners were the most ardent supporters of the war, given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements, and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports. [[New England]] was making a fine profit and its Federalists opposed the war, almost to the point of secession. The Federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national role.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''Prologue to war: England and the United States, 1805\u20131812'' (1961) [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203215517/http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520009967 full text online]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tecumseh ante Harrison crop.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Tecumseh]] and Governor William Henry Harrison; Tecumseh's death in the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813 ended British hopes to create a neutral Indian state in the Midwest]]\n\nThe war was draw in the war after bitter fighting that lasted even after the [[Burning of Washington]] in August 1814 and [[Andrew Jackson]]'s smashing defeat of the British invasion army at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815. The ratification of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in February, 1815, ended the war, returned to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''. Britain's alliance with the Native Americans ended, and the Indians were the major losers of the war. News of the victory at New Orleans over the best British combat troops came at the same time as news of the peace, giving Americans a psychological triumph and opening the [[Era of Good Feelings]]. The war destroyed the anti-war Federalist Party, and opened roles as national candidates to generals [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] among others, as well as civilian leaders James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay.<ref>Walter R. Borneman, ''1812: The War That Forged a Nation'' (2005)</ref>\n\n==Era of Good Feelings and the rise of Nationalism==\n{{Main|Era of Good Feelings|James Monroe}}\n\nFollowing the [[War of 1812]], America began to assert a newfound sense of nationalism. America began to rally around national heroes such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and patriotic feelings emerged in such works as [[Francis Scott Key]]'s poem [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]. Under the direction of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] issued a series of opinions reinforcing the role of the national government.<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998)</ref> These decisions included [[McCulloch v Maryland]] and [[Gibbons v Ogden]]; both of which reaffirmed the supremacy of the national government over the states. The signing of the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] helped to settle the western border of the country through popular and peaceable means.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The awakening of American nationalism, 1815\u20131828'' (1965)</ref>\n\n===Sectionalism===\nEven as [[nationalism]] increased across the country, its effects were limited by a renewed sense of [[sectionalism]]. The [[New England]] states that had opposed the War of 1812 felt an increasing decline in political power with the demise of the [[Federalist Party]]. This loss was tempered with the arrival of a new industrial movement and increased demands for northern banking. The [[industrial revolution]] in the United States was advanced by the immigration of [[Samuel Slater]] from Great Britain and arrival of textile mills beginning in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In the south, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] by [[Eli Whitney]] radically increased the value of slave labor. The export of southern [[cotton]] was now the predominant export of the U.S. The western states continued to thrive under the \"frontier spirit.\" Individualism was prized as exemplified by [[Davey Crockett]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s folk hero Natty Bumpo from [[The Leatherstocking Tales]]. Following the death of [[Tecumseh]] in 1813, Native Americans lacked the unity to stop white settlement.\n\n===Era of Good Feelings===\nDomestically, the [[Presidency of James Monroe|presidency]] of [[James Monroe]] (1817\u20131825) was hailed at the time and since as the \"Era of Good Feelings\" because of the decline of partisan politics and heated rhetoric after the war. The Federalist Party collapsed, but without an opponent the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] decayed as sectional interests came to the fore.\n\nThe '''[[Monroe Doctrine]]''' was drafted by Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] in collaboration with the British, and proclaimed by Monroe in late 1823. He asserted the Americas should be free from additional European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries' affairs. It further stated the United States' intention to stay neutral in wars between European powers and their colonies but to consider any new colonies or interference with independent countries in the Americas as hostile acts towards the United States. No new colonies were ever formed.\n\n===Annexation of Florida and border treaties===\nAs the 19th century dawned, Florida had been undisputed Spanish territory for almost 250 years, aside from 20 years of British control between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution. Although a sparsely inhabited swampland, expansionist-minded Americans were eager to grab it and already, in 1808, American settlers had invaded the westernmost tip of Florida and expelled the local Spanish authorities, after which Congress hastily passed a bill annexing it under the claim that the Louisiana Purchase had guaranteed the territory to the United States. During the War of 1812, American troops occupied and seized the area around Mobile Bay. Spain, then engulfed in war with France, did not react to either of these actions. Also taking advantage of the mother country's distraction, Spain's Latin American colonies rose up in revolt and Madrid was forced to denude Florida of troops to suppress the rebellions. As the Spanish withdrew, Native American and pirate raids from Florida to the US increased. In 1818, Andrew Jackson led an army into Florida to quell the chaotic situation there. He arrested and hanged two British agents who had been encouraging Indian raids, leading to an outcry in London and calls for war. However, cooler heads prevailed and the situation did not escalate further. A year later, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] with Spain. The Spanish agreed to turn over the no-longer-defensible Florida to the US and also give up their extremely flimsy {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} claims to the distant Oregon Territory, in exchange for which American claims on Texas were renounced (some Americans had also been claiming parts of that territory under the Louisiana Purchase). The heretofore vague border between the US and Spanish North America was also settled upon. Although American designs on Texas did not disappear, they were put on the backburner for the more immediately important Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1818, the U.S. and Britain also agreed to settle the western border with Canada, which was established at the 49th parallel running straight from the Great Lakes to the Rocky Mountains. Included in this settlement was the headwaters of the Red River in what would eventually become Minnesota, and the Mesabi Range, which eventually proved to contain vast amounts of iron ore. The eastern border of Canada continued to be disputed and was not settled until 1845.\n\n==Emergence of Second Party System==\n{{Main|Second Party System|Presidency of Andrew Jackson}}\nMonroe was reelected without opposition in 1820, and the old caucus system for selecting Republican candidates collapsed in 1820. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1824|presidential election of 1824]], factions in Tennessee and Pennsylvania put forth [[Andrew Jackson]]. From Kentucky came [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]], while Massachusetts produced Secretary of State Adams; a rump congressional caucus put forward [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[William H. Crawford]]. Personality and sectional allegiance played important roles in determining the outcome of the election. Adams won the electoral votes from New England and most of New York; Clay won his western base of Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri; Jackson won his base in the Southeast, and plus Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey; and Crawford won his base in the South, Virginia, Georgia, and Delaware. No candidate gained a majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], so the president was selected by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where Clay was the most influential figure. In return for Clay's support in winning the presidency, [[John Quincy Adams]] appointed Clay as secretary of state in what Jacksonians denounced as The [[Corrupt Bargain]].\n\nDuring [[Presidency of John Quincy Adams|Adams' administration]], new party alignments appeared. Adams' followers took the name of \"[[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republicans]]\", to reflect the mainstream of Jeffersonian Republicanism. Elected with less than 35% of the popular vote, Adams was a minority president and his cold, aloof personality did not win many friends. Adams was also a poor politician and alienated potential political allies with his commitment to principles when he refused to remove Federal officeholders and replace them with supporters out of patronage. A strong nationalist, he called for the construction of national road networks and canals and renewed George Washington's call for a national academy. Adams even went so far as to suggest the construction of astronomical observatories to rival those of Europe. These extravagant proposals offended many average Americans. The South was particularly against them since they would require continued heavy tariffs to fund and there were fears that government overreach of this type could easily lead to action taken against slavery.<ref>http://www.stsci.edu/~RAB/MemoRefs/USPresidents&AstronomicalDiscovery.pdf</ref>\n\nDespite his sterling record as Secretary of State, Adams also proved less than successful at foreign policy as his old rival, British Foreign Secretary [[George Canning]], played a cat-and-mouse game with him. Ever since the Treaty of Paris 42 years earlier, Britain had barred American merchantmen from visiting its islands in the West Indies, although smugglers frequently evaded this ban. When Adams demanded that London open the islands to trade with the US, Canning rejected his request. Another fiasco for the president occurred when the newly independent Latin American republics held a congress in [[Panama]]. Adams requested permission and funding from Congress to send two delegates. Some Congressmen worried about the US becoming involved in foreign entanglements, while Southerners, sensitive to racial issues, disliked the idea of granting recognition and equal status to the \"black\" and \"mixed\" Latin American states. Although Adams was ultimately successful in getting approval, one of the two delegates died en route to Panama and the Panama Congress ultimately accomplished little of value.\n\n===Jacksonian democracy===\n{{Main|Andrew Jackson|Jacksonian democracy}}\nCharismatic Andrew Jackson, by contrast, in collaboration with strategist [[Martin Van Buren]] rallied his followers in the newly emerging [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1828|election of 1828]], Jackson defeated Adams by an overwhelming electoral majority in the first presidential election since 1800 to mark a wholesale voter rejection of the previous administration's policies. The electoral campaign was correspondingly as vicious as the one 28 years earlier, with Jackson and Adams's camps hurtling the worst mudslinging accusations at one another. The former painted himself as a war hero and the champion of the masses against Northeastern elites while the latter argued that he was a man of education and social grace against an uncouth, semi-literate backwoodsman. This belied the fact that Andrew Jackson was a societal elite by any definition, owning a large plantation with dozens of slaves and mostly surrounding himself with men of wealth and property. The election saw the coming to power of [[Jacksonian Democracy]], thus marking the transition from the [[First Party System]] (which reflected [[Jeffersonian Democracy]]) to the [[Second Party System]]. Historians debate the significance of the election, with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics, with the decisive establishment of democracy and the formation of the two party system.<ref>David Waldstreicher, \"The Birth of Modern Politics: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828./Vindicating Andrew Jackson: The 1828 Election and the Rise of the Two Party System,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'', Winter 2010, Vol. 30 Issue 4, pp 674-678</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson took office on March 4, 1829, many doubted if he would survive his term in office. A week short of his 63rd birthday, he was the oldest man yet elected president and suffering from the effects of old battle wounds. He also had a frequent hacking cough and sometimes spit up blood. The inauguration ball became a notorious event in the history of the American presidency as a large mob of guests swarmed through the White House, tracking dirt and mud everywhere, and consuming a giant cheese that had been presented as an inaugural gift to the president. A contemporary journalist described the spectacle as \"the reign of King Mob\".\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President Andrew Jackson]]\n\n===Suffrage of all white men===\nStarting in the 1820s, American politics became more democratic as many state and local offices went from being appointed to elective, and the old requirements for voters to own property{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} were abolished. Voice voting in states gave way to ballots printed by the parties, and by the 1830s in every state except South Carolina presidential electors were chosen directly by the voters. [[Jacksonian Democracy]] drew its support from the small farmers of the West, and the workers, artisans and small merchants of the East. They favored geographical expansion to create more farms for people like them, and distrusted the upper classes who envisioned an [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] nation built on finance and manufacturing. The entrepreneurs, for whom [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]] were heroes, fought back and formed the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]].<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2006) ch 8-16</ref>\n\nPolitical machines appeared early in the history of the United States, and for all the exhortations of Jacksonian Democracy, it was they and not the average voter that nominated candidates. In addition, the system supported establishment politicians and party loyalists, and much legislation was designed to reward men and businesses who supported a particular party or candidate. As a consequence, the chance of single issue and ideology-based candidates being elected to major office dwindled and so those parties who were successful were pragmatist ones which appealed to multiple constituencies.\n\nExamples of single issue parties included the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], which  emerged in the Northeastern states. Its goal was to outlaw [[Freemasonry]] as a violation of republicanism; members were energized by reports that a man who threatened to expose Masonic secrets had been murdered. They ran a candidate for president ([[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]]) in 1832; he won 8% of the popular vote nationwide, carried Vermont, and ran well in rural Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.<ref>W. Stephen Belko, ''The invincible Duff Green: Whig of the West'' (2006) pp 240-1</ref> The party then merged into the new Whig Party. Others included abolitionist parties, workers' parties like the [[Workingmen's Party]], the [[Locofocos]] (who opposed monopolies), and assorted nativist parties who denounced the Roman Catholic Church as a threat to [[Republicanism in the United States]]. None of these parties were capable of mounting a broad enough appeal to voters or winning major elections.<ref>Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., ed. ''History of U.S. Political Parties: 1789\u20131860: From fractions to parties'' (1973)</ref>\n\nThe election of 1828 was a significant benchmark, marking the climax of the trend toward broader voter eligibility and participation. [[Vermont]] had universal male suffrage since its entry into the Union, and Tennessee permitted suffrage for the vast majority of taxpayers. New Jersey, Maryland, and South Carolina all abolished property and tax-paying requirements between 1807 and 1810. States entering the Union after 1815 either had universal white male suffrage or a low taxpaying requirement. From 1815 to 1821, [[Connecticut]], Massachusetts and New York abolished all property requirements. In 1824, members of the Electoral College were still selected by six state legislatures. By 1828, presidential electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but Delaware and South Carolina. Nothing dramatized this democratic sentiment more than the election of Andrew Jackson.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'' (2000) pp 22-42</ref> In addition, the 1828 election marked the decisive emergence of the West as a major political bloc and an end to the dominance of the original 13 states on national affairs.\n\n===Indian Removal===\n{{Main|Trail of Tears}}\n\nIn 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which authorized the President to negotiate treaties that exchanged Indian tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River. In 1834, a special [[Indian territory]] was established in what is now the eastern part of [[History of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]]. In all, Native American tribes signed 94 treaties during Jackson's two terms, ceding thousands of square miles to the Federal government.\n\nThe [[Cherokee]]s insisted on their independence from state government authority and faced expulsion from their lands when a faction of Cherokees signed the [[Treaty of New Echota]] in 1835, obtaining money in exchange for their land. Despite protests from the elected Cherokee government and many white supporters, the Cherokees were forced to trek to the Indian Territory in 1838. Many died of disease and privation in what became known as the \"Trail of Tears\".\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n[[File:Cottonfieldpanorama-edited.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Picking cotton in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ([[Media:Cottonfieldpanorama-edited.jpg|Larger version]])]]\n\n===Nullification Crisis===\n{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}\nToward the end of his first term in office, Jackson was forced to confront the state of South Carolina on the issue of the protective [[tariff]]. The protective tariff passed by Congress and signed into law by Jackson in 1832 was milder than that of 1828, but it further embittered many in the state. In response, several South Carolina citizens endorsed the \"[[states rights]]\" principle of \"nullification\", which was enunciated by [[John C. Calhoun]], Jackson's Vice President until 1832, in his [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] (1828). South Carolina dealt with the tariff by adopting the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared both the [[Tariff of 1828]] and the [[Tariff of 1832]] null and void within state borders.\n\nNullification was only the most recent in a series of state challenges to the authority of the federal government. In response to South Carolina's threat, Jackson sent seven small naval vessels and a man-of-war to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] in November 1832. On December 10, he issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers. South Carolina, the President declared, stood on \"the brink of insurrection and treason\", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought.\n\nSenator Henry Clay, though an advocate of protection and a political rival of Jackson, piloted a compromise measure through Congress. Clay's [[Compromise of 1833|1833 compromise tariff]] specified that all duties more than 20% of the value of the goods imported were to be reduced by easy stages, so that by 1842, the duties on all articles would reach the level of the moderate tariff of 1816.\n\nThe rest of the South declared South Carolina's course unwise and unconstitutional. Eventually, South Carolina rescinded its action. Jackson had committed the federal government to the principle of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] supremacy. South Carolina, however, had obtained many of the demands it sought and had demonstrated that a single state could force its will on Congress.\n\n===Banking===\n{{Main|History of central banking in the United States}}\nEven before the nullification issue had been settled, another controversy arose to challenge Jackson's leadership. It concerned the rechartering of the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. The [[First Bank of the United States]] had been established in 1791, under Alexander Hamilton's guidance and had been chartered for a 20-year period. After the Revolutionary War, the United States had a large [[war debt]] to France and others, and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray, as state banks printed their own currency, and the plethora of different [[bank note]]s made commerce difficult. Hamilton's national bank had been chartered to solve the debt problem and to unify the nation under one currency. While it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade, it was resented by Westerners and workers who believed that it was granting special favors to a few powerful men. When its charter expired in 1811, it was not renewed.<ref>Edward S. Kaplan, ''The Bank of the United States and the American Economy'' (1999)</ref>\n\nFor the next few years, the banking business was in the hands of State-Chartered banks, which issued currency in excessive amounts, creating great confusion and fueling inflation and concerns that state banks could not provide the country with a uniform currency. The absence of a national bank during the War of 1812 greatly hindered financial operations of the government; therefore a second Bank of the United States was created in 1816.\n\n[[File:General Jackson Slaying the Many Headed Monster crop.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Jackson slays the many-headed monster that is the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]]]]\n\nFrom its inception, the Second Bank was unpopular in the newer states and territories and with less prosperous people everywhere. Opponents claimed the bank possessed a virtual monopoly over the country's credit and currency, and reiterated that it represented the interests of the wealthy elite. Jackson, elected as a popular champion against it, vetoed a bill to recharter the bank. He also personally detested banks due to a brush with bankruptcy in his youth. In his message to Congress, he denounced monopoly and special privilege, saying that \"our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits, but have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War'' (1967)p. 406</ref>\n\nIn the election campaign that followed, the bank question caused a fundamental division between the merchant, manufacturing and financial interests (generally creditors who favored tight money and high interest rates), and the laboring and agrarian sectors, who were often in debt to banks and therefore favored an increased [[money supply]] and lower interest rates. The outcome was an enthusiastic endorsement of \"Jacksonism\". Jackson saw his [[U.S. presidential election, 1832|reelection in 1832]] as a popular mandate to crush the bank irrevocably; he found a ready-made weapon in a provision of the bank's charter authorizing removal of public funds.\n\nIn September 1833 Jackson ordered that no more government money be deposited in the bank and that the money already in its custody be gradually withdrawn in the ordinary course of meeting the expenses of government. Carefully selected state banks, stringently restricted, were provided as a substitute. For the next generation, the US would get by on a relatively unregulated state banking system. This banking system helped fuel westward expansion through easy credit, but kept the nation vulnerable to periodic panics. It was not until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] that the Federal government again chartered a national bank.\n\nJackson groomed [[Martin van Buren]] as his successor, and he was easily elected president in 1836. However, a few months into his administration, the country fell into a deep economic slump known as the [[Panic of 1837]], caused in large part by excessive speculation. Banks failed and unemployment soared.  It was a devastating economic and social Catastrophe that can be compared with the panic of 1893 and the Great Depression of 1929. event with repercussions every bit as deep as the Great Depression of the 1930s. There was an international dimension, for much of the growth In the private sector, as well as infrastructure investment by state governments (especially canals) had been financed by British capital. Several states and corporations defaulted permanently on their debts owed to London. Investment in America became a dubious proposition for Europeans, so American access to capital sharply declined for decades.<ref>Alasdair Roberts, ''America\u2019s First Great Depression: Economic Crisis and Political Disorder after the Panic of 1837'' (Cornell University press, 2012).</ref>\n\nThe depression had its roots in Jackson's economic hard money policies that blocked investment using paper money, insisting on gold and silver. But he had retired so his chosen successor van Buren was blamed for the disaster. In the 1840 presidential election, he was defeated by the Whig candidate William Henry Harrison. However, his presidency would prove a non-starter when he fell ill with pneumonia and died after only a month in office. [[John Tyler]], the new vice president, succeeded him. Tyler was not popular since he had not been elected to the presidency, and was widely referred to as \"His Accidency\".  He rejected Wake economic policies, so that party expelled him, and The Whigs lost their opportunity to reshape government policy.<ref>Norma Lois Peterson, ''The Presidencies of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler'' (U of Kansas Press, 1989).</ref>\n\nEconomic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the Jacksonian era. For the most part, they follow the conclusions of [[Peter Temin]]. who absolved Jackson's policies, and blamed international events beyond American control, such as conditions in Mexico, China and Britain.  A survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with Temin's conclusion that \"the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond President Jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did vis-a-vis the Second Bank of the U.S.\"<ref>Robert Whaples, \"Were Andrew Jackson's Policies 'Good for the Economy'?\" ''Independent Review'' (2014) 18#4 [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-362727309/were-andrew-jackson-s-policies-good-for-the-economy online]</ref>\n\n==Age of Reform==\nSpurred on by the [[Second Great Awakening]], Americans entered a period of rapid social change and experimentation. New social movements arose, as well as many new alternatives to traditional religious thought. This period of American history was marked by the destruction of some traditional roles of society and the erection of new social standards. One of the unique aspects of the Age of Reform was that it was heavily grounded in religion, in contrast to the anti-clericalism that characterized contemporary European reformers.<ref>Paul S. Boyer, Clifford Clark, and Sandra Hawley, ''The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People: to 1877'' (2009) p 226</ref>\n\n===Second Great Awakening===\nThe [[Second Great Awakening]] was a Protestant religious revival movement that flourished in 1800\u20131840 in every region. It expressed [[Arminianism|Arminian theology]] by which every person could be saved through a direct personal confrontation with Jesus Christ during an intensely emotional revival meeting. Millions joined the churches, often new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new [[Millennialism|millennial age]], so that the Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.<ref>Timothy L. Smith, ''Revivalism and Social Reform: American Protestantism on the Eve of the Civil War'' (1957)</ref> For example, the charismatic [[Charles Grandison Finney]], in [[upstate New York]] and the [[Old Northwest]] was highly effective. At the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] Revival of 1830, prominent citizens concerned with the city's poverty and absenteeism had invited Finney to the city. The wave of religious revival contributed to tremendous growth of the Methodist, Baptists, Disciples, and other evangelical denominations.<ref>Sydney Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (1972) ch 27-30</ref><ref>Dickson D. Bruce, Jr., ''And They All Sang Hallelujah: Plain Folk Camp-Meeting Religion, 1800\u20131845'' (1974)</ref>\n\n====Utopians====\nAs the [[Second Great Awakening]] challenged the traditional beliefs of the [[Calvinist]] faith, the movement inspired other groups to call into question their views on religion and society. Many of these [[Utopianism|utopianist]] groups also believed in [[millennialism]] which prophesied the return of Christ and the beginning of a new age. The [[Harmony Society]] made three attempts to effect a millennial society with the most notable example at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. Later, Scottish industrialist [[Robert Owen]] bought New Harmony and attempted to form a secular Utopian community there. Frenchman [[Charles Fourier]] began a similar secular experiment with his \"phalanxes\" that were spread across the Midwestern United States. However, none of these utopian communities lasted very long except for the Shakers.\n\nOne of the earliest movements was that of the [[Shakers]] in which members of a community held all of their possessions in \"[[Commune (intentional community)|common]]\" and lived in a prosperous, inventive, self-supporting society, with no sexual activity.<ref>Stephen J. Stein, ''The Shaker Experience in America: A History of the United Society of Believers'' (1994)</ref> The Shakers, founded by an English immigrant to the United States Mother [[Ann Lee]], peaked at around 6,000 in 1850 in communities from Maine to Kentucky. The Shakers condemned [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and demanded absolute [[celibacy]]. New members could only come from conversions, and from children brought to the Shaker villages. The Shakers persisted into the 20th century, but lost most of their originality by the middle of the 19th century. They are famed for their artistic craftsmanship, especially their furniture and handicrafts.\n\nThe Perfectionist movement, led by [[John Humphrey Noyes]], founded the utopian [[Oneida Community]] in 1848 with fifty-one devotees, in [[Oneida, New York]]. Noyes believed that the act of final conversion led to absolute and complete release from sin. The Onedia Community believed in the abolition of marriage or monogamous relationships and that sex should be free to whoever consented to it. As opposed to 20th century social movements such as the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s, the Onedians did not seek consequence-free sex for mere pleasure, but believed that, because the logical outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, that raising children should be a communal responsibility. After the original founders died or became elderly, their children rejected the concept of free love and returned to traditional family models. Transforming into a [[joint-stock]] company, Oneida thrived for many years and continues today as a [[Silver (household)|silverware]] company.<ref>{{cite web\n |first=Randall\n |last=Hillebrand\n |url= http://www.nyhistory.com/central/oneida.htm\n |title=The Shakers / Oneida Community (Part Two): The Oneida Community\n |work=New York History Net: For Historians and Students of New York History and Culture\n |date=February 20, 2008\n |location=[[Albany, NY]]\n |publisher=Institute for New York State Studies\n |accessdate=December 14, 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Smith]] also experienced a religious conversion in this era; under his guidance [[Mormon]] history began. Because of their unusual beliefs, which included recognition of the [[Book of Mormon]] as an additional book of scripture comparable to the Bible, Mormons were rejected by mainstream Christians and forced to flee en masse from upstate New York to Ohio, to Missouri and then to  [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where Smith was killed and they were again forced to flee. They Settled around the [[Great Salt Lake]], then part of Mexico. In 1848, the region came under American control and later formed the [[Utah]] Territory. National policy was to suppress polygamy, and Utah was only admitted as a state in 1896 after [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] backtracked from Smith's demand that all the leaders practice polygamy.<ref>Richard L. Bushman, ''Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling'' (2007)</ref>\n\nFor Americans wishing to bridge the gap between the earthly and spiritual worlds, [[spiritualism]] provided a means of communing with the dead. Spiritualists used [[mediums]] to communicate between the living and the dead through a variety of different means. The most famous mediums, the [[Fox sisters]] claimed a direct link to the spirit world. Spiritualism would gain a much larger following after the heavy number of casualties during the Civil War; First Lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] was a believer.<ref>Barbara Weisberg, ''Talking to the Dead: Kate and Maggie Fox and the Rise of Spiritualism'' (2005)</ref>\n\nOther groups seeking spiritual awaking gained popularity in the mid-19th century. Philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] began the [[Transcendentalism|American transcendentalist]] movement in New England, to promote self-reliance and better understanding of the universe through contemplation of the [[over-soul]]. Transcendentalism was in essence an American offshoot of the Romantic movement in Europe. Among transcendentalists' core beliefs was an ideal spiritual state that \"transcends\" the physical, and is only realized through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] rather than doctrine. Like many of the movements, the transcendentalists split over the idea of self-reliance. While Emerson and [[Henry David Thoreau]] promoted the idea of independent living, [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] brought transcendentalists together in a phalanx at [[Brook Farm]] to live cooperatively. Other authors such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] rejected transcendentalist beliefs.<ref>Philip F. Gura, ''American Transcendentalism: A History'' (2008)</ref>\n\nSo many of these new religious and spiritual groups began or concentrated within miles of each other in upstate New York that this area was nicknamed \"the [[burned-over district]]\" because there were so few people left who had not experienced a conversion.<ref>Whitney R. Cross, ''The Burned-over District: The Social and Intellectual History of Enthusiastic Religion in Western New York, 1800\u20131850'' (1950)</ref><ref>Judith Wellman, ''Grassroots Reform in the Burned-over District of Upstate New York: Religion, Abolitionism, and Democracy'' (2000) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0815337922/  excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===Public schools movement===\nEducation in the United States had long been a local affair with schools governed by locally elected school boards. As with much of the culture of the United States, education varied widely in the North and the South. In the New England states [[public education]] was common, although it was often class-based with the working class receiving little benefits. Instruction and curriculum were all locally determined and teachers were expected to meet rigorous demands of strict moral behaviour. Schools taught religious values and applied [[Calvinist]] philosophies of discipline which included [[corporal punishment]] and public humiliation. In the South, there was very little organization of a public education system. Public schools were very rare and most education took place in the home with the family acting as instructors. The wealthier planter families were able to bring in tutors for instruction in the [[classics]] but many yeoman farming families had little access to education outside of the family unit.\n\nThe reform movement in education began in [[Massachusetts]] when [[Horace Mann]] started the common school movement. Mann advocated a statewide curriculum and instituted financing of school through local property taxes. Mann also fought protracted battles against the Calvinist influence in discipline, preferring positive reinforcement to physical punishment. Most children learned to read and write and spell from [[Noah Webster]]'s ''Blue Backed Speller'' and later the [[McGuffey Readers]]. The readings inculcated moral values as well as literacy. Most states tried to emulate Massachusetts, and New England retained its leadership position for another century. German immigrants brought in [[kindergartens]] and the [[Gymnasium (school)]], while Yankee orators sponsored the [[Lyceum]] movement that provided popular education for hundreds of towns and small cities.\n\n===Asylum movement===\nThe social conscience that was raised in the early 19th century helped to elevate the awareness of mental illness and its treatment. A leading advocate of reform for mental illness was [[Dorothea Dix]], a Massachusetts woman who made an intensive study of the conditions that the mentally ill were kept in. Dix's report to the Massachusetts state legislature along with the development of the [[Kirkbride Plan]] helped to alleviate the miserable conditions for many of the mentally ill. Although these facilities often fell short of their intended purpose, reformers continued to follow Dix's advocacy and call for increased study and treatment of mental illness.\n\n===Women===\nZagarri (2007) argues the Revolution created an ongoing debate on the rights of women and created an environment favorable to women's participation in politics. She asserts that for a brief decades, a \"comprehensive transformation in women's rights, roles, and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable\" (p.&nbsp;8) However the opening of possibilities also engendered a backlash that actually set back the cause of women's rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political life.<ref>[[Rosemarie Zagarri]], ''Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2007). 233 pp</ref>\n\nDuring the building of the new republic, American women were able to gain a limited political voice in what is known as [[republican motherhood]]. Under this philosophy, as promoted by leaders such as [[Abigail Adams]], women were seen as the protectors of liberty and republicanism. Mothers were charged with passing down these ideals to their children through instruction of patriotic thoughts and feelings. During the 1830s and 1840s, many of the changes in the status of women that occurred in the post-Revolutionary period\u2014such as the belief in love between spouses and the role of women in the home\u2014continued at an accelerated pace. This was an age of reform movements, in which Americans sought to improve the moral fiber of themselves and of their nation in unprecedented numbers. The wife's role in this process was important because she was seen as the cultivator of morality in her husband and children. Besides domesticity, women were also expected to be pious, pure, and submissive to men. These four components were considered by many at the time to be \"the natural state\" of womanhood, echoes of this ideology still existing today. The view that the wife should find fulfillment in these values is called the ''Cult of True Womanhood'' or the ''[[Cult of Domesticity]]''.<ref>Barbara Welter, \"The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820\u20131860\", ''American Quarterly'' Vol. 18, No. 2, Part 1 (Summer, 1966), pp. 151\u2013174 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711179 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nIn the South, tradition still abounded with society women on the pedestal and dedicated to entertaining and hosting others. This phenomenon is reflected in the 1965 book, ''The Inevitable Guest'', based on a collection of letters by friends and relatives in [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]] to Miss Jemima Darby, a distant relative of the author.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&q=John%20A.%20Cawthon |title=Books: The Inevitable Guest |journal=The Alcalde: The University of Texas Alumni Magazine |date=September 1965 |volume=54 |issue=1 |page=33 |accessdate=July 14, 2010|last1=Communications |first1=Emmis }}</ref>\n\nUnder the doctrine of two spheres, women were to exist in the \"domestic sphere\" at home while their husbands operated in the \"public sphere\" of politics and business. Women took on the new role of \"softening\" their husbands and instructing their children in piety and not republican values, while men handled the business and financial affairs of the family. Some doctors of this period even went so far as to suggest that women should not get an education, lest they divert blood away from the uterus to the brain and produce weak children. The [[coverture]] laws ensured that men would hold political power over their wives.\n\n===Anti-slavery movements===\nBy 1800, many political leaders were convinced that slavery was undesirable, and should eventually be abolished, and the slaves returned to their natural homes in Africa. The [[American Colonization Society]], which was active in both North and South, tried to implement these ideas and established the colony of [[Liberia]] in Africa as a means to repatriate slaves out of white society. Prominent leaders included [[Henry Clay]] and President [[James Monroe]]\u2014who gave his name to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. However, after 1840 many abolitionists rejected the idea of repatriation to Africa.<ref>Eric Burin, ''Slavery and the Peculiar Solution: A History of the American Colonization Society'' (University Press of Florida, 2005)</ref>\n\nThe [[Abolitionism in the United States|slavery abolitionist]] movement among white Protestants was based on evangelical principles of the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Evangelist [[Theodore Weld]] led abolitionist revivals that called for immediate emancipation of slaves. [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded ''The Liberator'', an anti-slavery newspaper, and the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] to call for abolition. A controversial figure, Garrison often was the focus of public anger. His advocacy of women's rights and inclusion of women in the leadership of the Society caused a rift within the movement. Rejecting Garrison's idea that abolition and women's rights were connected [[Lewis Tappan]] broke with the Society and formed the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]]. Most abolitionists were not as extreme as Garrison, who vowed that \"The Liberator\" would not cease publication until slavery was abolished.<ref>Stanley Harrold, ''The American Abolitionists'' (Longman, 2000)</ref>\n\n[[File:Frederick Douglas NYHS c1866.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Frederick Douglass]]]]\n\nWhite abolitionists did not always face agreeable communities in the North. Garrison was almost lynched in Boston while newspaper publisher [[Elijah Lovejoy]] was killed in [[Alton, Illinois]]. The anger over abolition even spilled over into Congress where a [[gag rule]] was instituted to prevent any discussion of slavery on the floor of either chamber. Most whites viewed African-Americans as an inferior race and had little taste for abolitionists, often assuming that all were like Garrison. African-Americans had little freedom even in states where slavery was not permitted, being shunned by whites, subjected to discriminatory laws, and often forced to compete with Irish immigrants for menial, low-wage jobs. In the South meanwhile, planters argued that slavery was necessary to operate their plantations profitably and that emancipated slaves would attempt to Africanize the country as they had done in Haiti.\n\nBoth free-born [[African American]] citizens and former slaves took on leading roles in abolitionism as well. By far the most prominent spokesperson for abolition in the African American community was [[Frederick Douglass]], an escaped slave whose eloquent condemnations of slavery drew both crowds of supporters as well as threats against his life. Douglass was a keen user of the printed word both through his newspaper [[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]] and three best-selling autobiographies.\n\nAt one extreme [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]] published ''An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World'' calling for African American revolt against white tyranny. The [[Underground Railroad]] helped some slaves out of the South through a series of trails and safe houses known as \"stations.\"  Known as \"conductors\", escaped slaves volunteered to return to the South to lead others to safety; former slaves, such as [[Harriet Tubman]], risked their lives on these journeys.<ref>Fergus M Bordewich, ''Bound for Canaan: The Underground Railroad and the War for the Soul of America'' (2005)</ref>\n\n===Women as abolitionists===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1    = Lucretiamott2 crop.jpg\n | width1    = 152\n | caption1  = Lucretia Mott\n | image2    = ElizabethCadyStanton.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | caption2  = Elizabeth Cady Stanton}}\n\n[[Grimk\u00e9 sisters|Angelia and Sarah Grimk\u00e9]] were southerners who moved North to advocate against slavery. The American Anti-Slavery Society welcomed women. Garrison along with [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucretia Mott]] were so appalled that women were not allowed to participate at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London that they called for a women's rights convention in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]]. It was at this convention that [[Sojourner Truth]] became recognized as a leading spokesperson for both abolition and women's rights. Women abolitionists increasingly began to compare women's situation with the plight of slaves. This new polemic squarely blamed men for all the restrictions of women's role, and argued that the relationship between the sexes was one-sided, controlling and oppressive. There were strong religious roots; most feminists emerged from the [[Quaker]] and [[Congregationalist]] churches in the Northeast.<ref>Lori D. Ginzberg. ''Elizabeth Cady Stanton: An American Life'' (2010)</ref>\n\n===Prohibition===\nAlcohol consumption was another target of reformers in the 1850s. Americans drank heavily, which contributed to violent behaviour, crime, health problems, and poor workplace performance. Groups such as the [[American Temperance Society]] condemned liquor as being a scourge on society and urged temperance among their followers. The state of Maine attempted in 1851 to ban alcohol sales and production entirely, but it met resistance and was abandoned. The prohibition movement was forgotten during the Civil War, but would return in the 1875s.\n\n[[File:Boston Manufacturing Company.jpg|thumb|250px|The Boston Manufacturing Company was organized in 1813 by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]], a wealthy Boston merchant, in partnership with a group of investors known as the Boston Associates, for the manufacture of cotton textiles.<ref>{{cite web\n |url= http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/wes/collections/labor/textiles/content/1001956083.html\n |title=Boston Manufacturing Company Collection\n |work=Women, Enterprise and Society: A Guide to Resources in the Business Manuscripts Collection at Baker Library\n |location=[[Boston, MA]]\n |publisher=[[Harvard Business School]], [[Harvard University|Harvard U.]]\n |year=2009\n |accessdate=December 14, 2009\n}}</ref>]]\n[[File:PercentOfUSPopInEachState.gif|thumb|right|250px|Historical movement of U.S. population. Note the major westward expansion in the 19th century.]]\n\n==Economic growth==\n{{Main|Technological and industrial history of the United States#Early industrialization}}\nIn this period, the United States rapidly expanded economically from an agrarian nation into an industrial power. [[Industrialization]] in America involved two important developments. First, transportation was expanded. Second, improvements were made to industrial processes such as the use of [[interchangeable parts]] and [[railroads]] to ship goods more quickly. The government helped protect American manufacturers by passing a protective tariff.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860''   (1951)</ref>\n\n===Social mobility===\nThe steady expansion and rapid population growth of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, but on the whole hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude of most Americans. While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons for tens of thousands of pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]] were two of the richest men in the world by 1900. Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized upward mobility, and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.<ref>Stephan Thernstrom, ''Poverty and Progress, Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964)</ref><ref>Steven A. Riess, \"The Impact of ''Poverty and Progress'' on the Generation of Historians Trained in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s,\" ''Social Science History'' Vol. 10, No. 1 (Spring, 1986), pp. 23-32 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1171115 in JSTOR] reviews numerous studies of mobility</ref>\n\n==Westward expansion==\n{{Main|Manifest Destiny|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:United States 1822-1824.png|thumb|States and territories of the United States in 1822-1824]]\nAfter 1815, the United States shifted its attention away from foreign policy to internal development. With the defeat of the eastern Indians in the War of 1812, American settlers moved in great numbers into the rich farmlands of the Midwest. Westward expansion was mostly undertaken by groups of young families. [[Daniel Boone]] was one frontiersman who pioneered the settlement of Kentucky. In the 1830s, the federal government forcibly deported the southeastern tribes to their own reservations in the Indian territory (now Oklahoma) via the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\". There they received annual subsidies of food and supplies.<ref>Theda Perdue and Michael Green, ''The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears'' (2007)</ref>\n\nBefore the settlers arrived in the far west the fur trappers and [[Mountain men]] had their day. As skilled hunters, they trapped beaver for eventual sale to the European fashion industry. After the demise of the [[fur trade]], they established trading posts throughout the west, continued trade with the Indians and served as guides and hunters for the western migration of settlers to Utah and the Pacific coast.<ref>LeRoy R. Hafen and Harvey L. Carter, ''Mountain Men and Fur Traders of the Far West: Eighteen Biographical Sketches'' (1982)</ref>\n\n===Texas, Oregon, California and Manifest Destiny===\nManifest Destiny was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across the continent. This concept was born out of \"A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Frederick Merk|title=Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA3|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=3|isbn=9780674548053}}</ref> The phrase \"Manifest Destiny\" meant many different things to many different people, and was rejected by many Americans. [[Daniel Walker Howe|Howe]] argues that, \"[[American imperialism]] did not represent an American consensus; it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity.\"<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'', (2007) pp 705-6</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher|Faragher's]] analysis of the political polarization between the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] is that:\n\n<blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the North) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the territories. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. ... For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) page 413</ref></blockquote>\n\nManifest destiny did however provide the rhetorical tone for the largest acquisition of U.S. territory. It was used by [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the 1840s to justify the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]]. It was also used to threaten war with Britain, but [[President Polk]] negotiated a compromise that divided the [[Oregon Country]] half and half. Merk concludes:\n\n<blockquote>From the outset Manifest Destiny\u2014vast in program, in its sense of continentalism\u2014was slight in support. It lacked national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its bigness. The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit. The thesis that it embodied nationalism, found in much historical writing, is backed by little real supporting evidence.<ref>{{cite book |author=Frederick Merk|title=Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA215|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=215|isbn=9780674548053}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War: 1846\u20131848===\n[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|Growth 1840\u201350|thumb|right|250px|Growth from 1840 to 1850]]\nAfter a bitter debate in Congress the [[Texas Annexation|Republic of Texas was voluntarily annexed]] in 1845, which Mexico had repeatedly warned meant war. In May 1846, Congress declared war on Mexico after Mexican troops massacred a U.S. Army detachment in a disputed unsettled area. However the homefront was polarized as Whigs opposed and Democrats supported the war. The U.S. Army, augmented by tens of thousands of volunteers, under the command of General [[Zachary Taylor]] defeated [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s in northern Mexico while other American forces quickly took possession of New Mexico and California. Mexico continued to resist despite a chaotic political situation, and so Polk launched an invasion of the country's heartland. A new American army led by [[Winfield Scott]] occupied the port of Veracruz, and pressed inland amid bloody fighting. Santa Anna offered to cede Texas and California north of Monterrey Bay, but negotiations broke down and the fighting resumed. In September 1847, Scott's army captured Mexico City. Santa Anna was forced to flee and a provisional government began the task of negotiating peace. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was signed on February 2, 1848. It recognized the [[Rio Grande]] as the southern boundary of [[Texas]] and ceded what is now the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico to the United States, while also paying Mexico $15,000,000 for the territory. In the presidential election of 1848, Zachary Taylor ran as a Whig and won easily when the Democrats split, even though he was an apolitical military man who never voted in his life. Scott became the last Whig candidate for president in 1852, and he lost badly.\n\nWith Texas and Florida having been admitted to the union as slave states in 1845, California was entered as a free state in 1850 after its state convention unanimously voted to ban slavery.\n\nMajor events in the western movement of the U.S. population were the [[Homestead Act]], a law by which, for a nominal price, a settler was given title to {{convert|160|acres|abbr=out}} of land to farm; the opening of the [[Oregon Territory]] to settlement; the [[Texas Revolution]]; the opening of the [[Oregon Trail]]; the [[Mormon Emigration]] to [[Utah]] in 1846\u201347; the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849; the [[Colorado Gold Rush]] of 1859; and the completion of the nation's [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] on May 10, 1869.\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"150px\" heights=\"250px\" caption=\"US Population Distribution\">\nFile:USA population distribution 1790.png|1790\nFile:USA population distribution 1800.png|1800\nFile:USA population distribution 1820.png|1820\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1790\u20131819)]]\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1820\u20131859)]]\n* [[History of the United States (1849\u20131865)]]\n* [[First Party System]]\n* [[American gentry]]\n* [[First Great Awakening]]\n* [[Second Party System]]\n* [[Slavery in the United States]]\n* [[Presidency of George Washington]]\n* [[Presidency of John Adams]]\n* [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson]]\n* [[Presidency of James Madison]]\n* [[Presidency of James Monroe]]\n* [[Presidency of John Quincy Adams]]\n* [[Presidency of Andrew Jackson]]\n* [[Presidency of Martin Van Buren]]\n* [[Presidency of John Tyler]]\n* [[Presidency of James K.

Based in New York, the new government acted quickly to rebuild the nation's financial structure. Enacting the program of Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], the government assumed the Revolutionary War debts of the states and the national government, and refinanced them with new federal bonds. It paid for the program through new tariffs and taxes; the [[Whiskey Rebellion|tax on whiskey]] led to a revolt in the west; Washington raised an army and suppressed it. The nation adopted a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as 10 amendments to the new [[Constitution of the United States|constitution]]. Fleshing out the Constitution's specification of the judiciary as capped by a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] established the entire [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]]. The Supreme Court became important under the leadership of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] (1801\u20131835), a federalist and nationalist who built a strong Supreme Court and strengthened the national government.\n\nThe 1790s were highly contentious, as the [[First Party System]] emerged in the contest between Hamilton and his [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] party, and [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his [[Democratic-Republican|Republican]] party. Washington and Hamilton were building a strong national government, with a broad financial base, and the support of merchants and financiers throughout the country. Jeffersonians opposed the new national Bank, the Navy, and federal taxes. The Federalists favored Britain, which was embattled in a series of wars with France. Jefferson's victory in 1800 opened the era of [[Jeffersonian democracy]], and doomed the upper-crust Federalists to increasingly marginal roles.\n\nThe [[Louisiana Purchase]] from [[Napoleon]] in 1803 opened vast [[Western United States|Western]] expanses of fertile land, which exactly met the needs of the rapidly expanding population of [[Plain Folk of the Old South|yeomen farmers]] whom Jefferson championed.\n\nThe Americans declared war on Britain (the [[War of 1812]]) to uphold American honor at sea,<ref>Norman K. Risjord, \"1812: Conservatives, War Hawks, and the Nation's Honor\". ''William And Mary Quarterly'' 1961 18(2): 196\u2013210.

Stagg, \"James Madison and the coercion of Great Britain: Canada, the West Indies, and the War of 1812.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1981) 38#1: 3-34.</ref>  Despite incompetent government management, and a series of defeats early on, Americans found new generals like [[Andrew Jackson]], [[William Henry Harrison]], and [[Winfield Scott]], who repulsed British invasions and broke the alliance between the British and the Indians that held up settlement of the Old Northwest. The Federalists, who had opposed the war to the point of trading with the enemy and threatening secession, were devastated by the triumphant ending of the war. The remaining Indians east of the Mississippi were kept on reservations or moved via the [[Trail of Tears]] to reservations in what later became Oklahoma.\n\nThe spread of democracy opened the ballot box to nearly all white men, allowing the [[Jacksonian democracy]] to dominate politics during the [[Second Party System]]. Whigs, representing wealthier planters, merchants, financiers, and professionals, wanted to modernize the society, using tariffs and federally funded [[internal improvements]]; they were blocked by the Jacksonians, who closed down the national Bank in the 1830s. The Jacksonians wanted expansion\u2014that is \"[[Manifest Destiny]]\"\u2014into new lands that would be occupied by farmers and planters. Thanks to the annexation of Texas, the defeat of Mexico in war, and a compromise with Britain, the western third of the nation rounded out the continental United States by 1848.\n\nHowe (2007) argues that the transformation America underwent was not so much political democratization but rather the explosive growth of technologies and networks of infrastructure and communication\u2014the telegraph, railroads, the post office, and an expanding print industry. They made possible the religious revivals of the [[Second Great Awakening]], the expansion of education and social reform. They modernized party politics and sped up business by enabling the fast, efficient movement of goods, money, and people across an expanding nation. They transformed a loose-knit collection of parochial agricultural communities into a powerful cosmopolitan nation.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815\u20131848'' (2007), which is dedicated to the memory of John Quincy Adams.</ref> Economic modernization proceeded rapidly, thanks to highly profitable cotton crops in the South, new textile and machine-making industries in the Northeast, and a fast developing transportation infrastructure.\n\nDuring 1791 and 1838, 13 new states were formed. \n\nBreaking loose from European models, the Americans developed their own high culture, notably in literature and in higher education. The Second Great Awakening brought revivals across the country, forming new denominations and greatly increasing church membership, especially among Methodists and Baptists. By the 1840s increasing numbers of immigrants were arriving from Europe, especially British, Irish, and Germans. Many settled in the cities, which were starting to emerge as a major factor in the economy and society. The Whigs had warned that annexation of Texas would lead to a crisis over slavery, and they were proven right by the turmoil of the 1850s that led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>[[Joel H.

All the leaders of the new nation were committed to [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], and the doubts of the [[Anti-Federalists]] of 1788 were allayed with the passage of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as the first ten amendments to the Constitution in 1791.<ref>Forrest McDonald, ''The Presidency of George Washington'' (American Presidency Series) (1988)</ref>\n\nThe first census, conducted by Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], enumerated a population of 3.9 million, with a density of 4.5 people per square mile of land area. There were only 12 cities of more than 5,000 population, as the great majority of the people were farmers.\n\nWhereas the Constitution only defined the judiciary as vested in one Supreme Court and in various inferior courts that Congress was to define, Congress passed the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], which established the entire [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]]. The act provided for the Supreme Court to have six justices, and for two additional levels: three [[United States circuit court|circuit courts]] and 13 [[United States district court|district courts]]. It also created the offices of [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]], Deputy Marshal, and [[United States Attorney|District Attorney]] in each [[United States federal judicial district|federal judicial district]]. The [[Compromise of 1790]] located the national capital in a district to be defined in the southern state of Maryland (now the District of Columbia), and enabled the federal assumption of state debts.<ref>Charles Warren, ''The Supreme Court in United States History, Vol. 1: 1789\u20131821'' (1926)</ref>\n\nWashington had hoped that his Secretary of the Treasury would be [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], celebrated Philadelphia merchant and so-called \"financier of the Revolution\", but he declined and instead the post went to the president's young former aide-de-camp [[Alexander Hamilton]] who with Washington's support and Jefferson's opposition, convinced Congress to pass a far-reaching financial program that was patterned after the system developed in England a century earlier. It funded the debts of the American Revolution, set up a national bank, and set up a system of tariffs and taxes. His policies had the effect of linking the economic interests of the states, and of wealthy Americans, to the success of the national government, as well as enhancing the international financial standing of the new nation.<ref>Max M. Edling, and Mark D. Kaplanoff, \"Alexander Hamilton's Fiscal Reform: Transforming the Structure of Taxation in the Early Republic,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'', October 2004, Vol. 61 Issue 4, pp 713-744</ref>\n\nMost Representatives of the South opposed Hamilton's plan because they had already repudiated their debts and thus gained little from it. But more importantly, there were early signs of the economic and cultural rift between the Northern and Southern states that was to burst into flames seven decades later, being that the South and its plantation-based economy resisted the idea of a centralized federal government and being subordinated to Northeastern business interests. Despite considerable opposition in Congress from Southerners, Hamilton's plan was moved into effect during the middle of 1790. The First Bank of the United States was thus created that year despite arguments from Thomas Jefferson and his supporters that it was unconstitutional while Hamilton declared that it was entirely within the powers granted to the federal government. Hamilton's other proposals, including protection tariffs for nascent American industry, were defeated.\n\nThe [[Whiskey Rebellion]] happened in 1794\u2014when settlers in the [[Monongahela Valley]] of western Pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey, which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money. It was the first serious test of the federal government. Washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court. By August 1794, the protests became dangerously close to outright rebellion, and on August 7, several thousand armed settlers gathered near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Washington then invoked the [[Militia Law of 1792]] to summon the militias of several states. A force of 13,000 men was organized, and Washington personally led it to [[Western Pennsylvania]]. The revolt immediately collapsed, and there was no violence.<ref>George E. Connor, \"The politics of insurrection: A comparative analysis of the Shays', Whiskey, and Fries' Rebellions,\" ''Social Science Journal'', 1992, Vol. 29 Issue 3, pp 259-81</ref>\n\nForeign policy unexpectedly took center stage starting in 1793, when revolutionary France became engulfed in war with the rest of Europe, an event that was to lead to 22 years of fighting. France claimed that its 1778 alliance with the US meant that the latter was bound to come to their aid. The Washington administration's policy of neutrality was widely supported, but the Jeffersonians strongly favored France and deeply distrusted the British, who they saw as enemies of Republicanism. In addition, they sought to annex Spanish territory in the South and West. Meanwhile, Hamilton and the business community favored Britain, which was by far America's largest trading partner. The Republicans gained support in the winter of 1793\u201394 as Britain seized American merchant ships and impressed their crews into the Royal Navy, but the tensions were resolved with the [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794, which opened up 10 years of prosperous trade in exchange for which Britain would remove troops from its fortifications along the Canada\u2013US border. The Jeffersonians viewed the Treaty as a surrender to British moneyed interests, and mobilized their supporters nationwide to defeat the treaty. The Federalists likewise rallied supporters in a vicious conflict, which continued until 1795 when Washington publicly intervened in the debate, using his prestige to secure ratification. By this point, the economic and political advantages of the Federalist position had become clear to all concerned, combined with growing disdain for France after the Reign of Terror and Jacobin anti-religious policies. Jefferson promptly resigned as Secretary of State. Historian George Herring notes the \"remarkable and fortuitous economic and diplomatic gains\" produced by the Jay Treaty.<ref>George C. Herring, ''From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776'' (2008) p. 80</ref><ref>Stanley M. Elkins, and Eric McKitrick, ''The Age of Federalism: The Early American Republic, 1788\u20131800'' (1994), ch. 9</ref>\n\nContinuing conflict between Hamilton and Jefferson, especially over foreign policy, led to the formation of the [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist]] and [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|Republican]] parties. Although Washington remained aloof and warned against political parties in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]], he generally supported Hamilton and Hamiltonian programs over those of Jefferson. The Democratic-Republican Party dominated the Upper South, Western frontier, and in parts of the middle states. Federalist support was concentrated in the major Northern cities and South Carolina. After his death in 1799 he became the great symbolic hero of the Federalists.<ref>James Sharp, ''American Politics in the Early Republic: The New Nation in Crisis'' (1995)</ref>\n\n===Emergence of political parties===\nThe '''[[First Party System]]''' between 1792 and 1824 featured two national parties competing for control of the presidency, Congress, and the states: the [[Federalist Party]] was created by [[Alexander Hamilton]] and was dominant to 1800. The rival [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican Party]] (Democratic-Republican Party) was created by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], and was dominant after 1800. Both parties originated in national politics but moved to organize supporters and voters in every state. These comprised \"probably the first modern party system in the world\" because they were based on voters, not factions of aristocrats at court or parliament.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ''The First Party System: Federalists and Republicans'' (1972) p. v</ref> The Federalists appealed to the business community, the Republicans to the planters and farmers. By 1796, politics in every state was nearly monopolized by the two parties.\n\nJefferson wrote on Feb. 12, 1798:\n\n<blockquote>Two political Sects have arisen within the U. S. the one believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support; the other that like the analogous branch in the English Government, it is already too strong for the republican parts of the Constitution; and therefore in equivocal cases they incline to the legislative powers: the former of these are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition: the latter are stiled republicans, whigs, jacobins, anarchists, disorganizers, etc. these terms are in familiar use with most persons.<ref>Francis N. Thorpe, ed \"A Letter from Jefferson on the Political Parties, 1798,\" ''American Historical Review v.3#3 (April 1898) pp 488\u201389</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Federalists promoted the financial system of Treasury Secretary Hamilton, which emphasized federal assumption of state debts, a tariff to pay off those debts, a national bank to facilitate financing, and encouragement of banking and manufacturing. The Republicans, based in the plantation South, opposed a strong executive power, were hostile to a standing army and navy, demanded a limited reading of the Constitutional powers of the federal government, and strongly opposed the Hamilton financial program. Perhaps even more important was foreign policy, where the Federalists favored Britain because of its political stability and its close ties to American trade, while the Republicans admired the French and the French Revolution. Jefferson was especially fearful that British aristocratic influences would undermine [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. Britain and France were at war 1793\u20131815, with one brief interruption. American policy was neutrality, with the federalists hostile to France, and the Republicans hostile to Britain. The [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794 marked the decisive mobilization of the two parties and their supporters in every state. President Washington, while officially nonpartisan, generally supported the Federalists and that party made Washington their iconic hero.\n\n===Adams Administration: 1797\u20131801===\n{{Main|Presidency of John Adams}}\n[[File:JohnAdams 2nd US President.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Adams]],<br/>Second U.S. President]]\n[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Hamilton]],<br/>First U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nWashington retired in 1797, firmly declining to serve for more than eight years as the nation's head. The Federalists supported Vice President [[John Adams]] for President. Adams defeated Jefferson in the [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 presidential election]], who as the runner-up became Vice President under the operation of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] of that time.\n\nEven before he entered the presidency, Adams had quarreled with [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014and thus was hindered by a divided Federalist party.<ref>Ralph A. Brown, ''Presidency of John Adams (American Presidency Series) (1975)</ref>\n\nThese domestic difficulties were compounded by international complications: France, angered by American approval in 1795 of the [[Jay Treaty]] with its great enemy Britain proclaimed that food and war material bound for British ports were subject to seizure by the French navy. By 1797, France had seized 300 American ships and had broken off diplomatic relations with the United States. When Adams sent three other commissioners to Paris to negotiate, agents of Foreign Minister Charles Maurice de [[Talleyrand]] (whom Adams labeled \"X, Y and Z\" in his report to Congress) informed the Americans that negotiations could only begin if the United States loaned France $12 million and bribed officials of the French government. American hostility to France rose to an excited pitch, fanned by French ambassador [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]]. Federalists used the \"[[XYZ Affair]]\" to create a new American army, strengthen the fledgling [[United States Navy]], impose the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] to stop pro-French activities (which had severe repercussions for American [[civil liberties]]), and enact new taxes to pay for it. The [[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]], which changed the residency requirement for citizenship from five to 14 years, was targeted at Irish and French immigrants suspected of supporting the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The Sedition Act proscribed writing, speaking or publishing anything of \"a false, scandalous and malicious\" nature against the President or Congress. The few convictions won under the Sedition Act only created martyrs to the cause of civil liberties and aroused support for the Republicans. Jefferson and his allies launched a counterattack, with two states stating in the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] that state legislatures could nullify acts of Congress. However, all the other states rejected this proposition, and [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]]\u2014or as it was called, the \"principle of 98\"\u2014became the preserve of a faction of the [[Jeffersonian Democracy|Republicans]] called the [[Quids]].<ref>Kevin Gutzman, \"The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions Reconsidered: 'An Appeal to the Real Laws of Our Country,'\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 66 (2000), pp 473-96.</ref>\n\nIn 1799, after a series of naval battles with the French (known as the [[Quasi-War]]), full-scale war seemed inevitable. In this crisis, Adams broke with his party and sent three new commissioners to France. [[Napoleon]], who had just come to power, received them cordially, and the danger of conflict subsided with the negotiation of the [[Convention of 1800]], which formally released the United States from its [[Treaty of Alliance (1777)|1778 wartime alliance]] with France. However, reflecting American weakness, France refused to pay $20 million in compensation for American ships seized by the French navy.<ref>Alexander De Conde, ''The quasi-war: the politics and diplomacy of the undeclared war with France 1797\u20131801'' (1966).</ref>\n\nIn his final hours in office, Adams appointed [[John Marshall]] as chief justice. Serving until his death in 1835, Marshall dramatically expanded the powers of the Supreme Court and provided a Federalist interpretation of the Constitution that made for a strong national government.<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1996)</ref>\n\n==Thomas Jefferson==\n{{Main|Presidency of Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian democracy}}\n[[File:ThomasJefferson.jpg|thumb|Thomas Jefferson,<br/>Third U.S. President]]\n\nJefferson is a central figure in early American history, highly praised for his political leadership, but also criticized for the role of slavery in his private life.  He championed equality, democracy and republicanism, attacking aristocratic and monarchistic tendencies.  He was a leader in American independence, advocated religious freedom and tolerance, and opposed the centralizing tendencies of the urban financial elite.  He formed the second national political party and led it to dominance in 1800, then worked for western expansion and exploration.  Critics decry  the contradiction  between his ownership of hundreds of  slaves and his famous declaration that \"all men are created equal\", and argue that he fathered children with his slave mistress.<ref>Annette Gordon-Reed, 'Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings: An American Controversy' (1997)</ref><ref>Francis D. Cogliano, ''Thomas Jefferson: Reputation and Legacy'' (2006)</ref>\n\nUnder Washington and Adams the Federalists had established a strong government, but sometimes it followed policies that alienated the citizenry. For example, in 1798, to pay for the rapidly expanding army and navy, the Federalists had enacted a new tax on houses, land and slaves, affecting every property owner in the country. In the [[Fries's Rebellion]] hundreds of farmers in Pennsylvania revolted\u2014Federalists saw a breakdown in civil society. Some tax resisters were arrested\u2014then pardoned by Adams. Republicans denounced this action as an example of Federalist tyranny.<ref>Whitman H. Ridgway, \"Fries in the Federalist Imagination: A Crisis of Republican Society,\" ''Pennsylvania History'', January 2000, Vol. 67 Issue 1, pp 141-160</ref>\n\nJefferson had steadily gathered behind him a great mass of small farmers, shopkeepers and other workers which asserted themselves as Democratic-Republicans in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]]. Jefferson enjoyed extraordinary favor because of his appeal to American idealism. In his inaugural address, the first such speech in the new capital of [[Washington, DC]], he promised \"a wise and frugal government\" to preserve order among the inhabitants but would \"leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry, and improvement\".<ref>LaGreca, Gen.

Believing America to be a haven for the oppressed, he reduced the residency requirement for naturalization back to five years again.\n\nBy the end of his second term, Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] had reduced the national debt to less than $560 million. This was accomplished by reducing the number of executive department employees and Army and Navy officers and enlisted men, and by otherwise curtailing government and military spending.\n\nJefferson's domestic policy was uneventful and hands-off, the administration mainly concerning itself with foreign affairs and particularly territorial expansion. Except for Gallatin's reforms, their main preoccupation was purging the government of Federalist judges. The president and his associates were widely distrustful of the judicial branch, especially because Adams had made several \"midnight\" appointments prior to leaving office in March 1801. In ''Marbury vs Madison'' (1803), the Supreme Court under [[John Marshall]] established the precedent of being able to review and overturn legislation passed by Congress. This ruling by leading Federalist upset Jefferson to the point where his administration began opening impeachment hearings against judges that were perceived as abusing their power. The attempted purge of the judicial branch reached its climax with the trial of Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]]. When Chase was acquitted by the Senate, Jefferson abandoned his campaign.<ref>Frank Thompson Jr, and Daniel H.

A few weeks afterward, war resumed between Britain and [[Napoleon]]'s France. The United States, dependent on European revenues from the export of agricultural goods, tried to export food and raw materials to both warring [[Great Power]]s and to profit from transporting goods between their home markets and Caribbean colonies. Both sides permitted this trade when it benefited them but opposed it when it did not. Following the 1805 destruction of the French navy at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], Britain sought to impose a stranglehold over French overseas trade ties. Thus, in retaliation against U.S. trade practices, Britain imposed a [[Orders in Council (1807)|loose blockade]] of the American coast. Believing that Britain could not rely on other sources of food than the United States, Congress and President Jefferson suspended all U.S. trade with foreign nations in the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], hoping to get the British to end their blockade of the American coast. The Embargo Act, however, devastated American agricultural exports and weakened American ports while Britain found other sources of food.<ref>Marshall Smelser, ''The Democratic Republic: 1801\u20131815'' (1968) ch 7-8</ref>\n===War of 1812===\n{{Main|war of 1812}}\n[[James Madison]] won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1808|U.S. presidential election of 1808]], largely on the strength of his abilities in foreign affairs at a time when Britain and France were both on the brink of war with the United States. He was quick to repeal the Embargo Act, refreshing American seaports. Unfortunately, despite his intellectual brilliance, Madison lacked Jefferson's leadership and tried to merely copy his predecessor's policies verbatim. He tried various trade restrictions to try to force Britain and France to respect freedom of the seas, but they were unsuccessful. The British had undisputed mastery over the sea after defeating the French and Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805, and they took advantage of this to seize American ships at will and force their sailors into serving the Royal Navy. Even worse, the size of the U.S. Navy was reduced due to ideological opposition to a large standing military and the Federal government became considerably weakened when the charter of the First National Bank expired and Congress declined to renew it. A clamor for military action thus erupted just as relations with Britain and France were at a low point and the U.S.'s ability to wage war had been reduced.\n\n[[File:Battle erie.jpg|thumb|right|340px|''Battle of Lake Erie''; American victory in 1813 meant control of the Northwest; painting by [[William H.

Westerners and Southerners were the most ardent supporters of the war, given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements, and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports. [[New England]] was making a fine profit and its Federalists opposed the war, almost to the point of secession. The Federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national role.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''Prologue to war: England and the United States, 1805\u20131812'' (1961) [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203215517/http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520009967 full text online]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tecumseh ante Harrison crop.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Tecumseh]] and Governor William Henry Harrison; Tecumseh's death in the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813 ended British hopes to create a neutral Indian state in the Midwest]]\n\nThe war was draw in the war after bitter fighting that lasted even after the [[Burning of Washington]] in August 1814 and [[Andrew Jackson]]'s smashing defeat of the British invasion army at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815. The ratification of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in February, 1815, ended the war, returned to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''. Britain's alliance with the Native Americans ended, and the Indians were the major losers of the war. News of the victory at New Orleans over the best British combat troops came at the same time as news of the peace, giving Americans a psychological triumph and opening the [[Era of Good Feelings]]. The war destroyed the anti-war Federalist Party, and opened roles as national candidates to generals [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] among others, as well as civilian leaders James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay.<ref>Walter R. Borneman, ''1812: The War That Forged a Nation'' (2005)</ref>\n\n==Era of Good Feelings and the rise of Nationalism==\n{{Main|Era of Good Feelings|James Monroe}}\n\nFollowing the [[War of 1812]], America began to assert a newfound sense of nationalism. America began to rally around national heroes such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and patriotic feelings emerged in such works as [[Francis Scott Key]]'s poem [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]. Under the direction of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]], the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] issued a series of opinions reinforcing the role of the national government.<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998)</ref> These decisions included [[McCulloch v Maryland]] and [[Gibbons v Ogden]]; both of which reaffirmed the supremacy of the national government over the states. The signing of the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] helped to settle the western border of the country through popular and peaceable means.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The awakening of American nationalism, 1815\u20131828'' (1965)</ref>\n\n===Sectionalism===\nEven as [[nationalism]] increased across the country, its effects were limited by a renewed sense of [[sectionalism]]. The [[New England]] states that had opposed the War of 1812 felt an increasing decline in political power with the demise of the [[Federalist Party]]. This loss was tempered with the arrival of a new industrial movement and increased demands for northern banking. The [[industrial revolution]] in the United States was advanced by the immigration of [[Samuel Slater]] from Great Britain and arrival of textile mills beginning in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In the south, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] by [[Eli Whitney]] radically increased the value of slave labor. The export of southern [[cotton]] was now the predominant export of the U.S. The western states continued to thrive under the \"frontier spirit.\" Individualism was prized as exemplified by [[Davey Crockett]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s folk hero Natty Bumpo from [[The Leatherstocking Tales]]. Following the death of [[Tecumseh]] in 1813, Native Americans lacked the unity to stop white settlement.\n\n===Era of Good Feelings===\nDomestically, the [[Presidency of James Monroe|presidency]] of [[James Monroe]] (1817\u20131825) was hailed at the time and since as the \"Era of Good Feelings\" because of the decline of partisan politics and heated rhetoric after the war. The Federalist Party collapsed, but without an opponent the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] decayed as sectional interests came to the fore.\n\nThe '''[[Monroe Doctrine]]''' was drafted by Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] in collaboration with the British, and proclaimed by Monroe in late 1823. He asserted the Americas should be free from additional European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries' affairs. It further stated the United States' intention to stay neutral in wars between European powers and their colonies but to consider any new colonies or interference with independent countries in the Americas as hostile acts towards the United States. No new colonies were ever formed.\n\n===Annexation of Florida and border treaties===\nAs the 19th century dawned, Florida had been undisputed Spanish territory for almost 250 years, aside from 20 years of British control between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution. Although a sparsely inhabited swampland, expansionist-minded Americans were eager to grab it and already, in 1808, American settlers had invaded the westernmost tip of Florida and expelled the local Spanish authorities, after which Congress hastily passed a bill annexing it under the claim that the Louisiana Purchase had guaranteed the territory to the United States. During the War of 1812, American troops occupied and seized the area around Mobile Bay. Spain, then engulfed in war with France, did not react to either of these actions. Also taking advantage of the mother country's distraction, Spain's Latin American colonies rose up in revolt and Madrid was forced to denude Florida of troops to suppress the rebellions. As the Spanish withdrew, Native American and pirate raids from Florida to the US increased. In 1818, Andrew Jackson led an army into Florida to quell the chaotic situation there. He arrested and hanged two British agents who had been encouraging Indian raids, leading to an outcry in London and calls for war. However, cooler heads prevailed and the situation did not escalate further. A year later, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] with Spain. The Spanish agreed to turn over the no-longer-defensible Florida to the US and also give up their extremely flimsy {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} claims to the distant Oregon Territory, in exchange for which American claims on Texas were renounced (some Americans had also been claiming parts of that territory under the Louisiana Purchase). The heretofore vague border between the US and Spanish North America was also settled upon. Although American designs on Texas did not disappear, they were put on the backburner for the more immediately important Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1818, the U.S. and Britain also agreed to settle the western border with Canada, which was established at the 49th parallel running straight from the Great Lakes to the Rocky Mountains. Included in this settlement was the headwaters of the Red River in what would eventually become Minnesota, and the Mesabi Range, which eventually proved to contain vast amounts of iron ore. The eastern border of Canada continued to be disputed and was not settled until 1845.\n\n==Emergence of Second Party System==\n{{Main|Second Party System|Presidency of Andrew Jackson}}\nMonroe was reelected without opposition in 1820, and the old caucus system for selecting Republican candidates collapsed in 1820. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1824|presidential election of 1824]], factions in Tennessee and Pennsylvania put forth [[Andrew Jackson]]. From Kentucky came [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]], while Massachusetts produced Secretary of State Adams; a rump congressional caucus put forward [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[William H. Crawford]]. Personality and sectional allegiance played important roles in determining the outcome of the election. Adams won the electoral votes from New England and most of New York; Clay won his western base of Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri; Jackson won his base in the Southeast, and plus Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey; and Crawford won his base in the South, Virginia, Georgia, and Delaware. No candidate gained a majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], so the president was selected by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where Clay was the most influential figure. In return for Clay's support in winning the presidency, [[John Quincy Adams]] appointed Clay as secretary of state in what Jacksonians denounced as The [[Corrupt Bargain]].\n\nDuring [[Presidency of John Quincy Adams|Adams' administration]], new party alignments appeared. Adams' followers took the name of \"[[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republicans]]\", to reflect the mainstream of Jeffersonian Republicanism. Elected with less than 35% of the popular vote, Adams was a minority president and his cold, aloof personality did not win many friends. Adams was also a poor politician and alienated potential political allies with his commitment to principles when he refused to remove Federal officeholders and replace them with supporters out of patronage. A strong nationalist, he called for the construction of national road networks and canals and renewed George Washington's call for a national academy. Adams even went so far as to suggest the construction of astronomical observatories to rival those of Europe. These extravagant proposals offended many average Americans. The South was particularly against them since they would require continued heavy tariffs to fund and there were fears that government overreach of this type could easily lead to action taken against slavery.<ref>http://www.stsci.edu/~RAB/MemoRefs/USPresidents&AstronomicalDiscovery.pdf</ref>\n\nDespite his sterling record as Secretary of State, Adams also proved less than successful at foreign policy as his old rival, British Foreign Secretary [[George Canning]], played a cat-and-mouse game with him. Ever since the Treaty of Paris 42 years earlier, Britain had barred American merchantmen from visiting its islands in the West Indies, although smugglers frequently evaded this ban. When Adams demanded that London open the islands to trade with the US, Canning rejected his request. Another fiasco for the president occurred when the newly independent Latin American republics held a congress in [[Panama]]. Adams requested permission and funding from Congress to send two delegates. Some Congressmen worried about the US becoming involved in foreign entanglements, while Southerners, sensitive to racial issues, disliked the idea of granting recognition and equal status to the \"black\" and \"mixed\" Latin American states. Although Adams was ultimately successful in getting approval, one of the two delegates died en route to Panama and the Panama Congress ultimately accomplished little of value.\n\n===Jacksonian democracy===\n{{Main|Andrew Jackson|Jacksonian democracy}}\nCharismatic Andrew Jackson, by contrast, in collaboration with strategist [[Martin Van Buren]] rallied his followers in the newly emerging [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1828|election of 1828]], Jackson defeated Adams by an overwhelming electoral majority in the first presidential election since 1800 to mark a wholesale voter rejection of the previous administration's policies. The electoral campaign was correspondingly as vicious as the one 28 years earlier, with Jackson and Adams's camps hurtling the worst mudslinging accusations at one another. The former painted himself as a war hero and the champion of the masses against Northeastern elites while the latter argued that he was a man of education and social grace against an uncouth, semi-literate backwoodsman. This belied the fact that Andrew Jackson was a societal elite by any definition, owning a large plantation with dozens of slaves and mostly surrounding himself with men of wealth and property. The election saw the coming to power of [[Jacksonian Democracy]], thus marking the transition from the [[First Party System]] (which reflected [[Jeffersonian Democracy]]) to the [[Second Party System]]. Historians debate the significance of the election, with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics, with the decisive establishment of democracy and the formation of the two party system.<ref>David Waldstreicher, \"The Birth of Modern Politics: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828./Vindicating Andrew Jackson: The 1828 Election and the Rise of the Two Party System,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'', Winter 2010, Vol. 30 Issue 4, pp 674-678</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson took office on March 4, 1829, many doubted if he would survive his term in office. A week short of his 63rd birthday, he was the oldest man yet elected president and suffering from the effects of old battle wounds. He also had a frequent hacking cough and sometimes spit up blood. The inauguration ball became a notorious event in the history of the American presidency as a large mob of guests swarmed through the White House, tracking dirt and mud everywhere, and consuming a giant cheese that had been presented as an inaugural gift to the president. A contemporary journalist described the spectacle as \"the reign of King Mob\".\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President Andrew Jackson]]\n\n===Suffrage of all white men===\nStarting in the 1820s, American politics became more democratic as many state and local offices went from being appointed to elective, and the old requirements for voters to own property{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} were abolished. Voice voting in states gave way to ballots printed by the parties, and by the 1830s in every state except South Carolina presidential electors were chosen directly by the voters. [[Jacksonian Democracy]] drew its support from the small farmers of the West, and the workers, artisans and small merchants of the East. They favored geographical expansion to create more farms for people like them, and distrusted the upper classes who envisioned an [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] nation built on finance and manufacturing. The entrepreneurs, for whom [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]] were heroes, fought back and formed the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]].<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2006) ch 8-16</ref>\n\nPolitical machines appeared early in the history of the United States, and for all the exhortations of Jacksonian Democracy, it was they and not the average voter that nominated candidates. In addition, the system supported establishment politicians and party loyalists, and much legislation was designed to reward men and businesses who supported a particular party or candidate. As a consequence, the chance of single issue and ideology-based candidates being elected to major office dwindled and so those parties who were successful were pragmatist ones which appealed to multiple constituencies.\n\nExamples of single issue parties included the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], which  emerged in the Northeastern states. Its goal was to outlaw [[Freemasonry]] as a violation of republicanism; members were energized by reports that a man who threatened to expose Masonic secrets had been murdered. They ran a candidate for president ([[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]]) in 1832; he won 8% of the popular vote nationwide, carried Vermont, and ran well in rural Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.<ref>W. Stephen Belko, ''The invincible Duff Green: Whig of the West'' (2006) pp 240-1</ref> The party then merged into the new Whig Party. Others included abolitionist parties, workers' parties like the [[Workingmen's Party]], the [[Locofocos]] (who opposed monopolies), and assorted nativist parties who denounced the Roman Catholic Church as a threat to [[Republicanism in the United States]]. None of these parties were capable of mounting a broad enough appeal to voters or winning major elections.<ref>Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., ed. ''History of U.S. Political Parties: 1789\u20131860: From fractions to parties'' (1973)</ref>\n\nThe election of 1828 was a significant benchmark, marking the climax of the trend toward broader voter eligibility and participation. [[Vermont]] had universal male suffrage since its entry into the Union, and Tennessee permitted suffrage for the vast majority of taxpayers. New Jersey, Maryland, and South Carolina all abolished property and tax-paying requirements between 1807 and 1810. States entering the Union after 1815 either had universal white male suffrage or a low taxpaying requirement. From 1815 to 1821, [[Connecticut]], Massachusetts and New York abolished all property requirements. In 1824, members of the Electoral College were still selected by six state legislatures. By 1828, presidential electors were chosen by popular vote in every state but Delaware and South Carolina. Nothing dramatized this democratic sentiment more than the election of Andrew Jackson.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'' (2000) pp 22-42</ref> In addition, the 1828 election marked the decisive emergence of the West as a major political bloc and an end to the dominance of the original 13 states on national affairs.\n\n===Indian Removal===\n{{Main|Trail of Tears}}\n\nIn 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], which authorized the President to negotiate treaties that exchanged Indian tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River. In 1834, a special [[Indian territory]] was established in what is now the eastern part of [[History of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]]. In all, Native American tribes signed 94 treaties during Jackson's two terms, ceding thousands of square miles to the Federal government.\n\nThe [[Cherokee]]s insisted on their independence from state government authority and faced expulsion from their lands when a faction of Cherokees signed the [[Treaty of New Echota]] in 1835, obtaining money in exchange for their land. Despite protests from the elected Cherokee government and many white supporters, the Cherokees were forced to trek to the Indian Territory in 1838. Many died of disease and privation in what became known as the \"Trail of Tears\".\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n[[File:Cottonfieldpanorama-edited.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Picking cotton in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ([[Media:Cottonfieldpanorama-edited.jpg|Larger version]])]]\n\n===Nullification Crisis===\n{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}\nToward the end of his first term in office, Jackson was forced to confront the state of South Carolina on the issue of the protective [[tariff]]. The protective tariff passed by Congress and signed into law by Jackson in 1832 was milder than that of 1828, but it further embittered many in the state. In response, several South Carolina citizens endorsed the \"[[states rights]]\" principle of \"nullification\", which was enunciated by [[John C. Calhoun]], Jackson's Vice President until 1832, in his [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]] (1828). South Carolina dealt with the tariff by adopting the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared both the [[Tariff of 1828]] and the [[Tariff of 1832]] null and void within state borders.\n\nNullification was only the most recent in a series of state challenges to the authority of the federal government. In response to South Carolina's threat, Jackson sent seven small naval vessels and a man-of-war to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] in November 1832. On December 10, he issued a resounding proclamation against the nullifiers. South Carolina, the President declared, stood on \"the brink of insurrection and treason\", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought.\n\nSenator Henry Clay, though an advocate of protection and a political rival of Jackson, piloted a compromise measure through Congress. Clay's [[Compromise of 1833|1833 compromise tariff]] specified that all duties more than 20% of the value of the goods imported were to be reduced by easy stages, so that by 1842, the duties on all articles would reach the level of the moderate tariff of 1816.\n\nThe rest of the South declared South Carolina's course unwise and unconstitutional. Eventually, South Carolina rescinded its action. Jackson had committed the federal government to the principle of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] supremacy. South Carolina, however, had obtained many of the demands it sought and had demonstrated that a single state could force its will on Congress.\n\n===Banking===\n{{Main|History of central banking in the United States}}\nEven before the nullification issue had been settled, another controversy arose to challenge Jackson's leadership. It concerned the rechartering of the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. The [[First Bank of the United States]] had been established in 1791, under Alexander Hamilton's guidance and had been chartered for a 20-year period. After the Revolutionary War, the United States had a large [[war debt]] to France and others, and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray, as state banks printed their own currency, and the plethora of different [[bank note]]s made commerce difficult. Hamilton's national bank had been chartered to solve the debt problem and to unify the nation under one currency. While it stabilized the currency and stimulated trade, it was resented by Westerners and workers who believed that it was granting special favors to a few powerful men. When its charter expired in 1811, it was not renewed.<ref>Edward S. Kaplan, ''The Bank of the United States and the American Economy'' (1999)</ref>\n\nFor the next few years, the banking business was in the hands of State-Chartered banks, which issued currency in excessive amounts, creating great confusion and fueling inflation and concerns that state banks could not provide the country with a uniform currency. The absence of a national bank during the War of 1812 greatly hindered financial operations of the government; therefore a second Bank of the United States was created in 1816.\n\n[[File:General Jackson Slaying the Many Headed Monster crop.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Jackson slays the many-headed monster that is the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]]]]\n\nFrom its inception, the Second Bank was unpopular in the newer states and territories and with less prosperous people everywhere. Opponents claimed the bank possessed a virtual monopoly over the country's credit and currency, and reiterated that it represented the interests of the wealthy elite. Jackson, elected as a popular champion against it, vetoed a bill to recharter the bank. He also personally detested banks due to a brush with bankruptcy in his youth. In his message to Congress, he denounced monopoly and special privilege, saying that \"our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits, but have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War'' (1967)p. 406</ref>\n\nIn the election campaign that followed, the bank question caused a fundamental division between the merchant, manufacturing and financial interests (generally creditors who favored tight money and high interest rates), and the laboring and agrarian sectors, who were often in debt to banks and therefore favored an increased [[money supply]] and lower interest rates. The outcome was an enthusiastic endorsement of \"Jacksonism\". Jackson saw his [[U.S. presidential election, 1832|reelection in 1832]] as a popular mandate to crush the bank irrevocably; he found a ready-made weapon in a provision of the bank's charter authorizing removal of public funds.\n\nIn September 1833 Jackson ordered that no more government money be deposited in the bank and that the money already in its custody be gradually withdrawn in the ordinary course of meeting the expenses of government. Carefully selected state banks, stringently restricted, were provided as a substitute. For the next generation, the US would get by on a relatively unregulated state banking system. This banking system helped fuel westward expansion through easy credit, but kept the nation vulnerable to periodic panics. It was not until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] that the Federal government again chartered a national bank.\n\nJackson groomed [[Martin van Buren]] as his successor, and he was easily elected president in 1836. However, a few months into his administration, the country fell into a deep economic slump known as the [[Panic of 1837]], caused in large part by excessive speculation. Banks failed and unemployment soared.  It was a devastating economic and social Catastrophe that can be compared with the panic of 1893 and the Great Depression of 1929. event with repercussions every bit as deep as the Great Depression of the 1930s. There was an international dimension, for much of the growth In the private sector, as well as infrastructure investment by state governments (especially canals) had been financed by British capital. Several states and corporations defaulted permanently on their debts owed to London. Investment in America became a dubious proposition for Europeans, so American access to capital sharply declined for decades.<ref>Alasdair Roberts, ''America\u2019s First Great Depression: Economic Crisis and Political Disorder after the Panic of 1837'' (Cornell University press, 2012).</ref>\n\nThe depression had its roots in Jackson's economic hard money policies that blocked investment using paper money, insisting on gold and silver. But he had retired so his chosen successor van Buren was blamed for the disaster. In the 1840 presidential election, he was defeated by the Whig candidate William Henry Harrison. However, his presidency would prove a non-starter when he fell ill with pneumonia and died after only a month in office. [[John Tyler]], the new vice president, succeeded him. Tyler was not popular since he had not been elected to the presidency, and was widely referred to as \"His Accidency\".  He rejected Wake economic policies, so that party expelled him, and The Whigs lost their opportunity to reshape government policy.<ref>Norma Lois Peterson, ''The Presidencies of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler'' (U of Kansas Press, 1989).</ref>\n\nEconomic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the Jacksonian era. For the most part, they follow the conclusions of [[Peter Temin]]. who absolved Jackson's policies, and blamed international events beyond American control, such as conditions in Mexico, China and Britain.  A survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with Temin's conclusion that \"the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond President Jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did vis-a-vis the Second Bank of the U.S.\"<ref>Robert Whaples, \"Were Andrew Jackson's Policies 'Good for the Economy'?\" ''Independent Review'' (2014) 18#4 [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-362727309/were-andrew-jackson-s-policies-good-for-the-economy online]</ref>\n\n==Age of Reform==\nSpurred on by the [[Second Great Awakening]], Americans entered a period of rapid social change and experimentation. New social movements arose, as well as many new alternatives to traditional religious thought. This period of American history was marked by the destruction of some traditional roles of society and the erection of new social standards. One of the unique aspects of the Age of Reform was that it was heavily grounded in religion, in contrast to the anti-clericalism that characterized contemporary European reformers.<ref>Paul S. Boyer, Clifford Clark, and Sandra Hawley, ''The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People: to 1877'' (2009) p 226</ref>\n\n===Second Great Awakening===\nThe [[Second Great Awakening]] was a Protestant religious revival movement that flourished in 1800\u20131840 in every region. It expressed [[Arminianism|Arminian theology]] by which every person could be saved through a direct personal confrontation with Jesus Christ during an intensely emotional revival meeting. Millions joined the churches, often new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new [[Millennialism|millennial age]], so that the Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.<ref>Timothy L. Smith, ''Revivalism and Social Reform: American Protestantism on the Eve of the Civil War'' (1957)</ref> For example, the charismatic [[Charles Grandison Finney]], in [[upstate New York]] and the [[Old Northwest]] was highly effective. At the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] Revival of 1830, prominent citizens concerned with the city's poverty and absenteeism had invited Finney to the city. The wave of religious revival contributed to tremendous growth of the Methodist, Baptists, Disciples, and other evangelical denominations.<ref>Sydney Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People'' (1972) ch 27-30</ref><ref>Dickson D. Bruce, Jr., ''And They All Sang Hallelujah: Plain Folk Camp-Meeting Religion, 1800\u20131845'' (1974)</ref>\n\n====Utopians====\nAs the [[Second Great Awakening]] challenged the traditional beliefs of the [[Calvinist]] faith, the movement inspired other groups to call into question their views on religion and society. Many of these [[Utopianism|utopianist]] groups also believed in [[millennialism]] which prophesied the return of Christ and the beginning of a new age. The [[Harmony Society]] made three attempts to effect a millennial society with the most notable example at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. Later, Scottish industrialist [[Robert Owen]] bought New Harmony and attempted to form a secular Utopian community there. Frenchman [[Charles Fourier]] began a similar secular experiment with his \"phalanxes\" that were spread across the Midwestern United States. However, none of these utopian communities lasted very long except for the Shakers.\n\nOne of the earliest movements was that of the [[Shakers]] in which members of a community held all of their possessions in \"[[Commune (intentional community)|common]]\" and lived in a prosperous, inventive, self-supporting society, with no sexual activity.<ref>Stephen J. Stein, ''The Shaker Experience in America: A History of the United Society of Believers'' (1994)</ref> The Shakers, founded by an English immigrant to the United States Mother [[Ann Lee]], peaked at around 6,000 in 1850 in communities from Maine to Kentucky. The Shakers condemned [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and demanded absolute [[celibacy]]. New members could only come from conversions, and from children brought to the Shaker villages. The Shakers persisted into the 20th century, but lost most of their originality by the middle of the 19th century. They are famed for their artistic craftsmanship, especially their furniture and handicrafts.\n\nThe Perfectionist movement, led by [[John Humphrey Noyes]], founded the utopian [[Oneida Community]] in 1848 with fifty-one devotees, in [[Oneida, New York]]. Noyes believed that the act of final conversion led to absolute and complete release from sin. The Onedia Community believed in the abolition of marriage or monogamous relationships and that sex should be free to whoever consented to it. As opposed to 20th century social movements such as the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s, the Onedians did not seek consequence-free sex for mere pleasure, but believed that, because the logical outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, that raising children should be a communal responsibility. After the original founders died or became elderly, their children rejected the concept of free love and returned to traditional family models. Transforming into a [[joint-stock]] company, Oneida thrived for many years and continues today as a [[Silver (household)|silverware]] company.<ref>{{cite web\n |first=Randall\n |last=Hillebrand\n |url= http://www.nyhistory.com/central/oneida.htm\n |title=The Shakers / Oneida Community (Part Two): The Oneida Community\n |work=New York History Net: For Historians and Students of New York History and Culture\n |date=February 20, 2008\n |location=[[Albany, NY]]\n |publisher=Institute for New York State Studies\n |accessdate=December 14, 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Smith]] also experienced a religious conversion in this era; under his guidance [[Mormon]] history began. Because of their unusual beliefs, which included recognition of the [[Book of Mormon]] as an additional book of scripture comparable to the Bible, Mormons were rejected by mainstream Christians and forced to flee en masse from upstate New York to Ohio, to Missouri and then to  [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where Smith was killed and they were again forced to flee. They Settled around the [[Great Salt Lake]], then part of Mexico. In 1848, the region came under American control and later formed the [[Utah]] Territory. National policy was to suppress polygamy, and Utah was only admitted as a state in 1896 after [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] backtracked from Smith's demand that all the leaders practice polygamy.<ref>Richard L. Bushman, ''Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling'' (2007)</ref>\n\nFor Americans wishing to bridge the gap between the earthly and spiritual worlds, [[spiritualism]] provided a means of communing with the dead. Spiritualists used [[mediums]] to communicate between the living and the dead through a variety of different means. The most famous mediums, the [[Fox sisters]] claimed a direct link to the spirit world. Spiritualism would gain a much larger following after the heavy number of casualties during the Civil War; First Lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] was a believer.<ref>Barbara Weisberg, ''Talking to the Dead: Kate and Maggie Fox and the Rise of Spiritualism'' (2005)</ref>\n\nOther groups seeking spiritual awaking gained popularity in the mid-19th century. Philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] began the [[Transcendentalism|American transcendentalist]] movement in New England, to promote self-reliance and better understanding of the universe through contemplation of the [[over-soul]]. Transcendentalism was in essence an American offshoot of the Romantic movement in Europe. Among transcendentalists' core beliefs was an ideal spiritual state that \"transcends\" the physical, and is only realized through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] rather than doctrine. Like many of the movements, the transcendentalists split over the idea of self-reliance. While Emerson and [[Henry David Thoreau]] promoted the idea of independent living, [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] brought transcendentalists together in a phalanx at [[Brook Farm]] to live cooperatively. Other authors such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] rejected transcendentalist beliefs.<ref>Philip F. Gura, ''American Transcendentalism: A History'' (2008)</ref>\n\nSo many of these new religious and spiritual groups began or concentrated within miles of each other in upstate New York that this area was nicknamed \"the [[burned-over district]]\" because there were so few people left who had not experienced a conversion.<ref>Whitney R. Cross, ''The Burned-over District: The Social and Intellectual History of Enthusiastic Religion in Western New York, 1800\u20131850'' (1950)</ref><ref>Judith Wellman, ''Grassroots Reform in the Burned-over District of Upstate New York: Religion, Abolitionism, and Democracy'' (2000) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0815337922/  excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===Public schools movement===\nEducation in the United States had long been a local affair with schools governed by locally elected school boards. As with much of the culture of the United States, education varied widely in the North and the South. In the New England states [[public education]] was common, although it was often class-based with the working class receiving little benefits. Instruction and curriculum were all locally determined and teachers were expected to meet rigorous demands of strict moral behaviour. Schools taught religious values and applied [[Calvinist]] philosophies of discipline which included [[corporal punishment]] and public humiliation. In the South, there was very little organization of a public education system. Public schools were very rare and most education took place in the home with the family acting as instructors. The wealthier planter families were able to bring in tutors for instruction in the [[classics]] but many yeoman farming families had little access to education outside of the family unit.\n\nThe reform movement in education began in [[Massachusetts]] when [[Horace Mann]] started the common school movement. Mann advocated a statewide curriculum and instituted financing of school through local property taxes. Mann also fought protracted battles against the Calvinist influence in discipline, preferring positive reinforcement to physical punishment. Most children learned to read and write and spell from [[Noah Webster]]'s ''Blue Backed Speller'' and later the [[McGuffey Readers]]. The readings inculcated moral values as well as literacy. Most states tried to emulate Massachusetts, and New England retained its leadership position for another century. German immigrants brought in [[kindergartens]] and the [[Gymnasium (school)]], while Yankee orators sponsored the [[Lyceum]] movement that provided popular education for hundreds of towns and small cities.\n\n===Asylum movement===\nThe social conscience that was raised in the early 19th century helped to elevate the awareness of mental illness and its treatment. A leading advocate of reform for mental illness was [[Dorothea Dix]], a Massachusetts woman who made an intensive study of the conditions that the mentally ill were kept in. Dix's report to the Massachusetts state legislature along with the development of the [[Kirkbride Plan]] helped to alleviate the miserable conditions for many of the mentally ill. Although these facilities often fell short of their intended purpose, reformers continued to follow Dix's advocacy and call for increased study and treatment of mental illness.\n\n===Women===\nZagarri (2007) argues the Revolution created an ongoing debate on the rights of women and created an environment favorable to women's participation in politics. She asserts that for a brief decades, a \"comprehensive transformation in women's rights, roles, and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable\" (p.&nbsp;8) However the opening of possibilities also engendered a backlash that actually set back the cause of women's rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political life.<ref>[[Rosemarie Zagarri]], ''Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2007). 233 pp</ref>\n\nDuring the building of the new republic, American women were able to gain a limited political voice in what is known as [[republican motherhood]]. Under this philosophy, as promoted by leaders such as [[Abigail Adams]], women were seen as the protectors of liberty and republicanism. Mothers were charged with passing down these ideals to their children through instruction of patriotic thoughts and feelings. During the 1830s and 1840s, many of the changes in the status of women that occurred in the post-Revolutionary period\u2014such as the belief in love between spouses and the role of women in the home\u2014continued at an accelerated pace. This was an age of reform movements, in which Americans sought to improve the moral fiber of themselves and of their nation in unprecedented numbers. The wife's role in this process was important because she was seen as the cultivator of morality in her husband and children. Besides domesticity, women were also expected to be pious, pure, and submissive to men. These four components were considered by many at the time to be \"the natural state\" of womanhood, echoes of this ideology still existing today. The view that the wife should find fulfillment in these values is called the ''Cult of True Womanhood'' or the ''[[Cult of Domesticity]]''.<ref>Barbara Welter, \"The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820\u20131860\", ''American Quarterly'' Vol. 18, No. 2, Part 1 (Summer, 1966), pp. 151\u2013174 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711179 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nIn the South, tradition still abounded with society women on the pedestal and dedicated to entertaining and hosting others. This phenomenon is reflected in the 1965 book, ''The Inevitable Guest'', based on a collection of letters by friends and relatives in [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]] to Miss Jemima Darby, a distant relative of the author.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&q=John%20A.%20Cawthon |title=Books: The Inevitable Guest |journal=The Alcalde: The University of Texas Alumni Magazine |date=September 1965 |volume=54 |issue=1 |page=33 |accessdate=July 14, 2010|last1=Communications |first1=Emmis }}</ref>\n\nUnder the doctrine of two spheres, women were to exist in the \"domestic sphere\" at home while their husbands operated in the \"public sphere\" of politics and business. Women took on the new role of \"softening\" their husbands and instructing their children in piety and not republican values, while men handled the business and financial affairs of the family. Some doctors of this period even went so far as to suggest that women should not get an education, lest they divert blood away from the uterus to the brain and produce weak children. The [[coverture]] laws ensured that men would hold political power over their wives.\n\n===Anti-slavery movements===\nBy 1800, many political leaders were convinced that slavery was undesirable, and should eventually be abolished, and the slaves returned to their natural homes in Africa. The [[American Colonization Society]], which was active in both North and South, tried to implement these ideas and established the colony of [[Liberia]] in Africa as a means to repatriate slaves out of white society. Prominent leaders included [[Henry Clay]] and President [[James Monroe]]\u2014who gave his name to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. However, after 1840 many abolitionists rejected the idea of repatriation to Africa.<ref>Eric Burin, ''Slavery and the Peculiar Solution: A History of the American Colonization Society'' (University Press of Florida, 2005)</ref>\n\nThe [[Abolitionism in the United States|slavery abolitionist]] movement among white Protestants was based on evangelical principles of the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Evangelist [[Theodore Weld]] led abolitionist revivals that called for immediate emancipation of slaves. [[William Lloyd Garrison]] founded ''The Liberator'', an anti-slavery newspaper, and the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] to call for abolition. A controversial figure, Garrison often was the focus of public anger. His advocacy of women's rights and inclusion of women in the leadership of the Society caused a rift within the movement. Rejecting Garrison's idea that abolition and women's rights were connected [[Lewis Tappan]] broke with the Society and formed the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]]. Most abolitionists were not as extreme as Garrison, who vowed that \"The Liberator\" would not cease publication until slavery was abolished.<ref>Stanley Harrold, ''The American Abolitionists'' (Longman, 2000)</ref>\n\n[[File:Frederick Douglas NYHS c1866.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Frederick Douglass]]]]\n\nWhite abolitionists did not always face agreeable communities in the North. Garrison was almost lynched in Boston while newspaper publisher [[Elijah Lovejoy]] was killed in [[Alton, Illinois]]. The anger over abolition even spilled over into Congress where a [[gag rule]] was instituted to prevent any discussion of slavery on the floor of either chamber. Most whites viewed African-Americans as an inferior race and had little taste for abolitionists, often assuming that all were like Garrison. African-Americans had little freedom even in states where slavery was not permitted, being shunned by whites, subjected to discriminatory laws, and often forced to compete with Irish immigrants for menial, low-wage jobs. In the South meanwhile, planters argued that slavery was necessary to operate their plantations profitably and that emancipated slaves would attempt to Africanize the country as they had done in Haiti.\n\nBoth free-born [[African American]] citizens and former slaves took on leading roles in abolitionism as well. By far the most prominent spokesperson for abolition in the African American community was [[Frederick Douglass]], an escaped slave whose eloquent condemnations of slavery drew both crowds of supporters as well as threats against his life. Douglass was a keen user of the printed word both through his newspaper [[North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]] and three best-selling autobiographies.\n\nAt one extreme [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]] published ''An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World'' calling for African American revolt against white tyranny. The [[Underground Railroad]] helped some slaves out of the South through a series of trails and safe houses known as \"stations.\"  Known as \"conductors\", escaped slaves volunteered to return to the South to lead others to safety; former slaves, such as [[Harriet Tubman]], risked their lives on these journeys.<ref>Fergus M Bordewich, ''Bound for Canaan: The Underground Railroad and the War for the Soul of America'' (2005)</ref>\n\n===Women as abolitionists===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1    = Lucretiamott2 crop.jpg\n | width1    = 152\n | caption1  = Lucretia Mott\n | image2    = ElizabethCadyStanton.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | caption2  = Elizabeth Cady Stanton}}\n\n[[Grimk\u00e9 sisters|Angelia and Sarah Grimk\u00e9]] were southerners who moved North to advocate against slavery. The American Anti-Slavery Society welcomed women. Garrison along with [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Lucretia Mott]] were so appalled that women were not allowed to participate at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London that they called for a women's rights convention in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]]. It was at this convention that [[Sojourner Truth]] became recognized as a leading spokesperson for both abolition and women's rights. Women abolitionists increasingly began to compare women's situation with the plight of slaves. This new polemic squarely blamed men for all the restrictions of women's role, and argued that the relationship between the sexes was one-sided, controlling and oppressive. There were strong religious roots; most feminists emerged from the [[Quaker]] and [[Congregationalist]] churches in the Northeast.<ref>Lori D. Ginzberg. ''Elizabeth Cady Stanton: An American Life'' (2010)</ref>\n\n===Prohibition===\nAlcohol consumption was another target of reformers in the 1850s. Americans drank heavily, which contributed to violent behaviour, crime, health problems, and poor workplace performance. Groups such as the [[American Temperance Society]] condemned liquor as being a scourge on society and urged temperance among their followers. The state of Maine attempted in 1851 to ban alcohol sales and production entirely, but it met resistance and was abandoned. The prohibition movement was forgotten during the Civil War, but would return in the 1875s.\n\n[[File:Boston Manufacturing Company.jpg|thumb|250px|The Boston Manufacturing Company was organized in 1813 by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]], a wealthy Boston merchant, in partnership with a group of investors known as the Boston Associates, for the manufacture of cotton textiles.<ref>{{cite web\n |url= http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/wes/collections/labor/textiles/content/1001956083.html\n |title=Boston Manufacturing Company Collection\n |work=Women, Enterprise and Society: A Guide to Resources in the Business Manuscripts Collection at Baker Library\n |location=[[Boston, MA]]\n |publisher=[[Harvard Business School]], [[Harvard University|Harvard U.]]\n |year=2009\n |accessdate=December 14, 2009\n}}</ref>]]\n[[File:PercentOfUSPopInEachState.gif|thumb|right|250px|Historical movement of U.S. population. Note the major westward expansion in the 19th century.]]\n\n==Economic growth==\n{{Main|Technological and industrial history of the United States#Early industrialization}}\nIn this period, the United States rapidly expanded economically from an agrarian nation into an industrial power. [[Industrialization]] in America involved two important developments. First, transportation was expanded. Second, improvements were made to industrial processes such as the use of [[interchangeable parts]] and [[railroads]] to ship goods more quickly. The government helped protect American manufacturers by passing a protective tariff.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860''   (1951)</ref>\n\n===Social mobility===\nThe steady expansion and rapid population growth of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, but on the whole hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude of most Americans. While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons for tens of thousands of pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]] were two of the richest men in the world by 1900. Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized upward mobility, and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.<ref>Stephan Thernstrom, ''Poverty and Progress, Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964)</ref><ref>Steven A. Riess, \"The Impact of ''Poverty and Progress'' on the Generation of Historians Trained in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s,\" ''Social Science History'' Vol. 10, No. 1 (Spring, 1986), pp. 23-32 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1171115 in JSTOR] reviews numerous studies of mobility</ref>\n\n==Westward expansion==\n{{Main|Manifest Destiny|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:United States 1822-1824.png|thumb|States and territories of the United States in 1822-1824]]\nAfter 1815, the United States shifted its attention away from foreign policy to internal development. With the defeat of the eastern Indians in the War of 1812, American settlers moved in great numbers into the rich farmlands of the Midwest. Westward expansion was mostly undertaken by groups of young families. [[Daniel Boone]] was one frontiersman who pioneered the settlement of Kentucky. In the 1830s, the federal government forcibly deported the southeastern tribes to their own reservations in the Indian territory (now Oklahoma) via the \"[[Trail of Tears]]\". There they received annual subsidies of food and supplies.<ref>Theda Perdue and Michael Green, ''The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears'' (2007)</ref>\n\nBefore the settlers arrived in the far west the fur trappers and [[Mountain men]] had their day. As skilled hunters, they trapped beaver for eventual sale to the European fashion industry. After the demise of the [[fur trade]], they established trading posts throughout the west, continued trade with the Indians and served as guides and hunters for the western migration of settlers to Utah and the Pacific coast.<ref>LeRoy R. Hafen and Harvey L. Carter, ''Mountain Men and Fur Traders of the Far West: Eighteen Biographical Sketches'' (1982)</ref>\n\n===Texas, Oregon, California and Manifest Destiny===\nManifest Destiny was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across the continent. This concept was born out of \"A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Frederick Merk|title=Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA3|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=3|isbn=9780674548053}}</ref> The phrase \"Manifest Destiny\" meant many different things to many different people, and was rejected by many Americans. [[Daniel Walker Howe|Howe]] argues that, \"[[American imperialism]] did not represent an American consensus; it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity.\"<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'', (2007) pp 705-6</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher|Faragher's]] analysis of the political polarization between the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] is that:\n\n<blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the North) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the territories. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. ... For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson's vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) page 413</ref></blockquote>\n\nManifest destiny did however provide the rhetorical tone for the largest acquisition of U.S. territory. It was used by [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the 1840s to justify the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]]. It was also used to threaten war with Britain, but [[President Polk]] negotiated a compromise that divided the [[Oregon Country]] half and half. Merk concludes:\n\n<blockquote>From the outset Manifest Destiny\u2014vast in program, in its sense of continentalism\u2014was slight in support. It lacked national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its bigness. The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit. The thesis that it embodied nationalism, found in much historical writing, is backed by little real supporting evidence.<ref>{{cite book |author=Frederick Merk|title=Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhYJTaZiuxwC&pg=PA215|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=215|isbn=9780674548053}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War: 1846\u20131848===\n[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|Growth 1840\u201350|thumb|right|250px|Growth from 1840 to 1850]]\nAfter a bitter debate in Congress the [[Texas Annexation|Republic of Texas was voluntarily annexed]] in 1845, which Mexico had repeatedly warned meant war. In May 1846, Congress declared war on Mexico after Mexican troops massacred a U.S. Army detachment in a disputed unsettled area. However the homefront was polarized as Whigs opposed and Democrats supported the war. The U.S. Army, augmented by tens of thousands of volunteers, under the command of General [[Zachary Taylor]] defeated [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]'s in northern Mexico while other American forces quickly took possession of New Mexico and California. Mexico continued to resist despite a chaotic political situation, and so Polk launched an invasion of the country's heartland. A new American army led by [[Winfield Scott]] occupied the port of Veracruz, and pressed inland amid bloody fighting. Santa Anna offered to cede Texas and California north of Monterrey Bay, but negotiations broke down and the fighting resumed. In September 1847, Scott's army captured Mexico City. Santa Anna was forced to flee and a provisional government began the task of negotiating peace. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was signed on February 2, 1848. It recognized the [[Rio Grande]] as the southern boundary of [[Texas]] and ceded what is now the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico to the United States, while also paying Mexico $15,000,000 for the territory. In the presidential election of 1848, Zachary Taylor ran as a Whig and won easily when the Democrats split, even though he was an apolitical military man who never voted in his life. Scott became the last Whig candidate for president in 1852, and he lost badly.\n\nWith Texas and Florida having been admitted to the union as slave states in 1845, California was entered as a free state in 1850 after its state convention unanimously voted to ban slavery.\n\nMajor events in the western movement of the U.S. population were the [[Homestead Act]], a law by which, for a nominal price, a settler was given title to {{convert|160|acres|abbr=out}} of land to farm; the opening of the [[Oregon Territory]] to settlement; the [[Texas Revolution]]; the opening of the [[Oregon Trail]]; the [[Mormon Emigration]] to [[Utah]] in 1846\u201347; the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849; the [[Colorado Gold Rush]] of 1859; and the completion of the nation's [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] on May 10, 1869.\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"150px\" heights=\"250px\" caption=\"US Population Distribution\">\nFile:USA population distribution 1790.png|1790\nFile:USA population distribution 1800.png|1800\nFile:USA population distribution 1820.png|1820\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1790\u20131819)]]\n* [[Timeline of United States history (1820\u20131859)]]\n* [[History of the United States (1849\u20131865)]]\n* [[First Party System]]\n* [[American gentry]]\n* [[First Great Awakening]]\n* [[Second Party System]]\n* [[Slavery in the United States]]\n* [[Presidency of George Washington]]\n* [[Presidency of John Adams]]\n* [[Presidency of Thomas Jefferson]]\n* [[Presidency of James Madison]]\n* [[Presidency of James Monroe]]\n* [[Presidency of John Quincy Adams]]\n* [[Presidency of Andrew Jackson]]\n* [[Presidency of Martin Van Buren]]\n* [[Presidency of John Tyler]]\n* [[Presidency of James K.

His parents are unknown and he has few known relatives.  He has a sister, and also claims (like many other kender) to have an Uncle Trapspringer.  He has three uncles, by the names of Remo Lockpick, Bertie, and Wilfre.  He also has a cousin, Latchlifter Furrfoot.\n\n==Publication history==\n''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine introduced some of the [[Heroes of the Lance]] in a series of short stories, as a preview to the Dragonlance story; \"A Stone's Throw Away\" in ''Dragon'' #85 (May 1984) was the second of these, and is a story about Tasslehoff.<ref name=\"Dragon85\"/>\n\nIn the novel ''[[Kendermore]]'', Tasslehoff is \"collared by a lady bounty hunter and charged with violating the kender laws of prearranged marriage. To ensure his return, Kendermore's council has his Uncle Trapspringer in prison. Tas meets the last woolly mammoth and an alchemist who wants to pickle one of everything, including one kender. What no one knows is that the Dark Queen is inciting the riots in Kendermore as part of her plan for the battle of good versus evil.\"<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Kirchoff| first = Mary| authorlink = Mary Kirchoff| title = The Game Wizards|magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #141| page = 68| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=January 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nTasslehoff developed a passion for maps early on. He collected them and posted them all over the walls of his room. However, when he drew maps, his short patience led him to draw them inaccurately and make up names for certain places on [[Ansalon]].  While he often stole things, he always claimed he wasn't a thief, often saying he was just borrowing the objects in question. This is a behaviour typical to kender, who as a species steadfastly, and with some indignation, maintain they do not steal, but \"find\" things that \"just happen\" to have been left out, or fallen into their pouches.\n\nHe traveled to Solace and found a ring dropped by a thief, which he dubbed \"Tas's Ring of Teleportation\". With this ring, he traveled all across Krynn, ending up at Magus's Tower where he aided [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]] in an attempt to stop Magus from using demons. When he departed, he left Magus in the care of the Prince of Demons.\n\nDuring Tas's travels outside of Solace, he encountered [[Tanis Half-Elven]] and [[Flint Fireforge]]. He asked to be their friends; they declined. Tas, upon leaving Solace, acquired a bracelet that Flint made for Selena Sonluanaau.  This bracelet saved Tas from a spider, and a merchant as well. When Tanis and Flint came to collect the bracelet Tas no longer had it. Selena arrived and charged them with finding the bracelet. They set off immediately, but were waylaid by [[Satyr (Dungeons & Dragons)|satyrs]], who made them stop, dance, and drink while the satyrs played music for a whole day. Upon arriving in Tantallon, Flint and Tanis were captured by the local Lord.  Selena and Tas took a [[Shapeshifting|polymorph]] potion that turned them into birds to get into the castle, then they became mice to retrieve the bracelet.  They freed Tanis and Flint, the bracelet was returned to Selena, and Tas left with Flint and Tanis.\n\nTasslehoff then joined the remaining [[Heroes of the Lance|Companions]] and they began adventuring. Flint nearly drowned at one point, and Tas helped to get him ashore. When Tas was on a quest for a special herb that [[Raistlin Majere|Raistlin]] needed, along with [[Sturm Brightblade|Sturm]] and [[Caramon Majere|Caramon]], he was captured by minotaurs.\n\nTasslehoff also appeared in the ''Legends Trilogy'' as a character to retrieve Caramon from his drunken stupor.\n\n==Back to Kendermore==\nWhen the companions separated, Tas had no intention of leaving his friends but a bounty hunter (who was a beautiful dwarven woman, and was later killed by the half-orc Denzil) came to arrest him and bring him back to Kendermore. She did this because he had marry a kender named Damaris Metwinger (who was the mayor's daughter). His journey to Kendermore was forced upon him, by saying that his Uncle Trapspringer was arrested until Tas will come and marry. On the way Tas was kidnapped by two Gnomes, whose Life-Quest was to stuff one of every creature alive. He was rescued by a Woolly Mammoth he released (this later prompted endless stories he told to the other Heroes of the Lance, whether they wanted to hear them or not). He was then kidnapped by a half-orc named Denzil, who needed a map of Tas' to find a treasure located in The Ruins. The Ruins were the remnants of a city lost during the time of the Cataclysm, located just outside the kender city, Kendermore. When Tas reached The Ruins, he was captured by a friendly ogre. The ogre's lair was underneath one of the abandoned Towers of High Sorcery. In the Tower of High Sorcery he entered a dimension. The dimension where his Uncle Trapspringer and Damaris were on that anything and everything was edible. They escaped, along with the other kender caught there. Takhisis, finding an open portal, tried to enter the world, but they closed the portal before she could get in. In revenge, she asked her son, Nuitari, the god of dark magic, to cause natural disasters on Kendermore. When Tas and the rest of the kenders saved from the alternate dimension arrived in Kendermore, it was burning. However, thanks to Tas' leadership, they extinguished the fire. At the end Damaris decided to marry Trapspringer, thus freeing Tas from his obligation.\n\n==War of the Lance==\nTasslehoff helps his companions on many occasions during the war,<ref name=\"LZW\"/> mainly through his fearlessness and curiosity. While normally a nuisance, these qualities often help the Companions as well. Tasslehoff takes his part in the war by riding a dragon with Flint during one of the final battles. He is delighted at the chance of flying dragons and get excited easily, even in dangerous and deadly situations.  During the War of the Lance, Tasslehoff has numerous [[near-death experience]]s. In a draconian army encampment, he nearly dies in a burning wicker dragon. In the city of Tarsis the Beautiful, he nearly dies by a burning building falling on top of him. In the Temple of the Dark Queen in Neraka, Tasslehoff is poisoned by a trap sprung by a picked lock. He is later healed by Raistlin Majere.\n\nPaladine, leader of the white pantheon of gods in Dragonlance and brother to [[Takhisis]], becomes mortal and takes the form of a wizard named Fizban, who is very fond of kenders in general and Tasslehoff in particular, with the two developing a father and son relationship.{{sfn|Wolf|2010|p=14|ref=Wolf}}\n\n==After the war==\nAfter the war Tasslehoff splits up with the other Companions of the Lance, with the intention of going back to Kendermore. He went on to tell them the tale of how the kender killed a Dragon Highlord named Fewmaster Toede. Before leaving he told the companions that kenders would go down in Krynnish lore. The companions had to refrain from telling Tas that Fewmaster Toede was a hobgoblin with little more intelligence than a Gully Dwarf.\n\n==Legends==\nTasslehoff was sent by Tika Majere to help Caramon escort a cleric of Paladine, Crysania to the tower of High Sorcery. Anxious to keep his promise to protect Caramon and not miss out on any adventures, Tasslehoff, having been transformed into a mouse, manages to sneak into the laboratory of the great Par Salian, leader of the white robed magicians of Good, as he is casting the time traveling spell. Tasslehoff runs into the middle of the spell and gets transported back in time with Caramon. Since the creation of Kender was accidental, Kender possessed the ability to alter the flow of time. Through Tasslehoff's interference, Raistlin (as Fistandantilus) is able to change the past and successfully enter the Abyss to challenge [[Takhisis]] along with the Paladine cleric Crysania. Caramon and Tas, traveling back in time, end up in 358 instead of 356, discovering an alternate time line in which Raistlin has become a god, and the world is going to end. Armed with this knowledge, they go back in time again to 356, planning to stop Raistlin. Caramon orders Tas to save Tanis. Tas, knowing that Caramon will die if he tries to enters the Shoikan Grove, saves Tanis, and with his help, Tas saves Caramon. He then helps them when they capture the Flying Citadel, and controls it until the end of the war, when he gives it to Rounce. After hearing Crysania's eulogy for Elistan, he leaves to Tanis' castle with Tanis and Caramon.\n\n==Chaos War==\nIn order to force Chaos to part or remain on Krynn, the gods needed Chaos' blood, and so, at the end of the Chaos War Tasslehoff insulted Chaos, making the deity careless. Tasslehoff then ran up and stabbed Chaos in his big toe with a magical knife [[Caramon Majere]] had dubbed \"Rabbitslayer\". The resulting spurt of blood was enough of Chaos' essence to be used to force the deity into a choice\u2014stay in the world and be forced to continually control himself (which Chaos had little patience for), or leave. Chaos decided to leave, but while he was leaving, he stomped on Tasslehoff, seemingly killing him, but leaving his items.\n\n==War of Souls==\nBefore Tasslehoff was killed by Chaos, he used the magical time traveling device to go forward in time to speak at Caramon's funeral. The first time he attempted to attend the funeral, he arrived too late. On another attempt at arriving at the correct time, he managed to speak briefly. After this event, Tasslehoff went back, unintentionally, to a different time and participated in the War of Souls. There he met the knight Gerard, and the two embarked on a journey to [[Qualinesti]] to find the mage [[Palin Majere]] before separating. The third timeline he ever entered was the only one in which the Great Dragons reached Ansalon. By simply existing in this timeline that wasn't his own he was a danger to Takhisis. He was proof that her power wasn't absolute and inspired some individuals. Moreover, if he was slain in a time not his own, the result would be oblivion. Thus, he was unsuccessfully hunted by the Dark Knight, [[Mina (Dragonlance)|Mina]]. He was trapped for a time in the tower of high sorcery with the mages Palin and Dalamar, both of which wanted to send him back to die by using the Device of Time Journeying.<ref>Cannon, Peter (May 13, 2002). \"Dragons of a Vanished Moon: The War of Souls Volume Three\", ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' '''249''' (19): 56.</ref> However, the device had been broken earlier. Since he did not want to die, he fled with the device, which was later fixed by the gnome Conundrum. He traveled through several various times throughout history before he returned to the war of souls. Shortly after, he helped Gerard, Odila, and Mirror to free the metallic dragons from their prison. After this he agreed to go back in time and get stepped on by Chaos, as he was supposed to, thus returning to his normal time-stream. As he was leaving, he reminded Gerard that the lock on his tomb (which he had picklocked), was broken and needed repair.\n\nCoincidentally, many kender claim to have an ''Uncle Tas'' during the Fifth Age.\n\n==Personality==\nTas, like all kender of the Dragonlance series, could be compared to a 5-year-old child; he is utterly irresponsible in any task that is not of the utmost importance, and often takes things that do not belong to him, which to a kender is \"borrowing\" and not stealing. Kender do not consider themselves to be thieves, and can become quite indignant when accused of stealing. They believe in sharing all that they have, and a common custom between two kender is to dump the entire contents of their pouches and exchange things. To kender, a family heirloom is something that has been in their possession for more than three weeks.\n\nKender also have a trait called \"Taunting\", by insulting their opponents to the point of enraging them to killing intent, and thus lowering their accuracy in attacking but increasing their strength as a result. This is especially shown during Chronicles Book 2: ''[[Dragons of Winter Night]]'' when the companions were tied up and escorted to the mayor and while walking the street under the jeering of the crowd, Tas, as the master of taunting, managed to enrage the crowd into a riot and managed to be saved by the knights on covert mission in the chaos.\n\nLike all kender, Tas hated being bored, and on the occasion that he was, he was known to begin talking about meaningless things to anyone who would listen.\n\nLike all kender, Tas is completely without fear for himself. However, Tas is different from other kender in that he does know fear, not for himself, but for the people that he cares about. He is even immune to dragonfear, except that caused by the great dragons of the fourth age, but the Shoikan Grove's piercing aura of fear managed to break through and affect him, though he did not recognize the feeling. The Death Knight, Lord Soth, gave him the same feeling. He is also fiercely loyal to his friends, has enough sense (largely thanks to lecturing from [[Tanis Half-Elven]]) to avoid overly dangerous situations, and above all, has a conscience in the form of [[Flint Fireforge]]'s voice.\n\nDisplays of this fear can be found in the books:\n<BR>'''Chronicles Trilogy'''<BR>\n''Dragons of Autumn Twilight''<BR>\n''Dragons of Winter Night''<BR>\n''Dragons of Spring Dawning''<BR>\n''Dragons of Summer Flame''\n\n<BR>'''War of Souls Trilogy'''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Fallen Sun''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Lost Star''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Vanished Moon''\n\n==Appearance==\nTasslehoff is often described as resembling a twelve-year-old child; he is of that general height and build. His face has many wrinkles that appear whenever he smiles, which is often. His clothes are always described as colorful, comfortable, and utterly unmatching.  His most famous article of clothing was his fur-lined vest, worn through much of the War of Lance. Like all of his race, he carries a good number of pouches, which he never takes off, except just prior to his death at the hands of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], so that he could run faster. See [[Chaos War]]. Also like all of his race, he has a ludicrously large [[Man bun|topknot]], which is to a [[Kender (fantasy)|kender]] what a beard is to a dwarf. His hair is brown as are his eyes. He also embodies the statement in many of the novels, the two most dangerous things in all of Krynn is to hear a Kender say \"oops\" and \"I'm bored.\".\n\n==Other media==\n===Video games===\nTasslehoff appears as one of the player characters in ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine  | title =Fantasy Roleplaying: Heroes of the Lance  | format =review  |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]  | issue = 62  |page=71  | date =March 1989  | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue62/Pages/Crash6200071.jpg  | issn =0954-8661  | accessdate = March 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nTasslehoff also appears as a player character in ''[[Dragons of Flame (video game)|Dragons of Flame]]'', where one reviewer describes him as \"a rather fat mamma with ginormous ears\".<ref>{{cite journal  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Dragons of Flame  | format = review  | journal =[[Your Sinclair]]  | volume =  | issue = 58  |page=82  | publisher =  | date =October 1990  | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue58/Pages/YourSinclair5800082.jpg  | doi =  | issn =0269-6983  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Miniature figures===\nTasslehoff was included in [[Ral Partha]]'s ''Dragonlance Heroes'' boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine felt that Ral Partha did a good job of matching their figures to the characters' descriptions in the books, and described his figure: \"Tasslehoff stands at the ready, with a sling in his left hand and a rock in his right. He is clothed in simple pants and buckle boots, and is wearing a sleeveless fur coat. His face has a look of foreboding. His hair is pulled back into a topknot that flows down his back.

His parents are unknown and he has few known relatives.  He has a sister, and also claims (like many other kender) to have an Uncle Trapspringer.  He has three uncles, by the names of Remo Lockpick, Bertie, and Wilfre.  He also has a cousin, Latchlifter Furrfoot.\n\n==Publication history==\n''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine introduced some of the [[Heroes of the Lance]] in a series of short stories, as a preview to the Dragonlance story; \"A Stone's Throw Away\" in ''Dragon'' #85 (May 1984) was the second of these, and is a story about Tasslehoff.<ref name=\"Dragon85\"/>\n\nIn the novel ''[[Kendermore]]'', Tasslehoff is \"collared by a lady bounty hunter and charged with violating the kender laws of prearranged marriage. To ensure his return, Kendermore's council has his Uncle Trapspringer in prison. Tas meets the last woolly mammoth and an alchemist who wants to pickle one of everything, including one kender. What no one knows is that the Dark Queen is inciting the riots in Kendermore as part of her plan for the battle of good versus evil.\"<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Kirchoff| first = Mary| authorlink = Mary Kirchoff| title = The Game Wizards|magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #141| page = 68| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=January 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nTasslehoff developed a passion for maps early on. He collected them and posted them all over the walls of his room. However, when he drew maps, his short patience led him to draw them inaccurately and make up names for certain places on [[Ansalon]].  While he often stole things, he always claimed he wasn't a thief, often saying he was just borrowing the objects in question. This is a behaviour typical to kender, who as a species steadfastly, and with some indignation, maintain they do not steal, but \"find\" things that \"just happen\" to have been left out, or fallen into their pouches.\n\nHe traveled to Solace and found a ring dropped by a thief, which he dubbed \"Tas's Ring of Teleportation\". With this ring, he traveled all across Krynn, ending up at Magus's Tower where he aided [[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]] in an attempt to stop Magus from using demons. When he departed, he left Magus in the care of the Prince of Demons.\n\nDuring Tas's travels outside of Solace, he encountered [[Tanis Half-Elven]] and [[Flint Fireforge]]. He asked to be their friends; they declined. Tas, upon leaving Solace, acquired a bracelet that Flint made for Selena Sonluanaau.  This bracelet saved Tas from a spider, and a merchant as well. When Tanis and Flint came to collect the bracelet Tas no longer had it. Selena arrived and charged them with finding the bracelet. They set off immediately, but were waylaid by [[Satyr (Dungeons & Dragons)|satyrs]], who made them stop, dance, and drink while the satyrs played music for a whole day. Upon arriving in Tantallon, Flint and Tanis were captured by the local Lord.  Selena and Tas took a [[Shapeshifting|polymorph]] potion that turned them into birds to get into the castle, then they became mice to retrieve the bracelet.  They freed Tanis and Flint, the bracelet was returned to Selena, and Tas left with Flint and Tanis.\n\nTasslehoff then joined the remaining [[Heroes of the Lance|Companions]] and they began adventuring. Flint nearly drowned at one point, and Tas helped to get him ashore. When Tas was on a quest for a special herb that [[Raistlin Majere|Raistlin]] needed, along with [[Sturm Brightblade|Sturm]] and [[Caramon Majere|Caramon]], he was captured by minotaurs.\n\nTasslehoff also appeared in the ''Legends Trilogy'' as a character to retrieve Caramon from his drunken stupor.\n\n==Back to Kendermore==\nWhen the companions separated, Tas had no intention of leaving his friends but a bounty hunter (who was a beautiful dwarven woman, and was later killed by the half-orc Denzil) came to arrest him and bring him back to Kendermore. She did this because he had to get married to a kender named Damaris Metwinger (who was the mayor's daughter). His journey to Kendermore was forced upon him, by saying that his Uncle Trapspringer was arrested until Tas will come and marry. On the way Tas was kidnapped by two Gnomes, whose Life-Quest was to stuff one of every creature alive. He was rescued by a Woolly Mammoth he released (this later prompted endless stories he told to the other Heroes of the Lance, whether they wanted to hear them or not). He was then kidnapped by a half-orc named Denzil, who needed a map of Tas' to find a treasure located in The Ruins. The Ruins were the remnants of a city lost during the time of the Cataclysm, located just outside the kender city, Kendermore. When Tas reached The Ruins, he was captured by a friendly ogre. The ogre's lair was underneath one of the abandoned Towers of High Sorcery. In the Tower of High Sorcery he entered a dimension. The dimension where his Uncle Trapspringer and Damaris were on that anything and everything was edible. They escaped, along with the other kender caught there. Takhisis, finding an open portal, tried to enter the world, but they closed the portal before she could get in. In revenge, she asked her son, Nuitari, the god of dark magic, to cause natural disasters on Kendermore. When Tas and the rest of the kenders saved from the alternate dimension arrived in Kendermore, it was burning. However, thanks to Tas' leadership, they extinguished the fire. At the end Damaris decided to marry Trapspringer, thus freeing Tas from his obligation.\n\n==War of the Lance==\nTasslehoff helps his companions on many occasions during the war,<ref name=\"LZW\"/> mainly through his fearlessness and curiosity. While normally a nuisance, these qualities often help the Companions as well. Tasslehoff takes his part in the war by riding a dragon with Flint during one of the final battles. He is delighted at the chance of flying dragons and get excited easily, even in dangerous and deadly situations.  During the War of the Lance, Tasslehoff has numerous [[near-death experience]]s. In a draconian army encampment, he nearly dies in a burning wicker dragon. In the city of Tarsis the Beautiful, he nearly dies by a burning building falling on top of him. In the Temple of the Dark Queen in Neraka, Tasslehoff is poisoned by a trap sprung by a picked lock. He is later healed by Raistlin Majere.\n\nPaladine, leader of the white pantheon of gods in Dragonlance and brother to [[Takhisis]], becomes mortal and takes the form of a wizard named Fizban, who is very fond of kenders in general and Tasslehoff in particular, with the two developing a father and son relationship.{{sfn|Wolf|2010|p=14|ref=Wolf}}\n\n==After the war==\nAfter the war Tasslehoff splits up with the other Companions of the Lance, with the intention of going back to Kendermore. He went on to tell them the tale of how the kender killed a Dragon Highlord named Fewmaster Toede. Before leaving he told the companions that kenders would go down in Krynnish lore. The companions had to refrain from telling Tas that Fewmaster Toede was a hobgoblin with little more intelligence than a Gully Dwarf.\n\n==Legends==\nTasslehoff was sent by Tika Majere to help Caramon escort a cleric of Paladine, Crysania to the tower of High Sorcery. Anxious to keep his promise to protect Caramon and not miss out on any adventures, Tasslehoff, having been transformed into a mouse, manages to sneak into the laboratory of the great Par Salian, leader of the white robed magicians of Good, as he is casting the time traveling spell. Tasslehoff runs into the middle of the spell and gets transported back in time with Caramon. Since the creation of Kender was accidental, Kender possessed the ability to alter the flow of time. Through Tasslehoff's interference, Raistlin (as Fistandantilus) is able to change the past and successfully enter the Abyss to challenge [[Takhisis]] along with the Paladine cleric Crysania. Caramon and Tas, traveling back in time, end up in 358 instead of 356, discovering an alternate time line in which Raistlin has become a god, and the world is going to end. Armed with this knowledge, they go back in time again to 356, planning to stop Raistlin. Caramon orders Tas to save Tanis. Tas, knowing that Caramon will die if he tries to enters the Shoikan Grove, saves Tanis, and with his help, Tas saves Caramon. He then helps them when they capture the Flying Citadel, and controls it until the end of the war, when he gives it to Rounce. After hearing Crysania's eulogy for Elistan, he leaves to Tanis' castle with Tanis and Caramon.\n\n==Chaos War==\nIn order to force Chaos to part or remain on Krynn, the gods needed Chaos' blood, and so, at the end of the Chaos War Tasslehoff insulted Chaos, making the deity careless. Tasslehoff then ran up and stabbed Chaos in his big toe with a magical knife [[Caramon Majere]] had dubbed \"Rabbitslayer\". The resulting spurt of blood was enough of Chaos' essence to be used to force the deity into a choice\u2014stay in the world and be forced to continually control himself (which Chaos had little patience for), or leave. Chaos decided to leave, but while he was leaving, he stomped on Tasslehoff, seemingly killing him, but leaving his items.\n\n==War of Souls==\nBefore Tasslehoff was killed by Chaos, he used the magical time traveling device to go forward in time to speak at Caramon's funeral.

The third timeline he ever entered was the only one in which the Great Dragons reached Ansalon. By simply existing in this timeline that wasn't his own he was a danger to Takhisis. He was proof that her power wasn't absolute and inspired some individuals. Moreover, if he was slain in a time not his own, the result would be oblivion.

This is especially shown during Chronicles Book 2: ''[[Dragons of Winter Night]]'' when the companions were tied up and escorted to the mayor and while walking the street under the jeering of the crowd, Tas, as the master of taunting, managed to enrage the crowd into a riot and managed to be saved by the knights on covert mission in the chaos.\n\nLike all kender, Tas hated being bored, and on the occasion that he was, he was known to begin talking about meaningless things to anyone who would listen.\n\nLike all kender, Tas is completely without fear for himself. However, Tas is different from other kender in that he does know fear, not for himself, but for the people that he cares about. He is even immune to dragonfear, except that caused by the great dragons of the fourth age, but the Shoikan Grove's piercing aura of fear managed to break through and affect him, though he did not recognize the feeling. The Death Knight, Lord Soth, gave him the same feeling. He is also fiercely loyal to his friends, has enough sense (largely thanks to lecturing from [[Tanis Half-Elven]]) to avoid overly dangerous situations, and above all, has a conscience in the form of [[Flint Fireforge]]'s voice.\n\nDisplays of this fear can be found in the books:\n<BR>'''Chronicles Trilogy'''<BR>\n''Dragons of Autumn Twilight''<BR>\n''Dragons of Winter Night''<BR>\n''Dragons of Spring Dawning''<BR>\n''Dragons of Summer Flame''\n\n<BR>'''War of Souls Trilogy'''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Fallen Sun''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Lost Star''<BR>\n''Dragons of a Vanished Moon''\n\n==Appearance==\nTasslehoff is often described as resembling a twelve-year-old child; he is of that general height and build. His face has many wrinkles that appear whenever he smiles, which is often. His clothes are always described as colorful, comfortable, and utterly unmatching.  His most famous article of clothing was his fur-lined vest, worn through much of the War of Lance. Like all of his race, he carries a good number of pouches, which he never takes off, except just prior to his death at the hands of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], so that he could run faster. See [[Chaos War]]. Also like all of his race, he has a ludicrously large [[Man bun|topknot]], which is to a [[Kender (fantasy)|kender]] what a beard is to a dwarf. His hair is brown as are his eyes. He also embodies the statement in many of the novels, the two most dangerous things in all of Krynn is to hear a Kender say \"oops\" and \"I'm bored.\".\n\n==Other media==\n===Video games===\nTasslehoff appears as one of the player characters in ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes of the Lance]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine  | title =Fantasy Roleplaying: Heroes of the Lance  | format =review  |magazine=[[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]  | issue = 62  |page=71  | date =March 1989  | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash/Issue62/Pages/Crash6200071.jpg  | issn =0954-8661  | accessdate = March 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nTasslehoff also appears as a player character in ''[[Dragons of Flame (video game)|Dragons of Flame]]'', where one reviewer describes him as \"a rather fat mamma with ginormous ears\".<ref>{{cite journal  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Dragons of Flame  | format = review  | journal =[[Your Sinclair]]  | volume =  | issue = 58  |page=82  | publisher =  | date =October 1990  | url =http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue58/Pages/YourSinclair5800082.jpg  | doi =  | issn =0269-6983  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Miniature figures===\nTasslehoff was included in [[Ral Partha]]'s ''Dragonlance Heroes'' boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine felt that Ral Partha did a good job of matching their figures to the characters' descriptions in the books, and described his figure: \"Tasslehoff stands at the ready, with a sling in his left hand and a rock in his right. He is clothed in simple pants and buckle boots, and is wearing a sleeveless fur coat. His face has a look of foreboding. His hair is pulled back into a topknot that flows down his back. He is also carrying water containers and provisions on his belt.\"<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Bigelow| first = Robert| title = Through the Looking Glass|magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #155| page = 106| publisher = [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| location = [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]]|date=March 1990}}</ref>\n\n===''Dragonlance'' movie===\n{{main|Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight}}\n\n[[Jason Marsden]] voiced Tasslehoff in the animated movie ''[[Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.dragonlance-movie.com/movie/cast/\n | title = Cast\n | accessdate = 2006-07-30\n | publisher = Cinemagine Media Ltd.\n}}\n</ref> The 2002 winner of the American Library Association's Alex Award [[Mel Odom (author)|Mel Odom]] reviewed the film and described Tasslehoff as \"a kleptomaniac\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last       = Odom\n |first      = Mel\n |date       = 2008-01-06\n |url        = http://blogcritics.org/archives/2008/01/06/1403522.php\n |title      = Movie Review: Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight\n |publisher  = blogcritics.org\n |accessdate = 2008-04-06\n}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nJason Heller, of [[The A.V.
