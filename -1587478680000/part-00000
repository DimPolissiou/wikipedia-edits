The normal definition of laity is that given in the [[Canon law#Catholic Church|Code of Canon Law]]:\n{{Quote|By divine institution, there are among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay persons.\n\nThere are members of the Christian faithful from both these groups who, through the profession of the evangelical counsels by means of vows or other sacred bonds recognized and sanctioned by the Church, are consecrated to God in their own special way and contribute to the salvific mission of the Church; although their state does not belong to the hierarchical structure of the Church, it nevertheless belongs to its life and holiness.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PT.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 207].

These faithful are by baptism made one body with Christ and are constituted among the People of God; they are in their own way made sharers in the priestly, prophetical, and kingly functions of Christ; and they carry out for their own part the mission of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the world.<ref name=LG31>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html '&#39;Lumen gentium'&#39;, 31].

Their role is to sanctify the created world by directing it to become more Christian in its structures and systems: \"the laity, by their very vocation, seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God\".<ref name=LG31/> The laity are full members of the Church, fully share in Church's purpose of sanctification, of \"inner union of men with God\",<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P27.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 775].

Due to their [[baptism]], they are members of God's family, the Church, and they grow in intimate union with God, \"in\" and \"by means\" of the world. It is not a matter of departing from the world as the monks and the nuns do that they sanctify themselves; it is precisely through the material world sanctified by the coming of the God made flesh, i.e. made material, that they reach God. Doctors, mothers of a family, farmers, bank tellers, drivers, by doing their jobs in the world with a Christian spirit are already extending the Kingdom of God. According to the repeated statements of Popes and lay Catholic leaders, the laity should say \"we are the Church,\" in the same way that the saints said that \"Christ lives in me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blessedsacramentregina.ca/non-integration-mass-ministries/|title=You are being redirected...|website=blessedsacramentregina.ca}}</ref>\n\nLay involvement takes diverse forms, including participation in the life of the parish, [[confraternity|confraternities]], [[lay apostolate]]s, [[secular institute]]s, and [[Roman Catholic lay ecclesial movement|lay ecclesial movements]]. There are also [[lay ecclesial ministry|lay ecclesiastical ministries]], and where there is a [[priest shortage]], lay people have to take on some functions previously performed by priests.\n\n====Vatican II afterwards====\n{{See also|Theology of Pope Francis#Clericalism}} \nIn December 1977, \"A Chicago Declaration of Christian Concern\" was published. The declaration looked back a decade to the Vatican Council II with appreciation for its \"compelling vision of lay Christians in society.\" As the Declaration interpreted it, the Council viewed the laity's \"special vocation\" as being the \"leaven\" for the \"sanctification of the world\" in their \"secular professions and occupations.\" However, lamented the Declaration, the Council's vision has \"all but vanished\" from the church.\n\nThe Declaration was signed by forty-seven clergy, religious, and laity that included men and women in many occupations, and it served as the charter for the National Center for the Laity (NCL).<ref name=\"catholiclabor.org\">http://www.catholiclabor.org/NCL%20Inititiative/A%20Chicago%20Declaration.pdf</ref> The NCL helps lay Catholics respond to their call to change the world through their daily activities and regular responsibilities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicreview.org/article/work/working-families/national-center-marks-30-years-of-helping-catholic-laity.|title=Catholic Review - Archdiocese of Baltimore|publisher=}}</ref> and it publishes a monthly online newsletter ''Initiatives: In Support of Christians in the World.''<ref>http://www.catholiclabor.org/NCL.htm.</ref>\n\n''Initiatives: In Support of Christians in the World'' (January 2015) rejoiced that \"50 Years since Vatican II\" the increased lay ministry in parishes has \"brought fresh vitality.\" However, the newsletter lamented \"the neglect of formation for the lay apostolate in the world.\" \n\nPope Francis is quoted as confirming this lament.

The ministry of the laity complements the ministry of the priest in their daily lives in their families, their communities, their work: \"in whatever circumstances they find themselves.\" The most important \"lay ministry\" can be done anonymously.

The \"daily ministry\" of the laity in their work, in their homes, and in their recreation remains hidden.

There are elected lay representatives on the [[Church of England#Structure|various governing bodies]] of churches in the Anglican communion. In the [[Church of England]], these governing bodies range from a local [[parochial church council]], through [[Deanery]] Synods and [[Diocesan Synod]]s. At the topmost level, the [[General Synod]] includes a house of Laity. Likewise, in the Episcopal Church in the USA, the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] includes four lay persons from each [[diocese]] in the House of Deputies, and each diocesan convention includes lay delegates from the parishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/pdf/CnC/CandC_2012pp1-10.pdf|title=Governance Documents of the Church - The Archives of the Episcopal Church|website=www.episcopalarchives.org}}</ref>  On the local [[parish]] level, lay persons are elected to a church council called a [[vestry]] which manages church finances and elects the parish [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]].\n\nParish musicians, bookkeepers, administrative assistants, [[sexton (office)|sexton]]s, [[sacristan]]s, etc., are all roles normally filled by lay persons. At higher levels, diocesan and national offices rely on lay persons in many important areas of responsibility. Often specialized ministries as campus ministers, youth ministers, or hospital chaplains are performed by lay persons.\n\nLay persons serve in worship services in a number of important positions, including [[verger]]s, [[acolyte]]s, [[lector]]s, [[intercessor]]s, [[church usher|usher]]s. Acolytes include [[torch]] bearers, [[crucifer]]s, [[thurifer]]s, and [[boat boy|boat bearer]]s. Lectors read the lessons from the Bible appointed for the day (except for the Gospel reading, which is read by a Deacon), and may also lead the Prayers of the People.\n\nSome specialized lay ministries require special licensing by the bishop: the ministries which require a license vary from province to province. In the Episcopal Church, there are six specialized lay ministries requiring a license: Pastoral Leader, Worship Leader, Preacher, Eucharistic Minister, Eucharistic Visitor, and Catechist.<ref>Canon 4, Title III, ''Constitution & Canons Together with the Rules of Order for the Government of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America'', Adopted and Revised in General Convention, 2006</ref>\n\n====Methodism====\n=====Lay servant ministry=====\n{{main|Methodist local preacher}}\nA very early tradition of preaching in the Wesleyan / Methodist churches was for a lay preacher to be appointed to lead services of worship and preach in a group (called a 'circuit') of meeting places or churches. The lay preacher walked or rode on horseback in a prescribed circuit of the preaching places according to an agreed pattern and timing, and people came to the meetings. After the appointment of ministers and pastors, this lay preaching tradition continued with [[Methodist local preacher|local preacher]]s being appointed by individual churches, and in turn approved and invited by nearby churches, as an adjunct to the minister or during their planned absences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/roots|title=Roots (1736\u20131816) \u2013 The United Methodist Church|first=United Methodist|last=Communications|website=The United Methodist Church}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Methodist Church]] recognizes two types of lay ministries. One is a \"lay servant ministry\" of (a) assisting or leading local church meetings and worship or of (b) serving as lay missioners to begin new work within the church that requires special training.<ref>[http://www.cokesbury.com/forms/DynamicContent.aspx?id=87&pageid=920 \"Lay Servant Ministry,\" Part VI, Ch 1, Sec XI, \u00b6\u00b6 266-271 of ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church, 2012'' (The United Methodist Publishing House, 2012).

Thus the [[Church of Scotland]] has \"Readers\", men and women set apart by [[presbyterian polity|presbyteries]] to conduct public worship.  This arises out of the belief in the [[priesthood of all believers]].  Ministers are officially 'teaching elders' alongside the 'ruling elders' of the [[Kirk Session]] and have equivalent status, regardless of any other office.  In the Church of Scotland, as the Established church in Scotland, this gives ruling elders in congregations the same status as Queen's chaplains, professors of theology and other highly qualified ministers.  All are humble servants of the people in the congregation and parish.\nMinisters are simply men and women whose gift is for their role in teaching and possibly pastoral work. They are thus selected for advanced theological education.  All elders (teaching and ruling) in meetings of Session, Presbytery, or Assembly are subject to the Moderator, who may or may not be a minister but is always an elder.\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n{{main|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}\nMany leaders in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] are lay ministers.  Essentially all male members above the age of 12 who are judged by church leaders to be in good standing are ordained to an office of the [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] and hold various positions in the church. Most church positions at the local level are unpaid, but the LDS church helps with the living expenses of top church leaders and some others (e.g. [[mission president]]s). Many top church leaders serve in these positions after long secular careers. With the exception of members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], the [[First Quorum of the Seventy]] who are at the top of the church hierarchy, and [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarchs]], all leadership positions are temporary.\n\n==Buddhist lay persons==\n{{main|Householder (Buddhism)}}\nIn [[Buddhism]], a layperson is known as an ''[[upasaka]]'' (masc.) or ''upasika'' (fem.).

His research participants were women and men in equal numbers, aged 20 to 60, from six denominations. Reber found that \"all were really interested to link faith with their daily life and work.\" However, in his survey, Reber found that little had been done in the six denominations to enable laity to make this link. He observed a \"preoccupation with activities inside the church,\" as well as a lack of literature and programs on the subject. For these reasons, attempts to link faith and daily life \"fizzled out.\"<ref>Robert E.

The normal definition of laity is that given in the [[Canon law#Catholic Church|Code of Canon Law]]:\n{{Quote|By divine institution, there are among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay persons.\n\nThere are members of the Christian faithful from both these groups who, through the profession of the evangelical counsels by means of vows or other sacred bonds recognized and sanctioned by the Church, are consecrated to God in their own special way and contribute to the salvific mission of the Church; although their state does not belong to the hierarchical structure of the Church, it nevertheless belongs to its life and holiness.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PT.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 207]. Vatican.va. Retrieved on 2013-12-15.</ref>}}\n\nThe narrower sense in which the Second Vatican Council gave instruction concerning the laity is as follows: \n{{Quote|The term laity is here understood to mean all the faithful except those in holy orders and those in the state of religious life specially approved by the Church. These faithful are by baptism made one body with Christ and are constituted among the People of God; they are in their own way made sharers in the priestly, prophetical, and kingly functions of Christ; and they carry out for their own part the mission of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the world.<ref name=LG31>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html '&#39;Lumen gentium'&#39;, 31]. Vatican.va. Retrieved on 2013-12-15.</ref>}}\n\nIn this narrower sense, the Council taught that the laity's specific character is secularity: they are Christians who live the life of Christ in the world. Their role is to sanctify the created world by directing it to become more Christian in its structures and systems: \"the laity, by their very vocation, seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them according to the plan of God\".<ref name=LG31/> The laity are full members of the Church, fully share in Church's purpose of sanctification, of \"inner union of men with God\",<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P27.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 775]. Vatican.va.</ref> acting with freedom and personal responsibility and not as mere agents of the hierarchy. Due to their [[baptism]], they are members of God's family, the Church, and they grow in intimate union with God, \"in\" and \"by means\" of the world. It is not a matter of departing from the world as the monks and the nuns do that they sanctify themselves; it is precisely through the material world sanctified by the coming of the God made flesh, i.e. made material, that they reach God. Doctors, mothers of a family, farmers, bank tellers, drivers, by doing their jobs in the world with a Christian spirit are already extending the Kingdom of God. According to the repeated statements of Popes and lay Catholic leaders, the laity should say \"we are the Church,\" in the same way that the saints said that \"Christ lives in me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blessedsacramentregina.ca/non-integration-mass-ministries/|title=You are being redirected...|website=blessedsacramentregina.ca}}</ref>\n\nLay involvement takes diverse forms, including participation in the life of the parish, [[confraternity|confraternities]], [[lay apostolate]]s, [[secular institute]]s, and [[Roman Catholic lay ecclesial movement|lay ecclesial movements]]. There are also [[lay ecclesial ministry|lay ecclesiastical ministries]], and where there is a [[priest shortage]], lay people have to take on some functions previously performed by priests.\n\n====Vatican II afterwards====\n{{See also|Theology of Pope Francis#Clericalism}} \nIn December 1977, \"A Chicago Declaration of Christian Concern\" was published. The declaration looked back a decade to the Vatican Council II with appreciation for its \"compelling vision of lay Christians in society.\" As the Declaration interpreted it, the Council viewed the laity's \"special vocation\" as being the \"leaven\" for the \"sanctification of the world\" in their \"secular professions and occupations.\" However, lamented the Declaration, the Council's vision has \"all but vanished\" from the church.\n\nThe Declaration was signed by forty-seven clergy, religious, and laity that included men and women in many occupations, and it served as the charter for the National Center for the Laity (NCL).<ref name=\"catholiclabor.org\">http://www.catholiclabor.org/NCL%20Inititiative/A%20Chicago%20Declaration.pdf</ref> The NCL helps lay Catholics respond to their call to change the world through their daily activities and regular responsibilities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicreview.org/article/work/working-families/national-center-marks-30-years-of-helping-catholic-laity.|title=Catholic Review - Archdiocese of Baltimore|publisher=}}</ref> and it publishes a monthly online newsletter ''Initiatives: In Support of Christians in the World.''<ref>http://www.catholiclabor.org/NCL.htm.</ref>\n\n''Initiatives: In Support of Christians in the World'' (January 2015) rejoiced that \"50 Years since Vatican II\" the increased lay ministry in parishes has \"brought fresh vitality.\" However, the newsletter lamented \"the neglect of formation for the lay apostolate in the world.\" \n\nPope Francis is quoted as confirming this lament.

The ministry of the laity complements the ministry of the priest in their daily lives in their families, their communities, their work: \"in whatever circumstances they find themselves.\" The most important \"lay ministry\" can be done anonymously.

The \"daily ministry\" of the laity in their work, in their homes, and in their recreation remains hidden.

There are elected lay representatives on the [[Church of England#Structure|various governing bodies]] of churches in the Anglican communion. In the [[Church of England]], these governing bodies range from a local [[parochial church council]], through [[Deanery]] Synods and [[Diocesan Synod]]s. At the topmost level, the [[General Synod]] includes a house of Laity. Likewise, in the Episcopal Church in the USA, the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] includes four lay persons from each [[diocese]] in the House of Deputies, and each diocesan convention includes lay delegates from the parishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/pdf/CnC/CandC_2012pp1-10.pdf|title=Governance Documents of the Church - The Archives of the Episcopal Church|website=www.episcopalarchives.org}}</ref>  On the local [[parish]] level, lay persons are elected to a church council called a [[vestry]] which manages church finances and elects the parish [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]].\n\nParish musicians, bookkeepers, administrative assistants, [[sexton (office)|sexton]]s, [[sacristan]]s, etc., are all roles normally filled by lay persons. At higher levels, diocesan and national offices rely on lay persons in many important areas of responsibility. Often specialized ministries as campus ministers, youth ministers, or hospital chaplains are performed by lay persons.\n\nLay persons serve in worship services in a number of important positions, including [[verger]]s, [[acolyte]]s, [[lector]]s, [[intercessor]]s, [[church usher|usher]]s. Acolytes include [[torch]] bearers, [[crucifer]]s, [[thurifer]]s, and [[boat boy|boat bearer]]s. Lectors read the lessons from the Bible appointed for the day (except for the Gospel reading, which is read by a Deacon), and may also lead the Prayers of the People.\n\nSome specialized lay ministries require special licensing by the bishop: the ministries which require a license vary from province to province. In the Episcopal Church, there are six specialized lay ministries requiring a license: Pastoral Leader, Worship Leader, Preacher, Eucharistic Minister, Eucharistic Visitor, and Catechist.<ref>Canon 4, Title III, ''Constitution & Canons Together with the Rules of Order for the Government of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America'', Adopted and Revised in General Convention, 2006</ref>\n\n====Methodism====\n=====Lay servant ministry=====\n{{main|Methodist local preacher}}\nA very early tradition of preaching in the Wesleyan / Methodist churches was for a lay preacher to be appointed to lead services of worship and preach in a group (called a 'circuit') of meeting places or churches. The lay preacher walked or rode on horseback in a prescribed circuit of the preaching places according to an agreed pattern and timing, and people came to the meetings. After the appointment of ministers and pastors, this lay preaching tradition continued with [[Methodist local preacher|local preacher]]s being appointed by individual churches, and in turn approved and invited by nearby churches, as an adjunct to the minister or during their planned absences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/who-we-are/roots|title=Roots (1736\u20131816) \u2013 The United Methodist Church|first=United Methodist|last=Communications|website=The United Methodist Church}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Methodist Church]] recognizes two types of lay ministries. One is a \"lay servant ministry\" of (a) assisting or leading local church meetings and worship or of (b) serving as lay missioners to begin new work within the church that requires special training.<ref>[http://www.cokesbury.com/forms/DynamicContent.aspx?id=87&pageid=920 \"Lay Servant Ministry,\" Part VI, Ch 1, Sec XI, \u00b6\u00b6 266-271 of ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church, 2012'' (The United Methodist Publishing House, 2012).

Online at cokesbury.com]</ref>\n\nIn addition to being appointed by members of their local churches, local and certified [[lay speaker]]s of the United Methodist Church (more commonly in the United States) attend a series of training sessions. These training sessions prepare the individual to become a leader within the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unyumc.org/pages/detail/1239|title=Certified Lay Minister|website=unyumc.org|accessdate=January 1, 2015|publisher=}}</ref> All individuals who are full members of the church are laity, but some go on to become Lay Speakers. Some preachers get their start as Lay Speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.methodist-e-academy.org/training|title=Methodist e-Academy - Training|website=www.methodist-e-academy.org}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Uniting Church in Australia]], that was constituted in part from the [[Methodist Church]], persons can be appointed by the congregation as a Lay Preacher or by the regional Presbytery to conduct [[Eucharist|Communion]].\n\nA well-known lay preacher was the late [[King of Tonga|King]] [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] of [[Tonga]].\n\nThe comparable term in the Anglican and Episcopal churches is ''[[lay reader]]''.\n\n=====Ministry of the laity=====\nThe Methodist ''Book of Discipline'' describes the \"Ministry of the Laity\" in their daily lives as being \"Christ-like examples of everyday living\" and \"sharing their own faith experiences.\"<ref>[http://www.cokesbury.com/forms/DynamicContent.aspx?id=87&pageid=920 \"The Ministry of All Christians,\" Part IV, Sec II, \u00b6 127, \"The Ministry of the Laity,\" 95 of ''The Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church, 2012'' (The United Methodist Publishing House, 2012). Online at cokesbury.com]</ref>\n\n=====Worship Leader=====\nIn the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]], a Worship Leader is a trained lay person appointed by a Church Council to \"take a leading and significant role in the conduct of worship within the life of a Local Church\".<ref>Constutitional Practice and Discipline of the Methodist Church, Book III: Standing Orders, section 68: Worship Leaders</ref>\n\n====Presbyterianism====\nPresbyterians do not use the term \"lay\".  Thus the [[Church of Scotland]] has \"Readers\", men and women set apart by [[presbyterian polity|presbyteries]] to conduct public worship.  This arises out of the belief in the [[priesthood of all believers]].  Ministers are officially 'teaching elders' alongside the 'ruling elders' of the [[Kirk Session]] and have equivalent status, regardless of any other office.  In the Church of Scotland, as the Established church in Scotland, this gives ruling elders in congregations the same status as Queen's chaplains, professors of theology and other highly qualified ministers.  All are humble servants of the people in the congregation and parish.\nMinisters are simply men and women whose gift is for their role in teaching and possibly pastoral work. They are thus selected for advanced theological education.  All elders (teaching and ruling) in meetings of Session, Presbytery, or Assembly are subject to the Moderator, who may or may not be a minister but is always an elder.\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n{{main|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}\nMany leaders in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] are lay ministers.  Essentially all male members above the age of 12 who are judged by church leaders to be in good standing are ordained to an office of the [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] and hold various positions in the church. Most church positions at the local level are unpaid, but the LDS church helps with the living expenses of top church leaders and some others (e.g. [[mission president]]s). Many top church leaders serve in these positions after long secular careers. With the exception of members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], the [[First Quorum of the Seventy]] who are at the top of the church hierarchy, and [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarchs]], all leadership positions are temporary.\n\n==Buddhist lay persons==\n{{main|Householder (Buddhism)}}\nIn [[Buddhism]], a layperson is known as an ''[[upasaka]]'' (masc.) or ''upasika'' (fem.). Buddhist laypeople [[Refuge (Buddhism)|take refuge]] in the [[Three Jewels|Triple Gem]] (the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], his [[Dharma|teaching]], and his [[Sangha (Buddhism)|community of noble disciples]]) and accept the [[Five Precepts]] (or the Eight Precepts) as rules for conduct.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090305011625/http://www.buddhanet.net/cmdsg/getting7.htm 7.

Its major proponents were all clergy: [[Washington Gladden]], [[Charles Monroe Sheldon]], and [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]. They were better in diagnosing society's ills than finding remedies.<ref>Ronald Cedric White, Charles Howard Hopkins, ''The Social Gospel: Religion and Reform in Changing America'' (Temple University, 1976). xviii.</ref> The Social Gospel reached its peak just prior to World War I, a war that contradicted its optimism about Christianizing society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvieweyes.org/strauss-docs.html|title=WorldViewEyes -> strauss-docs|website=www.worldvieweyes.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Social Gospel was promulgated by the preaching, writing, and other efforts of clergy on behalf of the laity rather than by the laity themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/38e.asp|title=Religious Revival: The \"Social Gospel\" [ushistory.org]|first=|last=ushistory.org|website=www.ushistory.org}}</ref> In the early 1930s, the Social Gospel was described as \"a preacher's gospel.

His research participants were women and men in equal numbers, aged 20 to 60, from six denominations. Reber found that \"all were really interested to link faith with their daily life and work.\" However, in his survey, Reber found that little had been done in the six denominations to enable laity to make this link. He observed a \"preoccupation with activities inside the church,\" as well as a lack of literature and programs on the subject. For these reasons, attempts to link faith and daily life \"fizzled out.\"<ref>Robert E. Reber, \"Vocation and Vision: a New Look at the Ministry of the Laity\" in ''Religious Education: the official journal of the Religious Education Association'', 83:3, 1988. 402-411.</ref>\n\nFor Miller, \"hindsight suggests that the institutional church and its leaders never fully embraced or understood lay ministry\". Therefore, they stopped promoting the \"ministry of the laity\" concept to their members.<ref>Donald W.

Platform 1 serves the Up & Down Morecambe line (which is in effect a long siding all the way to the terminus), whilst platform 2 handles trains on what is now the Up & Down Heysham line.  The latter is connected to the now-single track branch down to {{rws|Heysham Port}} at Holt Bank Junction (just outside Morecambe station), with the junction points operated from a ground frame worked by the train crew.  The two lines converge east of the station, but then immediately split into the single line curves toward {{rws|Hest Bank}} and towards Lancaster; the former sees only limited use, whereas the latter was double track until 1988 and is used by the vast majority of trains on the route.\n\nThis layout dates from the closure of the former terminus at {{rws|Morecambe Promenade}} and its associated signal box in February 1994, with Bare Lane signal box taking over control of all signalling on the line thereafter (other than that controlling the junctions with the main line at Hest Bank).  As mentioned above however, it was closed in December 2012. The structure remained intact for another year and had been used for several months by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] staff as a manned help point for travellers due to the absence of digital passenger information screens at the station.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.railscot.co.uk/img/43/836/| title=Photo of interior of decommissioned signal box in July 2013| website=Railscot| accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>  It was eventually demolished in January 2014 after the PIS screens were installed and finally brought into use.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.railscot.co.uk/img/46/50/| title=Bare Lane station on 22 January 2014 after demolition of the signal box| website=Railscot| accessdate=2014-01-23}}</ref>\n\nThe station is unstaffed and had no ticket facilities of any kind until recently - Northern has now installed one as part of a programme of station improvements in the area.
