The dragons are painted silver, with details of their wings and tongue picked out in red.  The dragon stands on one rear leg, the other lifted against a shield, with the right foreleg raised and the left foreleg holding a shield which bears the [[Coat of arms of the City of London|City of London's coat of arms]], painted in red and white. This stance is the equivalent of the [[rampant]] heraldic attitude of the [[supporters]] of the City's arms.\n\n==Design==\nThe design is based on two large dragon sculptures, {{convert|7|ft|cm}} high, which were mounted above the entrance to the [[Coal Exchange (London)|Coal Exchange]] on [[Lower Thames Street]], designed by the City Architect, [[James Bunstone Bunning|J. B. Bunning]], and made by the London founder [[Dewer]] in 1849.  The dragons were preserved when the Coal Exchange was demolished in 1962\u20133. The two original statues were re-erected on {{convert|6|ft|cm}} high plinths of [[Portland stone]] at the western boundary of the City, by [[Temple Gardens]] on [[Victoria Embankment]], in October 1963.\n\nThe [[Corporation of London]]'s Streets Committee selected the statues as the model for boundary markers for the city in 1964, in preference to the fiercer dragon by [[C.
