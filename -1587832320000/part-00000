It was an average season, with a total of 26 named storms, 13 typhoons, and six super typhoons. The season ran throughout 2016, though typically most tropical cyclones [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] between May and October. The season's first named storm, [[Typhoon Nepartak (2016)|Nepartak]], developed on July 3, while the season's last named storm, [[Typhoon Nock-ten|Nock-ten]], dissipated on December 28.\n\nThe development of Nepartak made the second-latest time within a season for the first named storm to develop and ended a 199-day period (from December 17, 2015 \u2013 July 3, 2016) during which no named storm was active in the basin. [[Tropical Storm Mirinae (2016)|Tropical Storm Mirinae]] reached peak intensity while making landfall over the [[Red River Delta]], causing very severe damage in Northern Vietnam. By the end of August, three storms had hit the Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], the most since 1951. In September, [[Typhoon Meranti (2016)|Typhoon Meranti]] reached peak intensity with a minimum pressure of 890 hPa, becoming one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. [[Typhoon Chaba (2016)|Typhoon Chaba]] became the strongest typhoon to strike [[South Korea]] since [[2012 Pacific typhoon season|2012]]. [[Tropical Storm Aere (2016)|Tropical Storm Aere]] and a [[November 2016 Vietnam tropical depression|tropical depression]] brought the worst flooding in [[Vietnam]] since 2011. The last storm of the season, [[Typhoon Nock-ten]], became the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide on [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) since at least 1960, in terms of 1-minute maximum sustained winds.\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the [[equator]] between [[100th meridian east|100\u00b0E]] and the [[180th meridian]]. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones, which often results in a storm having two names. The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]&nbsp;<small>(JMA)</small> will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind|sustained wind speeds]] of at least {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} anywhere in the basin, whilst the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]]&nbsp;<small>(PAGASA)</small> assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as tropical depressions in their area of responsibility, located between 115\u00b0E and 135\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N and 25\u00b0N, regardless of whether or not the tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions monitored by the United States' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]&nbsp;<small>(JTWC)</small> are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n!

season's late start, the 2016 season was a normal and active season with a total of 53 tropical depressions, of which 26 became tropical storms. After five months of inactivity, the first tropical depression developed on May 26, making it the fifth-latest season for a system to form. According to existing records only four other seasons started later\u2014the [[1973 Pacific typhoon season|1973]], [[1983 Pacific typhoon season|1983]], [[1984 Pacific typhoon season|1984]], and [[1998 Pacific typhoon season|1998]] seasons. Tropical activity throughout the basin became marginally favorable for development, and two tropical depressions developed during June. On July 3, Nepartak became the first named tropical storm, making it the second-latest first named storm on record. Nepartak's naming ended a 199-day period (from December 17, 2015 to July 2, 2016) during which no named storm was active within the basin; this period tied the 199-day period from December 22, 1997 to July 8, 1998.<ref name=record>{{cite web|title=Ranking of Typhoon Inactive Period (W.

It was an average season, with a total of 26 named storms, 13 typhoons, and six super typhoons. The season ran throughout 2016, though typically most tropical cyclones [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] between May and October. The season's first named storm, [[Typhoon Nepartak (2016)|Nepartak]], developed on July 3, while the season's last named storm, [[Typhoon Nock-ten|Nock-ten]], dissipated on December 28.\n\nThe development of Nepartak made the second-latest time within a season for the first named storm to develop and ended a 199-day period (from December 17, 2015 \u2013 July 3, 2016) during which no named storm was active in the basin. [[Tropical Storm Mirinae (2016)|Tropical Storm Mirinae]] reached peak intensity while making landfall over the [[Red River Delta]], causing very severe damage in Northern Vietnam. By the end of August, three storms had hit the Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], the most since 1951. In September, [[Typhoon Meranti (2016)|Typhoon Meranti]] reached peak intensity with a minimum pressure of 890 hPa, becoming one of the most intense tropical cyclones on record. [[Typhoon Chaba (2016)|Typhoon Chaba]] became the strongest typhoon to strike [[South Korea]] since [[2012 Pacific typhoon season|2012]]. [[Tropical Storm Aere (2016)|Tropical Storm Aere]] and a [[November 2016 Vietnam tropical depression|tropical depression]] brought the worst flooding in [[Vietnam]] since 2011. The last storm of the season, [[Typhoon Nock-ten]], became the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide on [[Christmas Day]] (December 25) since at least 1960, in terms of 1-minute maximum sustained winds.\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the [[equator]] between [[100th meridian east|100\u00b0E]] and the [[180th meridian]]. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones, which often results in a storm having two names. The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]&nbsp;<small>(JMA)</small> will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind|sustained wind speeds]] of at least {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} anywhere in the basin, whilst the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]]&nbsp;<small>(PAGASA)</small> assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as tropical depressions in their area of responsibility, located between 115\u00b0E and 135\u00b0E and between 5\u00b0N and 25\u00b0N, regardless of whether or not the tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions monitored by the United States' [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]&nbsp;<small>(JTWC)</small> are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n!

These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk&nbsp;<small>(TSR)</small> Consortium of [[University College London]], [[PAGASA]] and Taiwan's [[Central Weather Bureau]]. Some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the El Ni\u00f1o conditions that were observed during the previous year.

season's late start, the 2016 season was a normal and active season with a total of 53 tropical depressions, of which 26 became tropical storms. After five months of inactivity, the first tropical depression developed on May 26, making it the fifth-latest season for a system to form. According to existing records only four other seasons started later\u2014the [[1973 Pacific typhoon season|1973]], [[1983 Pacific typhoon season|1983]], [[1984 Pacific typhoon season|1984]], and [[1998 Pacific typhoon season|1998]] seasons. Tropical activity throughout the basin became marginally favorable for development, and two tropical depressions developed during June. On July 3, Nepartak became the first named tropical storm, making it the second-latest first named storm on record. Nepartak's naming ended a 199-day period (from December 17, 2015 to July 2, 2016) during which no named storm was active within the basin; this period tied the 199-day period from December 22, 1997 to July 8, 1998.<ref name=record>{{cite web|title=Ranking of Typhoon Inactive Period (W.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

[[Indiana University Press]]. p. 331.</ref> Breakfast also often consists of open sandwiches. The sandwich is spread with margarine, with toppings added such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

[[Whole-grain]] porridges with regular milk or butter are also eaten by some. More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

Hungarian breakfast is typically an [[open sandwich]] made with fresh bread or toast, butter, cheese or different cream cheeses, ''[[t\u00far\u00f3]]'' cheese or ''[[Liptauer|k\u00f6r\u00f6z\u00f6tt]]'' (Liptauer cheese spread), cold cuts such as ham, liver [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]] (called ''[[Braunschweiger (sausage)|m\u00e1jkr\u00e9m]]'', or ''[[Liverwurst|ken\u0151m\u00e1jas]]''), bacon, [[salami]], [[beef tongue]], [[mortadella]], ''[[Head cheese|diszn\u00f3sajt]]'' ([[head cheese]]), and different Hungarian sausages or [[kolb\u00e1sz]].<ref>Gundel's Hungarian Cookbook, Karoly Gundel, p. 34</ref> Eggs (fried, scrambled or boiled), [[French toast]] called ''bund\u00e1s keny\u00e9r'' and vegetables (such as peppers, bell peppers, tomatoes, radishes, scallions, and cucumber) may also form part of a Hungarian breakfast. Sometimes a simple breakfast will consist of a cup of milk, tea, or coffee taken with one or more pastries, bread rolls (including crescent-shaped [[kifli]]), toast, other pastries with different fillings (sweet and savory), butter, jam, or honey and a [[bun]] or a [[strudel]]<ref>J\u00f3zsef Venesz {{ISBN|963-13-0219-9}}: Corvina Press 1977.</ref> or cereal like [[muesli]], [[yogurt]], [[kefir]], and perhaps fruit.\n\n===Iceland===\nA typical Icelandic breakfast for children is oatmeal porridge.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Italy===\nThe traditional breakfast in [[Italy]] simply consists of a [[latte|caff\u00e8 latte]] (hot coffee with milk) with bread or rolls, butter and jam&nbsp;\u2013 known as ''prima colazione'' or just ''colazione''. ''Fette biscottate'' (a cookie-like hard bread often eaten with hazelnut chocolate spread or butter and jam) and [[biscuit|biscotti]] (cookies) are commonly eaten. Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with [[barley]] coffee, or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt, and fruit juices are also common. If breakfast is eaten in a ''bar'' (coffee shop), it is composed of ''cappuccino'' and ''cornetto'' (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry).<ref>The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\nTypical Latvian breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches with toppings made of vegetables, fish, eggs, or cheese. As in Finland they are often buttered with margarine. Curd mixed with vegetables and salt as well as other sour milk products are very popular as well. Very often light oat porridge is eaten too.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">And the New Scandinavian Cuisine Marcus Samuelsson {{ISBN|0618109412}}</ref> In general light, sour, and salty tasting food is common for morning meal. Latvians usually drink coffee for breakfast.\n\n===Malta===\nOn the island of [[Malta]], breakfast integrates both [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine|continental]] elements. Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]]. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: ''[[hagelslag]]'' (chocolate sprinkles), ''[[Vlokken|chocoladevlokken]]'' (chocolate flakes) (both typically Dutch), and ''chocoladepasta ''([[chocolate spread]]).<ref name=\"wintle\">{{cite book|last=Wintle|first=Michael|editor=Thomas M.

On special occasions, such as Easter, Christmas, Mother's Day etc., breakfast is usually the same, but with a wider range of choices (i.e. premium cheeses, special ham, hot buns, croissants etc.).\n\nA 2012 opinion poll concluded that the Dutch believe that breakfast should be a more important meal than it is and that more time should be spent on it; almost three-quarters of those polled ate their sandwiches in less than fifteen minutes, and blame for an all-too quick breakfast was placed on \"fast\" breakfast products. A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg. The poll also concluded that men are more interested than women in having breakfast with their partner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/lifestyle/2934751/nederland-wil-ontbijt-terug-kaart.html|title=Nederland wil ontbijt terug op de kaart|date=16 October 2012|publisher=[[Nu.nl]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Norway===\n80% of Norwegians eat breakfast (''frokost'') daily, mostly at home.

[[Whole-grain]] porridges with regular milk or butter are also eaten by some. More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. In recent years, Romanians have also started to serve cereal with dried fruits and milk instead of the traditional breakfast, though that is not yet very widespread.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stiripesurse.ro/micul-dejun-in-lume-unde-si-ce-se-mananca-dimineata_956272.html |location=Bucharest|work=\u0218tiri pe surse |title=Micul dejun \u00een lume - unde \u0219i ce se m\u0103n\u00e2nc\u0103 diminea\u021ba| date= 20 May 2015}}</ref> According to a 2014 study, 35% of Romanians eat cooked dishes such as omelet or fried eggs and 15% eat sandwiches.

In [[Madrid]], ''churros'' are somewhat smaller and shaped like a [[charity ribbon]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}} This meal is normally served in cafeter\u00edas but it is not a regular or usual breakfast at Madrid homes. The usual one is the same as in the rest of Spain: coffee with milk or [[Cola Cao]], orange juice, biscuits or toasts, with butter and jam.\n\nIn the North, East and West it is more common to have a cup of coffee (usually with milk) or [[Cola Cao]] and a toast with a choice of [[olive oil]] and salt, [[tomato]] and olive oil, [[butter]], jam, p\u00e2t\u00e9, ''[[jam\u00f3n serrano]]'' (cured ham), and other options like ''[[Sobrassada|sobrasada]]'' (a raw cured spiced sausage that is easy to spread),<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref> and in [[Andalucia]], ''[[pring\u00e1]]''. Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> \n\n==== Traditional ====\nThere are two different type of breakfasts: traditional and quick.

He was an articulate champion of the grievances and anger of Upper Canada (Ontario). He played a major role in securing national unity.  His career in active politics faltered after 1865, but he remained a powerful spokesman for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] promoting westward expansion and opposing the policies of Conservative Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\n==Biography==\nGeorge Brown was born in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]], Scotland, on November 29, 1818. His father, an evangelical Presbyterian, was committed to civil and religious liberty, progress, and laissez-faire economics. He was an enemy of Tory aristocratic privilege, and provided a good education for his son, who brought similar beliefs to the New World.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\n===New York City===\nThe family emigrated to New York in 1837, and began publishing newspapers.<ref name=\"DOCB\">{{ cite DCB |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brown_george_10E.html |title=BROWN, GEORGE |volume=10 |accessdate= September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBrown discovered he appreciated British parliamentarianism more than American republicanism. He visited Canada several times and was invited to move there in 1843 by Presbyterians.\n\n===Toronto===\n[[File:Toronto Globe 2 December, 1845.jpg|thumb|left|350px|December 99, 1845]]\n\nBrown began the Toronto ''Banner'' in 1843. It was a Presbyterian weekly supporting [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] principles and political reform. Brown's father raised the money and founded a weekly newspaper, ''The Globe'' in 1844, and later became a daily news source.  Filled with strong editorials on religious and political affairs, ''The Globe'' quickly became the leading Reform newspaper in the [[Province of Canada]].  In 1848, he was appointed to head a [[Royal Commission]] to examine  accusations of official misconduct in [[Kingston Penitentiary|Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada]] at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The \"Brown Report\", which Brown drafted early in 1849, included sufficient evidence of abuse to set in motion the termination of warden Henry Smith.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/> Brown's revelations of poor conditions at the Kingston penitentiary were heavily criticized by [[John A. Macdonald]] and contributed to the tense relationship between the two rival politicians.\n\n===Issues===\nBrown attacked slavery in the United States and in 1850, helped found the [[Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society of Canada]]. This society was founded to end the practice of slavery in [[North America]], and individual members aided former American slaves reach Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Anti-Slavery Society of Canada |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anti-slavery-society-of-canada |last=Baker |first=Nathan |date=February 13, 2018 |language=en |access-date=November 27, 2018 }}</ref> As a result, black Canadians enthusiastically supported Brown's political ambitions.\n\nCatholics, however, were another matter. He vehemently ridiculed and denounced the [[Catholic Church]], Jesuits, priests, nunneries, etc.  His newspaper promoted the strident speeches of ex-Catholic priest [[Alessandro Gavazzi]], which incited [[Gavazzi Riots|mob violence in 1853 with nine dead in Montreal.]]<ref>Careless, ''Brown of the Globe'' 1:172-74</ref>\n\nBrown was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1851. He reorganized the [[Clear Grits|Clear Grit]] ([[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]) Party in 1857, supporting, among other things, the [[separation of church and state]], the annexation of [[Rupert's Land]], and a small government. But the most important issue for George Brown was representation by population, where electoral districts would be divided so that each one contained a roughly equal number of electors.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\nFrom the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, the Canadian colonial legislature had been composed of an equal number of members from Canada East (Lower Canada, Quebec) and Canada West (Upper Canada, Ontario, Canada). In 1841, Francophone-dominated Lower Canada had a larger population, and the British colonial administration hoped that the [[Canadiens]] in Lower Canada would be legislatively pacified by a coalition of Loyalists from Lower Canada with the Upper Canadian side.  But during the 1840s and 1850s, as the population of Upper Canada grew larger than the Canadien population of Lower Canada, the opposite became true. Brown believed that the larger population deserved to have more representatives, rather than an equal number from Upper and Lower Canada. Brown's pursuit of this goal of righting what he perceived to be a great wrong to Canada West<ref>{{cite book |first=P.

Macdonald lost the support of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] on a non-confidence vote and his cabinet had to resign. After [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] declined the opportunity, George Brown attempted to form a ministry with [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. At the time, newly appointed ministers had to resign their seats and run in by-elections. When members of Brown's ministry resigned their seats to get re-elected, supporters of Macdonald called for a vote of non-confidence, which passed and thus forced Brown and his government to resign before they had re-taken their seats. Brown was the de facto premier of [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Province of Canada]] in 1858. The short-lived administration was called the Brown-Dorion government, named after the co-premiers George Brown and [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. This episode was termed the \"double shuffle.\"<ref name=\"Careless\">{{cite book|last1=Careless|first1=JMS|title=The Union of the he was dead by assasinationCanadas|url=https://archive.org/details/unionofcanadaoxf00jmsc|url-access=registration|date=1967|publisher=McClelland and Stewart Ltd|location=Toronto}}</ref>\n\n== Confederation ==\n[[Image:George Brown Monument, Queens Park, Toronto, Ontario.jpg|thumb|Monument to George Brown at Queen's Park, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, circa 1910]]\n\nGeorge Brown resigned from the [[Great Coalition|Coalition]] in 1865 because he was not happy with the United States.  Brown thought Canada should pursue free trade, while the conservative government of John A. Macdonald and Alexander Galt thought Canada should increase tariffs.\n\nDuring the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], Brown argued strongly in favour of an appointed [[Senate of Canada|Senate]].  Like many reformers of the time, he saw Upper Houses as inherently conservative in function, serving to protect the interests of the rich, and wished to deny the Senate the legitimacy and power that naturally follows with an electoral mandate.<ref>{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Moore |title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-5519-9483-3 |pp=107\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the Quebec Conference pleased Brown particularly by the prospect for the end of Lower Canadian interference in the affairs of Canada West.   \"Is it not wonderful?\" he wrote to his wife Anne after the Quebec Conference, \"French-Canadianism is entirely extinguished.\"<ref>Brown Papers, George Brown to Anne Brown, October 15, 1864.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |chapter=George Brown and the Mother of Confederation |title=Careless at Work: Selected Canadian historical studies |url={{google books|ezMooPjieAEC|plainurl=yes|page=77}} |publisher=Dundurn |location=Toronto |date=1996 |p=77 |isbn=978-1-4597-1340-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |first=J.M.S. |last=Careless |title=George Brown and the Mother of Confederation |publisher=Canadian Historical Association |conference=Report of the Annual Meeting |date=1960 |p=71}}</ref><ref name=Gwyn319>[[#Gwyn2009|Gwyn (2009)]], p. 319</ref>  By this he may have meant either that he was of the view that English-speaking Canada West had emerged triumphant over French Canadians<ref>[[#Waite2001|Waite (2001)]], p. 113</ref> or that Confederation would put an end to French Canadian domination of the affairs of what would become the province of Ontario.<ref name=Gwyn319/>\n\nBrown realized, nevertheless, that satisfaction for Canada West would not be achieved without the support of the French-speaking majority of Canada East.  In his speech in support of Confederation in the Legislature of the Province of Canada on February 8, 1865, in which he spoke glowingly of the prospects for Canada's future,<ref>[[#Waite2001|Waite (2001)]], p. 139</ref> Brown insisted that \"whether we ask for parliamentary reform for Canada alone or in union with the Maritime Provinces, the views of French Canadians must be consulted as well as ours.

As leader of the provincial [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]], he also ran for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. His intention was to become [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] but he failed to win election to either chamber. He was widely seen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]] in the [[1867 Canadian federal election|1867 federal election]]. The Liberals were officially leaderless until 1873, but Brown was considered the party's \"elder statesman\" even without a seat in the House of Commons, and was regularly consulted by leading Liberal parliamentarians. Brown was made a senator in 1873.<ref>{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Brown, George (1818-1880)|first=Edward Irving |last=Carlyle}}</ref>\n\n== Post-parliamentary career and death ==\n[[Image:Attempted Assassination of George Brown.jpg|thumb|right|Fatal shooting of George Brown, Toronto]]   Brown fought endless battles with the typographical union from 1843 to 1872.

Popular legend has it that Brown was rescued by Hubbard, but Hubbard stated he was not present at that event and that he only agreed to work for Brown as a favour to his brother, who operated the livery service.

He was an articulate champion of the grievances and anger of Upper Canada (Ontario). He played a major role in securing national unity.  His career in active politics faltered after 1865, but he remained a powerful spokesman for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] promoting westward expansion and opposing the policies of Conservative Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\n==Biography==\nGeorge Brown was born in [[Alloa]], [[Clackmannanshire]], Scotland, on November 29, 1818. His father, an evangelical Presbyterian, was committed to civil and religious liberty, progress, and laissez-faire economics. He was an enemy of Tory aristocratic privilege, and provided a good education for his son, who brought similar beliefs to the New World.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\n===New York City===\nThe family emigrated to New York in 1837, and began publishing newspapers.<ref name=\"DOCB\">{{ cite DCB |last=Careless |first=J.M.S. |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brown_george_10E.html |title=BROWN, GEORGE |volume=10 |accessdate= September 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBrown discovered he appreciated British parliamentarianism more than American republicanism. He visited Canada several times and was invited to move there in 1843 by Presbyterians.\n\n===Toronto===\n[[File:Toronto Globe 2 December, 1845.jpg|thumb|left|350px|December 99, 1845]]\n\nBrown began the Toronto ''Banner'' in 1843. It was a Presbyterian weekly supporting [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Kirk]] principles and political reform. Brown's father raised the money and founded a weekly newspaper, ''The Globe'' in 1844, and later became a daily news source.  Filled with strong editorials on religious and political affairs, ''The Globe'' quickly became the leading Reform newspaper in the [[Province of Canada]].  In 1848, he was appointed to head a [[Royal Commission]] to examine  accusations of official misconduct in [[Kingston Penitentiary|Provincial Penitentiary of the Province of Upper Canada]] at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. The \"Brown Report\", which Brown drafted early in 1849, included sufficient evidence of abuse to set in motion the termination of warden Henry Smith.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/> Brown's revelations of poor conditions at the Kingston penitentiary were heavily criticized by [[John A. Macdonald]] and contributed to the tense relationship between the two rival politicians.\n\n===Issues===\nBrown attacked slavery in the United States and in 1850, helped found the [[Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society of Canada]]. This society was founded to end the practice of slavery in [[North America]], and individual members aided former American slaves reach Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Anti-Slavery Society of Canada |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anti-slavery-society-of-canada |last=Baker |first=Nathan |date=February 13, 2018 |language=en |access-date=November 27, 2018 }}</ref> As a result, black Canadians enthusiastically supported Brown's political ambitions.\n\nCatholics, however, were another matter. He vehemently ridiculed and denounced the [[Catholic Church]], Jesuits, priests, nunneries, etc.  His newspaper promoted the strident speeches of ex-Catholic priest [[Alessandro Gavazzi]], which incited [[Gavazzi Riots|mob violence in 1853 with nine dead in Montreal.]]<ref>Careless, ''Brown of the Globe'' 1:172-74</ref>\n\nBrown was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1851. He reorganized the [[Clear Grits|Clear Grit]] ([[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]) Party in 1857, supporting, among other things, the [[separation of church and state]], the annexation of [[Rupert's Land]], and a small government. But the most important issue for George Brown was representation by population, where electoral districts would be divided so that each one contained a roughly equal number of electors.<ref name=\"DOCB\"/>\n\nFrom the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]] in 1840, the Canadian colonial legislature had been composed of an equal number of members from Canada East (Lower Canada, Quebec) and Canada West (Upper Canada, Ontario, Canada). In 1841, Francophone-dominated Lower Canada had a larger population, and the British colonial administration hoped that the [[Canadiens]] in Lower Canada would be legislatively pacified by a coalition of Loyalists from Lower Canada with the Upper Canadian side.  But during the 1840s and 1850s, as the population of Upper Canada grew larger than the Canadien population of Lower Canada, the opposite became true. Brown believed that the larger population deserved to have more representatives, rather than an equal number from Upper and Lower Canada.

Macdonald lost the support of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] on a non-confidence vote and his cabinet had to resign. After [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] declined the opportunity, George Brown attempted to form a ministry with [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]]. At the time, newly appointed ministers had to resign their seats and run in by-elections. When members of Brown's ministry resigned their seats to get re-elected, supporters of Macdonald called for a vote of non-confidence, which passed and thus forced Brown and his government to resign before they had re-taken their seats. Brown was the de facto premier of [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Province of Canada]] in 1858. The short-lived administration was called the Brown-Dorion government, named after the co-premiers George Brown and [[Antoine-Aim\u00e9 Dorion]].

As leader of the provincial [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberals]], he also ran for a seat in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. His intention was to become [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] but he failed to win election to either chamber. He was widely seen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]] in the [[1867 Canadian federal election|1867 federal election]]. The Liberals were officially leaderless until 1873, but Brown was considered the party's \"elder statesman\" even without a seat in the House of Commons, and was regularly consulted by leading Liberal parliamentarians.

His father was supervisor of excise at [[Oban]], and his mother the daughter of John Williams, author of the \u2018Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom.\u2019 He was thus a younger brother of [[John Anderson (genealogist, 1789-1832)]], the historian of the house of Hamilton. After receiving a good education in Edinburgh he became clerk to a [[Leith]] merchant, but subsequently entered a lawyer's office in Edinburgh. At an early period he began to contribute to the newspapers, and in 1830 published a volume of verse, entitled \u2018Poetical Aspirations,\u2019 which reached a second edition in 1833. This was followed by a volume of prose and verse, entitled \u2018Odd Sketches.\u2019 After a short residence in London in 1831 he obtained a situation on the \u2018Aberdeen Journal.\u2019\n\nIn 1836 he returned to London, where he formed a rather extensive literary connection, and in 1839 brought out the \u2018Gift of all Nations,\u2019 an annual which numbered among its contributors [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], [[Sheridan Knowles]], the [[Countess of Blessington]], and [[Miss Pardoe]]. In the same year he also published \u2018Landscape Lyrics,\u2019 which reached a second edition in 1854. In 1842 he became editor of the \u2018Western Watchman,\u2019 a weekly newspaper published at [[Ayr]]; in 1844 he was chosen subeditor of the \u2018[[Edinburgh Witness]],\u2019 which, although the articles of [[Hugh Miller]] had secured it a wide circulation, had hitherto been subedited in a very perfunctory manner; and in 1845 he became the chief subeditor of the \u2018[[Glasgow Daily Mail]],\u2019 the first daily newspaper published in Scotland.\n\nOn account of the serious effects on his health of severe night labour, he was two years afterwards compelled for a time to abandon literary work, and he never formed any subsequent connection with a newspaper. With the exception of a volume of \u2018Poems\u2019 published in 1845, and the \u2018Young Voyager,\u2019 1855, a poem descriptive of the search after Sir John Franklin, and intended for juvenile readers, the remaining works of Anderson are of the nature chiefly of popular compilations. They include an edition of the \u2018Works of Lord Byron,\u2019 with a life and notes, 1850; the \u2018Poems and Songs of R. Gilfillan,\u2019 with a memoir, 1851; and a \u2018Treasury\u2019 series, embracing the \u2018Treasury of Discovery,\u2019 1853; of the \u2018Animal World,\u2019 1854; of \u2018Manners,\u2019 1855; of \u2018History,\u2019 1856; and of \u2018Nature,\u2019 1857. Of a somewhat higher character than these compilations are the \u2018Scottish Nation,\u2019 1859\u201363, an expansion of his \u2018Popular Scottish Biography\u2019 published in 1842; and \u2018Genealogy and Surnames,\u2019 1865. The \u2018Scottish Nation,\u2019 though diffuse and ill arranged, displays great industry and a minute acquaintance with Scottish family history; while \u2018Genealogy and Surnames,\u2019 amid much that is commonplace, contains some curious information not easily accessible elsewhere.\n\nHe died suddenly at London 2 August 1866.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Anderson, William (1805-1866)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, William}}\n[[Category:1805 births]]\n[[Category:1866 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish people]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish writers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish poets]]\n[[Category:Scottish journalists]]\n[[Category:Scottish historians]]\n[[Category:19th-century British journalists]]\n[[Category:British male journalists]]\n[[Category:Male poets]]\n[[Category:19th-century British male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|other people of a similar name|William Anderson (disambiguation){{!}}William Anderson}}\n'''William Anderson''' (1805\u20131866) was a Scottish miscellaneous writer.\n\n==Biography==\nAnderson was born in Edinburgh 10 December 1805.

With the exception of a volume of \u2018Poems\u2019 published in 1845, and the \u2018Young Voyager,\u2019 1855, a poem descriptive of the search after Sir John Franklin, and intended for juvenile readers, the remaining works of Anderson are of the nature chiefly of popular compilations. They include an edition of the \u2018Works of Lord Byron,\u2019 with a life and notes, 1850; the \u2018Poems and Songs of R. Gilfillan,\u2019 with a memoir, 1851; and a \u2018Treasury\u2019 series, embracing the \u2018Treasury of Discovery,\u2019 1853; of the \u2018Animal World,\u2019 1854; of \u2018Manners,\u2019 1855; of \u2018History,\u2019 1856; and of \u2018Nature,\u2019 1857. Of a somewhat higher character than these compilations are the \u2018Scottish Nation,\u2019 1859\u201363, an expansion of his \u2018Popular Scottish Biography\u2019 published in 1842; and \u2018Genealogy and Surnames,\u2019 1865. The \u2018Scottish Nation,\u2019 though diffuse and ill arranged, displays great industry and a minute acquaintance with Scottish family history; while \u2018Genealogy and Surnames,\u2019 amid much that is commonplace, contains some curious information not easily accessible elsewhere.\n\nHe died suddenly at London 2 August 1866.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Anderson, William (1805-1866)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anderson, William}}\n[[Category:1805 births]]\n[[Category:1866 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish people]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish writers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:19th-century Scottish poets]]\n[[Category:Scottish journalists]]\n[[Category:Scottish historians]]\n[[Category:19th-century British journalists]]\n[[Category:British male journalists]]\n[[Category:Male poets]]\n[[Category:19th-century British male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Dthomsen8", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBiography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Anderson_(Scottish_writer)"}

Thought and Two Languages: The Impact of Bilingualism on Cognitive Development. Review of Research in Education. Vol. 10, pp. 23-54.</ref> helping not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math.  Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.\n\n==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2019}}\n\nAlthough significant differences between the definitions of second language and foreign language may be hard to find as the two terms are often taken as synonyms, research has been carried out to shed light on the differentiating traits of the two. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and TEFL (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows the attention different researchers have paid to the concepts of foreign language and second language.\n\nRichards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide the following information about second language:\n\n\"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's [[native language]] [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfills many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home).\"\n\nThey also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).\n\nCrystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).\n\nStern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after [[World War II]] in international organisations, such as [[UNESCO]], in order to meet [[nationalist]] susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.\n\nFasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.\n\nSo, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).\n\nA 'second language' usually has [[official language|official status]] or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, [[Persian language|Persian]] is a second language for [[Kurdish people]], but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian person]] goes to [[United States]], then English becomes a second language for them. Thus, British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language, and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. Meanwhile, people in Kurdistan can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.\n\nThe purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.\n\nThere are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. They can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.\n\nSecond language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.\n\n[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.\n\nThe major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:\n\n# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.\n# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.\n# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.\n# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.\n# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.\n\nThere are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.\n\n===Acquisition versus learning===\nThere is often a distinction between [[language acquisition|acquisition]] and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught, and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.\n\nThe distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.\n\nNevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the US]] can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[First language]]\n* [[Foreign language influences in English]]\n* [[Fremdsprachen und Hochschule]]\n* [[International auxiliary language]]\n* [[Language education]]\n* [[Language exchange]]\n* [[Language Resource Center]]\n* [[Language school]]\n* [[Learning by teaching]]\n* [[Multilingualism]]\n* [[Official language]]\n* [[Second language]]\n* [[Teaching English as a foreign language]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bailey, David. \"The Secret to Learning a Foreign Language as an Adult. \" Time.

Studies show that a person that is bilingual or multilingual, can make a greater salary than a computer programmer or engineer because they can use their abilities in foreign language to obtain success in a wide range of career paths. Also due to the increase of international population, a multilingual person can easily communicate and translate to perspective viewers.\n\nAlso in 2004, a study by [[University College London]] (UCL) examined the brains of 105 people who could speak more than one language.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Learning languages 'boosts brain'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126220802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|archivedate=2017-01-26|date=2004-10-13}}</ref> The study found that people who learned a second language when younger had denser [[grey matter]] than those who learned one later.<ref name=\":0\" /> Grey matter is an area of the brain where information is most efficiently processed, due to the function of specific nerve cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Helen|date=2004-07-21|title=Grey matter matters for intellect|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news040719-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217224556/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|archivedate=2017-02-17}}</ref>\n\nA series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|title=Thinking in a Foreign Language Makes Decisions More Rational|last=Keim|first=Brandon|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001301/https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|archivedate=2017-11-17}}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that early exposure to a second language increases divergent thinking strategies,<ref>Rafael Diaz (1983). Thought and Two Languages: The Impact of Bilingualism on Cognitive Development. Review of Research in Education. Vol. 10, pp. 23-54.</ref> helping not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math.  Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.\n\n==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2019}}\n\nAlthough significant differences between the definitions of second language and foreign language may be hard to find as the two terms are often taken as synonyms, research has been carried out to shed light on the differentiating traits of the two. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and TEFL (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows the attention different researchers have paid to the concepts of foreign language and second language.\n\nRichards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide the following information about second language:\n\n\"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's [[native language]] [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfills many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home).\"\n\nThey also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).\n\nCrystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).\n\nStern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after [[World War II]] in international organisations, such as [[UNESCO]], in order to meet [[nationalist]] susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.\n\nFasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.\n\nSo, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).\n\nA 'second language' usually has [[official language|official status]] or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, [[Persian language|Persian]] is a second language for [[Kurdish people]], but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian person]] goes to [[United States]], then English becomes a second language for him. Thus, British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language, and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. Meanwhile, people in Kurdistan can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.\n\nThe purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.\n\nThere are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. He or she can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.\n\nSecond language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.\n\n[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.\n\nThe major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:\n\n# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.\n# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.\n# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.\n# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.\n# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.\n\nThere are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.\n\n===Acquisition versus learning===\nThere is often a distinction between [[language acquisition|acquisition]] and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught, and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.\n\nThe distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.\n\nNevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the US]] can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[First language]]\n* [[Foreign language influences in English]]\n* [[Fremdsprachen und Hochschule]]\n* [[International auxiliary language]]\n* [[Language education]]\n* [[Language exchange]]\n* [[Language Resource Center]]\n* [[Language school]]\n* [[Learning by teaching]]\n* [[Multilingualism]]\n* [[Official language]]\n* [[Second language]]\n* [[Teaching English as a foreign language]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bailey, David. \"The Secret to Learning a Foreign Language as an Adult. \" Time.
