Born in [[Brussels]] as the second but eldest surviving son of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] and [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]], he succeeded his father to the Belgian throne in 1865 and reigned for 44 years until his death \u2013 the longest reign of any Belgian monarch. He died without surviving sons. The current Belgian king descends from his nephew and successor, [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]].\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]], a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, the present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. Leopold ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using the mercenary [[Force Publique]] for his personal gain. He extracted a fortune from the territory, initially by the collection of [[ivory]], and after a rise in the price of [[rubber]] in the 1890s, by forced labour from the native population to harvest and process rubber. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium.\n\nLeopold's administration of the Congo was characterised by murder, torture, and [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|atrocities]], resulting from notorious systematic brutality. The hands of men, women, and children were amputated when the quota of rubber was not met. These and other facts were established at the time by eyewitness testimony and on-site inspection by an international Commission of Inquiry (1904). Millions of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] people died: modern estimates range from 1 million to 15 million deaths, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Some historians argue against this figure, citing the absence of reliable censuses, the enormous mortality of diseases such as [[smallpox]] or [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and the fact that there were only 175 administrative agents in charge of [[rubber]] exploitation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CRITIQUE DU LIVRE DE HOCHSCHILD |url=http://www.urome.be/fr2/ouvrag/hochschild.pdf |author= Jean Stengers|language=French}}</ref><ref name=\"Sophie Mignon\">{{Cite web |title=Non, L\u00e9opold II n'est pas un g\u00e9nocidaire!|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/opinions/non-leopold-ii-n-est-pas-un-genocidaire-567922033570ed3894b6608a |author= Sophie Mignon|language=french}}</ref>  In 1908, the reports of deaths and abuse induced the Belgian government to take over the administration of the Congo from Leopold. This meant that for people who are smart enough to do their own research they can fully understand what ahe was and how he deserves to be remembered as someone who caused a genocide and not the goddamn builder king like ffs\n\n==Early life==\nLeopold was born in [[Brussels]] on 9 April 1835, the second child of the reigning Belgian monarch, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], and of his second wife, [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans|Louise]], the daughter of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]] of [[France]]. The [[French Revolution of 1848]] forced Louis Philippe to flee to the [[United Kingdom]]. The British monarch, [[Queen Victoria]], was Leopold II's first cousin, as Leopold's father and Victoria's mother were siblings. Louis Philippe died two years later, in 1850. Leopold's fragile mother was deeply affected by the death of her father, and her health deteriorated. She died of [[tuberculosis]] that same year, when Leopold was 15 years old.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Leopold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant; Nicaise de Keyser.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Leopold as a younger man in the uniform of the [[Grenadier]]s (Portrait by [[Nicaise de Keyser]])]]\n\nOn 22 August 1853, at the age of 18, he married [[Marie Henriette of Austria]] in Brussels. Marie Henriette was a cousin of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and granddaughter of [[Emperor Leopold II]]. Marie Henriette was lively and energetic, and endeared herself to the people by her character and benevolence, and her beauty gained for her the [[sobriquet]] of \"The Rose of Brabant\". She was also an accomplished artist and musician.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Leopold II., King of the Belgians|volume=16|page=461}}</ref> She was passionate about [[horseback riding]] to the point that she would care for her horses personally. Some joked about this \"marriage of a [[hostler|stableman]] and a [[nun]]\",<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab mariage d'un palefrenier et d'une religieuse \u00bb</ref> the shy and withdrawn Leopold referred to as the nun.\n\nFour children were born of this marriage, three daughters and one son, also named [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant|Leopold]]. The younger Leopold died in 1869 at the age of nine from [[pneumonia]] after falling into a pond. His death was a source of great sorrow for King Leopold. The marriage became unhappy, and the couple separated completely after a last attempt to have another son, a union that resulted in the birth of their last daughter Clementine. Marie Henriette retreated to [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] in 1895, and died there in 1902.<ref name=monarchie/>\n\n[[File:Your Majesty! at your age....jpg|thumb|A [[political cartoon]] pillorying Leopold's love affair with Caroline Lacroix. <br />\n'''''The Abbot:''''' Oh! Sire, at your age?<br />\n'''''The King:''''' You should try it for yourself!]]\n\nLeopold had many mistresses. In 1899, in his sixty-fifth year, Leopold took as a mistress [[Caroline Lacroix]], a sixteen-year-old French prostitute, and they remained together for the next decade until his death. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Owing to these gifts and the unofficial nature of their relationship, Caroline was deeply unpopular among the Belgian people and internationally. She and Leopold married secretly in a religious ceremony five days before his death. Their failure to perform a [[civil ceremony]] rendered the marriage invalid under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline a large fortune, which the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters tried to seize as rightfully theirs. Caroline bore two sons who were probably Leopold's; the boys would have had a strong claim to the throne had the marriage been valid.\n\n==Early political career==\n[[File:Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); kroonprins en hertog van Brabant, later koning Leopold II der Belgen, Granzella, Felixarchief, 12 12732.jpg|thumb|Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); crown prince and duke of Brabant, later King Leopold II of the Belgians, Granzella, collection Felixarchief]]\nAs Leopold's older brother, also named [[Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium|Louis Philippe]], had died the year before Leopold's birth, Leopold was heir to the throne from his birth. When he was 9 years old, Leopold received the title of [[Duke of Brabant]], and was appointed a sub-lieutenant in [[Belgian Armed Forces|the army]]. He served in the army until his accession in 1865, by which time he had reached the rank of lieutenant-general.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nLeopold's public career began on his attaining the age of majority in 1855, when he became a member of the [[Senate (Belgium)|Belgian Senate]]. He took an active interest in the senate, especially in matters concerning the development of Belgium and its trade,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and began to urge Belgium's acquisition of colonies. Leopold traveled extensively abroad from 1854 to 1865, visiting [[India]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], and the countries on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[Africa]]. His father died on December 10, 1865, and Leopold took the oath of office on December 17, in his thirtieth year.<ref name=monarchie>{{cite web|title=Leopold II|url=http://www.monarchie.be/history/leopold-ii|publisher=[[Monarchy of Belgium|The Belgian Monarchy]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic reign==\n[[File:Prestation de serment de L\u00e9opold II le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Leopold II at his accession to the throne]]\nLeopold became king in 1865. He explained his goal for his reign in an 1888 letter addressed to his brother, [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]]: \"the country must be strong, prosperous, therefore have colonies of her own, beautiful and calm.\"<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab la patrie doit \u00eatre forte, prosp\u00e8re, par cons\u00e9quent poss\u00e9der des d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s \u00e0 elle, belle et calme. \u00bb ''The King to the Count of Flanders'', January 26, 1888; The Count of Flanders's papers.</ref>\n\nLeopold's reign was marked by a number of major political developments. The [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] governed Belgium from 1857 to 1880, and during its final year in power legislated the [[Walth\u00e8re Fr\u00e8re-Orban|Fr\u00e8re-Orban]] Law of 1879. This law created free, secular, compulsory primary schools supported by the state and withdrew all state support from [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] primary schools. The [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] obtained a parliamentary majority in 1880, and four years later restored state support to Catholic schools. In 1885, various socialist and social democratic groups drew together and formed the [[Belgian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Increasing social unrest and the rise of the Labour Party forced the adoption of universal male [[suffrage]] in 1893.\n\nDuring Leopold's reign other social changes were enacted into law. Among these were the right of workers to form [[labour union]]s and the abolition of the ''livret d'ouvrier'', an [[employment record book]]. Laws against child labour were passed. Children younger than 12 were not allowed to work in factories, children younger than 16 were not allowed to work at night, and women younger than 21 years old were not allowed to work underground. Workers gained the right to be compensated for workplace accidents, and were given Sundays off.\n\nThe first revision of the [[Belgian constitution]] came in 1893. [[Universal male suffrage]] was introduced, though the effect of this was tempered by [[plural voting]]. The eligibility requirements for [[senate (Belgium)|the senate]] were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of [[proportional representation]], which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his [[veto]] according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected [[government]]. Leopold was so disappointed that he considered [[abdication]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Stengers |title=L'action du Roi en Belgique depuis 1831: pouvoir et influence |trans-title=The action of the King in Belgium since 1831: power and influence |language=French |edition=3rd |publisher=Racine |location=Brussels |year=2008 |pages=123\u20134 |isbn=978-2-87386-567-2}}</ref>\n\nLeopold emphasized military defence as the basis of neutrality, and strove to make Belgium less vulnerable militarily. He achieved the construction of defensive fortresses [[Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge|at Li\u00e8ge]], [[Fortified Position of Namur|at Namur]] and [[National redoubt of Belgium|at Antwerp]]. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he managed to preserve Belgium's neutrality in a period of unusual difficulty and danger.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> Leopold pushed for a reform in military service, but he was unable to obtain one until he was on his deathbed. Under the old system of ''[[Remplacement]]'', the Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service. This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would have to serve in the military.\n\n===Builder King===\n[[File:Brussels Cinquantenaire R02.jpg|thumb|left|The [[triumphal arch]] of the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' complex in [[Brussels]]]]\n\nLeopold commissioned a great number of buildings, urban projects and public works, largely with the profits generated from exploitation of natural resources and the population of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. These projects earned him the epithet of \"Builder King\" (''Koning-Bouwheer'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''le Roi-B\u00e2tisseur'' in [[French language|French]]). The public buildings were mainly in [[Brussels]], [[Ostend]] and [[Antwerp]], and include the [[Hippodrome Wellington]] racetrack, the [[Royal Galleries of Ostend|Royal Galleries]] and Maria Hendrikapark in [[Ostend]]; the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] and its surrounding park in [[Tervuren]]; the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' park, triumphal arch and complex, and the [[Duden Park]] in Brussels, and the 1895-1905 [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station]].\n\nIn addition to his public works, he acquired and built numerous private properties for himself inside and outside Belgium. He expanded the grounds of the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], and built the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken|Royal Greenhouses]], the Japanese Tower and the Chinese Pavilion near the palace. In the [[Ardennes]], his domains consisted of {{convert|6700|ha|-3}} of forests and agricultural lands and the [[ch\u00e2teaux]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau royal d'Ardenne|Ardenne]], [[Ciergnon Castle|Ciergnon]], Fenffe, Villers-sur-Lesse and Ferage. He also built important [[country estate]]s on the [[French Riviera]], including the ''[[Jardin botanique \"Les C\u00e8dres\"|Villa des C\u00e8dres]]'' and its [[botanical garden]], and the [[Villa Leopolda]].\n\nThinking of the future after his death, Leopold did not want the collection of estates, lands and heritage buildings he had privately amassed to be scattered amongst his daughters, each of whom was married to a foreign prince. In 1900, he created the [[Royal Trust (Belgium)|Royal Trust]], by means of which he donated most of his property to the Belgian nation. This preserved them to beautify Belgium in perpetuity, while still allowing future generations of the Belgian Royal family the privilege of their use.\n\n===Attempted assassination===\nOn 15 November 1902, Italian [[anarchist]] [[Gennaro Rubino]] attempted to [[regicide|assassinate]] Leopold, who was riding in a royal cortege from a ceremony at Saint-Gudule Cathedral in memory of his recently deceased wife, [[Marie Henriette of Austria|Marie Henriette]]. After Leopold's carriage passed, Rubino fired three shots at the procession. The shots missed Leopold but almost killed the king's [[Grand Marshall]], Count Charles John d'Oultremont. Rubino was immediately arrested and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1918.\n\nThe king replied after the attack to a senator: \"My dear senator, if fate wants me shot, too bad!\" (\"Mon cher Senateur, si la fatalite veut que je sois atteint, tant pis\"!)<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\">Meuse (La) 17-11-1902</ref>\nAfter the failed [[regicide]] the security of the king was questioned, because the glass of the landaus was 2&nbsp;cm thick. Elsewhere in Europe, the news of this assassination attempt was received with alarm. Heads of state and the pope sent telegrams to the king congratulating him for surviving the assassination attempt. Many people remembered the earlier assassinations of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]] by other Italian anarchists.\n\nThe Belgians rejoiced that the king was safe. Later in the day, in the [[Theatre Royal de la Monnaie]] before ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' was performed, the orchestra played the [[Braban\u00e7onne]], which was sung loudly and ended with loud cheers and applause.<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\"/>\n\n==Congo Free State==\n[[File:kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|Map of the Congo Free State, c. 1890]]\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]] and all its people, a private project undertaken on his own behalf.<ref name=ewans>{{cite book|last1=Ewans|first1=Sir Martin|title=European Atrocity, African Catastrophe: Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its Aftermath|date=2017|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, England|doi=10.4324/9781315829173|isbn=9781317849070|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|136}} He used explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands.\n\nHe used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death.\n\nLeopold extracted a fortune from the Congo, initially by the collection of [[ivory]], and after a rise in the price of rubber in the 1890s, by forced labour from the natives to harvest and process rubber.

Leopold eventually began to acquire a colony as a private citizen. The Belgian government lent him money for this venture.\n\nIn 1866, Leopold instructed the Belgian ambassador in Madrid to speak to Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] about ceding the [[Philippines]] to Belgium.

The second, a much smaller force of 800, was led by [[Louis-Napol\u00e9on Chaltin]] and took the main road towards Rejaf.

At first, ivory was exported, but this did not yield the expected levels of revenue. When the global demand for rubber exploded, attention shifted to the labor-intensive collection of sap from rubber plants. Abandoning the promises of the [[Berlin Conference]] in the late 1890s, the Free State government restricted foreign access and extorted [[forced labor]] from the natives.

Born in [[Brussels]] as the second but eldest surviving son of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] and [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]], he succeeded his father to the Belgian throne in 1865 and reigned for 44 years until his death \u2013 the longest reign of any Belgian monarch. He died without surviving sons. The current Belgian king descends from his nephew and successor, [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I]].\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]], a private project undertaken on his own behalf. He used [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, the present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. Leopold ignored these conditions and ran the Congo using the mercenary [[Force Publique]] for his personal gain. He extracted a fortune from the territory, initially by the collection of [[ivory]], and after a rise in the price of [[rubber]] in the 1890s, by forced labour from the native population to harvest and process rubber. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium.\n\nLeopold's administration of the Congo was characterised by murder, torture, and [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|atrocities]], resulting from notorious systematic brutality. The hands of men, women, and children were amputated when the quota of rubber was not met. These and other facts were established at the time by eyewitness testimony and on-site inspection by an international Commission of Inquiry (1904). Millions of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] people died: modern estimates range from 1 million to 15 million deaths, with a consensus growing around 10 million. Some historians argue against this figure, citing the absence of reliable censuses, the enormous mortality of diseases such as [[smallpox]] or [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and the fact that there were only 175 administrative agents in charge of [[rubber]] exploitation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CRITIQUE DU LIVRE DE HOCHSCHILD |url=http://www.urome.be/fr2/ouvrag/hochschild.pdf |author= Jean Stengers|language=French}}</ref><ref name=\"Sophie Mignon\">{{Cite web |title=Non, L\u00e9opold II n'est pas un g\u00e9nocidaire!|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/opinions/non-leopold-ii-n-est-pas-un-genocidaire-567922033570ed3894b6608a |author= Sophie Mignon|language=french}}</ref>  In 1908, the reports of deaths and abuse induced the Belgian government to take over the administration of the Congo from Leopold.\n\n==Early life==\nLeopold was born in [[Brussels]] on 9 April 1835, the second child of the reigning Belgian monarch, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], and of his second wife, [[Louise of Orl\u00e9ans|Louise]], the daughter of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis Philippe]] of [[France]]. The [[French Revolution of 1848]] forced Louis Philippe to flee to the [[United Kingdom]]. The British monarch, [[Queen Victoria]], was Leopold II's first cousin, as Leopold's father and Victoria's mother were siblings. Louis Philippe died two years later, in 1850. Leopold's fragile mother was deeply affected by the death of her father, and her health deteriorated. She died of [[tuberculosis]] that same year, when Leopold was 15 years old.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Leopold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant; Nicaise de Keyser.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Leopold as a younger man in the uniform of the [[Grenadier]]s (Portrait by [[Nicaise de Keyser]])]]\n\nOn 22 August 1853, at the age of 18, he married [[Marie Henriette of Austria]] in Brussels. Marie Henriette was a cousin of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and granddaughter of [[Emperor Leopold II]]. Marie Henriette was lively and energetic, and endeared herself to the people by her character and benevolence, and her beauty gained for her the [[sobriquet]] of \"The Rose of Brabant\". She was also an accomplished artist and musician.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Leopold II., King of the Belgians|volume=16|page=461}}</ref> She was passionate about [[horseback riding]] to the point that she would care for her horses personally. Some joked about this \"marriage of a [[hostler|stableman]] and a [[nun]]\",<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab mariage d'un palefrenier et d'une religieuse \u00bb</ref> the shy and withdrawn Leopold referred to as the nun.\n\nFour children were born of this marriage, three daughters and one son, also named [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant|Leopold]]. The younger Leopold died in 1869 at the age of nine from [[pneumonia]] after falling into a pond. His death was a source of great sorrow for King Leopold. The marriage became unhappy, and the couple separated completely after a last attempt to have another son, a union that resulted in the birth of their last daughter Clementine. Marie Henriette retreated to [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]] in 1895, and died there in 1902.<ref name=monarchie/>\n\n[[File:Your Majesty! at your age....jpg|thumb|A [[political cartoon]] pillorying Leopold's love affair with Caroline Lacroix. <br />\n'''''The Abbot:''''' Oh! Sire, at your age?<br />\n'''''The King:''''' You should try it for yourself!]]\n\nLeopold had many mistresses. In 1899, in his sixty-fifth year, Leopold took as a mistress [[Caroline Lacroix]], a sixteen-year-old French prostitute, and they remained together for the next decade until his death. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. Owing to these gifts and the unofficial nature of their relationship, Caroline was deeply unpopular among the Belgian people and internationally. She and Leopold married secretly in a religious ceremony five days before his death. Their failure to perform a [[civil ceremony]] rendered the marriage invalid under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline a large fortune, which the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters tried to seize as rightfully theirs. Caroline bore two sons who were probably Leopold's; the boys would have had a strong claim to the throne had the marriage been valid.\n\n==Early political career==\n[[File:Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); kroonprins en hertog van Brabant, later koning Leopold II der Belgen, Granzella, Felixarchief, 12 12732.jpg|thumb|Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835-1909); crown prince and duke of Brabant, later King Leopold II of the Belgians, Granzella, collection Felixarchief]]\nAs Leopold's older brother, also named [[Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium|Louis Philippe]], had died the year before Leopold's birth, Leopold was heir to the throne from his birth. When he was 9 years old, Leopold received the title of [[Duke of Brabant]], and was appointed a sub-lieutenant in [[Belgian Armed Forces|the army]]. He served in the army until his accession in 1865, by which time he had reached the rank of lieutenant-general.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nLeopold's public career began on his attaining the age of majority in 1855, when he became a member of the [[Senate (Belgium)|Belgian Senate]]. He took an active interest in the senate, especially in matters concerning the development of Belgium and its trade,<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and began to urge Belgium's acquisition of colonies. Leopold traveled extensively abroad from 1854 to 1865, visiting [[India]], [[China]], [[Egypt]], and the countries on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[Africa]]. His father died on December 10, 1865, and Leopold took the oath of office on December 17, in his thirtieth year.<ref name=monarchie>{{cite web|title=Leopold II|url=http://www.monarchie.be/history/leopold-ii|publisher=[[Monarchy of Belgium|The Belgian Monarchy]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic reign==\n[[File:Prestation de serment de L\u00e9opold II le 17 d\u00e9cembre 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Leopold II at his accession to the throne]]\nLeopold became king in 1865. He explained his goal for his reign in an 1888 letter addressed to his brother, [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]]: \"the country must be strong, prosperous, therefore have colonies of her own, beautiful and calm.\"<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \u00ab la patrie doit \u00eatre forte, prosp\u00e8re, par cons\u00e9quent poss\u00e9der des d\u00e9bouch\u00e9s \u00e0 elle, belle et calme. \u00bb ''The King to the Count of Flanders'', January 26, 1888; The Count of Flanders's papers.</ref>\n\nLeopold's reign was marked by a number of major political developments. The [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] governed Belgium from 1857 to 1880, and during its final year in power legislated the [[Walth\u00e8re Fr\u00e8re-Orban|Fr\u00e8re-Orban]] Law of 1879. This law created free, secular, compulsory primary schools supported by the state and withdrew all state support from [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] primary schools. The [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] obtained a parliamentary majority in 1880, and four years later restored state support to Catholic schools. In 1885, various socialist and social democratic groups drew together and formed the [[Belgian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. Increasing social unrest and the rise of the Labour Party forced the adoption of universal male [[suffrage]] in 1893.\n\nDuring Leopold's reign other social changes were enacted into law. Among these were the right of workers to form [[labour union]]s and the abolition of the ''livret d'ouvrier'', an [[employment record book]]. Laws against child labour were passed. Children younger than 12 were not allowed to work in factories, children younger than 16 were not allowed to work at night, and women younger than 21 years old were not allowed to work underground. Workers gained the right to be compensated for workplace accidents, and were given Sundays off.\n\nThe first revision of the [[Belgian constitution]] came in 1893. [[Universal male suffrage]] was introduced, though the effect of this was tempered by [[plural voting]]. The eligibility requirements for [[senate (Belgium)|the senate]] were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of [[proportional representation]], which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his [[veto]] according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected [[government]]. Leopold was so disappointed that he considered [[abdication]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Stengers |title=L'action du Roi en Belgique depuis 1831: pouvoir et influence |trans-title=The action of the King in Belgium since 1831: power and influence |language=French |edition=3rd |publisher=Racine |location=Brussels |year=2008 |pages=123\u20134 |isbn=978-2-87386-567-2}}</ref>\n\nLeopold emphasized military defence as the basis of neutrality, and strove to make Belgium less vulnerable militarily. He achieved the construction of defensive fortresses [[Fortified Position of Li\u00e8ge|at Li\u00e8ge]], [[Fortified Position of Namur|at Namur]] and [[National redoubt of Belgium|at Antwerp]]. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he managed to preserve Belgium's neutrality in a period of unusual difficulty and danger.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> Leopold pushed for a reform in military service, but he was unable to obtain one until he was on his deathbed. Under the old system of ''[[Remplacement]]'', the Belgian army was a combination of volunteers and a lottery, and it was possible for men to pay for substitutes for service. This was replaced by a system in which one son in every family would have to serve in the military.\n\n===Builder King===\n[[File:Brussels Cinquantenaire R02.jpg|thumb|left|The [[triumphal arch]] of the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' complex in [[Brussels]]]]\n\nLeopold commissioned a great number of buildings, urban projects and public works, largely with the profits generated from exploitation of natural resources and the population of the [[Congo Free State|Congo]]. These projects earned him the epithet of \"Builder King\" (''Koning-Bouwheer'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''le Roi-B\u00e2tisseur'' in [[French language|French]]). The public buildings were mainly in [[Brussels]], [[Ostend]] and [[Antwerp]], and include the [[Hippodrome Wellington]] racetrack, the [[Royal Galleries of Ostend|Royal Galleries]] and Maria Hendrikapark in [[Ostend]]; the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]] and its surrounding park in [[Tervuren]]; the ''[[Cinquantenaire]]'' park, triumphal arch and complex, and the [[Duden Park]] in Brussels, and the 1895-1905 [[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station]].\n\nIn addition to his public works, he acquired and built numerous private properties for himself inside and outside Belgium. He expanded the grounds of the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]], and built the [[Royal Greenhouses of Laeken|Royal Greenhouses]], the Japanese Tower and the Chinese Pavilion near the palace. In the [[Ardennes]], his domains consisted of {{convert|6700|ha|-3}} of forests and agricultural lands and the [[ch\u00e2teaux]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau royal d'Ardenne|Ardenne]], [[Ciergnon Castle|Ciergnon]], Fenffe, Villers-sur-Lesse and Ferage. He also built important [[country estate]]s on the [[French Riviera]], including the ''[[Jardin botanique \"Les C\u00e8dres\"|Villa des C\u00e8dres]]'' and its [[botanical garden]], and the [[Villa Leopolda]].\n\nThinking of the future after his death, Leopold did not want the collection of estates, lands and heritage buildings he had privately amassed to be scattered amongst his daughters, each of whom was married to a foreign prince. In 1900, he created the [[Royal Trust (Belgium)|Royal Trust]], by means of which he donated most of his property to the Belgian nation. This preserved them to beautify Belgium in perpetuity, while still allowing future generations of the Belgian Royal family the privilege of their use.\n\n===Attempted assassination===\nOn 15 November 1902, Italian [[anarchist]] [[Gennaro Rubino]] attempted to [[regicide|assassinate]] Leopold, who was riding in a royal cortege from a ceremony at Saint-Gudule Cathedral in memory of his recently deceased wife, [[Marie Henriette of Austria|Marie Henriette]]. After Leopold's carriage passed, Rubino fired three shots at the procession. The shots missed Leopold but almost killed the king's [[Grand Marshall]], Count Charles John d'Oultremont. Rubino was immediately arrested and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1918.\n\nThe king replied after the attack to a senator: \"My dear senator, if fate wants me shot, too bad!\" (\"Mon cher Senateur, si la fatalite veut que je sois atteint, tant pis\"!)<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\">Meuse (La) 17-11-1902</ref>\nAfter the failed [[regicide]] the security of the king was questioned, because the glass of the landaus was 2&nbsp;cm thick. Elsewhere in Europe, the news of this assassination attempt was received with alarm. Heads of state and the pope sent telegrams to the king congratulating him for surviving the assassination attempt. Many people remembered the earlier assassinations of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]] and [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]] by other Italian anarchists.\n\nThe Belgians rejoiced that the king was safe. Later in the day, in the [[Theatre Royal de la Monnaie]] before ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' was performed, the orchestra played the [[Braban\u00e7onne]], which was sung loudly and ended with loud cheers and applause.<ref name=\"Meuse La 17-11-1902\"/>\n\n==Congo Free State==\n[[File:kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|Map of the Congo Free State, c. 1890]]\n\nLeopold was the founder and sole owner of the [[Congo Free State]] and all its people, a private project undertaken on his own behalf.<ref name=ewans>{{cite book|last1=Ewans|first1=Sir Martin|title=European Atrocity, African Catastrophe: Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its Aftermath|date=2017|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, England|doi=10.4324/9781315829173|isbn=9781317849070|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|136}} He used explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to help him lay claim to the Congo, an area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

Leopold eventually began to acquire a colony as a private citizen. The Belgian government lent him money for this venture.\n\nIn 1866, Leopold instructed the Belgian ambassador in Madrid to speak to Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] about ceding the [[Philippines]] to Belgium.

The second, a much smaller force of 800, was led by [[Louis-Napol\u00e9on Chaltin]] and took the main road towards Rejaf.

At first, ivory was exported, but this did not yield the expected levels of revenue. When the global demand for rubber exploded, attention shifted to the labor-intensive collection of sap from rubber plants. Abandoning the promises of the [[Berlin Conference]] in the late 1890s, the Free State government restricted foreign access and extorted [[forced labor]] from the natives.

Following the side's success and development a youth set up was formed for the beginning of the 2011-12 season. The club has enjoyed unparalled success in Shropshire, winning the last 11 Shropshire Women's Challenge Cups as well as achieving their current league standing in the FA Women's National League - Midlands Division One.\n\n\nFor the 2013-14 season the club entered the [[West Midlands Regional Women's Football League]] - Premier Division with the club finishing 4th in the league and winning their 7th Shropshire Women's Challenge Cup. The following season (2014\u201315) saw a second-placed finish, another Shropshire Women's Challenge Cup win and saw Emily Ridge finish the season as the league's top goalscorer with 24 goals in 18 league games. In their third season in the league TNS finished the season as champions and claimed promotion to the FA Women's National League - Midlands Division One, the season also saw another Shropshire Women's Challenge Cup and Ridge again claimed the league's golden boot with an impressive 38 goals in 18 games.\n\n\nTNS's first season in the FA Women's National League saw a 6th-placed finish, thanks to impressive performances from Emily Ridge (24 goals in 18 games) and new signing Charlotte Canlett who had joined the club from [[Everton L.F.C.]] in the summer, the club also added to their Shropshire Women's Challenge Cup haul. The 2017-18 season saw TNS improve on their position securing a 5th-placed finish and another Shropshire Women's Challenge Cup win (their 11th in a row), matched with a spectacular performance in the [[Women's FA Cup]] where they reached the 4th round proper for the first time in the club's history.\n\n\nFor the 2018-19 season, TNS hired former Assistant Manager, Lawrence Wilson, as the club's new manager, following a number of player and staff retirements, the club went on a stage of rebuilding, bringing in a large number of young players. Wilson's first game was a 4-1 away loss to Nettleham FC, [[Nettleham]], [[Lincolnshire]]. Wilson's first win was a home match at [[Park Hall (football ground)]] against [[Solihull Moors]] Ladies which finished 3-0, with goals from Emily Ridge, Laura Morris and a Solihull own goal. Saints ended the 18-19 campaign in eight place beating [[Burton Albion]] LFC, 9-1, following that Wilson\u2019s side secured an eleventh Shropshire Cup with a 9-1 victory and a Ridge hat trick over Shifnal Town.\n\n\nFor the beginning of the 2019-20 season, Saints brought in a number of new players, including Helen Evans from [[Aberystwyth Town F.C.]] and Jess Jennings from [[Wolverhampton Wanderers W.F.C.]], the club also entered a Development team into the FAWNL Reserve League, where the team were entered into the Reserve Midland Division 2 and managed by former [[Burton Albion]] LFC coach, Dave Warner. Saints started the season with a 5-1 loss to Birmingham & West Midlands LFC, which saw Saints fall towards the bottom of the league, however a quick upturn in form saw Saints climb to 2nd in the league after a number of wins over league rivals. Saints reached the 1st round proper of the [[Women's FA Cup]], beating [[Long Eaton United F.C.]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.]] before being knocked out at home to [[Chorley F.C.]].\n\n== Current squad ==\n:''As of 20th January, 2020''\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=Sarah Parkes}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Lauren Brown}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Lucy Brown}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=WAL|pos=DF|name=Phoebe Davies|other=Captain}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Caitlyn Smith}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=WAL|pos=MF|name=Lia Lewis}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Laura Morris}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=WAL|pos=DF|name=Taylor Davis}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Zoe Griffiths}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Katie Doster}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=WAL|pos=FW|name=Laura Pennington}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=Kim Bebbington}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Mia Evans}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Yasmin Evans}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=WAL|pos=MF|name=Helen Evans}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Charlotte Turner}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=Jess Jennings}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=Erin Taylor}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==Coaching staff==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The session version makes clear that the basic structure of the song, including its signature bass-line, percussion arrangement and idiosyncratic introductory and middle eight sections, were already intact prior to any involvement from ZTT or eventual producer [[Trevor Horn]].\n\n{{Listen|filename=Two Tribes Peel Sessions 1982.ogg\n|title=Two Tribes (Peel Sessions 1982) excerpt|description=An excerpt from ''Two Tribes (Peel Sessions 1982)''}}\n\nJohnson also noted: \"There's {{sic}} two elements in the music \u2014 an American funk line and a Russian line. It's the most obvious demonstration of two tribes that we have today.\"<ref name=\"Smash Hits, 26 April 1984\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=55|publisher=Smash Hits\n|title=The War Game|date=26 April 1984}}</ref> To accentuate the musical tension, Horn arranged the 'Russian' segments as a dramatic string arrangement. The driving funk/rock rhythm section was played on synthesisers.\n\n==Title and lyrics==\nThe single was released at a time when the [[Cold War]] had [[Cold War (1979\u201385)|intensified]] and fears about global [[nuclear warfare]] were at a peak. Although Johnson would attest in a 1984 radio interview that the \"two tribes\" of the song potentially represented any pair of warring adversaries (giving the examples of \"[[cowboy]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] or [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Klingon]]s\"), the line \"On the air America/I modelled shirts by Van Heusen\" is a clear reference to then [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan had advertised for [[Phillips Van Heusen]] in 1953 (briefly reviving the association in the early 1980s). The title of his first film had been ''[[Love Is On the Air]]''.\n\nThe lyric \"working for the black gas\" is, according to Johnson, \"About oil surpassing gold. How you might as well be paid in petrol.\"<ref>No 1 magazine, 4 August 1984 http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=181</ref> And the line \"Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?\" was inspired by the 1959 British film ''[[Cover Girl Killer]]''. Johnson explained, \"The TV was on in the background while I was doing me ironing and suddenly this character came out with that statement.\"<ref>No 1 magazine, 4 August 1984 http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=181</ref> (The actual dialogue, which occurs at about 48 minutes 24 seconds into the film, is \"Surely sex and horror are the new gods in this polluted world of so-called entertainment?\")\n\nThe track featured snippets of narration from actor [[Patrick Allen]], recreating his narration from the British ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' [[public information film]]s about how to survive a nuclear war. (The original ''Protect and Survive'' soundtracks were [[sampling (music)|sampled]] for the 7-inch mixes.)\n\nThe 12-inch A- and B-sides featured voice parts by British actor [[Chris Barrie]] imitating Ronald Reagan. Barrie also voiced the Reagan puppet on ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Barrie's parts as 'Reagan' included praise for the band, as well as parts of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s speech to a court after the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]: \"You may pronounce us guilty a thousand times over, but the Goddess of the Eternal Court of History will smile and tear to tatters the brief of the State Prosecutor and the sentence of this court, for She acquits us.\" Barrie also voiced the last sentence of \"[[History Will Absolve Me]]\" (Spanish: \"La historia me absolver\u00e1\") which is the concluding sentence and subsequent title of a four-hour speech made by Fidel Castro on 16 October 1953. Castro made the speech in his own defense in court against the charges brought against him after leading an attack on the Moncada Barracks on 26 July 1953. Barrie would return for the band's next single, \"[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)|The Power of Love]]\", imitating [[Mike Read]] in a parody of the DJ's ban on their previous single, \"Relax\".\n\nThe song's title derives from the line \"when two great warrior tribes go to war\", from the film ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (the line is also spoken by [[Holly Johnson]] at the beginning of the session version).\n\n==Promotion==\nZTT aggressively marketed the single in terms of its topical political angle, promoting it with images of the group wearing American military garb in combat, as well as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style army uniforms set against an American urban backdrop.\n\nThe original cover art featured a Soviet mural of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in St Petersburg, and images of Reagan and then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The sleeve notes, attributed to ZTT's [[Paul Morley]], dispassionately reported details of the relative nuclear arsenals of each [[superpower]].\n\n==Original 1984 mixes==\nThe song appeared in the form of six [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixes]], including \"Annihilation\", \"Carnage\", \"[[Hibakusha]]\", \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"We Don't Want to Die\" and \"For The Victims Of Ravishment\".\n\nThe first 12-inch mix (\"Annihilation\") started with an [[Civil defense siren|air-raid siren]], and included advice from Allen about how to tag and dispose of family members should they die in the fallout shelter (taken from the [[public information film]] ''Casualties''). This version appeared on CD editions of the album. \"Annihilation\" was the basis for the \"Hibakusha\" mix, which was originally released in a limited edition, and appears on the Japanese-only 1985 album ''[[Bang! (1985 Frankie Goes to Hollywood album)|Bang!]]''.\n\n\"For The Victims Of Ravishment\" appeared on the LP and cassette editions of the album ''Welcome To The Pleasuredome''. It is the shortest version, at 3:27 minutes. This mix derived from the \"Carnage\" mix, which prominently featured strings as well as vocal samples from Allen and the group's B-side interview.\n\nSince 1984, \"Two Tribes\" has been re-issued several times, generally involving third-party remixes bearing little relation to the original releases in terms of either structure or character.\n\n==B-sides==\nThe 7-inch featured \"One February Friday\", an interview between Morley and the group's three musicians, [[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]], [[Brian Nash]] and [[Peter Gill (FGTH drummer)|Peter Gill]], over an otherwise untitled instrumental track. A similar track had been included on the B-side of \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\", with the title \"One September Monday\".\n\nThe principal B-side to the original 12-inch single was a cover version of \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\", which became the subject of an extended remix (subtitled \"Hidden\") on the single's third UK 12-inch release, where it was promoted as a [[double A-side]] with \"Carnage\".\n\nThe UK [[cassette single]] featured a cut-together combination of \"Surrender\", \"Carnage\" and \"Annihilation\", plus Reagan snippets and interview sections not included on any other release.\n\n==Videos==\nThe [[Godley & Creme]]-directed video depicted a wrestling match between then-US President [[Ronald Reagan]] and then-Soviet General Secretary [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in front of group members and an assembly of representatives from the world's nations. The match eventually degenerates into global destruction. Certain violent moments (\"Reagan\" is seen, for example, biting \"Chernenko's\" ear) were edited from the version shown on [[MTV]].\n\nA longer version of the video (based on the \"Hibakusha\" mix) included an introductory, heavily [[Film editing|edited]] monologue by [[Richard Nixon]] taken from an ad from his 1960 US Presidential campaign (\"No&nbsp;... firm diplomacy&nbsp;... No&nbsp;... peace for America and the world\"), plus similar contributions from other world leaders, including [[Lord Beaverbrook]], [[Yasser Arafat]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. The complete soundtrack to the extended video was eventually released as \"Two Tribes (Video Destructo)\" on the German version of the ''[[Twelve Inches]]'' compilation. A third version of the video, included on the band's ''From An Wasteland to an Artificial Paradise'' VHS, retains the introduction, but omits most of the inserted clips in the main wrestling sequence.\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (1984)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia<ref>{{cite web|title=Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 Top 100 Singles 1984|website=Australian-charts.com.

The session version makes clear that the basic structure of the song, including its signature bass-line, percussion arrangement and idiosyncratic introductory and middle eight sections, were already intact prior to any involvement from ZTT or eventual producer [[Trevor Horn]].\n\n{{Listen|filename=Two Tribes Peel Sessions 1982.ogg\n|title=Two Tribes (Peel Sessions 1982) excerpt|description=An excerpt from ''Two Tribes (Peel Sessions 1982)''}}\n\nJohnson also noted: \"There's {{sic}} two elements in the music \u2014 an American funk line and a Russian line. It's the most obvious demonstration of two tribes that we have today.\"<ref name=\"Smash Hits, 26 April 1984\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=55|publisher=Smash Hits\n|title=The War Game|date=26 April 1984}}</ref> To accentuate the musical tension, Horn arranged the 'Russian' segments as a dramatic string arrangement. The driving funk/rock rhythm section was played on synthesisers.\n\n==Title and lyrics==\nThe single was released at a time when the [[Cold War]] had [[Cold War (1979\u201385)|intensified]] and fears about global [[nuclear warfare]] were at a peak. Although Johnson would attest in a 1984 radio interview that the \"two tribes\" of the song potentially represented any pair of warring adversaries (giving the examples of \"[[cowboy]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] or [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Klingon]]s\"), the line \"On the air America/I modelled shirts by Van Heusen\" is a clear reference to then [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. Reagan had advertised for [[Phillips Van Heusen]] in 1953 (briefly reviving the association in the early 1980s). The title of his first film had been ''[[Love Is On the Air]]''.\n\nThe lyric \"working for the black gas\" is, according to Johnson, \"About oil surpassing gold. How you might as well be paid in petrol.\"<ref>No 1 magazine, 4 August 1984 http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=181</ref> And the line \"Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new gods?\" was inspired by the 1959 British film ''[[Cover Girl Killer]]''. Johnson explained, \"The TV was on in the background while I was doing me ironing and suddenly this character came out with that statement.\"<ref>No 1 magazine, 4 August 1984 http://www.zttaat.com/article.php?title=181</ref> (The actual dialogue, which occurs at about 48 minutes 24 seconds into the film, is \"Surely sex and horror are the new gods in this polluted world of so-called entertainment?\")\n\nThe track featured snippets of narration from actor [[Patrick Allen]], recreating his narration from the British ''[[Protect and Survive]]'' [[public information film]]s about how to survive a nuclear war. (The original ''Protect and Survive'' soundtracks were [[sampling (music)|sampled]] for the 7-inch mixes.)\n\nThe 12-inch A- and B-sides featured voice parts by British actor [[Chris Barrie]] imitating Ronald Reagan. Barrie also voiced the Reagan puppet on ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Barrie's parts as 'Reagan' included praise for the band, as well as parts of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s speech to a court after the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]: \"You may pronounce us guilty a thousand times over, but the Goddess of the Eternal Court of History will smile and tear to tatters the brief of the State Prosecutor and the sentence of this court, for She acquits us.\" Barrie also voiced the last sentence of \"[[History Will Absolve Me]]\" (Spanish: \"La historia me absolver\u00e1\") which is the concluding sentence and subsequent title of a four-hour speech made by Fidel Castro on 16 October 1953. Castro made the speech in his own defense in court against the charges brought against him after leading an attack on the Moncada Barracks on 26 July 1953. Barrie would return for the band's next single, \"[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)|The Power of Love]]\", imitating [[Mike Read]] in a parody of the DJ's ban on their previous single, \"Relax\".\n\nThe song's title derives from the line \"when two great warrior tribes go to war\", from the film ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (the line is also spoken by [[Holly Johnson]] at the beginning of the session version).\n\n==Promotion==\nZTT aggressively marketed the single in terms of its topical political angle, promoting it with images of the group wearing American military garb in combat, as well as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style army uniforms set against an American urban backdrop.\n\nThe original cover art featured a Soviet mural of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in St Petersburg, and images of Reagan and then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The sleeve notes, attributed to ZTT's [[Paul Morley]], dispassionately reported details of the relative nuclear arsenals of each [[superpower]].\n\n==Original 1984 mixes==\nThe song appeared in the form of six [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixes]], including \"Annihilation\", \"Carnage\", \"[[Hibakusha]]\", \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"We Don't Want to Die\" and \"For The Victims Of Ravishment\".\n\nThe first 12-inch mix (\"Annihilation\") started with an [[Civil defense siren|air-raid siren]], and included advice from Allen about how to tag and dispose of family members should they die in the fallout shelter (taken from the [[public information film]] ''Casualties''). This version appeared on CD editions of the album. \"Annihilation\" was the basis for the \"Hibakusha\" mix, which was originally released in a limited edition, and appears on the Japanese-only 1985 album ''[[Bang! (1985 Frankie Goes to Hollywood album)|Bang!]]''.\n\n\"For The Victims Of Ravishment\" appeared on the LP and cassette editions of the album ''Welcome To The Pleasuredome''. It is the shortest version, at 3:27 minutes. This mix derived from the \"Carnage\" mix, which prominently featured strings as well as vocal samples from Allen and the group's B-side interview.\n\nSince 1984, \"Two Tribes\" has been re-issued several times, generally involving third-party remixes bearing little relation to the original releases in terms of either structure or character.\n\n==B-sides==\nThe 7-inch featured \"One February Friday\", an interview between Morley and the group's three musicians, [[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]], [[Brian Nash]] and [[Peter Gill (FGTH drummer)|Peter Gill]], over an otherwise untitled instrumental track. A similar track had been included on the B-side of \"[[Relax (song)|Relax]]\", with the title \"One September Monday\".\n\nThe principal B-side to the original 12-inch single was a cover version of \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\", which became the subject of an extended remix (subtitled \"Hidden\") on the single's third UK 12-inch release, where it was promoted as a [[double A-side]] with \"Carnage\".\n\nThe UK [[cassette single]] featured a cut-together combination of \"Surrender\", \"Carnage\" and \"Annihilation\", plus Reagan snippets and interview sections not included on any other release.\n\n==Videos==\nThe [[Godley & Creme]]-directed video depicted a wrestling match between then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] and then-Soviet leader [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in front of group members and an assembly of representatives from the world's nations. The match eventually degenerates into global destruction. Certain violent moments (\"Reagan\" is seen, for example, biting \"Chernenko's\" ear) were edited from the version shown on [[MTV]].\n\nA longer version of the video (based on the \"Hibakusha\" mix) included an introductory, heavily [[Film editing|edited]] monologue by [[Richard Nixon]] taken from an ad from his 1960 US Presidential campaign (\"No&nbsp;... firm diplomacy&nbsp;... No&nbsp;... peace for America and the world\"), plus similar contributions from other world leaders, including [[Lord Beaverbrook]], [[Yasser Arafat]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. The complete soundtrack to the extended video was eventually released as \"Two Tribes (Video Destructo)\" on the German version of the ''[[Twelve Inches]]'' compilation. A third version of the video, included on the band's ''From An Wasteland to an Artificial Paradise'' VHS, retains the introduction, but omits most of the inserted clips in the main wrestling sequence.\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (1984)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia<ref>{{cite web|title=Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 Top 100 Singles 1984|website=Australian-charts.com.

The story goes that al-Sh\u0101fi'\u012b triumphed in the argument over Fityan, who, being intemperate, resorted to abuse. The Governor of Egypt, with whom al-Shafi'i had good relations, ordered Fityan punished by having him paraded through the streets of the city carrying a plank and stating the reason for his punishment. Fityan's supporters were enraged by this treatment and attacked Shafi'i in retaliation after one of his lectures.

Even in later eras, his speeches and works were used by Arabic grammarians. He was given the title of Nasir al-Sunnah, the Defender of the [[Sunnah]].\n\nAl-Shafi\u2018i loved the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] very deeply. Al Muzani said of him, \"He said in the Old School: \u2018Supplication ends with the invocation of blessings on the Prophet, and its end is but by means of it.\u2019\u201d Al-Karabisi said: \u201cI heard al-Shafi\u2019i say that he disliked for someone to say \u2018the Messenger\u2019 (al-Rasul), but that he should say \u2018Allah\u2019s Messenger\u2019 (Rasul Allah) out of veneration for him.\u201d He divided his night into three parts: one for writing, one for praying, and one for sleeping.\n\n[[Apocryphal]] accounts claim that Imam Ahmad said of al-Shafi'i, \"I never saw anyone adhere more to hadith than al-Shafi\u2019i.

Chess could not be played for a stake, but if a player was playing for a mental exercise, he was not doing anything illegal.  Provided the player took care that his fondness for chess did not cause him to break any other rule of life, he saw no harm in playing chess.  He played chess himself, defending his practice by the example of many of his companions. {{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Quotations ===\n* He who seeks pearls immerses himself in the sea.<ref>Diwan al-Imam al-shafi'i, (book of poems \u2013 al-shafi'i) p. 100; Dar El-Mrefah Beirut \u2013 Lebanon 2005. {{ISBN|9953-429-33-2}}</ref>\n* He said to the effect that no knowledge of Islam can be gained from books of [[Kalam]], as kalam \"is not from knowledge\"<ref>Dhammul-Kalaam (Q/213)</ref><ref>[[Dhahabi]], as-Siyar (10/30)</ref> and that \"It is better for a man to spend his whole life doing whatever [[Allah]] has prohibited \u2013 besides [[Shirk (polytheism)|shirk]] with Allah \u2013 rather than spending his whole life involved in kalam.\"<ref name=\":2\">Ibn Abi Hatim, Manaaqibush-Shaafi'ee, pg. 39</ref>\n*  Ahadith from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad have to be accepted without questioning, reasoning, critical thinking. \"If a hadith is authenticated as coming from the Prophet, we have to resign ourselves to it, and your talk and the talk of others about why and how, is a mistake ...\"<ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-13>{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=13  }}</ref>\n\n== Islamic scholars ==\n{{Islam scholars diagram}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Islam}}\n*[[Fiqh]]\n*[[Mujaddid]]\n*[[Shafi'i]]\n*[[Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i]]\n\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Notes===\n\n* {{Cite book| first1=John |last1=Burton | title=The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | year=1990 | isbn=0-7486-0108-2 |url=http://www.almuslih.org/Library/Burton,%20J%20-%20The%20Sources%20of%20Islamic%20Law.pdf |accessdate=21 July 2018 |ref=JBSILITA1990}}\n* Ruthven Malise, ''Islam in the World''. 3rd edition Granta Books London 2006 ch. 4\n* [[Majid Khadduri]] (trans.), \"al-Shafi'i's Risala: Treatise on the Foundation of Islamic Jurisprudence\".

Chess could not be played for a stake, but if a player was playing for a mental exercise, he was not doing anything illegal.  Provided the player took care that his fondness for chess did not cause him to break any other rule of life, he saw no harm in playing chess.

It was released by [[ATO Records]] on March 10, 2017.<ref name=ato>{{cite web|url=http://atorecords.com/featured/hurray-for-the-riff-raff-announces-new-album-the-navigator-out-march-10/|title=New Hurray for the Riff Raff Album 'The Navigator' out Now! |date=March 10, 2017|publisher=[[ATO Records]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref> The album was recorded in 2016 at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York City and Panoramic House in [[West Marin]] with producer Paul Butler, a member of the band [[The Bees (band)|The Bees]].\n\n==Background==\nBy the end of 2014, Hurray for the Riff Raff had managed to gain a wider audience following the successes of [[Small Town Heroes]]. Rather than immediately follow it up quickly by recording another album, frontwoman Alynda Mariposa Segarra used the opportunity to travel back to her ancestral homelands in [[Puerto Rico]] and reconnect with her roots. Much of the album was inspired by her travels. She witnessed the effects that both the [[Puerto Rican government-debt crisis|debt crisis]] and continual environmental damage had done to the communities, as well as the way Puerto Rican culture had continued to flourish despite the hardships that had been endured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2017/03/creating-navita-qa-alynda-lee-segarra-hurray-riff-raff/|title=Creating \"Navita\": A Q&A with Alynda Mariposa Segarra of Hurray For The Riff Raff|work=[[American Songwriter]]|accessdate=September 11, 2017|last=Johnson|first=Alex B.}}</ref> \n\nSegarra also returned to her childhood hometown in [[The Bronx]] to see how [[gentrification]] had affected the area since she had left to start her music career. These changes would also become central to the themes covered within the album. After returning from her travels, Segarra and the rest of the band decided to relocate from [[New Orleans]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in order to start writing the new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hurray-for-the-riff-raff-mn0002534755/biography|title= Hurray for the Riff Raff {{!}} Biography & History|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 11, 2017|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nSegarra conceived ''The Navigator'' with a storyline following the protagonist Navita in an over[[gentrification|gentrified]] city in the future. She based the character on herself as a 16-year old [[street children|street kid]].<ref name=\"dis\"/> As she later told ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'':\n\n{{quote|She's this very independent spirit, a tough girl. She feels very suffocated by the city, the poverty and how everyone is cramped together. She has this overwhelming feeling that something is wrong. And she's also very ashamed of where she comes from. So that's where ''The Navigator'' begins. She wants to escape. It's like this ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wizard of Oz]]'' story: Navi asks this wise woman to wake up the next day without remembering or recognizing anyone or anything. So this woman puts her to sleep for forty years; she then wakes up in the same city. In this future, gentrification has gone rapid. And basically in my mind, [[Donald Trump|Trump]] is mayor in this place. I thought about this very extreme dictator-like figure who wants to separate everyone. Someone who wants to get all people of color and the poor out of certain neighborhoods to somewhere remote.<ref name=\"dis\">{{cite magazine|last=Willems|first=Jasper|date=2 March 2017|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4150834-radical-roots--dis-meets-hurray-for-the-riff-raff|title=Radical Roots: DiS meets Hurray For The Riff Raff|magazine=[[Drowned in Sound]]|accessdate=20 December 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/74nw66Ii4?url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4150834-radical-roots--dis-meets-hurray-for-the-riff-raff|archivedate=20 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nOnce writing the album had been completed, the band then spent most of 2016 recording the album at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City|New York]] and Panoramic House in [[West Marin]].<ref name=\"am\"/> The band asked Paul Butler to produce the album, based on his work with British soul singer [[Michael Kiwanuka]]. Butler was hired with the aim to recapture the same sound he had brought to Kirwanuka's albums and combine it with the various musical influences of the places Segarra had visited. To accomplish the task an ensemble of musicians were brought in, including percussionist Juan-Carlos Chaurand and Devendra Banhart\u2019s drummer [[Gregory Rogove]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atorecords.com/artists/hurray-for-the-riff-raff/|title=Hurray for the Riff Raff|work=[[ATO Records]]|accessdate=September 11, 2017|last=Kettering|first=Kelly}}</ref> \n\nSegarra said, \"I was listening to [[Kendrick Lamar]] a lot during the making of ''The Navigator''. I started writing the lyrics for [the title] track on my phone, with no music. That's the part of the album where Navita starts to transform. I wanted it to sound very cinematic. I listened to a lot of [[Jorge Ben Jor]] too, especially his album ''[[For\u00e7a Bruta]]''. The strings on that album are gorgeous.\"<ref name=\"dis\"/>\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe album was announced on December 5, 2016 alongside the release of the video for lead single 'Rican Beach'. Details on the tour to support the album were also listed, as well as a statement from Segarra regarding the album. In the statement Segarra wrote, \"This is dedicated to the [[water protectors]] of Standing Rock\u2014thank you for your bravery and giving us hope. Also, to the people of Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico, who are demanding an end to the AES dumping of coal ash which leads to water contamination\u2014we are with you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/70190-watch-hurray-for-the-riff-raffs-video-for-new-song-rican-beach/|title=Watch Hurray for the Riff Raff\u2019s Video for New Song \"Rican Beach\"|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=September 11, 2017|last=Yoo|first=Noah}}</ref>\n\nTwo additional songs were taken from the album in order to promote it.

At [[Metacritic]], the album holds a score of an 83 out of 100 based upon 18 selected independent ratings and reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\".<ref name=mc/>\n\nAt [[AllMusic]], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote, \"''The Navigator'' is nothing if it isn't a bold risk, a record that attempts to carve out a new kind of Americana, one where the past informs the present instead of the present preserving the past -- and one where the political is personal, too.\"<ref name=am/> Caroline Sullivan was similarly positive in her review for [[The Guardian]] stating; \"Segarra personalises the political by foregrounding her Hispanic roots. If that sounds as if it\u2019s a recipe for unmitigated worthiness, be assured that folk melodies and wild-hearted Latin beats play as big a role as Segarra\u2019s flamethrower polemics\"<ref name=\"tg\"/> Writing for [[The Independent]], Andy Gill claimed, \"[Segarra] effectively expands the notion of Americana to accommodate another cultural strain alongside the usual blues and country influences.\"<ref name=\"ti\"/>\n\nWriting for [[NME]], Leonie Cooper said, \"Serious stuff for sure, but doesn\u2019t deliver its message with a po-face. \u2018Living in The City\u2019 is a fun doo-wop number while the title track is a sultry slice of mid-1980s Tom Waits-ian southern gothic.

Rather than immediately follow it up quickly by recording another album, frontwoman Alynda Mariposa Segarra used the opportunity to travel back to her ancestral homelands in [[Puerto Rico]] and reconnect with her roots. Much of the album was inspired by her travels. She witnessed the effects that both the [[Puerto Rican government-debt crisis|debt crisis]] and continual environmental damage had done to the communities, as well as the way Puerto Rican culture had continued to flourish despite the hardships that had been endured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2017/03/creating-navita-qa-alynda-lee-segarra-hurray-riff-raff/|title=Creating \"Navita\": A Q&A with Alynda Mariposa Segarra of Hurray For The Riff Raff|work=[[American Songwriter]]|accessdate=September 11, 2017|last=Johnson|first=Alex B.}}</ref> \n\nSegarra also returned to her childhood hometown in [[The Bronx]] to see how [[gentrification]] had affected the area since she had left to start her music career. These changes would also become central to the themes covered within the album. After returning from her travels, Segarra and the rest of the band decided to relocate from [[New Orleans]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in order to start writing the new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hurray-for-the-riff-raff-mn0002534755/biography|title= Hurray for the Riff Raff {{!}} Biography & History|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 11, 2017|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nSegarra conceived ''The Navigator'' with a storyline following the protagonist Navita in an over[[gentrification|gentrified]] city in the future. She based the character on herself as a 16-year old [[street children|street kid]].<ref name=\"dis\"/> As she later told ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'':\n\n{{quote|She's this very independent spirit, a tough girl. She feels very suffocated by the city, the poverty and how everyone is cramped together. She has this overwhelming feeling that something is wrong. And she's also very ashamed of where she comes from. So that's where ''The Navigator'' begins. She wants to escape. It's like this ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wizard of Oz]]'' story: Navi asks this wise woman to wake up the next day without remembering or recognizing anyone or anything. So this woman puts her to sleep for forty years; she then wakes up in the same city. In this future, gentrification has gone rapid. And basically in my mind, [[Donald Trump|Trump]] is mayor in this place. I thought about this very extreme dictator-like figure who wants to separate everyone. Someone who wants to get all people of color and the poor out of certain neighborhoods to somewhere remote.<ref name=\"dis\">{{cite magazine|last=Willems|first=Jasper|date=2 March 2017|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4150834-radical-roots--dis-meets-hurray-for-the-riff-raff|title=Radical Roots: DiS meets Hurray For The Riff Raff|magazine=[[Drowned in Sound]]|accessdate=20 December 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/74nw66Ii4?url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4150834-radical-roots--dis-meets-hurray-for-the-riff-raff|archivedate=20 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nOnce writing the album had been completed, the band then spent most of 2016 recording the album at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City|New York]] and Panoramic House in [[West Marin]].<ref name=\"am\"/> The band asked Paul Butler to produce the album, based on his work with British soul singer [[Michael Kiwanuka]]. Butler was hired with the aim to recapture the same sound he had brought to Kirwanuka's albums and combine it with the various musical influences of the places Segarra had visited. To accomplish the task an ensemble of musicians were brought in, including percussionist Juan-Carlos Chaurand and Devendra Banhart\u2019s drummer [[Gregory Rogove]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atorecords.com/artists/hurray-for-the-riff-raff/|title=Hurray for the Riff Raff|work=[[ATO Records]]|accessdate=September 11, 2017|last=Kettering|first=Kelly}}</ref> \n\nSegarra said, \"I was listening to [[Kendrick Lamar]] a lot during the making of ''The Navigator''. I started writing the lyrics for [the title] track on my phone, with no music. That's the part of the album where Navita starts to transform. I wanted it to sound very cinematic. I listened to a lot of [[Jorge Ben Jor]] too, especially his album ''[[For\u00e7a Bruta]]''. The strings on that album are gorgeous.\"<ref name=\"dis\"/>\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe album was announced on December 5, 2016 alongside the release of the video for lead single 'Rican Beach'. Details on the tour to support the album were also listed, as well as a statement from Segarra regarding the album. In the statement Segarra wrote, \"This is dedicated to the [[water protectors]] of Standing Rock\u2014thank you for your bravery and giving us hope.
