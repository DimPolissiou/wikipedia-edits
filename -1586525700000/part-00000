Dorking is a [[London Commuter Belt|commuter and retirement settlement]] with three railway stations and a few large offices of multinational companies.  Similarly, Malden in 1911, noted the place was \"almost entirely residential and agricultural, with some lime works on the chalk, though not so extensive as those in neighbouring parishes, a little brick-making, water-mills (corn) at Pixham Mill, and timber and saw-mills\". Fine sand often in veins of pink colour, used for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and in [[glassmaking]] was dug, particularly in the 19th century &mdash; the [[Dorking Caves]] were accordingly excavated under southern parts of the town centre itself.\n\n[[Dorking (chicken)|Dorking chicken]]s with short five-toed legs are a major local breed.  The town has a local government headquarters and hosts repeating loops of the FIA-ranked [[London-Surrey cycle classic]] elite category event every year.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe origins and meaning of the place-name are uncertain, and a subject of scholarly debate.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Rob |last=Briggs |title=Dorking, Surrey |journal=Journal of the English Place-Name Society |volume=50 |year=2018 |pages=17\u201354 }}</ref> Early spellings include ''Dorchinges'' (1086), ''Doreking{{'}}'' (1138\u201347), ''Dorkingg'' (1219), and other variants.<ref>Briggs 2018, p. 19.</ref> Both principal elements in the name are disputed. The first element may be from a personal name, ''Deorc'', or some variant, which might arguably be of either [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] or [[Old English]] origin; but it might equally be from a Brittonic word ''Dorce'', a river-name meaning \"clear, bright stream\"; or possibly from a British word ''duro'', meaning a \"fort\", \"walled town\" or \"gated place\". The second element, if originally plural (''\u2013ingas''), might mean \"(settlement belonging to the) followers of ...\", but if singular (''\u2013ing'') might mean \"place\", \"stream\", \"wood\" or \"clump\". The issue remains complex and unresolved.\n\n== History and development ==\n\nDorking began to become more than an agricultural village as a small staging post on [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]], the [[Roman road]] between London and [[Chichester]] on the [[English Channel]].\n\nDorking appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as the Manor of ''Dorchinges''. It was held by [[William the Conqueror]]. Its Domesday assets were: one church, three [[Mill (grinding)|mills]] worth 15s 4d, 16 [[plough]]s, {{convert|3|acre|ha|1}} of [[meadow]], [[woodland]] and herbage for 88 [[hog (swine)|hogs]]. It rendered \u00a318 per year to its [[feudal system]] overlords.<ref>[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030000000/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nSubsequent Lords of the Manor included the [[Dukes of Norfolk]], who lived in Dorking until they moved to [[Arundel]]. One of them is buried in Dorking churchyard.  In the [[medieval period]], Dorking was a prosperous agricultural and market town with businesses, including milling and brewing, capitalising on its position on the junction of a number of long distance roads and local tracks.\n\nIn 1750, the construction of a [[Toll road|turnpike road]] made Dorking a staging post on the route to [[Brighton]] and the coast. The Bull's Head in South Street had a famous coachman, William Broad, whose portrait hangs in Dorking Museum in West Street. An inn in the centre of Dorking, the White Horse, was developed in the 18th century; previous buildings on this site belonged to the [[Knights Templar]] and later the [[Knights of Saint John|Knights of St John]].\n\nDorking held a big wheat and cattle market in the High Street. The poultry market was held in the corner of South Street and round Butter Hill. Here the famous [[Dorking (chicken)|Dorking fowl]] were sold. This breed, which has five claws instead of the normal four, was a favourite for 19th century tables, including that of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\nDorking lost its stagecoaches when the railways arrived, but then attracted wealthy residents who built large houses in and around the town, such as [[Denbies|Denbies House]] and Pippbrook House (now with council offices in the grounds). Surrounding land and beauty spots such as Cotmandene<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Recreation Areas and Parks|url=http://www.molevalley.gov.uk|publisher=Mole Valley Borough Council|date=February 2007}}</ref> and [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]] were donated by landowners for public use, protected by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] and the [[Surrey Hills AONB|AONB]] designation of the [[North Downs]] and [[Greensand Ridge]].\n\nCotmandene is a {{convert|4.78|ha|acre|abbr=on|sigfig=2|adj=on}} area of [[common land]] to the east of the town centre, (the name is thought to mean ''the heath of the poor cottages'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://common-land.com/lands/view/790 |title=The Cotmandene, Chart Lane, Dorking |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Timms |first= John |title= A Picturesque Promenade Round Dorking, in Surrey |year= 1822 |publisher= John Warren |location= London |page=96}}</ref> Cricket matches were played on the heath during the 18th century and are recorded in Edward Beavan's 1777 poem ''Box Hill''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Box Hill, a descriptive poem |last= Beavan |first= E |year= 1777 |publisher= Wilkie |location= London }}</ref> A painting entitled ''A Cricket Match on Cotmandene, Dorking'' by the artist James Canter, dating to around 1770, is now held by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dorkingmuseum.org.uk/howzat/ |title=Howzat |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= |publisher= Dorking Museum and Heritage Centre |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nA game resembling rugby was once played here. The two sides were unlimited in number, representing the east and west of the town. The goals were the two bridges on the Pipp Brook. The Town Crier kicked off the ball at 2 pm and stopped play at 6 pm. The game was started at the church gates and was \"rioted\" up and down the High Street. It ceased in 1897 after complaints by tradesmen and it was officially stopped under section 72 of the [[Highway Act 1835]].\n\nIn the 1880s there was a proposal to supply seawater to the town from a conduit between Lancing and London.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3016667/3016671|title=.SEA.-WATER SUPPLY.&#124;1880-12-11&#124;The Cardigan Observer and General Advertiser for the Counties of Cardigan Carmarthen and Pembroke - Welsh Newspapers|website=newspapers.library.wales}}</ref>\n\nDorking was an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] from 1894 to 1974.

The hill has been designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]], because of the large number of rare orchids which grow there in the summer.\n\nFurther north is [[Norbury Park]], which contains the Druids Grove, a forest of ancient yew trees.\n\nTo the south west of the town is [[Leith Hill]], also owned by the National Trust, the second highest point in the south east of England after [[Walbury Hill]]. The tower on the summit elevates the hill to {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The area is towards the east of the [[Surrey Hills AONB]] surrounded by the [[Greensand Ridge]], including Holmbury Hill and Pitch Hill, as well as the nearby escarpment of the [[North Downs]] from Box Hill to Newlands Corner.\n\nA species of fish-eating [[dinosaur]], ''[[Baryonyx walkeri]]'', was discovered in clay pits just south of Dorking. The creature had a long curved claw on each hand and remains of its last meal were discovered fossilised in its ribcage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2008/january/british-dinosaur-had-crocodile-like-skull18891.html|title=News archive, Natural History Museum website}}</ref> The skeleton can be seen at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London.

Both ridges are notable in southern England for country walks, rambling and [[mountain biking]], and the town in one of the narrowest gaps between high parts of them has a number of premises catering to these pursuits. Part of the [[Vale of Holmesdale]], much of the post town but not town itself is within the [[Surrey Hills AONB]]. Adjacent to Dorking is [[Denbies Wine Estate]]. The Dorking Group of Artists, established in 1947, exhibit locally twice a year, in [[Betchworth]] and at Denbies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dga.org.uk/|title=Dorking Artists|website=dga1}}</ref>\n\nUnder part of the town centre are the [[Dorking Caves]] which were dug for sand, mostly in the 19th century, and are open occasionally to the public.\n\n===Leith Hill Musical Festival===\nEach year in April, the town plays host to the Leith Hill Musical Festival for local choral societies. This was founded in 1905 by Margaret Vaughan Williams, sister of the composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], and Lady (Evangeline) Farrer, wife of [[Thomas Farrer, 2nd Baron Farrer|Lord Farrer]] of [[Abinger]] Hall.<ref>And Choirs Singing, An account of the Leith Hill Musical Festival 1905\u20131985</ref> Ralph Vaughan Williams was the Festival Conductor from 1905 to 1953. The present Festival Conductor is [[Brian Kay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lhmf.co.uk/ |title= Leith Hill Music Festival |accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe festival is competitive lasting three days, each day with a different division of choirs; each evening the choirs who have competed during the day combine to give a concert of the works which form the subject of the competitions. Following the tradition established by Vaughan Williams, the [[St. Matthew Passion]] or the [[St. John Passion]] of [[J. S. Bach]] are also frequently performed by the combined choral societies.\n\nAfter the death of Vaughan Williams in 1958 the festival committee commissioned, from [[David McFall]] <small>[[Royal Academy of Arts|A.R.A.]]</small>, two identical bronze plaques with a likeness of the composer: one was placed in St. Martin's church and one in the Dorking Halls. In 2001 a smaller than life-size bronze statue of Vaughan Williams by William Fawke was erected outside the Dorking Halls.\n\n==Cultural references==\n''[[The Battle of Dorking]]'', a novella written by Lt. Col. Sir [[George Tomkyns Chesney]] in 1871, was set in the town. Describing a fictional invasion and conquest of Britain by a German-speaking country, it triggered an explosion of what came to be known as [[invasion literature]].\n\n==Demography and housing==\nIn groupings by such bodies as [[Surrey County Council]], the unparished area in terms of [[civil parishes in England]], [[North Holmwood]] is grouped with Dorking, and is subsidiary to the town as lacking many amenities and services. However, as with [[Westcott, Surrey|Westcott]], neighbouring settlements with their own church and a degree of physical divide (a hill and fields respectively) are considered separately.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=yes\n|+ '''2011 Census Homes'''<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n!Ward !!Detached  !!Semi-detached !!Terraced !!Flats and apartments !!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes/houseboats !!Shared between households\n|-\n|Dorking North\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 378\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 548\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 451\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 465\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0\t\n|-\n|Dorking South|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 865\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 695\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 417\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1,045\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3\n|}\n<br/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=yes\n|+ '''2011 Census Households'''<ref name=ons/>\n!Ward !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares\n|-\n|Dorking North\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4,157\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1,842|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 34\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 38\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 255\n|-\t\n|Dorking South\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7,001\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3,025\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 34\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 32\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 402\n|-\n|Regional average || || ||  style=\"text-align:center;\" | 35.1 ||  style=\"text-align:center;\" | 32.5 ||\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of places of worship in Mole Valley]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Nairn|first1=Ian|authorlink1=Ian Nairn|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner|title=The Buildings of England: Surrey|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=Harmondsworth|year=1971|origyear=1962|edition=2nd|isbn=0-300-09675-5|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Dorking}}\n* [http://www.mole-valley.gov.uk/ Mole Valley District Council]\n* {{dmoz|/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Surrey/Dorking/|Dorking}}\n* {{Exploring Surrey's Past |place=Dorking |access-date=30 December 2017 |fewer-links=yes}}\n\n{{Mole Valley}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dorking| ]]\n[[Category:Market towns in Surrey]]\n[[Category:Mole Valley]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Historic market town in Surrey, England}}\n{{About|the market town in Surrey}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox UK place\n|type = [[Market town]]\n|country = England\n|official_name = Dorking\n|map_type = Surrey\n|label_position= bottom\n|population = 11,185\n|population_ref = (2011 census)<ref name=ons>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk Key Statistics; Quick Statistics: Population Density] [[United Kingdom Census 2011]] ''[[Office for National Statistics]]'' Retrieved 20 December 2013</ref> or 17,098 (its Built-up Area) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=1119884849|title=Custom report - Nomis - Official Labour Market Statistics|website=www.nomisweb.co.uk}}</ref>\n|area_total_km2 = 6.57\n|civil_parish=n/a\n|shire_district= [[Mole Valley]]\n|shire_county = [[Surrey]]\n|region = South East England\n|constituency_westminster= [[Mole Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Mole Valley]]\n|post_town= Dorking\n|postcode_district= RH4\n|postcode_area=RH\n|dial_code= 01306\n|os_grid_reference= TQ165496\n|coordinates = {{coord|51.2340|-0.3318|display=inline,title}}\n|static_image_name = Dorking - geograph.org.uk - 788645.jpg\n|static_image_caption = Dorking from Denbies hillside, [[Ranmore Common]]\n|london_direction = NNE\n|london_distance_mi = 21\n}}\n[[File:Dorking South Street 1959.jpg|275px|thumb|South Street in Dorking in about 1959]]\n[[File:Dorking South Street 2009.jpg|thumb|275px|South Street in Dorking in May 2009]]\n'''Dorking''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|\u0254r|.|k|\u026a|\u014b}} is a [[market town]] in [[Surrey]], south east [[England]], {{convert|21|mi|km}} south of [[London]].<ref name=grf>{{cite web|title=UK Grid Reference Finder|url=http://www.gridreferencefinder.com/|publisher=UK Grid Reference Finder|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref> The main axis of the town runs east-west along the northern face of an outcrop of [[Lower Greensand Group|Lower Greensand]] and parallel to the course of the [[Pipp Brook]].

Dorking is a [[London Commuter Belt|commuter and retirement settlement]] with three railway stations and a few large offices of multinational companies.  Similarly, Malden in 1911, noted the place was \"almost entirely residential and agricultural, with some lime works on the chalk, though not so extensive as those in neighbouring parishes, a little brick-making, water-mills (corn) at Pixham Mill, and timber and saw-mills\". Fine sand often in veins of pink colour, used for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and in [[glassmaking]] was dug, particularly in the 19th century &mdash; the [[Dorking Caves]] were accordingly excavated under southern parts of the town centre itself.\n\n[[Dorking (chicken)|Dorking chicken]]s with short five-toed legs are a major local breed.  The town has a local government headquarters and hosts repeating loops of the FIA-ranked [[London-Surrey cycle classic]] elite category event every year.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe origins and meaning of the place-name are uncertain, and a subject of scholarly debate.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Rob |last=Briggs |title=Dorking, Surrey |journal=Journal of the English Place-Name Society |volume=50 |year=2018 |pages=17\u201354 }}</ref> Early spellings include ''Dorchinges'' (1086), ''Doreking{{'}}'' (1138\u201347), ''Dorkingg'' (1219), and other variants.<ref>Briggs 2018, p. 19.</ref> Both principal elements in the name are disputed. The first element may be from a personal name, ''Deorc'', or some variant, which might arguably be of either [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] or [[Old English]] origin; but it might equally be from a Brittonic word ''Dorce'', a river-name meaning \"clear, bright stream\"; or possibly from a British word ''duro'', meaning a \"fort\", \"walled town\" or \"gated place\". The second element, if originally plural (''\u2013ingas''), might mean \"(settlement belonging to the) followers of ...\", but if singular (''\u2013ing'') might mean \"place\", \"stream\", \"wood\" or \"clump\". The issue remains complex and unresolved.\n\n== History and development ==\n\nDorking began to become more than an agricultural village as a small staging post on [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]], the [[Roman road]] between London and [[Chichester]] on the [[English Channel]].\n\nDorking appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as the Manor of ''Dorchinges''. It was held by [[William the Conqueror]]. Its Domesday assets were: one church, three [[Mill (grinding)|mills]] worth 15s 4d, 16 [[plough]]s, {{convert|3|acre|ha|1}} of [[meadow]], [[woodland]] and herbage for 88 [[hog (swine)|hogs]].

One of them is buried in Dorking churchyard.  In the [[medieval period]], Dorking was a prosperous agricultural and market town with businesses, including milling and brewing, capitalising on its position on the junction of a number of long distance roads and local tracks.\n\nIn 1750, the construction of a [[Toll road|turnpike road]] made Dorking a staging post on the route to [[Brighton]] and the coast. The Bull's Head in South Street had a famous coachman, William Broad, whose portrait hangs in Dorking Museum in West Street. An inn in the centre of Dorking, the White Horse, was developed in the 18th century; previous buildings on this site belonged to the [[Knights Templar]] and later the [[Knights of Saint John|Knights of St John]].\n\nDorking held a big wheat and cattle market in the High Street. The poultry market was held in the corner of South Street and round Butter Hill. Here the famous [[Dorking (chicken)|Dorking fowl]] were sold. This breed, which has five claws instead of the normal four, was a favourite for 19th century tables, including that of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\nDorking lost its stagecoaches when the railways arrived, but then attracted wealthy residents who built large houses in and around the town, such as [[Denbies|Denbies House]] and Pippbrook House (now with council offices in the grounds). Surrounding land and beauty spots such as Cotmandene<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Recreation Areas and Parks|url=http://www.molevalley.gov.uk|publisher=Mole Valley Borough Council|date=February 2007}}</ref> and [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]] were donated by landowners for public use, protected by the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] and the [[Surrey Hills AONB|AONB]] designation of the [[North Downs]] and [[Greensand Ridge]].\n\nCotmandene is a {{convert|4.78|ha|acre|abbr=on|sigfig=2|adj=on}} area of [[common land]] to the east of the town centre, (the name is thought to mean ''the heath of the poor cottages'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://common-land.com/lands/view/790 |title=The Cotmandene, Chart Lane, Dorking |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Timms |first= John |title= A Picturesque Promenade Round Dorking, in Surrey |year= 1822 |publisher= John Warren |location= London |page=96}}</ref> Cricket matches were played on the heath during the 18th century and are recorded in Edward Beavan's 1777 poem ''Box Hill''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Box Hill, a descriptive poem |last= Beavan |first= E |year= 1777 |publisher= Wilkie |location= London }}</ref> A painting entitled ''A Cricket Match on Cotmandene, Dorking'' by the artist James Canter, dating to around 1770, is now held by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dorkingmuseum.org.uk/howzat/ |title=Howzat |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website= |publisher= Dorking Museum and Heritage Centre |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nA game resembling rugby was once played here.

The Town Crier kicked off the ball at 2 pm and stopped play at 6 pm. The game was started at the church gates and was \"rioted\" up and down the High Street. It ceased in 1897 after complaints by tradesmen and it was officially stopped under section 72 of the [[Highway Act 1835]].\n\nIn the 1880s there was a proposal to supply seawater to the town from a conduit between Lancing and London.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3016667/3016671|title=.SEA.-WATER SUPPLY.&#124;1880-12-11&#124;The Cardigan Observer and General Advertiser for the Counties of Cardigan Carmarthen and Pembroke - Welsh Newspapers|website=newspapers.library.wales}}</ref>\n\nDorking was an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] from 1894 to 1974.

Following the tradition established by Vaughan Williams, the [[St. Matthew Passion]] or the [[St. John Passion]] of [[J. S. Bach]] are also frequently performed by the combined choral societies.\n\nAfter the death of Vaughan Williams in 1958 the festival committee commissioned, from [[David McFall]] <small>[[Royal Academy of Arts|A.R.A.]]</small>, two identical bronze plaques with a likeness of the composer: one was placed in St. Martin's church and one in the Dorking Halls. In 2001 a smaller than life-size bronze statue of Vaughan Williams by William Fawke was erected outside the Dorking Halls.\n\n==Cultural references==\n''[[The Battle of Dorking]]'', a novella written by Lt. Col. Sir [[George Tomkyns Chesney]] in 1871, was set in the town. Describing a fictional invasion and conquest of Britain by a German-speaking country, it triggered an explosion of what came to be known as [[invasion literature]].\n\n==Demography and housing==\nIn groupings by such bodies as [[Surrey County Council]], the unparished area in terms of [[civil parishes in England]], [[North Holmwood]] is grouped with Dorking, and is subsidiary to the town as lacking many amenities and services. However, as with [[Westcott, Surrey|Westcott]], neighbouring settlements with their own church and a degree of physical divide (a hill and fields respectively) are considered separately.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=yes\n|+ '''2011 Census Homes'''<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n!Ward !!Detached  !!Semi-detached !!Terraced !!Flats and apartments !!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes/houseboats !!Shared between households\n|-\n|Dorking North\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 378\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 548\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 451\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 465\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0\t\n|-\n|Dorking South|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 865\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 695\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 417\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1,045\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3\n|}\n<br/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=yes\n|+ '''2011 Census Households'''<ref name=ons/>\n!Ward !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares\n|-\n|Dorking North\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4,157\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1,842|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 34\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 38\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 255\n|-\t\n|Dorking South\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7,001\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3,025\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 34\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 32\t|| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 402\n|-\n|Regional average || || ||  style=\"text-align:center;\" | 35.1 ||  style=\"text-align:center;\" | 32.5 ||\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of places of worship in Mole Valley]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Nairn|first1=Ian|authorlink1=Ian Nairn|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner|title=The Buildings of England: Surrey|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=Harmondsworth|year=1971|origyear=1962|edition=2nd|isbn=0-300-09675-5|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Dorking}}\n* [http://www.mole-valley.gov.uk/ Mole Valley District Council]\n* {{dmoz|/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Surrey/Dorking/|Dorking}}\n* {{Exploring Surrey's Past |place=Dorking |access-date=30 December 2017 |fewer-links=yes}}\n\n{{Mole Valley}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dorking| ]]\n[[Category:Market towns in Surrey]]\n[[Category:Mole Valley]]\n", "name_user": "Fuckbandit", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorking"}

Its features are focused on web browsing as well as [[email]]. For instance, one does not have to sign into AOL in order to use it as a regular browser. In addition, non-AOL email accounts can be accessed through it. Primary buttons include \"MAIL\", \"IM\", and several shortcuts to various web pages. The first two require users to sign in, but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication. AOL Desktop version 10.X was late marked as unsupported in favor of supporting the AOL Desktop 9.X versions.\n\nVersion 9.8 was released, replacing the Internet Explorer components of the internet browser with [[Chromium Embedded Framework|CEF]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beta.aol.com/|title=Beta \u2013 Main|website=beta.aol.com|access-date=July 27, 2016}}</ref> (Chromium Embedded Framework) to give users an improved web browsing experience closer to that of [[Google Chrome|Chrome]]\n\nVersion 11 of AOL Desktop, currently in Beta, is a total rewrite but maintains a similar user interface to the previous 9.8.X series of releases.<ref name=\"beta.aol.com\" />\n\nIn 2017, a new paid version called AOL Desktop Gold was released, available for $4.99 per month after trial.

The program dated back to AOL's early days, when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat. AOL provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms, and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate, and more lucrative than AOL's other services of the era. There were 33,000 community leaders in 1996.<ref name=\"wired1999\">{{Cite web|title = Inside AOL\u2019s \"Cyber-Sweatshop\"|url = https://www.wired.com/1999/10/volunteers/|website = WIRED|access-date = 2016-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref> All community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period. While most community leaders moderated chat rooms, some ran AOL communities and controlled their layout and design, with as much as 90% of AOL's content being created or overseen by community managers until 1996.<ref name=journal>{{cite journal|title=\nAmerica Online volunteers: Lessons from an early co-production community|author=Postigo, Hector|date=2009-09-03|volume=12|issue=5|pages=451\u2013469|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/10314787/America_Online_volunteers_Lessons_from_an_early_co-production_community|doi=10.1177/1367877909337858}}</ref>\n\nBy 1996, [[ISP]]s were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access, which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access. Even though AOL would lose money with such a pricing scheme, it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in October 1996. In order to return to profitability, AOL rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising, resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhkt_fUrGOkC&q=unlimited+#v=snippet&q=unlimited&f=false|author=Munk, Nina|pages=82\u201388|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref>\n\nAfter unlimited access, AOL considered scrapping the program entirely, but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders, with scaled-back roles in creating content.<ref name=journal /> Although community leaders continued to receive free access, after 1996 they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within AOL.<ref name=\"wired1999\"/><ref name=journal /> By 1999, there were over 15,000 volunteers in the program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Volunteers Sue AOL, Seeking Back Pay for Work|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/26/nyregion/former-volunteers-sue-aol-seeking-back-pay-for-work.html|date=1999-05-26|author=Napoli, Lisa|page=Section B, Page 10}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1999, two former volunteers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging AOL violated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] by treating volunteers like employees. Volunteers had to apply for the position, commit to working for at least three to four hours a week, fill out timecards and sign a non-disclosure agreement.<ref name=\"priceonomics\">{{Cite web|title = The Aol Chat Room Monitor Revolt|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-aol-chat-room-monitor-revolt/|website = Priceonomics|access-date = 2016-02-02}}</ref> On July 22, AOL ended its youth corps, which consisted of 350 underage community leaders.<ref name=\"wired1999\"/> At this time, the [[United States Department of Labor]] began an investigation into the program, but it came to no conclusions about AOL's practices.<ref name=\"priceonomics\" />\n\nAOL ended its community leader program on June 8, 2005. The class action lawsuit dragged on for years, even after AOL ended the program and AOL declined as a major internet company. In 2010, AOL finally agreed to settle the lawsuit for $15 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/aol_settled_with_unpaid_volunt.php|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|title=AOL Settled with Unpaid \u201cVolunteers\u201d for $15 Million|author=Kirchner, Lauren|date=2011-02-10}}</ref> The community leader program was found to be an example of [[Co-production (society)|co-production]] in a 2009 article in [[International Journal of Cultural Studies]].<ref name=journal />\n\n=== Billing disputes ===\nAOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]]. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.\n\nAOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Account cancellation ===\nMany customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or \"save\" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or \"save\" half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or \"save\" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum \"save\" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.\n\nOn August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\"/> However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.<ref name=\"pcworld.com\">{{cite magazine| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |magazine= PCWorld |accessdate= April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13447232 |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.<ref>Popken, Ben.

The program dated back to AOL's early days, when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat. AOL provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms, and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate, and more lucrative than AOL's other services of the era. There were 33,000 community leaders in 1996.<ref name=\"wired1999\">{{Cite web|title = Inside AOL\u2019s \"Cyber-Sweatshop\"|url = https://www.wired.com/1999/10/volunteers/|website = WIRED|access-date = 2016-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref> All community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period. While most community leaders moderated chat rooms, some ran AOL communities and controlled their layout and design, with as much as 90% of AOL's content being created or overseen by community managers until 1996.<ref name=journal>{{cite journal|title=\nAmerica Online volunteers: Lessons from an early co-production community|author=Postigo, Hector|date=2009-09-03|volume=12|issue=5|pages=451\u2013469|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/10314787/America_Online_volunteers_Lessons_from_an_early_co-production_community|doi=10.1177/1367877909337858}}</ref>\n\nBy 1996, [[ISP]]s were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access, which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access. Even though AOL would lose money with such a pricing scheme, it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in October 1996. In order to return to profitability, AOL rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising, resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhkt_fUrGOkC&q=unlimited+#v=snippet&q=unlimited&f=false|author=Munk, Nina|pages=82\u201388|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref>\n\nAfter unlimited access, AOL considered scrapping the program entirely, but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders, with scaled-back roles in creating content.<ref name=journal /> Although community leaders continued to receive free access, after 1996 they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within AOL.<ref name=\"wired1999\"/><ref name=journal /> By 1999, there were over 15,000 volunteers in the program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Volunteers Sue AOL, Seeking Back Pay for Work|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/26/nyregion/former-volunteers-sue-aol-seeking-back-pay-for-work.html|date=1999-05-26|author=Napoli, Lisa|page=Section B, Page 10}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1999, two former volunteers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging AOL violated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] by treating volunteers like employees. Volunteers had to apply for the position, commit to working for at least three to four hours a week, fill out timecards and sign a non-disclosure agreement.<ref name=\"priceonomics\">{{Cite web|title = The Aol Chat Room Monitor Revolt|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-aol-chat-room-monitor-revolt/|website = Priceonomics|access-date = 2016-02-02}}</ref> On July 22, AOL ended its youth corps, which consisted of 350 underage community leaders.<ref name=\"wired1999\"/> At this time, the [[United States Department of Labor]] began an investigation into the program, but it came to no conclusions about AOL's practices.<ref name=\"priceonomics\" />\n\nAOL ended its community leader program on June 8, 2005. The class action lawsuit dragged on for years, even after AOL ended the program and AOL declined as a major internet company. In 2010, AOL finally agreed to settle the lawsuit for $15 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/aol_settled_with_unpaid_volunt.php|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|title=AOL Settled with Unpaid \u201cVolunteers\u201d for $15 Million|author=Kirchner, Lauren|date=2011-02-10}}</ref> The community leader program was found to be an example of [[Co-production (society)|co-production]] in a 2009 article in [[International Journal of Cultural Studies]].<ref name=journal />\n\n=== Billing disputes ===\nAOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]]. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.\n\nAOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Account cancellation ===\nMany customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or \"save\" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or \"save\" half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or \"save\" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum \"save\" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.\n\nOn August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\"/> However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.<ref name=\"pcworld.com\">{{cite magazine| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |magazine= PCWorld |accessdate= April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> stating he had switched to broadband years earlier.

Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13447232 |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.<ref>Popken, Ben.

Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware.

However, as might be expected from a city as cosmopolitan as [[London]], there is a great diversity in the liturgy as celebrated by Catholics.  The [[Latin Mass Society]] celebrates the liturgy according to the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]. The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek Catholics]] have a strong presence in the diocese with their own cathedral in Binney Street close to [[Bond Street]].  There is a [[Maronite|Lebanese Maronite]] community based at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in Cirencester Street in West London; a [[Melkite]] community in [[Pimlico]], at St Barnabas' [[Church of England]] church; an [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Ethiopian Catholic]] church, Our Lady Queen of Heaven, in [[Queensway (London)|Queensway]] West London; an Eritrean Catholic church, St Aidan of Lindisfarne, in East Acton; a [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean Catholic]] church, St Anne's, in Laxton Place and a [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church|Belarusian Catholic]] church in Holden Avenue in North London. There are also a large number of Masses for the expatriate Polish community; as well as French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish language churches.\n\nThe diocese is also responsible for many chaplaincies, including [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], hospitals and prisons. See [[St. George's Interdenominational Chapel, Heathrow Airport]] for more information about the Heathrow Airport Latin-Church Catholic chaplaincy.\n\nThere are a large number of religious communities in the diocese.  Religious orders of men include: the [[Assumptionists]] at [[Bethnal Green]], [[Hitchin]] and Burnt Oak; the [[Augustinians]] at [[Hammersmith]] and Hoxton; the [[Augustinian Recollects]] at Kensal New Town, [[Kensington]] and [[Wembley]]; the Benedictines at [[Ealing Abbey]] and [[Cockfosters]]; the [[Carmelites]] at Finchley East; [[Discalced Carmelites]] at Kensington; the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] at [[Twickenham]]; the missionary [[Missionary Society of St. Columban|Columban Fathers]] at [[Hampstead]]; the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at Haverstock Hill; the [[Franciscans]] at Pimlico; the [[Society of the Atonement|Franciscan Friars of the Atonement]] in Westminster; the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] at New Barnett and [[Northwood, London|Northwood]]; and the [[Passionists]] at Highgate. The [[Jesuits]] have a large presence in London with communities in Mayfair (at Farm Street), Kensington, Kilburn, Osterley, Southall, Stamford Hill, Swiss Cottage and Willesden Green.  The [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorians]] are based at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in Kensington, which is popularly known as the [[Brompton Oratory]] and is the largest church in the diocese after [[Westminster Cathedral]].\n\nReligious communities of women include the Carmelites at [[Golders Green]] and Ware; the [[Poor Clares]] in Barnet; the Franciscan Sisters of Our Lady of Victories at the cathedral; the Ursulines of Jesus at Hoxton, Kingsland and Stamford Hill; the Dominicans at Bushey, Cricklewood, Ealing, [[Edgware]], Harpenden, Harrow on the Hill, Haverstock Hill, Hemel Hempstead, Osterley, Stevenage and Pinner.  The Institute of the BVM is located in Swiss Cottage, Acton, Osterley, Redbourn and [[St Albans]].  The [[Sisters of Mercy]] are located at the cathedral, Acton East, Bethnal Green, Bow, Clapton Park, Commercial Road, Cricklewood, Feltham, Hampton Hill, Hillingdon, Kensal, Newtown, Marylebone Road, St Albans, St John's Wood, Twickenham and Underwood Road.

Some 159 state and 10 independent [[primary schools]] are run by the diocese along with 42 state and 4 independent [[secondary schools]].  There are also a further five independent primary / secondary and special schools including the Choristers school attached to the cathedral.\n\nMusic in the diocese is as diverse as the communities represented in it, but the all-male [[Choir|cathedral choir]] is reputedly one of the best in the country <ref name=\"charleston\">{{Cite news|work=Charleston City Paper| author=Lindsay Koob| title= The world's finest academic choir takes its audience to choral heaven| date=4 June 2010| accessdate=14 December 2010| publisher= charlestoncitypaper.com| url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/the-worlds-finest-academic-choir-takes-its-audience-to-choral-heaven/Content?oid=2039699}}</ref><ref name=\"journal\">{{cite news| title=Palestrina: Westminster Cathedral Choir| publisher= thefreelibrary.com Reviews| work= The Journal (Newcastle, England)| author=Tom Hall| date=12 May 2003}}</ref> and sings at all chief Masses in the cathedral as well as the daily [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine offices]].

However, as might be expected from a city as cosmopolitan as [[London]], there is a great diversity in the liturgy as celebrated by Catholics.  The [[Latin Mass Society]] celebrates the liturgy according to the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]. The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek Catholics]] have a strong presence in the diocese with their own cathedral in Binney Street close to [[Bond Street]].  There is a [[Maronite|Lebanese Maronite]] community based at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in Cirencester Street in West London; a [[Melkite]] community in [[Pimlico]], at St Barnabas' [[Church of England]] church; an [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Ethiopian Catholic]] church, Our Lady Queen of Heaven, in [[Queensway (London)|Queensway]] West London; an Eritrean Catholic church, St Aidan of Lindisfarne, in East Acton; a [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean Catholic]] church, St Anne's, in Laxton Place and a [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church|Belarusian Catholic]] church in Holden Avenue in North London. There are also a large number of Masses for the expatriate Polish community; as well as French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish language churches.\n\nThe diocese is also responsible for many chaplaincies, including [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], hospitals and prisons. See [[St. George's Interdenominational Chapel, Heathrow Airport]] for more information about the Heathrow Airport Latin-Church Catholic chaplaincy.\n\nThere are a large number of religious communities in the diocese.  Religious orders of men include: the [[Assumptionists]] at [[Bethnal Green]], [[Hitchin]] and Burnt Oak; the [[Augustinians]] at [[Hammersmith]] and Hoxton; the [[Augustinian Recollects]] at Kensal New Town, [[Kensington]] and [[Wembley]]; the Benedictines at [[Ealing Abbey]] and [[Cockfosters]]; the [[Carmelites]] at Finchley East; [[Discalced Carmelites]] at Kensington; the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] at [[Twickenham]]; the missionary [[Missionary Society of St. Columban|Columban Fathers]] at [[Hampstead]]; the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at Haverstock Hill; the [[Franciscans]] at Pimlico; the [[Society of the Atonement|Franciscan Friars of the Atonement]] in Westminster; the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] at New Barnett and [[Northwood, London|Northwood]]; and the [[Passionists]] at Highgate. The [[Jesuits]] have a large presence in London with communities in Mayfair (at Farm Street), Kensington, Kilburn, Osterley, Southall, Stamford Hill, Swiss Cottage and Willesden Green.  The [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorians]] are based at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in Kensington, which is popularly known as the [[Brompton Oratory]] and is the largest church in the diocese after [[Westminster Cathedral]].\n\nReligious communities of women include the Carmelites at [[Golders Green]] and Ware; the [[Poor Clares]] in Barnet; the Franciscan Sisters of Our Lady of Victories at the cathedral; the Ursulines of Jesus at Hoxton, Kingsland and Stamford Hill; the Dominicans at Bushey, Cricklewood, Ealing, [[Edgware]], Harpenden, Harrow on the Hill, Haverstock Hill, Hemel Hempstead, Osterley, Stevenage and Pinner.  The Institute of the BVM is located in Swiss Cottage, Acton, Osterley, Redbourn and [[St Albans]].  The [[Sisters of Mercy]] are located at the cathedral, Acton East, Bethnal Green, Bow, Clapton Park, Commercial Road, Cricklewood, Feltham, Hampton Hill, Hillingdon, Kensal, Newtown, Marylebone Road, St Albans, St John's Wood, Twickenham and Underwood Road.  The Servants of the Mother of God at [[Bayswater]], [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] and [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]].\n\nThe diocese is involved in both the independent and state school sectors. Some 159 state and 10 independent [[primary schools]] are run by the diocese along with 42 state and 4 independent [[secondary schools]].  There are also a further five independent primary / secondary and special schools including the Choristers school attached to the cathedral.\n\nMusic in the diocese is as diverse as the communities represented in it, but the all-male [[Choir|cathedral choir]] is reputedly one of the best in the country <ref name=\"charleston\">{{Cite news|work=Charleston City Paper| author=Lindsay Koob| title= The world's finest academic choir takes its audience to choral heaven| date=4 June 2010| accessdate=14 December 2010| publisher= charlestoncitypaper.com| url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/the-worlds-finest-academic-choir-takes-its-audience-to-choral-heaven/Content?oid=2039699}}</ref><ref name=\"journal\">{{cite news| title=Palestrina: Westminster Cathedral Choir| publisher= thefreelibrary.com Reviews| work= The Journal (Newcastle, England)| author=Tom Hall| date=12 May 2003}}</ref> and sings at all chief Masses in the cathedral as well as the daily [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine offices]].
