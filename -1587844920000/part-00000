It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nAccording to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nAccording to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates, and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a positive critical response from critics despite moderate success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks an escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs of her drug abuse and implores her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]] and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation, and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated, and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me.

He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books.

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates, and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a positive critical response from critics despite moderate success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks an escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs of her drug abuse and implores her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]] and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation, and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated, and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me.

He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books.
