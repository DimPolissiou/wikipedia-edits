Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''''' is the eighth [[studio album]] by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]]. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom{{refn|group=nb|According to author Allen J. Wiener, the album's intended release date of 1 June has been \"traditionally observed\" over the ensuing decades, yet the true release date was 26 May.{{sfn|Wiener|1992|p=31}}}} and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and 15 weeks at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between [[popular music]] and [[high art]], and for reflecting the interests of [[Baby boomers|contemporary youth]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]]. It won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1968, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], the first rock [[LP record|LP]] to receive this honour.\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to [[London]] in November, [[Paul McCartney]] had an idea for a song involving an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] military band that formed the impetus of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept. Sessions began on 24 November at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", but after pressure from [[EMI]], the songs were released as a [[double A-side]] single and left off the album.\n\nIn February 1967, after recording [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|the title track]], McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This [[alter ego]] group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer [[George Martin]] and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], the group approached the [[Recording studio as an instrument|studio as an instrument]], colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|tableau of celebrities and historical figures]], was designed by the [[pop art]]ists [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jann Haworth]].\n\n''Sgt. Pepper'' is regarded by musicologists as an early [[concept album]] that advanced the use of [[Cyclic form|extended form]] in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including [[vaudeville]], [[Circus music|circus]], [[music hall]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Indian classical music]]. It is described as one of the first [[art rock]] LPs, a progenitor to [[progressive rock]], and the starting point of the [[album era]]. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Sgt. Pepper'' in the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"LoC2003\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it as the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|greatest album of all time]]. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album. Professor Kevin Dettmar, writing in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', described it as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".{{sfn|Dettmar|2006|p=139}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{quote box|quote= We were fed up with being the Beatles.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. Gould adds that McCartney's succumbing to peer pressure allowed Lennon \"to play the role of psychedelic guide\" to his songwriting partner, thereby facilitating a closer collaboration between the two than had been evident since early in the Beatles' career.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=388\u201389}} For his part, Lennon had turned deeply introspective during the filming of ''How I Won the War'' in southern Spain in September 1966. His anxiety over his and the Beatles' future was reflected in \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\",{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=332\u201333}} a song that provided the initial theme, regarding a Liverpool childhood, of the new album.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}} On his return to London, Lennon embraced the city's arts culture, of which McCartney was a part,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=88}} and shared his bandmate's interest in [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and [[Electronic music|electronic-music]] composers such as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[John Cage]] and [[Luciano Berio]].{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=165}}{{sfn|Prendergast|2003|p=193}}\n\nIn November, during his and Evans' return flight from Kenya, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the ''Sgt.

Pepper'' reflect the Beatles' general immersion in the [[blues]], [[Motown]] and other American popular musical traditions.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=62}} The author [[Ian MacDonald]] writes that when reviewing their rivals' recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', which [[Brian Wilson]], the band's leader, had created in response to the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215}} McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on ''Pet Sounds'', and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=197}} He identified ''Pet Sounds'' as his main musical inspiration for ''Sgt. Pepper'', adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\",{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=204}} although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=253}} ''[[Freak Out!]]'' by [[the Mothers of Invention]] has also been cited as having influenced ''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=160}} According to the biographer [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], during the recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \"This is our ''Freak Out!''\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=158}} The music journalist [[Chet Flippo]] stated that McCartney was inspired to record a [[concept album]] after hearing ''Freak Out!''{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=160}}\n\n[[Indian music]] was another touchstone on ''Sgt. Pepper'', principally for Lennon and Harrison.{{sfn|Reck|2008|pp=69, 72\u201373}} In a 1967 interview, Harrison said that the Beatles' ongoing success had encouraged them to continue developing musically and that, given their standing, \"We can do things that please us without conforming to the standard pop idea. We are not only involved in pop music, but all music.\"{{sfn|Philo|2015|p=119}} McCartney envisioned the Beatles' alter egos being able to \"do a bit of [[B.B. King]], a bit of Stockhausen, a bit of [[Albert Ayler]], a bit of Ravi Shankar, a bit of ''Pet Sounds'', a bit of [[the Doors]]\".{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=19}} He saw the group as \"pushing frontiers\" similar to other composers of the time, even though the Beatles did not \"necessarily like what, say, Berio was doing\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005}}\n\n== Recording and production ==\n===Recording history===\n[[File:Abbeyroadtomswain.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colour image of a large room with a piano in the middle|[[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road Studio Two]], where nearly every track on ''Sgt.

Pepper'' marks the beginning of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote more than half of the album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}}{{refn|group=nb|In Emerick's opinion, the recording of ''Sgt.

When the decision was made to re-record the basic track, Starr was summoned to the studio, but called off soon afterwards as the focus switched from rhythm to vocal tracking.{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=270}} Much of the bass guitar on the album was mixed upfront.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=52}} Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song's backing track. This approach afforded him the time to devise bass lines that were melodically adventurous \u2013 one of the qualities he especially admired in Wilson's work on ''Pet Sounds'' \u2013 and complemented the song's final arrangement.<ref>{{harvnb|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=169\u201370}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=281}}: \"one of the qualities he especially admired on ''Pet Sounds''\".</ref> McCartney played a [[grand piano]] on \"[[A Day in the Life]]\" and a [[Lowrey organ]] on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", while Martin played a [[Hohner Pianet]] on \"Getting Better\", a [[harpsichord]] on \"[[Fixing a Hole]]\" and a [[pump organ|harmonium]] on \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\"<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=104}}: Lowrey organ on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=106}}: Hohner Pianet on \"Getting Better\", {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=107}}: harpsichord on \"Fixing a Hole\"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=110}}: harmonium on \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=120}}: grand piano on \"A Day in the Life\".</ref>\n\nAlthough Harrison's role as lead guitarist was limited during the sessions, Everett considers that \"his contribution to the album is strong in several ways.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=100}} In addition to providing sitar and [[Tanpura|tambura]] on his composition \"[[Within You Without You]]\", and [[swarmandal]] on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", Harrison played tambura on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"Getting Better\".{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=104, 106, 111}}{{refn|group=nb|In a 2017 interview, Starr said with regard to Harrison's guitar contributions: \"Actually, Paul and I were talking about him when we were both listening to ''Sgt Pepper's'' for the [50th] anniversary and saying how important George's work on guitar was on that record.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/ringo-starr-the-voice-behind-the-yellow-submarine-and-tank-engine-returns-on-give-more-love/news-story/c5eb865f1b73a574e82930ff04f4bb92|first=Kathy|last=McCabe|title=Ringo Starr: The voice behind the yellow submarine and tank engine returns on Give More Love|work=[[news.com.au]]|date=17 September 2017|accessdate=2 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202095605/https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/ringo-starr-the-voice-behind-the-yellow-submarine-and-tank-engine-returns-on-give-more-love/news-story/c5eb865f1b73a574e82930ff04f4bb92|archive-date=2 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} As on ''Revolver'',{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=112}} the Beatles also increasingly used session musicians, particularly for classical-inspired arrangements.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=197}} Norman comments that Lennon's prominent vocal on some of McCartney's songs \"hugely enhanced their atmosphere\", particularly \"[[Lovely Rita]]\".{{sfn|Norman|2016|p=263}}\n\nWithin an hour of completing the last overdubs on the album's songs, on 20 April 1967, the group returned to Harrison's \"[[Only a Northern Song]]\", the basic track of which they had taped in February.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=109}} The Beatles overdubbed random sounds and instrumentation before submitting it as the first of four new songs they were contracted to supply to [[United Artists]] for inclusion in the animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=102}} In author [[Mark Lewisohn]]'s description, it was a \"curious\" session, but one that demonstrated the Beatles' \"tremendous appetite for recording\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=109}} During the ''Sgt.

ADT was invented by Townsend during the ''Revolver'' sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=216}} Another important effect was [[Pitch shift|varispeeding]], a technique that the Beatles used extensively on ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Martin cites \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" as having the most variations of tape speed on ''Sgt.

During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=105}} For the album's title track, the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of [[Damping (music)|damping]] and [[Microphone practice#Basic techniques|close-miking]].

He also said that in the context of 1967, ''Sgt.

But it couldn't be done, because only the Beatles can put out an album by the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=188}}{{refn|group=nb|Everett similarly characterises ''Their Satanic Majesties Request'' and the [[Small Faces]]' ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'' as ''Sgt.

He added that [[the Velvet Underground]]'s ''[[The Velvet Underground & Nico]]'', an album that contrasted sharply with the Beatles' message by \"offer[ing] no escape\", became more relevant in a cultural climate typified by \"the [[Sex Pistols]], the new political aggression, the rioting in the streets\" during the 1970s.<ref name=\"Frith/HoR\" /> In a 1987 review for ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, [[Charles Shaar Murray]] asserted that ''Sgt.

Ned Rorem and Leonard Bernstein.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=155}} According to Rodriguez, an element of exaggeration accompanied some of the acclaim for ''Sgt.

Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Lydon|title=Paul Williams ''Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music''|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 April 1969|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== Studio as instrument ===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\n{{quote box|quote= Equal credit [for ''Sgt.

The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167}}\n\nIn his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', David Howard says that many acts, \"from the Rolling Stones to [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] to the [[Ultimate Spinach]]\", soon imitated the album's innovative production techniques, and that as a result of ''Sgt. Pepper'', the producer's role \"ballooned almost overnight\".{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=31}} In this regard, Lennon and McCartney complained that Martin had received too much attention for his role in the album's creation,{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=172\u201373}} so beginning a feeling of resentment by the Beatles towards their longtime producer.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=489}}{{refn|group=nb|The group were particularly annoyed that ''Time'' had referred to ''Sgt.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''''' is the eighth [[studio album]] by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]]. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom{{refn|group=nb|According to author Allen J. Wiener, the album's intended release date of 1 June has been \"traditionally observed\" over the ensuing decades, yet the true release date was 26 May.{{sfn|Wiener|1992|p=31}}}} and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and 15 weeks at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between [[popular music]] and [[high art]], and for reflecting the interests of [[Baby boomers|contemporary youth]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture]]. It won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1968, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], the first rock [[LP record|LP]] to receive this honour.\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday. During a return flight to [[London]] in November, [[Paul McCartney]] had an idea for a song involving an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] military band that formed the impetus of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' concept. Sessions began on 24 November at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] with two compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", but after pressure from [[EMI]], the songs were released as a [[double A-side]] single and left off the album.\n\nIn February 1967, after recording [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|the title track]], McCartney suggested that the album represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This [[alter ego]] group further inspired the band to experiment artistically. During the recording sessions, there was no thought of reproducing the songs in concert, and the band were free to continue the technological experimentation marked by their previous album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer [[George Martin]] and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], the group approached the [[Recording studio as an instrument|studio as an instrument]], colouring much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", \"[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]\" and \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a [[List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|tableau of celebrities and historical figures]], was designed by the [[pop art]]ists [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jann Haworth]].\n\n''Sgt. Pepper'' is regarded by musicologists as an early [[concept album]] that advanced the use of [[Cyclic form|extended form]] in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. An important work of British [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including [[vaudeville]], [[Circus music|circus]], [[music hall]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Indian classical music]]. It is described as one of the first [[art rock]] LPs, a progenitor to [[progressive rock]], and the starting point of the [[album era]]. In 2003, the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Sgt. Pepper'' in the [[National Recording Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"LoC2003\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it as the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|greatest album of all time]]. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011, and remains the UK's best-selling studio album. Professor Kevin Dettmar, writing in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'', described it as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".{{sfn|Dettmar|2006|p=139}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{quote box|quote= We were fed up with being the Beatles.

Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=229}} In June that year, two days after finishing the album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', the group set off for a [[The Beatles' 1966 tour of Germany, Japan and the Philippines|tour that started in West Germany]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} While in [[Hamburg]] they received an anonymous telegram stating: \"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\"{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}} The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred [[Nippon Budokan]] arena.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}} As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewisohn|2010|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}}.</ref> The Beatles then performed in the [[Philippines]], where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]].

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. Gould adds that McCartney's succumbing to peer pressure allowed Lennon \"to play the role of psychedelic guide\" to his songwriting partner, thereby facilitating a closer collaboration between the two than had been evident since early in the Beatles' career.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=388\u201389}} For his part, Lennon had turned deeply introspective during the filming of ''How I Won the War'' in southern Spain in September 1966. His anxiety over his and the Beatles' future was reflected in \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\",{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=332\u201333}} a song that provided the initial theme, regarding a Liverpool childhood, of the new album.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}} On his return to London, Lennon embraced the city's arts culture, of which McCartney was a part,{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|p=88}} and shared his bandmate's interest in [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and [[Electronic music|electronic-music]] composers such as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[John Cage]] and [[Luciano Berio]].{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=165}}{{sfn|Prendergast|2003|p=193}}\n\nIn November, during his and Evans' return flight from Kenya, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the ''Sgt.

Pepper'' reflect the Beatles' general immersion in the [[blues]], [[Motown]] and other American popular musical traditions.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=62}} The author [[Ian MacDonald]] writes that when reviewing their rivals' recent work in late 1966, the Beatles identified the most significant LP as [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', which [[Brian Wilson]], the band's leader, had created in response to the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215}} McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on ''Pet Sounds'', and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=197}} He identified ''Pet Sounds'' as his main musical inspiration for ''Sgt. Pepper'', adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\",{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=204}} although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=253}} ''[[Freak Out!]]'' by [[the Mothers of Invention]] has also been cited as having influenced ''Sgt.

Pepper'' recordings made extensive use of [[Ping-pong recording|reduction mixing]], a technique in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio.<ref>{{cite liner notes|last=Lewisohn|first=Mark|year=2009|title=Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band| publisher=Apple/EMI Records|p=29}}</ref> EMI's [[Studer]] J37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=199}} When recording the orchestra for \"A Day in the Life\", Martin synchronised a four-track recorder playing the Beatles' backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer [[Ken Townsend]] devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50&nbsp;Hz control signal between the two machines.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=244}}\n\n{{quote box|quote= Listening to each stage of their recording, once they've done the first couple of tracks, it's often hard to see what they're still looking for, it sounds so complete.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\" was the first example of the Beatles recording via direct injection (DI), which Townsend devised as a method for plugging electric guitars directly into the recording console.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=170}} In Womack's opinion, the use of DI on the album's title track \"afforded McCartney's bass with richer textures and tonal clarity\".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=170}}\n\nSome of the mixing employed [[automatic double tracking]] (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. ADT was invented by Townsend during the ''Revolver'' sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who regularly expressed a desire for a technical alternative to having to record doubled lead vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2010|p=216}} Another important effect was [[Pitch shift|varispeeding]], a technique that the Beatles used extensively on ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Martin cites \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" as having the most variations of tape speed on ''Sgt. Pepper''. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=105}} For the album's title track, the recording of Starr's drum kit was enhanced by the use of [[Damping (music)|damping]] and [[Microphone practice#Basic techniques|close-miking]].

We were all conscious that we were doing something that was great.\" He said that while McCartney effectively led the project, and sometimes annoyed his bandmates, \"Paul appreciated John's contribution on ''Pepper''.

Pepper'', you had to try to write something as good as ''Sgt. Pepper''. Because, of course, what made that record beautiful was the beautiful response it created in you; if your written response was true to your listening response, the writing would stand on its own as a creation on par with the record.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Lydon|title=Paul Williams ''Outlaw Blues: A Book of Rock Music''|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 April 1969|p=}}</ref>\n\n=== Studio as instrument ===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\n{{quote box|quote= Equal credit [for ''Sgt.

Pepper'' \"people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance.\"{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167}}\n\nIn his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', David Howard says that many acts, \"from the Rolling Stones to [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]] to the [[Ultimate Spinach]]\", soon imitated the album's innovative production techniques, and that as a result of ''Sgt.

Between its inception in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] in 1885 and 1907, the club competed in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), winning two premierships. Richmond joined the Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1908 and has since won twelve premierships, most recently in 2019.\n\nRichmond's headquarters and training facilities are located at its original home ground, the [[Punt Road Oval]], which sits adjacent to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG), the club's playing home since 1965.

Richmond Cricket Club]. Accessed 7 August 2007.</ref>\n\nAt first the team wore blue [[guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]]s and caps with yellow and black stripes in the style of the Richmond Cricket Club. The football club soon adopted yellow and black as its official colours. The team was variously called the \"Richmondites\", the \"Wasps\" or, most commonly, the \"Tigers\".\n\nDuring the late 1880s, Richmond struggled to make an impression in the VFA, and after a promising season in 1888 (when they finished fifth with eleven wins), the club slipped backwards, in the process losing players to more successful sides. As the local economy slipped into severe [[Recession|depression]] in the early 1890s and the crowds began to dwindle, some of the VFA's strongest clubs began to agitate for a reform of the competition. Richmond was not considered part of this elite group, which usually [[Voting bloc|voted as a ''bloc'']] at VFA meetings.\n\nIn 1896, Richmond [[wiktionary:forfeit|walked off the field]] in a match against [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] to protest the umpiring, and later in the season, the Tigers had their half-time score annulled against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] when it was discovered that they had too many men on the ground. In the closing three weeks of the season, Richmond's cut of the gate takings amounted to just five pounds, and they finished the season with the wooden spoon.\n\n[[File:Alec Redmond Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Alec Edmond captained Richmond from 1901 to his retirement in 1907.]]\nIn October 1896, the cabal of six strong clubs broke with the association to form the [[VFL/AFL|Victorian Football League]] (VFL). As a struggling club with a poor following, Richmond was not invited to join the new league. Richmond's performances did not immediately improve in the emaciated VFA until the turn of the century.\n\nThe Tigers were boosted by a significant country recruit in 1901. [[George Sidney Johnson|George \"Mallee\" Johnson]] was an instant sensation and the first true star player at the club. Richmond leapt to third place and then in 1902, with Johnson dominating the ruck, Richmond entered the closing weeks of the season neck and neck with [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] at the head of the ladder, but Port Melbourne faltered against [[Williamstown Football Club|Williamstown]] to hand Richmond its first flag.\n\nHaving missed a potential bonanza from a premiership play-off, the VFA decided to emulate the VFL and introduce a finals series in 1903, a fateful decision for the Tigers. After recruiting the competition's leading goalkicker, [[Jack Hutchinson]], and finishing the season as [[Minor premiership|minor premier]], Richmond lost both finals and were [[runner-up]]. The following season, the club became embroiled in a feud with umpire Allen, whom the Tigers accused of failing to curb field invasions or the dubious tactics of arch-rival [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]]. When the two clubs were scheduled to meet in the [[1904 VFA Grand Final]], Richmond announced that they wouldn't play with Allen as umpire. The VFA called Richmond's bluff, and appointed Allen as umpire for the match, meaning that the Grand Final was scratched and North Melbourne won the premiership on forfeit.\n\nRichmond were now openly at odds with the VFA, and matters failed to improve in the next few years. The club was campaigning against violence (both on-field and among the crowd), ungentlemanly conduct and poor sportsmanship, issues that plagued the VFA to a far greater extent than the rival VFL since the 1896 split. Richmond cultivated links with some VFL clubs by playing practice matches against them. Richmond knew that they were a major asset to the VFA, had built up a large following and played on one of the best grounds in the competition, where they remained unbeaten for five years. In 1905, Richmond confirmed their status with a second premiership, this time overcoming bitter rivals [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], \"Mallee\" Johnson had moved to Carlton, but youngster [[Charlie Ricketts]] dominated the season and won plaudits among the pressmen, who voted him the best player in the VFA.\n\nHowever, Ricketts was also lost to the VFL and injury hit the club hard. In 1906\u201307, the Tigers played finals without looking likely to win the flag. The club earned a rebuke from the VFA for scheduling a practice match against Geelong before the 1907 season, then went ahead with the commitment and earned further censure. Later in the year it became clear that the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] wanted to expand its competition and Richmond won a place ahead of North Melbourne, which had been strengthened by an amalgamation with the bankrupt West Melbourne as part of their bid. Richmond were granted admission along with the now defunct [[University Football Club]].\n\n===Entry into the VFL (1908\u20131944)===\n[[File:FrankTudorPEO.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The Hon. Frank Tudor, federal leader of the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]], was president of Richmond during World War I]]\nThe first few seasons in the VFL were less than spectacular. Although the club turned up some star players, it let a lot of talent leave and the administration was unstable after [[George Henry Bennett|George Bennett]]'s death at the end of the 1908 season. In 1916, the side played in the finals for the first time, however, with [[World War I]] having reduced the competition to just four clubs, finals qualification was automatic.\n\nFinally, in 1919, Richmond made their first [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] appearance, losing to [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]. Richmond stoked a rivalry with Collingwood by recruiting their former skipper [[Dan Minogue]] as playing coach and gained vengeance by beating Collingwood in the [[1920 VFL Grand Final]] to secure a first flag in the big league. This was followed by an even better performance the next year. The only club that continued to beat Richmond on a regular basis was Carlton. Finishing [[List of Australian Football League minor premiers|minor premier]] with only one loss for the season in 1921, Carlton were the hottest premiership favourite, yet Richmond managed to beat them in two classic finals matches played over successive weeks to go back-to-back.\n\n[[File:Richmond fc 1920.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Richmond team that won its first VFL premiership in 1920]]\nThe rest of the decade saw four more Grand Final appearances, all of which would end in frustration. From 1927 to 1929 Richmond became the first club in the VFL to lose three consecutive Grand Finals, all of which were to neighbouring archrivals, Collingwood.\n\nThe next VFL flag came in 1932, with Richmond's triumph over Carlton in a tough encounter which saw Richmond [[Centre line (football)|wingman]] [[Alan Geddes]] play the second half with a broken jaw. Another premiership came in 1934, this time against South Melbourne's famed \"Foreign Legion\", avenging Richmond's loss in the [[1933 VFL Grand Final]].\n\n[[File:Jack Dyer.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Richmond legend [[Jack Dyer]] played 19 consecutive seasons for the club, scoring 443 goals]]\nPrior to the commencement of the 1940 season, internal problems were brewing between the key personalities at the club. Some felt that the uneven performance of the team was due to [[Percy Bentley]]'s coaching methods, and that he should be replaced. [[Jack Dyer]] walked out on the club and threatened to play in the VFA after his father, a committeeman who was involved with the anti-Bentley faction, lost his position at the board elections. Finally, the matter was resolved and Bentley kept his job, while Dyer returned to training on the eve of the season. The problems appeared to have been solved when Richmond won the semi-final against Melbourne to go straight into the [[1940 VFL Grand Final]]. However, Melbourne reversed this result with a crushing win to pinch the premiership. Richmond had been out-thought by their old mentor [[Frank 'Checker' Hughes]], who had assigned a tagger to negate Dyer. Dyer was furious that Bentley had done nothing to prevent his opponent taking him out of the game. The Richmond committee agreed with this assessment, so when Bentley (after retiring as a player) attempted to negotiate a higher fee to continue his coaching tenure, he was rebuffed. Incensed, Bentley quit Punt Road and moved to Carlton as coach, adding further spice to an already fierce rivalry between the two clubs.\n\nDespite the tribulations created by the Second World War, Richmond was able to maintain a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had quite a lot of players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}{{examples|date=February 2014}} Dyer was a fearsome presence in his role as playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the [[1942 VFL Grand Final]] to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. [[Jack Titus]] set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling [[1943 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot who had been killed in action a few weeks before the match. But another Grand Final loss followed in [[1944 VFL Grand Final|1944]], when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day.\n\n===Tough times at Tigerland (1945\u20131965)===\nIn the immediate post-war era, despite an influx of excellent new players, Richmond struggled to make the four, appearing in the finals only once, in 1947. Dyer continued on as coach for three years after his playing retirement at the end of 1949, but was asked to retire by the committee who felt the club needed a shake up. Under a succession of coaches in the 1950s, With the demands of potential players increasing with each passing year, the club refused to allocate sufficient funds to recruit and they failed to replace star players as they retired. When stalwarts such as [[Des Rowe]] and dual-[[Brownlow Medal]]list [[Roy Wright (footballer)|Roy Wright]] left, the team slumped dramatically and finished with a [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in 1960.\n\nIn 1962 [[Graeme Richmond]] was appointed Secretary of the club, Richmond was the under 19's coach who had been around the club since the early 1950s as a junior player until knee injury stopped him from playing so he took on coaching.  Graeme understood that for Richmond to improve so would the recruiting. A shrewd businessman, Richmond was able to sign young recruits for bargain like fees. [[Royce Hart]] was given a suit and six shirts, and Kevin Bartlett simply walked in off the street. Graeme kept a close eye on the success former player Tom Hafey was having with Shepparton in the [[Goulburn Valley Football League]]. When coach Len Smith had a heart attack in 1965, the club appointed Jack Titus to serve as interim coach until a replacement could be found. Hafey was encouraged to apply, and the decision came down to Hafey and former club captain Ron Branton. Many expected Branton to get the job. However, Graeme Richmond saw something special in Hafey and he was appointed coach for the 1966 season.\n\n===Success through Hafey Era (1966\u20131982)===\n[[File:Kevin Bartlett.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Kevin Bartlett outside the MCG]]\n1966 heralded the start of the [[Tom Hafey]] era. Hafey, a former player of the club, was appointed coach and brought with him a couple of quality young footballers from northern Victoria.  Out of the Goulburn Valley came [[Dick Clay]] from Kyabram and [[Francis Bourke]] from Nathalia. Further afield were [[Doug Strang]] and [[John Perry (footballer)|John Perry]] from Albury and Wodonga.\n\nOn his return to Richmond, Hafey found the team had acquired a number of young, high quality players, [[Kevin Bartlett (Australian rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]] was a skinny 17 year old who lived locally walked in and asked for a tryout. [[Michael Green (Australian rules footballer)|Mike Green]] followed Kevin a year later. Even so, he quickly put his stamp on the club, bringing intensity and desire to reach the top. Although he acknowledged the ideas and tactical approach of Len Smith (who remained at the club as a selector and consultant), Hafey opted for what became his trademark style: kick the ball long and quickly into the forward line. He raised the bar for fitness among his players,[4] extending pre-season training and introducing a third training night during the week. Richmond quickly became known for being the fittest team in the competition.\n\nRichmond began 1966 strongly. A month before the finals, they hit the top of the ladder for the first time since 1951 and seemed certain to play in September. However, two losses dropped the Tigers to fifth place with thirteen wins and a draw.  Richmond dismissed a number of players, replacing them with new players such as [[Royce Hart]], Kevin Sheedy and [[Francis Bourke]].\n\nRichmond dominated the 1967 season, running out winners in a classic Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to the toast of the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked a turning point for the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that had gone before and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, after two decades of defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and betters standards of fitness. They won the 1967 flag in a thrilling encounter with Geelong, ending a 24-year premiership drought.\n\nThe Tigers started the 1968 season slowly. They rallied to win the last six games, but missed the finals. When the Tigers were again lethargic in mid-1969, accusations of under-achievement arose and rumours that Hafey was on the way out circulated.  The players rallied behind Hafey and finished the season strong, taking fourth place. The team won all three finals, beat the much fancied Carlton in the [[1969 VFL Grand Final]] by 25 points.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 1970, Hafey took the Tigers to the finals for the next five years. Basing the team's strategy around all-out attack had drawbacks. Richmond were dominant in 1972 and were hot favourites in the [[1972 VFL Grand Final]] against Carlton. However, Carlton stunned Richmond in a game of ridiculous high scoring. Even Richmond equalled the then record highest score in a Grand Final of 22.18 (150), but Carlton beat it with 28.9 (177). Richmond got their revenge in an intensely physical clash in the [[1973 VFL Grand Final]] and went back-to-back in [[1974 VFL Grand Final|1974]] with a strong win against a resurgent North Melbourne.\n\nBy now, the aggressive attitude of the club both on and off the field had created resentment toward the club. A number of incidents during the 1973 Grand Final \u2013 the Windy Hill brawl, the attempted recruitment of [[John Pitura]] from South Melbourne and a poor reaction to Kevin Bartlett's failure to win the Brownlow medal \u2013 all focussed negative attention on the club. Hafey, however, used the resentment to his advantage, telling his players \"it's Richmond against the world\".\n\nRichmond showed signs of ageing in 1975, when they lost in the preliminary final. Triple Brownlow medallist, [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] retired, [[Paul Sproule]] returned to Hobart, [[Brian Roberts (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Roberts]] and two others were part of the John Pitura trade. A raft of other player departures made for a poor 1976 season, Hart spent most of the year nursing a knee and Dick Clay opted to retire. The Tigers finishing seventh, Hafey's worst ever result. Internally the Richmond board bickering had flared into the public domain. It took a majority vote for Hafey to be reappointed for 1977, but not unanimously (he had no contract with Richmond, instead being appointed on a year-to-year basis). When it leaked that [[Graeme Richmond]], the club's powerbroker, had voted against Hafey's reappointment Hafey immediately resigned.\n\nThe club appointed dual premiership player [[Barry Richardson (Australian footballer)|Barry Richardson]] as coach for two seasons before he was replaced by Tony Jewell. Richmond won its next premiership under Jewell with a then record-breaking margin of 81 points over arch-rivals Collingwood in [[1980 VFL Grand Final|1980]]. After reaching and losing the [[1982 VFL Grand Final]], it has been a rocky road for Richmond who have struggled to come to grips with the rules and regulations of a modernised VFL, including the [[AFL Draft|draft]] and [[salary cap]]. The successes of the early 1980s were bought at high financial cost through expensive recruiting, and were followed by severe cut backs that saw several top players depart.\n\n===Recruiting war (1983\u20131986)===\nStill smarting from the loss of star players to Collingwood, Richmond set themselves for war with Collingwood in 1984 by signing three of their players: [[John Annear]], [[Craig Stewart (Australian footballer)|Craig Stewart]] and [[Phil Walsh (Australian footballer)|Phil Walsh]]. Not only were there big contracts and transfer fees to pay, but the costs of an expensive court action as well.\n\nRichmond also signed a number of mediocre players on big contracts, and the club's financial situation took a battering. With the team failing to improve, a challenge to the committee was brewing and Richmond's traditional political stability threatened. The rebel group, organised by long-time servant Bill Durham, convinced former player and coach [[Barry Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Barry Richardson]] to be leader. An election in late 1984 failed to clarify the situation.\n\nIan Wilson held on to the presidency into the new year. When the one hundredth birthday of the club arrived in February 1985, there was too much dissension to mark the moment fittingly. Eventually, Wilson handed over to Richardson, who had selected his former premiership teammate [[Paul Sproule]] to return from [[Tasmania]] and take over the coaching position on a guaranteed contract.\n\nAs the season progressed with Richmond still struggling, Sproule came under pressure. Richardson guaranteed his position, but at the end of the year, the committee overruled Richardson and sacked Sproule. Incensed, Richardson walked out of Punt Road, which was in turmoil again. Desperately, Richmond turned back to [[Tony Jewell (footballer)|Tony Jewell]], who was appointed coach for a second time, the only man in the club's history to get a second go at the job. Jewell later commented on the destruction wrought on the club during his four-year absence: \"the supporters were gone, the members were gone, the money was gone, ... a real shame.\"\n\nWith the competition set to expand, Richmond made a number of misguided moves in 1986. To fill the vacancy left by Richardson, Richmond wooed high-flying West Australian entrepreneur [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] to become president. Bond came with an agenda to raise money for the club by listing on the stockmarket and relocating to [[Brisbane]]. When the latter plan was revealed in the media, a furious reaction from supporters and high-profile club personalities buried the proposal almost immediately. Early in 1987, Bond's tenure at the club ended in farce when he resigned without presiding over a single game. The off-field confusion was reflected in the players' performance as Richmond slumped to only its second wooden spoon in 70 years.\n\n===''Save Our Skins'' and a return to the finals (1987\u20131995)===\n[[File:Matthew Richardson media.jpg|thumb|upright|Debuting for Richmond in 1993, Matthew Richardson went on to become one of the league's leading goal kickers.]]\nAlthough the new president, ex-captain [[Neville Crowe]], had stabilised the club and scored a coup by persuading club legend [[Kevin Bartlett (Aussie Rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]] to coach, The club managed to stay solvent by cutting expenses to the bone and paying only two-thirds of the allowable salary cap. But there was no money for recruiting to improve an impoverished playing list. The club struggled to come to terms with the draft after its inception in 1986, and made a number of poor choices\u2014notably, the number one pick in 1987 was used on a player who had only four games with Richmond.\n\nFinally, with the economy in serious recession and interest rates touching seventeen per cent, Richmond's creditors came knocking. At one point, an attempt was made to seize the club's 1973 and 1974 premiership trophies as securities for unpaid debts, an embarrassing situation. For a number of years, the exact amount that the club owed was not publicly known. After Bartlett came Allan Jeans, who then passed the job to ex-Richmond premiership player [[John Northey]] for 1993. Northey returned the team to the simple long-kicking style of the halcyon days under the legendary Tom Hafey. Along with some draft concessions granted by the AFL, Northey's efforts gradually improved Richmond. The team fumbled an opportunity to make the 1994 finals, then opened [[1995 AFL season|1995]] with its best start to a season in 75 years and eventually made it to the preliminary final. With a talented playing list and a strong administration led by Leon Daphne (Richmond's first president from the corporate world, the Alan Bond farce aside), Richmond looked set to become regular finalists again.\n\n===Lost opportunities (1996\u20132004)===\nThe anticipated success failed to materialise, partly because Richmond allowed the coaching position to again become unstable. With over a year still to run on his contract, John Northey demanded a contract extension that the club refused. This was because of a rumour that some people with an association with the club were pursuing Essendon coach and former Richmond premiership player [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. So Northey walked out on Richmond and accepted a longer-term contract to coach the [[Brisbane Bears]]. Richmond, caught short, appointed the Bears' ex-coach [[Robert Walls]] for 1996. After several humiliating thrashings in 1997, [[Robert Walls]] became the first Richmond coach to be sacked mid-season. After two-and-a-half seasons under [[Jeff Gieschen]], the club appointed ex-St Kilda captain [[Danny Frawley]]. After a Preliminary Final appearance in Frawley's second season, Richmond overestimated the strength of the list and settled for trading for established players rather than drafting youth. Over the next three seasons, the team managed just 18 wins. The administration continued to support Frawley and ensured that he would see out his contract, a far cry from the way many of his predecessors were treated. However, midway through the 2004 season (a season in which Richmond only managed 4 wins, and lost their last 14 H&A matches), Frawley announced he would be relinquishing his role as Richmond coach at seasons' end.\n\n===Beginning to rebuild and another wooden spoon (2005\u20132007)===\n{{See also|Richmond Football Club season 2007}}\nThe 2005 pre-season began with renewed optimism at the club, with No. 1 draft pick [[Brett Deledio]] being touted as a future star and leader. However, the Tigers' first match of the season (against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]), quickly dashed that hope, as they were thrashed by 62 points. However, this loss would spark a change in the Tigers, and in the next 8 weeks of the season, they would go on to win 7 matches (the one exception being a 68-point loss at the hands of [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in Round 5). This included wins over the then-reigning premiers, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], and over then-runners up, the [[Brisbane Lions]]. Sitting pretty at 7 wins and 2 losses, and 3rd on the ladder, the impossible prospect of finals football loomed large. However, in the Round 10 match against [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]], star player [[Nathan G. Brown|Nathan Brown]] suffered a horrible leg injury, that would sideline him for the rest of the season. They went on to lose the match by 57 points, and would only register 3 more wins for the season (one of those was against eventual premiers the [[Sydney Swans]] by one point, who had a one-point win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] the round before), eventually finishing 12th.\n\n2006, a year which many experts predicted continued improvement for the Tigers, saw them lose their first H&A match by 115 points, against the [[Western Bulldogs]], after which followed losses to St Kilda and [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. By the end of Round 3, things were looking grim for the Tigers once again. However, just as they did in 2005, the Tigers would respond to their poor start by winning 8 of their next 11 matches, and by the end of Round 14, the Tigers were in the Top 8 by a game and percentage. However, their spot in the Top 8 would be short lived, as 4 straight losses between Rounds 15 and 18 would effectively end their finals chances. They finished the 2006 season in 9th place, with 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nAfter promising seasons in 2005 and 2006, it was expected that the Tigers would take the next step in 2007, and play finals football. After massive hype in the off-season, the Tigers had a terrible start to the 2007 season, losing their first 9 matches (this included suffering their biggest ever defeat, at the hands of eventual premiers [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], by a whopping 157 points). Their first premiership points came in a draw against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in Round 10, and their first win of the season didn't come until Round 12 against fellow straggler [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]]. After Round 18 of the season, the Tigers had registered a mere 1 win, 1 draw, and 16 losses, and were looking like recording their worst ever recorded season. However, late-season victories over old rivals [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in Round 19, and [[Essendon Bombers|Essendon]] in Round 21, saved them from this fate. They would eventually finish the year as wooden-spooners, with 3 wins, 1 draw, and 18 losses.\n\n===Centenary (2008)===\nAfter the end of the [[2007 AFL season|2007 season]], Richmond elected to delist [[Patrick Bowden]], [[Brent Hartigan]], [[Andrew Krakouer]] and [[Carl Peterson (Australian footballer)|Carl Peterson]]. These four joined another four players in leaving Punt Road\u2014veteran [[Darren Gaspar]], [[Kent Kingsley]], [[Trent Knobel]] and [[Ray Hall (footballer)|Ray Hall]]. While these players left the club [[Jake King]] and [[Angus Graham (footballer)|Angus Graham]] were elevated off the rookie list.\n\nNext up came the [[2007 AFL Draft]], in which the Tigers recruited highly rated midfielder [[Trent Cotchin]] with their first pick (No. 2 overall), backman [[Alex Rance]] (pick No. 18 overall) and ruckman Dean Putt (pick No. 51 overall). Then, in the pre-season draft, they elected to pick [[David Gourdis]] with the number one pick. The Tigers also picked [[Clayton Collard]], [[Jarrod Silvester]], [[Tristan Cartledge]] and [[Cameron Howat]] for the rookie list. Cam Howat had previously been on the rookie list but was delisted then picked up again.\n\nRichmond began the 2008 season with a surprise win over Carlton, but from Rounds 2 to 11, registered only two more wins (and a controversial draw against the Western Bulldogs). The club fought back in the latter half of the season, winning eight of its last 11 matches. However, this was not enough to reach the finals, as Richmond finished two premiership points short (and percentage) of 8th placed [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]].\n\n===Wallace era ends===\nAt the start of 2009, Richmond was said to be rising as a team, and they would be in the eight .{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} They had recruited former [[Brownlow Medal]] winner [[Ben Cousins]] \u2013 who had previously been released by the West Coast Eagles due to drug trouble \u2013 and they had rising stars in [[Brett Deledio]] and [[Trent Cotchin]]. However, the club was beaten by 83 points in Round 1 by Carlton, and did not register a win until Round 5, against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]]. With a record of 2\u20139 after eleven weeks, [[Terry Wallace]] stepped down as coach, having announced his intention during the previous week. [[Jade Rawlings]] was announced as caretaker senior coach; he adopted a youth policy for the remainder of the year, which saw experienced players [[Joel Bowden]] and [[Matthew Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Matthew Richardson]] retire by the end of the year. Rawlings led Richmond to three wins and a draw from eleven games. Richmond finished fifteenth with a record of 5\u201316\u20131. On 25 August, [[Damien Hardwick]] was appointed to be the senior coach from 2010.\n\nAs Jade Rawlings and [[Craig McRae]] and [[Brian Royal]] left the Tigers assistant coaching panel, [[Brendon Lade]] and [[Justin Leppitsch]] were appointed as assistant coaches, leaving only [[Wayne Campbell]] as a previous Richmond assistant coach. [[Brendon Gale]] was also appointed CEO of the Tigers.\n\n===New coach, new list and a new beginning (2010\u20132012)===\n[[File:Damien Hardwick 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|Damien Hardwick has coached Richmond since 2010.]]\nRichmond was not expected to be competitive in 2010, with many commentators predicting the team would win no more than four games. From the [[2009 AFL Draft]], the Tigers drafted seven new players, which included midfielder [[Dustin Martin]]. At the 2010 Pre-season Draft, Richmond recruited young key defender [[Dylan Grimes]], brother of Melbourne defender [[Jack Grimes (footballer)|Jack Grimes]].\n\n[[Damien Hardwick]] selected a young team at the start of the season, with four debutants, and only three players ([[Ben Cousins]], [[Chris Newman (footballer)|Chris Newman]] and [[Troy Simmonds]]) over 25 in the Round 1 loss against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]. Richmond was winless after nine games, before a scrappy win over Port Adelaide in Round 10. This was the start of a turnaround in Richmond's form, with the team winning six out of eight games, to sit with a record of 6\u201312 after eighteen rounds. After losing the final four matches, Richmond finished fifteenth out of sixteen with a record of 6\u201316. Young key forward [[Jack Riewoldt]] finished the season with 78 goals, to win the [[Coleman Medal]].\n\nVery early in the season, Richmond were criticised for \"partying too much\" in the wake of its winless start to the season; after the Round 3 loss to the [[Sydney Swans]], Richmond players were reported to be at the bar drinking and acting in a disorderly manner.<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/ben-cousins-punched-drunken-teammate-daniel-connors-in-sydney-fracas/story-e6frf9jf-1225852936687 Ben Cousins punched drunken teammate Daniel Connors in Sydney fracas - Herald Sun]</ref>\n\nRichmond continued to show improvement to finish 12th out of 17 teams in 2011 with eight wins and a draw.\n\n[[Jack Riewoldt]] again led the goalkicking with 62 majors, down on his previous year's tally of 78.

A series of close losses hampered the Tigers throughout the middle of the season, including a 5-point loss to the Western Bulldogs, 2-point loss to Fremantle, and a 3-point loss to the Giants. Richmond ended the season strongly with convincing victories over Fremantle and St Kilda in the final two rounds, elevating the club to 3rd on the ladder. Richmond's first final of the season - their qualifying final against the Cats at the MCG - attracted a record qualifying final crowd of 95,028; the Tigers won by 51 points.

They suffered various setbacks during the first half of the season, with several of their best players sidelined, most notably [[Alex Rance]] who suffered a career-ending ACL injury in Round 1 against Carlton. The Tigers were resilient in spite of their misfortune, winning six games in a seven-game stretch from round four to round 10. Despite a midseason slump where three losses on the trot dislodged them from the top eight, the Tigers re-emerged from the mid-year bye a different team and would not lose again for the rest of the season. They won their last nine games of the home-and-away season and finished third on the ladder with a 16\u20136 win-loss record, trailing minor premiers Geelong and second-placed Brisbane on percentage.\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:200px;\"| ''[[2019 AFL Grand Final]]'' \n| ''G'' \n| ''B'' \n| ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |Richmond \n| '''17''' \n| '''12''' \n| '''114'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |{{AFL GWS}} \n| 3\n| 7\n| 25\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=\"3\" | Crowd: 100,014\n|}\nThey would defeat both teams en route to their second grand final in three years, dispatching the Lions by 47 points in the second qualifying final at the Gabba (marking their first interstate finals victory) before coming from 21 points down at halftime to beat the Cats by 19 points in the second preliminary final at the MCG. They met Greater Western Sydney in the [[2019 AFL Grand Final]] on September 28, thrashing the Giants by 89 points \u2013 their biggest ever win in a grand final, eclipsing their 81-point victory over Collingwood in 1980. Martin won his second Norm Smith Medal, becoming just the fourth to win multiple Norm Smith Medals after [[Gary Ayres]], [[Andrew McLeod]] and [[Luke Hodge]]. Cotchin equaled Dan Minogue, Percy Bentley and Royce Hart with his second Premiership as Richmond captain while Hardwick became the Tigers' first multiple Premiership coach since Tom Hafey \u2013\u00a0whose widow Maureen presented the two of them with the Premiership cup. Richmond also chose to debut [[Marlion Pickett]], who they had drafted midseason following Grigg's retirement and who had won the Norm Goss Medal in the VFL Grand Final against Williamstown the previous week. Pickett not only became the first player to make his senior debut in an AFL or VFL Grand Final since [[Keith Batchelor]] for Collingwood in 1952, but he also kicked his first AFL goal in the third quarter and finished with four Norm Smith Medal votes.\n\n==Club identity and culture==\nInitially, Richmond saw itself as a gentlemanly and sportsman-like club; it even went to the extent of sacking a player who used poor language. During the early 1900s, the club used the press as a forum to publicise a campaign against violence in the game, which earned the derision of some rival clubs. This image followed the club into the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] in 1908 and during the First World War the club emphasised the number of men associated with the club who had enlisted and served overseas. But the club's actions in 1916, when it voted with three other clubs seen as representative of the working class ([[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]) to continue playing football, left no doubt as to which side of the class divide that the Tigers belonged. The club's self-consciously non-confrontational image can be partly attributed to two of long serving presidents\u2014[[George Henry Bennett|George Bennett]] (1887\u20131908) and [[Frank Tudor]] (1909\u20131918). Both were Richmond men and respected parliamentarians who took the view that how the game was played was more important than whether the game was won.\n\nAfter World War I, the club's attitude hardened as they attempted to match it with the then power clubs Collingwood and Carlton. Eventually, the Tigers became more prosaic in their approach to recruiting and training.\n\nThe Hafey era transformed Richmond into one of the most feared combinations in the then VFL. The club's football administrator, Graeme Richmond, drove the \"win at all costs\" mentality across the whole club, making Richmond a formidable force, winning five premierships from 1967 to 1980.\n\nSince the Tigers' grand final appearance in 1982, the club appeared in five finals series (1995, 2001, 2013, 2014 and 2015) before winning another preliminary final and eventually breaking their Premiership drought as board and coaching instability during the 1980s and 1990s distracted the club and forced its focus away from becoming an on-field force.\n\nThe club also hosts the Korin Gamadji Institute (KGI) at Punt Road, which has delivered highly-unique and innovative leadership and well-being programming for young Indigenous boys and girls since 2008. In 2018, Richmond became the first sports club to present at the [[United Nations]] Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.<ref>[https://www.richmondfc.com.au/news/2018-04-04/richmond-invited-to-present-at-the-united-nations Richmond invited to present at the United Nations] Richmond Football Club</ref>\n\n===Guernseys===\nThe club's current home jumper design is black and features a yellow sash running from the top left of the jumper to the bottom right. For away games against teams with dark coloured jumpers, the club wears a clash strip with a reverse of this design, a black sash on a yellow base. In its first season, Richmond wore a blue jumper with a thin yellow-and-black sash running from right to left. Between 2011 and 2016, the club guernseys were manufactured by sportswear company [[KooGa|BLK]], who were known as KooGa Australia prior to 2014,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmondfc.com.au/news/2013-10-21/richmond-renews-partnership-with-blk |title=Richmond renews partnership with BLK |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 October 2013 |website=Richmond Football Club |publisher=Richmond Football Club |accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> before it went into receivership in November 2016.

In 1962, Jack Malcomson, a cabaret singer who was performing regularly at the Richmond Football Club Social Club, was approached to write a new club song and adapted \"Row, Row, Row\" ([[James V. Monaco|Monaco]]/[[William Jerome|Jerome]]), a show tune from the [[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1912]], to create \"We're From Tigerland\". The current version of the song used by the club is a 1972 recording performed by the Fable Singers.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-tunes-to-remember-20100723-10nyh.html AFL Tunes to Remember]\u2014The Melbourne Age, 23 July 2010.</ref>  In 2014, the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' named it the top club song of any AFL team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/expert-opinion/glenn-mcfarlane/glenns-18-special-edition-we-give-you-the-definitive-ranking-of-the-afl-club-songs/news-story/4e67021bc1849696bbff4674e00b5fb0|title=Every AFL song ranked from best to worst|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref>\n\n: ''Oh, we're from Tigerland''\n: ''A fighting fury, we're from Tigerland''\n: ''In any weather, you will see us with a grin''\n: ''Risking head and shin''\n: ''If we're behind, then never mind''\n: ''We'll fight and fight and win''\n: ''For we're from Tigerland''\n: ''We never weaken 'till the final siren's gone''\n: ''Like the tiger of old''\n: ''We're strong and we're bold''\n: ''For we're from Tiger''\n: ''Yellow and black''\n: ''We're from Tigerland''\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:MelbourneCricketGround.jpg|thumb|The MCG, Richmond's home ground since 1965]]\n[[File:David Mandie building 25.05.19.jpg|thumb|The David Mandie building at Punt Road Oval is home to Richmond's training facilities and administrative headquarters.]]\nThe club's home ground is the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) where the team plays most of their home matches in the regular season.

The club broke its membership record along with the all time AFL membership record with 100,063 signing up in 2018. It also has the most members of any Australian sporting team.\n\nThe building of the fan base was a slow process for Richmond. In the 1890s, the club never sold more than 300 season tickets, but the following was built up with success in the [[Victorian Football Association|VFA]] and membership numbered about 2,000 at the time of admission to the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] in 1908. Between the wars, the club captured the imagination of the residents of [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. The successful Tigers were a positive motif for the oppressed working class community which suffered deprivation during the [[Great Depression]]. At this time, the Richmond community was almost half Catholic, and this demographic was reflected in the club among the players and officials.\n\nAs Melbourne dramatically spread out in the post-war years, so too did the Richmond supporters. Many were now concentrated in the eastern suburbs, which eventually formed the club's metropolitan recruiting zone. Indeed, at one point during the early development of the [[Waverley Park]] ground, the Tigers considered making the stadium its home for this reason.  Following the barren period of the 1950s, Richmond was able to tap into the large number of fans by moving home matches to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] and almost doubled attendance figures. The Tigers maintained this advantage over the other clubs until the mid-1980s, when poor administration led to a downturn in every area of the club. As the club struggled for funds, the membership plummeted from over 10,000 to under 3,000.\n\nThe greatest display of loyalty from the fans occurred during 1990. Threatened by liquidation, the supporters rallied to pay off the multimillion-dollar debt via the \"Save Our Skins\" campaign.<ref>[http://www.richmondfc.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/6301/newsid/99801/default.aspx Superb salute to Save Our Skins]</ref> In 2011, the club launched the ''Fighting Tiger Fund'' to reduce the club's debt and to allow it to increase spending on the football department in order to be more competitive on field.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/richmond-6-million-bid-to-buy-an-afl-flag/story-e6frf9jf-1226003311871 Richmond $6 million bid to buy an AFL flag]</ref>\n[[File:RFC commemorative football 2013.jpg|thumb|RFC commemorative football 2013]]\nIn 2013, the club launched ''The Roar is Back'' membership promotion aiming at signing up 60,000 members in a season for the first time ever.

But the great days from the late 1960s to the early 1980s provide the bulk of the side: Sheedy, Green, Keane, Bourke, Barrot, Clay, Hart, Dean and Bartlett who made up the core of Tom Hafey's teams, and later success stories Weightman and Raines.

Richmond Cricket Club]. Accessed 7 August 2007.</ref>\n\nAt first the team wore blue [[guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]]s and caps with yellow and black stripes in the style of the Richmond Cricket Club. The football club soon adopted yellow and black as its official colours. The team was variously called the \"Richmondites\", the \"Wasps\" or, most commonly, the \"Tigers\".\n\nDuring the late 1880s, Richmond struggled to make an impression in the VFA, and after a promising season in 1888 (when they finished fifth with eleven wins), the club slipped backwards, in the process losing players to more successful sides. As the local economy slipped into severe [[Recession|depression]] in the early 1890s and the crowds began to dwindle, some of the VFA's strongest clubs began to agitate for a reform of the competition. Richmond was not considered part of this elite group, which usually [[Voting bloc|voted as a ''bloc'']] at VFA meetings.\n\nIn 1896, Richmond [[wiktionary:forfeit|walked off the field]] in a match against [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] to protest the umpiring, and later in the season, the Tigers had their half-time score annulled against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] when it was discovered that they had too many men on the ground. In the closing three weeks of the season, Richmond's cut of the gate takings amounted to just five pounds, and they finished the season with the wooden spoon.\n\n[[File:Alec Redmond Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Alec Edmond captained Richmond from 1901 to his retirement in 1907.]]\nIn October 1896, the cabal of six strong clubs broke with the association to form the [[VFL/AFL|Victorian Football League]] (VFL). As a struggling club with a poor following, Richmond was not invited to join the new league. Richmond's performances did not immediately improve in the emaciated VFA until the turn of the century.\n\nThe Tigers were boosted by a significant country recruit in 1901. [[George Sidney Johnson|George \"Mallee\" Johnson]] was an instant sensation and the first true star player at the club. Richmond leapt to third place and then in 1902, with Johnson dominating the ruck, Richmond entered the closing weeks of the season neck and neck with [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] at the head of the ladder, but Port Melbourne faltered against [[Williamstown Football Club|Williamstown]] to hand Richmond its first flag.\n\nHaving missed a potential bonanza from a premiership play-off, the VFA decided to emulate the VFL and introduce a finals series in 1903, a fateful decision for the Tigers. After recruiting the competition's leading goalkicker, [[Jack Hutchinson]], and finishing the season as [[Minor premiership|minor premier]], Richmond lost both finals and were [[runner-up]]. The following season, the club became embroiled in a feud with umpire Allen, whom the Tigers accused of failing to curb field invasions or the dubious tactics of arch-rival [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]]. When the two clubs were scheduled to meet in the [[1904 VFA Grand Final]], Richmond announced that they wouldn't play with Allen as umpire. The VFA called Richmond's bluff, and appointed Allen as umpire for the match, meaning that the Grand Final was scratched and North Melbourne won the premiership on forfeit.\n\nRichmond were now openly at odds with the VFA, and matters failed to improve in the next few years. The club was campaigning against violence (both on-field and among the crowd), ungentlemanly conduct and poor sportsmanship, issues that plagued the VFA to a far greater extent than the rival VFL since the 1896 split. Richmond cultivated links with some VFL clubs by playing practice matches against them. Richmond knew that they were a major asset to the VFA, had built up a large following and played on one of the best grounds in the competition, where they remained unbeaten for five years. In 1905, Richmond confirmed their status with a second premiership, this time overcoming bitter rivals [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], \"Mallee\" Johnson had moved to Carlton, but youngster [[Charlie Ricketts]] dominated the season and won plaudits among the pressmen, who voted him the best player in the VFA.\n\nHowever, Ricketts was also lost to the VFL and injury hit the club hard. In 1906\u201307, the Tigers played finals without looking likely to win the flag. The club earned a rebuke from the VFA for scheduling a practice match against Geelong before the 1907 season, then went ahead with the commitment and earned further censure. Later in the year it became clear that the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] wanted to expand its competition and Richmond won a place ahead of North Melbourne, which had been strengthened by an amalgamation with the bankrupt West Melbourne as part of their bid. Richmond were granted admission along with the now defunct [[University Football Club]].\n\n===Entry into the VFL (1908\u20131944)===\n[[File:FrankTudorPEO.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The Hon. Frank Tudor, federal leader of the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]], was president of Richmond during World War I]]\nThe first few seasons in the VFL were less than spectacular. Although the club turned up some star players, it let a lot of talent leave and the administration was unstable after [[George Henry Bennett|George Bennett]]'s death at the end of the 1908 season. In 1916, the side played in the finals for the first time, however, with [[World War I]] having reduced the competition to just four clubs, finals qualification was automatic.\n\nFinally, in 1919, Richmond made their first [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] appearance, losing to [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]. Richmond stoked a rivalry with Collingwood by recruiting their former skipper [[Dan Minogue]] as playing coach and gained vengeance by beating Collingwood in the [[1920 VFL Grand Final]] to secure a first flag in the big league. This was followed by an even better performance the next year. The only club that continued to beat Richmond on a regular basis was Carlton. Finishing [[List of Australian Football League minor premiers|minor premier]] with only one loss for the season in 1921, Carlton were the hottest premiership favourite, yet Richmond managed to beat them in two classic finals matches played over successive weeks to go back-to-back.\n\n[[File:Richmond fc 1920.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Richmond team that won its first VFL premiership in 1920]]\nThe rest of the decade saw four more Grand Final appearances, all of which would end in frustration. From 1927 to 1929 Richmond became the first club in the VFL to lose three consecutive Grand Finals, all of which were to neighbouring archrivals, Collingwood.\n\nThe next VFL flag came in 1932, with Richmond's triumph over Carlton in a tough encounter which saw Richmond [[Centre line (football)|wingman]] [[Alan Geddes]] play the second half with a broken jaw. Another premiership came in 1934, this time against South Melbourne's famed \"Foreign Legion\", avenging Richmond's loss in the [[1933 VFL Grand Final]].\n\n[[File:Jack Dyer.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Richmond legend [[Jack Dyer]] played 19 consecutive seasons for the club, scoring 443 goals]]\nPrior to the commencement of the 1940 season, internal problems were brewing between the key personalities at the club. Some felt that the uneven performance of the team was due to [[Percy Bentley]]'s coaching methods, and that he should be replaced. [[Jack Dyer]] walked out on the club and threatened to play in the VFA after his father, a committeeman who was involved with the anti-Bentley faction, lost his position at the board elections. Finally, the matter was resolved and Bentley kept his job, while Dyer returned to training on the eve of the season. The problems appeared to have been solved when Richmond won the semi-final against Melbourne to go straight into the [[1940 VFL Grand Final]]. However, Melbourne reversed this result with a crushing win to pinch the premiership. Richmond had been out-thought by their old mentor [[Frank 'Checker' Hughes]], who had assigned a tagger to negate Dyer. Dyer was furious that Bentley had done nothing to prevent his opponent taking him out of the game. The Richmond committee agreed with this assessment, so when Bentley (after retiring as a player) attempted to negotiate a higher fee to continue his coaching tenure, he was rebuffed. Incensed, Bentley quit Punt Road and moved to Carlton as coach, adding further spice to an already fierce rivalry between the two clubs.\n\nDespite the tribulations created by the Second World War, Richmond was able to maintain a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had quite a lot of players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}{{examples|date=February 2014}} Dyer was a fearsome presence in his role as playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the [[1942 VFL Grand Final]] to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. [[Jack Titus]] set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling [[1943 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot who had been killed in action a few weeks before the match. But another Grand Final loss followed in [[1944 VFL Grand Final|1944]], when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day.\n\n===Tough times at Tigerland (1945\u20131965)===\nIn the immediate post-war era, despite an influx of excellent new players, Richmond struggled to make the four, appearing in the finals only once, in 1947. Dyer continued on as coach for three years after his playing retirement at the end of 1949, but was asked to retire by the committee who felt the club needed a shake up. Under a succession of coaches in the 1950s, With the demands of potential players increasing with each passing year, the club refused to allocate sufficient funds to recruit and they failed to replace star players as they retired. When stalwarts such as [[Des Rowe]] and dual-[[Brownlow Medal]]list [[Roy Wright (footballer)|Roy Wright]] left, the team slumped dramatically and finished with a [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in 1960.\n\nIn 1962 [[Graeme Richmond]] was appointed Secretary of the club, Richmond was the under 19's coach who had been around the club since the early 1950s as a junior player until knee injury stopped him from playing so he took on coaching.  Graeme understood that for Richmond to improve so would the recruiting. A shrewd businessman, Richmond was able to sign young recruits for bargain like fees. [[Royce Hart]] was given a suit and six shirts, and Kevin Bartlett simply walked in off the street. Graeme kept a close eye on the success former player Tom Hafey was having with Shepparton in the [[Goulburn Valley Football League]]. When coach Len Smith had a heart attack in 1965, the club appointed Jack Titus to serve as interim coach until a replacement could be found. Hafey was encouraged to apply, and the decision came down to Hafey and former club captain Ron Branton. Many expected Branton to get the job. However, Graeme Richmond saw something special in Hafey and he was appointed coach for the 1966 season.\n\n===Success through Hafey Era (1966\u20131982)===\n[[File:Kevin Bartlett.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Kevin Bartlett outside the MCG]]\n1966 heralded the start of the [[Tom Hafey]] era. Hafey, a former player of the club, was appointed coach and brought with him a couple of quality young footballers from northern Victoria.  Out of the Goulburn Valley came [[Dick Clay]] from Kyabram and [[Francis Bourke]] from Nathalia. Further afield were [[Doug Strang]] and [[John Perry (footballer)|John Perry]] from Albury and Wodonga.\n\nOn his return to Richmond, Hafey found the team had acquired a number of young, high quality players, [[Kevin Bartlett (Australian rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]] was a skinny 17 year old who lived locally walked in and asked for a tryout. [[Michael Green (Australian rules footballer)|Mike Green]] followed Kevin a year later. Even so, he quickly put his stamp on the club, bringing intensity and desire to reach the top. Although he acknowledged the ideas and tactical approach of Len Smith (who remained at the club as a selector and consultant), Hafey opted for what became his trademark style: kick the ball long and quickly into the forward line. He raised the bar for fitness among his players,[4] extending pre-season training and introducing a third training night during the week. Richmond quickly became known for being the fittest team in the competition.\n\nRichmond began 1966 strongly. A month before the finals, they hit the top of the ladder for the first time since 1951 and seemed certain to play in September. However, two losses dropped the Tigers to fifth place with thirteen wins and a draw.  Richmond dismissed a number of players, replacing them with new players such as [[Royce Hart]], Kevin Sheedy and [[Francis Bourke]].\n\nRichmond dominated the 1967 season, running out winners in a classic Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to the toast of the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked a turning point for the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that had gone before and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, after two decades of defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and betters standards of fitness. They won the 1967 flag in a thrilling encounter with Geelong, ending a 24-year premiership drought.\n\nThe Tigers started the 1968 season slowly. They rallied to win the last six games, but missed the finals. When the Tigers were again lethargic in mid-1969, accusations of under-achievement arose and rumours that Hafey was on the way out circulated.  The players rallied behind Hafey and finished the season strong, taking fourth place. The team won all three finals, beat the much fancied Carlton in the [[1969 VFL Grand Final]] by 25 points.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 1970, Hafey took the Tigers to the finals for the next five years. Basing the team's strategy around all-out attack had drawbacks. Richmond were dominant in 1972 and were hot favourites in the [[1972 VFL Grand Final]] against Carlton. However, Carlton stunned Richmond in a game of ridiculous high scoring. Even Richmond equalled the then record highest score in a Grand Final of 22.18 (150), but Carlton beat it with 28.9 (177). Richmond got their revenge in an intensely physical clash in the [[1973 VFL Grand Final]] and went back-to-back in [[1974 VFL Grand Final|1974]] with a strong win against a resurgent North Melbourne.\n\nBy now, the aggressive attitude of the club both on and off the field had created resentment toward the club. A number of incidents during the 1973 Grand Final \u2013 the Windy Hill brawl, the attempted recruitment of [[John Pitura]] from South Melbourne and a poor reaction to Kevin Bartlett's failure to win the Brownlow medal \u2013 all focussed negative attention on the club. Hafey, however, used the resentment to his advantage, telling his players \"it's Richmond against the world\".\n\nRichmond showed signs of ageing in 1975, when they lost in the preliminary final. Triple Brownlow medallist, [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] retired, [[Paul Sproule]] returned to Hobart, [[Brian Roberts (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Roberts]] and two others were part of the John Pitura trade. A raft of other player departures made for a poor 1976 season, Hart spent most of the year nursing a knee and Dick Clay opted to retire. The Tigers finishing seventh, Hafey's worst ever result. Internally the Richmond board bickering had flared into the public domain. It took a majority vote for Hafey to be reappointed for 1977, but not unanimously (he had no contract with Richmond, instead being appointed on a year-to-year basis). When it leaked that [[Graeme Richmond]], the club's powerbroker, had voted against Hafey's reappointment Hafey immediately resigned.\n\nThe club appointed dual premiership player [[Barry Richardson (Australian footballer)|Barry Richardson]] as coach for two seasons before he was replaced by Tony Jewell. Richmond won its next premiership under Jewell with a then record-breaking margin of 81 points over arch-rivals Collingwood in [[1980 VFL Grand Final|1980]]. After reaching and losing the [[1982 VFL Grand Final]], it has been a rocky road for Richmond who have struggled to come to grips with the rules and regulations of a modernised VFL, including the [[AFL Draft|draft]] and [[salary cap]]. The successes of the early 1980s were bought at high financial cost through expensive recruiting, and were followed by severe cut backs that saw several top players depart.\n\n===Recruiting war (1983\u20131986)===\nStill smarting from the loss of star players to Collingwood, Richmond set themselves for war with Collingwood in 1984 by signing three of their players: [[John Annear]], [[Craig Stewart (Australian footballer)|Craig Stewart]] and [[Phil Walsh (Australian footballer)|Phil Walsh]]. Not only were there big contracts and transfer fees to pay, but the costs of an expensive court action as well.\n\nRichmond also signed a number of mediocre players on big contracts, and the club's financial situation took a battering. With the team failing to improve, a challenge to the committee was brewing and Richmond's traditional political stability threatened. The rebel group, organised by long-time servant Bill Durham, convinced former player and coach [[Barry Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Barry Richardson]] to be leader. An election in late 1984 failed to clarify the situation.\n\nIan Wilson held on to the presidency into the new year. When the one hundredth birthday of the club arrived in February 1985, there was too much dissension to mark the moment fittingly. Eventually, Wilson handed over to Richardson, who had selected his former premiership teammate [[Paul Sproule]] to return from [[Tasmania]] and take over the coaching position on a guaranteed contract.\n\nAs the season progressed with Richmond still struggling, Sproule came under pressure. Richardson guaranteed his position, but at the end of the year, the committee overruled Richardson and sacked Sproule. Incensed, Richardson walked out of Punt Road, which was in turmoil again. Desperately, Richmond turned back to [[Tony Jewell (footballer)|Tony Jewell]], who was appointed coach for a second time, the only man in the club's history to get a second go at the job. Jewell later commented on the destruction wrought on the club during his four-year absence: \"the supporters were gone, the members were gone, the money was gone, ... a real shame.\"\n\nWith the competition set to expand, Richmond made a number of misguided moves in 1986. To fill the vacancy left by Richardson, Richmond wooed high-flying West Australian entrepreneur [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]] to become president. Bond came with an agenda to raise money for the club by listing on the stockmarket and relocating to [[Brisbane]]. When the latter plan was revealed in the media, a furious reaction from supporters and high-profile club personalities buried the proposal almost immediately. Early in 1987, Bond's tenure at the club ended in farce when he resigned without presiding over a single game. The off-field confusion was reflected in the players' performance as Richmond slumped to only its second wooden spoon in 70 years.\n\n===''Save Our Skins'' and a return to the finals (1987\u20131995)===\n[[File:Matthew Richardson media.jpg|thumb|upright|Debuting for Richmond in 1993, Matthew Richardson went on to become one of the league's leading goal kickers.]]\nAlthough the new president, ex-captain [[Neville Crowe]], had stabilised the club and scored a coup by persuading club legend [[Kevin Bartlett (Aussie Rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]] to coach, The club managed to stay solvent by cutting expenses to the bone and paying only two-thirds of the allowable salary cap. But there was no money for recruiting to improve an impoverished playing list. The club struggled to come to terms with the draft after its inception in 1986, and made a number of poor choices\u2014notably, the number one pick in 1987 was used on a player who had only four games with Richmond.\n\nFinally, with the economy in serious recession and interest rates touching seventeen per cent, Richmond's creditors came knocking. At one point, an attempt was made to seize the club's 1973 and 1974 premiership trophies as securities for unpaid debts, an embarrassing situation. For a number of years, the exact amount that the club owed was not publicly known. After Bartlett came Allan Jeans, who then passed the job to ex-Richmond premiership player [[John Northey]] for 1993. Northey returned the team to the simple long-kicking style of the halcyon days under the legendary Tom Hafey. Along with some draft concessions granted by the AFL, Northey's efforts gradually improved Richmond. The team fumbled an opportunity to make the 1994 finals, then opened [[1995 AFL season|1995]] with its best start to a season in 75 years and eventually made it to the preliminary final. With a talented playing list and a strong administration led by Leon Daphne (Richmond's first president from the corporate world, the Alan Bond farce aside), Richmond looked set to become regular finalists again.\n\n===Lost opportunities (1996\u20132004)===\nThe anticipated success failed to materialise, partly because Richmond allowed the coaching position to again become unstable. With over a year still to run on his contract, John Northey demanded a contract extension that the club refused. This was because of a rumour that some people with an association with the club were pursuing Essendon coach and former Richmond premiership player [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. So Northey walked out on Richmond and accepted a longer-term contract to coach the [[Brisbane Bears]]. Richmond, caught short, appointed the Bears' ex-coach [[Robert Walls]] for 1996. After several humiliating thrashings in 1997, [[Robert Walls]] became the first Richmond coach to be sacked mid-season. After two-and-a-half seasons under [[Jeff Gieschen]], the club appointed ex-St Kilda captain [[Danny Frawley]]. After a Preliminary Final appearance in Frawley's second season, Richmond overestimated the strength of the list and settled for trading for established players rather than drafting youth. Over the next three seasons, the team managed just 18 wins. The administration continued to support Frawley and ensured that he would see out his contract, a far cry from the way many of his predecessors were treated. However, midway through the 2004 season (a season in which Richmond only managed 4 wins, and lost their last 14 H&A matches), Frawley announced he would be relinquishing his role as Richmond coach at seasons' end.\n\n===Beginning to rebuild and another wooden spoon (2005\u20132007)===\n{{See also|Richmond Football Club season 2007}}\nThe 2005 pre-season began with renewed optimism at the club, with No. 1 draft pick [[Brett Deledio]] being touted as a future star and leader. However, the Tigers' first match of the season (against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]), quickly dashed that hope, as they were thrashed by 62 points. However, this loss would spark a change in the Tigers, and in the next 8 weeks of the season, they would go on to win 7 matches (the one exception being a 68-point loss at the hands of [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in Round 5). This included wins over the then-reigning premiers, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], and over then-runners up, the [[Brisbane Lions]]. Sitting pretty at 7 wins and 2 losses, and 3rd on the ladder, the impossible prospect of finals football loomed large. However, in the Round 10 match against [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]], star player [[Nathan G. Brown|Nathan Brown]] suffered a horrible leg injury, that would sideline him for the rest of the season. They went on to lose the match by 57 points, and would only register 3 more wins for the season (one of those was against eventual premiers the [[Sydney Swans]] by one point, who had a one-point win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] the round before), eventually finishing 12th.\n\n2006, a year which many experts predicted continued improvement for the Tigers, saw them lose their first H&A match by 115 points, against the [[Western Bulldogs]], after which followed losses to St Kilda and [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. By the end of Round 3, things were looking grim for the Tigers once again. However, just as they did in 2005, the Tigers would respond to their poor start by winning 8 of their next 11 matches, and by the end of Round 14, the Tigers were in the Top 8 by a game and percentage. However, their spot in the Top 8 would be short lived, as 4 straight losses between Rounds 15 and 18 would effectively end their finals chances. They finished the 2006 season in 9th place, with 11 wins and 11 losses.\n\nAfter promising seasons in 2005 and 2006, it was expected that the Tigers would take the next step in 2007, and play finals football. After massive hype in the off-season, the Tigers had a terrible start to the 2007 season, losing their first 9 matches (this included suffering their biggest ever defeat, at the hands of eventual premiers [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], by a whopping 157 points). Their first premiership points came in a draw against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in Round 10, and their first win of the season didn't come until Round 12 against fellow straggler [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]]. After Round 18 of the season, the Tigers had registered a mere 1 win, 1 draw, and 16 losses, and were looking like recording their worst ever recorded season. However, late-season victories over old rivals [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in Round 19, and [[Essendon Bombers|Essendon]] in Round 21, saved them from this fate. They would eventually finish the year as wooden-spooners, with 3 wins, 1 draw, and 18 losses.\n\n===Centenary (2008)===\nAfter the end of the [[2007 AFL season|2007 season]], Richmond elected to delist [[Patrick Bowden]], [[Brent Hartigan]], [[Andrew Krakouer]] and [[Carl Peterson (Australian footballer)|Carl Peterson]]. These four joined another four players in leaving Punt Road\u2014veteran [[Darren Gaspar]], [[Kent Kingsley]], [[Trent Knobel]] and [[Ray Hall (footballer)|Ray Hall]]. While these players left the club [[Jake King]] and [[Angus Graham (footballer)|Angus Graham]] were elevated off the rookie list.\n\nNext up came the [[2007 AFL Draft]], in which the Tigers recruited highly rated midfielder [[Trent Cotchin]] with their first pick (No. 2 overall), backman [[Alex Rance]] (pick No. 18 overall) and ruckman Dean Putt (pick No. 51 overall). Then, in the pre-season draft, they elected to pick [[David Gourdis]] with the number one pick. The Tigers also picked [[Clayton Collard]], [[Jarrod Silvester]], [[Tristan Cartledge]] and [[Cameron Howat]] for the rookie list. Cam Howat had previously been on the rookie list but was delisted then picked up again.\n\nRichmond began the 2008 season with a surprise win over Carlton, but from Rounds 2 to 11, registered only two more wins (and a controversial draw against the Western Bulldogs). The club fought back in the latter half of the season, winning eight of its last 11 matches. However, this was not enough to reach the finals, as Richmond finished two premiership points short (and percentage) of 8th placed [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]].\n\n===Wallace era ends===\nAt the start of 2009, Richmond was said to be rising as a team, and they would be in the eight .{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} They had recruited former [[Brownlow Medal]] winner [[Ben Cousins]] \u2013 who had previously been released by the West Coast Eagles due to drug trouble \u2013 and they had rising stars in [[Brett Deledio]] and [[Trent Cotchin]]. However, the club was beaten by 83 points in Round 1 by Carlton, and did not register a win until Round 5, against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]]. With a record of 2\u20139 after eleven weeks, [[Terry Wallace]] stepped down as coach, having announced his intention during the previous week. [[Jade Rawlings]] was announced as caretaker senior coach; he adopted a youth policy for the remainder of the year, which saw experienced players [[Joel Bowden]] and [[Matthew Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Matthew Richardson]] retire by the end of the year. Rawlings led Richmond to three wins and a draw from eleven games. Richmond finished fifteenth with a record of 5\u201316\u20131. On 25 August, [[Damien Hardwick]] was appointed to be the senior coach from 2010.\n\nAs Jade Rawlings and [[Craig McRae]] and [[Brian Royal]] left the Tigers assistant coaching panel, [[Brendon Lade]] and [[Justin Leppitsch]] were appointed as assistant coaches, leaving only [[Wayne Campbell]] as a previous Richmond assistant coach. [[Brendon Gale]] was also appointed CEO of the Tigers.\n\n===New coach, new list and a new beginning (2010\u20132012)===\n[[File:Damien Hardwick 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|Damien Hardwick has coached Richmond since 2010.]]\nRichmond was not expected to be competitive in 2010, with many commentators predicting the team would win no more than four games. From the [[2009 AFL Draft]], the Tigers drafted seven new players, which included midfielder [[Dustin Martin]]. At the 2010 Pre-season Draft, Richmond recruited young key defender [[Dylan Grimes]], brother of Melbourne defender [[Jack Grimes (footballer)|Jack Grimes]].\n\n[[Damien Hardwick]] selected a young team at the start of the season, with four debutants, and only three players ([[Ben Cousins]], [[Chris Newman (footballer)|Chris Newman]] and [[Troy Simmonds]]) over 25 in the Round 1 loss against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]. Richmond was winless after nine games, before a scrappy win over Port Adelaide in Round 10.

A series of close losses hampered the Tigers throughout the middle of the season, including a 5-point loss to the Western Bulldogs, 2-point loss to Fremantle, and a 3-point loss to the Giants. Richmond ended the season strongly with convincing victories over Fremantle and St Kilda in the final two rounds, elevating the club to 3rd on the ladder. Richmond's first final of the season - their qualifying final against the Cats at the MCG - attracted a record qualifying final crowd of 95,028; the Tigers won by 51 points. This sent them to their first preliminary final since 2001, in which Richmond defeated [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|Greater Western Sydney]] by 36 points in front of a crowd of 94,258 to progress to the [[2017 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]], their first Grand Final appearance since 1982. The attendance was 100,021, the largest crowd for a Grand Final since 1986. The Crows led at quarter time and were in front by as much as 13, but the Tigers took over the game as it progressed and kicked seven straight goals at one point with former South Australian U-19 captain [[Jack Graham (Australian footballer, born 1998)|Jack Graham]] finishing as the game's leading goalscorer after kicking three despite playing only his fifth game at AFL level.

They suffered various setbacks during the first half of the season, with several of their best players sidelined, most notably [[Alex Rance]] who suffered a career-ending ACL injury in Round 1 against Carlton. The Tigers were resilient in spite of their misfortune, winning six games in a seven-game stretch from round four to round 10. Despite a midseason slump where three losses on the trot dislodged them from the top eight, the Tigers re-emerged from the mid-year bye a different team and would not lose again for the rest of the season. They won their last nine games of the home-and-away season and finished third on the ladder with a 16\u20136 win-loss record, trailing minor premiers Geelong and second-placed Brisbane on percentage.\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:200px;\"| ''[[2019 AFL Grand Final]]'' \n| ''G'' \n| ''B'' \n| ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |Richmond \n| '''17''' \n| '''12''' \n| '''114'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |{{AFL GWS}} \n| 3\n| 7\n| 25\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=\"3\" | Crowd: 100,014\n|}\nThey would defeat both teams en route to their second grand final in three years, dispatching the Lions by 47 points in the second qualifying final at the Gabba (marking their first interstate finals victory) before coming from 21 points down at halftime to beat the Cats by 19 points in the second preliminary final at the MCG. They met Greater Western Sydney in the [[2019 AFL Grand Final]] on September 28, thrashing the Giants by 89 points \u2013 their biggest ever win in a grand final, eclipsing their 81-point victory over Collingwood in 1980. Martin won his second Norm Smith Medal, becoming just the fourth to win multiple Norm Smith Medals after [[Gary Ayres]], [[Andrew McLeod]] and [[Luke Hodge]]. Cotchin equaled Dan Minogue, Percy Bentley and Royce Hart with his second Premiership as Richmond captain while Hardwick became the Tigers' first multiple Premiership coach since Tom Hafey \u2013\u00a0whose widow Maureen presented the two of them with the Premiership cup. Richmond also chose to debut [[Marlion Pickett]], who they had drafted midseason following Grigg's retirement and who had won the Norm Goss Medal in the VFL Grand Final against Williamstown the previous week. Pickett not only became the first player to make his senior debut in an AFL or VFL Grand Final since [[Keith Batchelor]] for Collingwood in 1952, but he also kicked his first AFL goal in the third quarter and finished with four Norm Smith Medal votes.\n\n==Club identity and culture==\nInitially, Richmond saw itself as a gentlemanly and sportsman-like club; it even went to the extent of sacking a player who used poor language. During the early 1900s, the club used the press as a forum to publicise a campaign against violence in the game, which earned the derision of some rival clubs. This image followed the club into the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] in 1908 and during the First World War the club emphasised the number of men associated with the club who had enlisted and served overseas. But the club's actions in 1916, when it voted with three other clubs seen as representative of the working class ([[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]) to continue playing football, left no doubt as to which side of the class divide that the Tigers belonged. The club's self-consciously non-confrontational image can be partly attributed to two of long serving presidents\u2014[[George Henry Bennett|George Bennett]] (1887\u20131908) and [[Frank Tudor]] (1909\u20131918). Both were Richmond men and respected parliamentarians who took the view that how the game was played was more important than whether the game was won.\n\nAfter World War I, the club's attitude hardened as they attempted to match it with the then power clubs Collingwood and Carlton. Eventually, the Tigers became more prosaic in their approach to recruiting and training.\n\nThe Hafey era transformed Richmond into one of the most feared combinations in the then VFL. The club's football administrator, Graeme Richmond, drove the \"win at all costs\" mentality across the whole club, making Richmond a formidable force, winning five premierships from 1967 to 1980.\n\nSince the Tigers' grand final appearance in 1982, the club appeared in five finals series (1995, 2001, 2013, 2014 and 2015) before winning another preliminary final and eventually breaking their Premiership drought as board and coaching instability during the 1980s and 1990s distracted the club and forced its focus away from becoming an on-field force.\n\nThe club also hosts the Korin Gamadji Institute (KGI) at Punt Road, which has delivered highly-unique and innovative leadership and well-being programming for young Indigenous boys and girls since 2008. In 2018, Richmond became the first sports club to present at the [[United Nations]] Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.<ref>[https://www.richmondfc.com.au/news/2018-04-04/richmond-invited-to-present-at-the-united-nations Richmond invited to present at the United Nations] Richmond Football Club</ref>\n\n===Guernseys===\nThe club's current home jumper design is black and features a yellow sash running from the top left of the jumper to the bottom right. For away games against teams with dark coloured jumpers, the club wears a clash strip with a reverse of this design, a black sash on a yellow base.

In 1962, Jack Malcomson, a cabaret singer who was performing regularly at the Richmond Football Club Social Club, was approached to write a new club song and adapted \"Row, Row, Row\" ([[James V. Monaco|Monaco]]/[[William Jerome|Jerome]]), a show tune from the [[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1912]], to create \"We're From Tigerland\". The current version of the song used by the club is a 1972 recording performed by the Fable Singers.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-tunes-to-remember-20100723-10nyh.html AFL Tunes to Remember]\u2014The Melbourne Age, 23 July 2010.</ref>  In 2014, the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' named it the top club song of any AFL team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/expert-opinion/glenn-mcfarlane/glenns-18-special-edition-we-give-you-the-definitive-ranking-of-the-afl-club-songs/news-story/4e67021bc1849696bbff4674e00b5fb0|title=Every AFL song ranked from best to worst|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref>\n\n: ''Oh, we're from Tigerland''\n: ''A fighting fury, we're from Tigerland''\n: ''In any weather, you will see us with a grin''\n: ''Risking head and shin''\n: ''If we're behind, then never mind''\n: ''We'll fight and fight and win''\n: ''For we're from Tigerland''\n: ''We never weaken 'till the final siren's gone''\n: ''Like the tiger of old''\n: ''We're strong and we're bold''\n: ''For we're from Tiger''\n: ''Yellow and black''\n: ''We're from Tigerland''\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:MelbourneCricketGround.jpg|thumb|The MCG, Richmond's home ground since 1965]]\n[[File:David Mandie building 25.05.19.jpg|thumb|The David Mandie building at Punt Road Oval is home to Richmond's training facilities and administrative headquarters.]]\nThe club's home ground is the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) where the team plays most of their home matches in the regular season.

The club broke its membership record along with the all time AFL membership record with 100,063 signing up in 2018. It also has the most members of any Australian sporting team.\n\nThe building of the fan base was a slow process for Richmond. In the 1890s, the club never sold more than 300 season tickets, but the following was built up with success in the [[Victorian Football Association|VFA]] and membership numbered about 2,000 at the time of admission to the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] in 1908. Between the wars, the club captured the imagination of the residents of [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. The successful Tigers were a positive motif for the oppressed working class community which suffered deprivation during the [[Great Depression]]. At this time, the Richmond community was almost half Catholic, and this demographic was reflected in the club among the players and officials.\n\nAs Melbourne dramatically spread out in the post-war years, so too did the Richmond supporters. Many were now concentrated in the eastern suburbs, which eventually formed the club's metropolitan recruiting zone. Indeed, at one point during the early development of the [[Waverley Park]] ground, the Tigers considered making the stadium its home for this reason.  Following the barren period of the 1950s, Richmond was able to tap into the large number of fans by moving home matches to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] and almost doubled attendance figures. The Tigers maintained this advantage over the other clubs until the mid-1980s, when poor administration led to a downturn in every area of the club. As the club struggled for funds, the membership plummeted from over 10,000 to under 3,000.\n\nThe greatest display of loyalty from the fans occurred during 1990. Threatened by liquidation, the supporters rallied to pay off the multimillion-dollar debt via the \"Save Our Skins\" campaign.<ref>[http://www.richmondfc.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/6301/newsid/99801/default.aspx Superb salute to Save Our Skins]</ref> In 2011, the club launched the ''Fighting Tiger Fund'' to reduce the club's debt and to allow it to increase spending on the football department in order to be more competitive on field.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/richmond-6-million-bid-to-buy-an-afl-flag/story-e6frf9jf-1226003311871 Richmond $6 million bid to buy an AFL flag]</ref>\n[[File:RFC commemorative football 2013.jpg|thumb|RFC commemorative football 2013]]\nIn 2013, the club launched ''The Roar is Back'' membership promotion aiming at signing up 60,000 members in a season for the first time ever.

This record was again broken in 2015 with the club signing up 70,809 members, still ranking 3rd in total membership numbers. The club averaged the highest crowds in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] of 49,841 in 2015, home crowd averaged 53,236 the highest in the [[2015 AFL season]]. The Richmond Football club created AFL/VFL history in 2018 by becoming the first club ever to reach 100,000 members.\n\n==== Membership ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

The selection of the 22 players shows an even spread of champions from all the eras of the club: Thorp from the club's first premiership wins of 1920\u201321; McCormack, Strang, Titus and Dyer from the inter-war years; Rowe, Morris and Wright from the battling era after the war; Richardson and Knights from recent times. But the great days from the late 1960s to the early 1980s provide the bulk of the side: Sheedy, Green, Keane, Bourke, Barrot, Clay, Hart, Dean and Bartlett who made up the core of Tom Hafey's teams, and later success stories Weightman and Raines. Ian Stewart, named on the bench, managed selection in a team of the century at two clubs\u2014he was named in the centre of St Kilda's team as well. Richmond has four players denoted below with an [[asterisk]] who are also members of [[AFL Team of the Century]].

Of its many provisions, two aim to reduce the burden of prescription drugs, both relating to the [[Medicare Part D coverage gap]].

A generic drug form is required to have the same dose, strength and active ingredient(s) as the brand name drug; thus, they carry the same risks and benefits. To ensure compliance, the FDA Generic Drugs Program conducts stringent reviews (3,500 inspections of manufacturing plants per year).<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/genericdrugs/UCM167991.htm|title=Generic Drugs - Generic Drug Facts|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref> Although generic drugs sound like a great money-saver, generic medicines can only be sold after the patents of the brand name versions end.<ref name=\":11\" /> Because of this mandatory period of exclusivity for many brand-name drugs (a period in which generic medicines cannot be sold), delay of generic drugs reaching the market is expected. The high cost of upfront research that the brand-name products have to go through to ensure safety and efficacy largely account for the high discrepancy in pricing between the two groups.\n\n===Value-based prices===\nAn effort is being made to determine if the value of a drug justifies its price. Such measures include cost-minimization, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analysis.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=The Price of Global Health: Drug Pricing Strategies to Balance Patient Access and the Funding of Innovation|last=Schoonveld|first=Ed|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd|year=2015|isbn=978-1472438829|location=|pages=73\u201386|quote=}}</ref> They take into account the total costs, including hospital stays, repeated dosages, etc. and, comparing it to a similar treatment, determines whether a drug will actually minimize costs and whether it is more effective in curing the patient.

The subjectiveness of QALY is apparent on a case by case basis as it takes into account both the quality and quantity of life lived by an individual, with quality of life being the primary subjective factor. QALY does not completely reflect an individual's personal preferences in a particular clinical situation as their value based perspective of life is completely subjective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mehrez|first=Abraham|last2=Gafni|first2=Amiram|title=Quality-adjusted Life Years, Utility Theory, and Healthy-years Equivalents|journal=Medical Decision Making|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=142\u2013149|doi=10.1177/0272989x8900900209|pmid=2501627|year=1989}}</ref>\n\nIn [[oncology]], the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] and the [[European Society for Medical Oncology]] both developed specific tools in 2015 to grade the value of new drugs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schnipper|first=Lowell E.|last2=Davidson|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Wollins|first3=Dana S.|last4=Blayney|first4=Douglas W.|last5=Dicker|first5=Adam P.|last6=Ganz|first6=Patricia A.|last7=Hoverman|first7=J.

It also created the [[Patented Medicine Prices Review Board]] (PMPRB), an independent semi-judicial body, which had the purpose of establishing review guidelines of individual drug prices, conduct investigations for allegations of excessive pricing, and negotiations to a voluntary compliance agreement. These efforts are to ensure that manufacturer prices are within justification, and not excessive. Excessive is interpreted based on the following criteria:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Menon |first=Devidas |date=June 2001 |title=Pharmaceutical Cost Control in Canada: Does It Work? |journal=Health Affairs |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=92\u2013103 |bibcode=|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.20.3.92|pmid=11585186 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n# The price of an existing patented drug cannot increase by more than the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n# The price of a new drug (in most cases) is limited so that the cost of therapy with the new drug is in the range of the costs of therapy with existing drugs in the same therapeutic class.\n# The price of a breakthrough drug is limited to the median of its prices in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States. In addition, no patented drug can be priced above the highest price in this group of countries.\n</blockquote>\n\nLow levels of drug spending in Canada are not solely attributable to the regulatory activities of the government, but also the actions of provincial and private insurance plans.

She predicted that the tradeoff if prices were set too low, would be fewer new treatments coming to market in about a decade (due to the long development lifecycle).<ref name=\"onpoint\">[http://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2018/10/18/drug-prices-tv-ads-us-pharma Transparency And Drug Prices: Will The New U.S. Mandate On TV Ads Drive Costs Down?]</ref> David Mitchell of the advocacy group Patients for Affordable Drugs argues that in the face of reduced pharmaceutical company profits, [[Medical research#Funding|government-funded research]] could provide an ongoing pipeline of new treatments.<ref name=\"onpoint\" />\n\n===Healthcare providers===\nHealthcare providers can help lower drug prices by helping patients navigate the medication formulary, prescribing drugs covered by formularies, and participating in formulary development through [[Pharmacy and Therapeutics]] committees. The formulary system's effectiveness is directly correlated to the education of physicians, pharmacists and patients in understanding the justification of formulary compositions. This education includes drug information monographs to provide adequate resources to physicians in making clinical prescribing decisions, pharmacy education regarding any changes in the formulary, and patient education within the managed care system.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.amcp.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=9298|title=Formulary Management|date=2015|website=Academy of Managed Care Pharmacists|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFormularies should be easily accessible for patient access as well, such as the online [https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx/ Medicare Planfinder], which is part of the Medicare Part D Plan.\n\nHealthcare providers can substitute three-month for one-month supplies of medicines.

Monopolizing orphan drugs has proven to be a very profitable strategy for drug companies; rare diseases have few patients so heavy investment into marketing is not needed and patients rarely have other options. Furthermore, a majority of orphan drugs (93%) are covered by insurance payers. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/IV005214/Orphan-Drug-Pricing-And-Reimbursement-Challenges-To-Patient-Access |title = Orphan Drug Pricing and Reimbursement: Challenges to Patient Access|date = 2017-11-15}}</ref>. In the face of continued criticism, drug company executives defend this practice by noting that high cost allows the company to produce the drug for the very few patients who need it, and that most patients with very rare disorders rarely require any treatment at all. <ref>https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/19/expensive-drugs-cost-business-healthcare-rare-diseases.html#462e45fc5e10</ref>\n\nTargeting orphan drugs may sometimes fail.

For example, they may classify generic drugs as brand name drugs, because their contract does not contain a definition, or only an ambiguous, or a variable definition. This allows PBM's to classify drugs \"for one purpose in one way, and for another purpose in another way\", and to change the classification at different points during the life of a contract.

When it comes to US drug prices, many factors are at hand to result in unaffordable drug prices for patients. There are programs in place to help the consumer navigate to obtain affordable drugs. One of the following programs is the 340B pricing program that allows hospitals and pharmacists to buy drugs at 30-50% off the retail prices.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite news|url=https://catalyst.nejm.org/who-has-the-power-to-cut-drug-prices/|title=Who Has the Power to Cut Drug Prices? - NEJM Catalyst|date=2016-01-13|work=NEJM Catalyst|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}</ref> Per HRSA's [[340B Drug Pricing Program]], drug manufacturers are required to give certain organizations discounted drugs given these organizations fit the eligibility criteria for discounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsa.gov/opa/|title=340B Drug Pricing Program|author1=Office of Pharmacy Affairs|date=n.d.|publisher=Health Resources and Services Administration|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> A big problem with 340B or similar programs is that pharmacies and hospitals can choose to bill for the discounted drugs at full price, defeating the purpose of the program to control drug prices and maintain affordability for low-income patients.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPrices vary from one pharmacy to another as listed prices determine what the insurance companies will have to pay for the drug.

A generic drug form is required to have the same dose, strength and active ingredient(s) as the brand name drug; thus, they carry the same risks and benefits. To ensure compliance, the FDA Generic Drugs Program conducts stringent reviews (3,500 inspections of manufacturing plants per year).<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/genericdrugs/UCM167991.htm|title=Generic Drugs - Generic Drug Facts|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref> Although generic drugs sound like a great money-saver, generic medicines can only be sold after the patents of the brand name versions end.<ref name=\":11\" /> Because of this mandatory period of exclusivity for many brand-name drugs (a period in which generic medicines cannot be sold), delay of generic drugs reaching the market is expected. The high cost of upfront research that the brand-name products have to go through to ensure safety and efficacy largely account for the high discrepancy in pricing between the two groups.\n\n===Value-based prices===\nAn effort is being made to determine if the value of a drug justifies its price. Such measures include cost-minimization, cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility analysis.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=The Price of Global Health: Drug Pricing Strategies to Balance Patient Access and the Funding of Innovation|last=Schoonveld|first=Ed|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd|year=2015|isbn=978-1472438829|location=|pages=73\u201386|quote=}}</ref> They take into account the total costs, including hospital stays, repeated dosages, etc. and, comparing it to a similar treatment, determines whether a drug will actually minimize costs and whether it is more effective in curing the patient. These cost analyses can all be calculated from the point of view of the hospital, the healthcare system, the government, and the patient, so what is best for one party may not be best for another in terms of cost, making the value of a drug in terms of its price, sometimes a difficult thing to measure.\n\n[[Quality-adjusted life year|Quality-Adjusted Life Years]] (QALY) is a cost-effective measure that determines the value of a drug in terms of the quality of life achieved after taking a prescription drug, rather than the number of years the medication extends a patient's life.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, QALY is subjective to each patient and brings up moral dilemmas such as whether or not it is cost-effective to do a life-saving operation for someone who is elderly or has other complications. The subjectiveness of QALY is apparent on a case by case basis as it takes into account both the quality and quantity of life lived by an individual, with quality of life being the primary subjective factor. QALY does not completely reflect an individual's personal preferences in a particular clinical situation as their value based perspective of life is completely subjective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mehrez|first=Abraham|last2=Gafni|first2=Amiram|title=Quality-adjusted Life Years, Utility Theory, and Healthy-years Equivalents|journal=Medical Decision Making|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=142\u2013149|doi=10.1177/0272989x8900900209|pmid=2501627|year=1989}}</ref>\n\nIn [[oncology]], the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] and the [[European Society for Medical Oncology]] both developed specific tools in 2015 to grade the value of new drugs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schnipper|first=Lowell E.|last2=Davidson|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Wollins|first3=Dana S.|last4=Blayney|first4=Douglas W.|last5=Dicker|first5=Adam P.|last6=Ganz|first6=Patricia A.|last7=Hoverman|first7=J.

In 1987, Bill C-22 established an extended period of protection for patents prior to licensing, which would allow for generics to enter the market. It also created the [[Patented Medicine Prices Review Board]] (PMPRB), an independent semi-judicial body, which had the purpose of establishing review guidelines of individual drug prices, conduct investigations for allegations of excessive pricing, and negotiations to a voluntary compliance agreement. These efforts are to ensure that manufacturer prices are within justification, and not excessive. Excessive is interpreted based on the following criteria:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Menon |first=Devidas |date=June 2001 |title=Pharmaceutical Cost Control in Canada: Does It Work? |journal=Health Affairs |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=92\u2013103 |bibcode=|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.20.3.92|pmid=11585186 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n# The price of an existing patented drug cannot increase by more than the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n# The price of a new drug (in most cases) is limited so that the cost of therapy with the new drug is in the range of the costs of therapy with existing drugs in the same therapeutic class.\n# The price of a breakthrough drug is limited to the median of its prices in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States. In addition, no patented drug can be priced above the highest price in this group of countries.\n</blockquote>\n\nLow levels of drug spending in Canada are not solely attributable to the regulatory activities of the government, but also the actions of provincial and private insurance plans.

The limited use program requires prior authorization for specific drugs, and restricts reimbursements to the approved rationale of prior authorizations (i.e. patients who have failed previous agents for the same indication).\n\nThe government is purchasing drugs similar to how the United States purchases medications for military personnel, but on a much wider scale.<ref name=\":0\">Brandon Kramer and Michael Shally-Jensen.

The dual heritage-listed<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=\"VHD\"/> bridge crosses the border between the Australian states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], linking the Victorian towns of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] and [[Bethanga]] with the regional New South Wales city of [[Albury]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\nThe first crossing of the Murray River by white men occurred in November 1824 when [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] led an expedition from [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] in search of an overland route to Westernport Bay. Their crossing point was some distance up river from Albury and an obelisk near the river commemorates this. Hume and Hovell came upon the river on 16 November 1824, naming it the Hume River, and inscribing a tree near the riverbank the next day before moving on to the south. In 1829, the explorer Captain Charles Sturt discovered the Hume River downstream at its junction with the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Not realising it was indeed the Hume, he named it the Murray River. Both names persisted for some time, Hume falling into disuse eventually in favour of Murray.<ref name=nswshr-1750>{{cite NSW SHR|5056556|Bethanga Bridge|hr=01750|fn=H00/00301, EF14/4310|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe explorers route was shortly followed by white squatters and their livestock, mainly sheep and cattle. Subsequently, many families took up parcels of grazing land on the rich river flatlands, among the first being William Wyse and [[Charles Ebden]]. The drovers track that developed along the line of the advancing squatters, and subsequently by their excess stock returning for sale at [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] markets, led naturally to the same point Hume and Hovell first sighted the river. Although an easier crossing point could be found 10 miles upstream (where the [[Hume Dam]] now stands) the original site by Hume and Hovel's inscribed tree became the popular crossing place for people and stock on their way to new settlements in the south.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nCrossing the river during the drier summer months could normally be achieved on foot. When the river was high after heavy rains or snow melting in the mountains crossing became difficult until a log punt was built in 1844. Stock, however, had to swim.\nThe first bridge over the Murray was built in 1860 near the present crossing at Albury. People up and down stream had to find their own fords, or trek back to Albury.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe arrival of the first railroad from Melbourne in 1873 boosted the district and captured the Southern [[Riverina]] markets for Melbourne. The rail line from Sydney reached Albury in 1881, but the first railway bridge over the Murray was not opened until 1883.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Bethanga-Talgarno gold and copper field became one of the top copper producers in Victoria although both minerals proved difficult to extract from the intractable ores. The alluvial field was first reported in 1852 and was visited by mining officials in 1854, but the field was not really opened up until the discovery of the New Year's Gift reef on 1 January 1876. This led to a number of highly capitalised mining ventures. Harris and Hollow, a mining partnership from [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen]], built a smelting works on the flats of lower Bethanga with a view to smelting copper for the public and opened the first furnace of their Great Eastern Copper Smelting works in January 1878. [[John Wallace (Australian politician)|John Wallace]] MLC took an interest in the Bethanga mining scene and purchased mining leases and major mines at Bethanga, then built his own smelting works to treat the ore, completing three furnaces by June 1878. The Bethanga Goldfields Ltd company made a takeover in 1895 and both metals were mined and treated. Mining however, continued only sporadically into the 20th century, with further leads opened at Mt Corryong and Mt. Talgarno. There was a brief revival in the 1930s and some mines struggled on to at least 1945, but in the latter half of the 20th century mining ceased and the town gradually diminished (Bannear).<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe concept of damning Australian rivers for irrigation and flood mitigation was first investigated back in the days of the steamers. The Hume Dam was proposed under the River Murray Waters Agreement, which was signed on 9 September 1914, by the Prime Minister, [[Joseph Cook]], and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and [[South Australia]]. The first sod was turned by His Excellency, the Right Honourable Sir Ronald Crawford Munro-Ferguson, [[Governor-General of Australia]], on 28 November 1919.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nH. V. Beresford was construction engineer on the Hume Weir from about 1925, but died while still engaged on the project in 1927. At the height of construction, more than 1100 workers were employed at the site. These workers were housed in two fully serviced towns adjacent to the site, one on either side of the river.<ref name=nswshr-1750-15>River Murray Commission 1928</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nConstruction of the weir took seventeen years with the reservoir being completed and officially opened by the Right Honourable Lord Gowrie, Governor of NSW, on 21 November 1936 and a plaque on the northern pier of the dam commemorates the occasion. The Bethanga Bridge was evidently constructed in the middle of this period, probably when water backing-up behind the rising dam wall, began to reach the low level bridge at Bethanga.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThree engineers of note were involved in formulating the agreement, [[Ernest de Burgh]], the Chief Engineer of the Water Supply Branch of the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]], J. S. Detheridge the Commissioner, State Rivers and Water Supply of Victoria, and G. Stewart in South Australia. The initial designs for Hume Dam were prepared by de Burgh and Detheridge. NSW was responsible for construction of the concrete dam and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria was responsible for the southern earth embankments.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nAnother Victorian engineer, Ettore Checchi (1853-1946) was closely connected with the Hume Dam project in the 1920s and 30s. However, as his skills were with hydrographic work, it is unclear what contribution he had to the associated structures such as Bethanga Bridge. The State Rivers and Water supply Commission undertook at least some of the Hume Weir works in conjunction with the NSW Public Works Department. The [[River Murray Commission]] evidently had an overriding supervision of the works, but engineering and design details were left to the established public works engineers in the two states.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe heavy cost of Victoria's irrigation infrastructure lead to a parliamentary inquiry into the Commission's finances in 1928, and recommendations against further irrigation investment in an era of low export returns from primary produce. However, the Hume scheme appears to have been immune to any cuts due to the State - Federal agreement and advanced stage of the project. The NSW Department of Public Works carried out modifications between 1950 and 1961 to enlarge the dam to about twice its original size to the present capacity of {{convert|3038|GL|e9impgal e9USgal}} to accommodate diverted water from the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n===The place===\nAs a result of the construction of the weir, the water level in the Murray River backed up behind the dam to permanently inundate the floodplain, which was up to several kilometres wide in many places.<ref name=nswshr-1750/> Although confirmation of the construction authority is yet to be found, there is later evidence in the form of lantern slides showing the construction of the bridge and clearly intended for public presentation, that the bridge was substantially the work of the SRWSC.<ref name=SWRSC>SRWSC collection, [[State Library of Victoria]], Pictures Collection.</ref> The involvement of the NSW Public Works Department is also implied by photographs of components fabricated by Charles Ruwolt and Sons held by Museum Victoria. It is therefore very likely that the New South Wales Public Works Department and Victorian State Rivers and Water supply commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction, as was the case with the Hume Dam itself.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is roughly contemporary with and is similar in design to the [[Yarrawonga, Victoria|Yarrawonga]] Bridge at [[Lake Mulwala]], which was designed by NSW [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] Engineer Percy Allen and constructed in 1924, also as a result of the creation of an artificial lake on the Murray River. The other prominent engineers involved in the Hume Project, Ettore Checchi, Ernest deBurgh, and J. S. Detheridge, were water supply engineers or had ceased to be involved when the bridge was built.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThere was a pattern in NSW/Victoria relationships over the Murray River border for NSW to design Murray River bridges, and Victoria to built them. Other examples of the arrangement can be found in the [[Swan Hill]] bridge and many timber bridges. Bethanga Bridge is similar to other large NSW bridges such as the Hawkesbury bridges, and uncharacteristic of Victorian bridge design practice.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe sequence of SRWSC lantern slides show the progressive construction of the Bethanga Bridge. Construction commenced in 1927 with clearance of the foundation sites and piling. By 1928 the piers were well under way and staging commenced from each bank. By 1929 all the piers were in place and waters had risen to the base of the piers. Erection of the trusses was underway. Falsework of underslung, divided Warren-type, metal trusses supported on three intermediate steel lattice towers, were used as staging for erecting the Pratt trusses. These were assembled in situ with the use of a travelling crane running across the falsework and hot riveting of preformed, punched and cut angle and flat section steel. As the permanent trusses were completed the staging was dismantled and moved on to the next span.<ref name=SWRSC/> Steel work for the bridge was fabricated at least in part, by Vickers Ruwolt of Burnley Melbourne. Photographs of components such as the truss members and bearings are in the collection of Museum Victoria. At least one of the main trusses was trial assembled at Vickers Ruwolt's Burnley works, probably one of the largest structures to be erected in this fashion.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe bridge was clearly seen as a landmark and complementary to the Hume Dam itself in terms of national pride and potential tourist value. The State Rivers documented the bridge's construction and produced a series of lantern slides showing progress. A number of hand coloured slides and images were produced of the finished bridge to show it at its most impressive. The Victorian Railways also produced its own series of photographs in the 1940s and 50s presenting the bridge as part of a dramatic landscape and engineering achievement, probably for promoting tourist visits(by train) to the region. The bridge has been included in several Postcard series of the natural and man-made features of Albury in the 1950s and 60s under titles such as ''A Souvenir of Beautiful Albury''.<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=SWRSC/> The bridge was constructed at a cost of {{circa}}&nbsp;[[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]194,000{{spaced endash}}210,000.<ref name=EA>{{cite web |url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Bethanga%20Bridge.Nomination.V5.Sept%202015.docx.pdf |title=Nomination for Recognition of the Bethanga Bridge |work=EHA Heritage Recognition Program |publisher=[[Engineers Australia]] |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|13.7|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side was constructed in 1963 as part of the upgrading of the Hume Dam.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe town of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] at the southern end of the bridge, was created to replace facilities inundated by the reservoir. The bridge is currently managed by River Murray Water, although it is understood that the RTA, [[VicRoads]] and River Murray Water are negotiating on the future management responsibility for the bridge. A current {{convert|33|t|ST LT|0|adj=on}} load limit applies and recent tenders have been advertised for the cleaning and repainting of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1750-16>Advertisement for Bethanga Bridge Rehabilitation VicRoads tenders 5858</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe Bethanga Bridge is a road bridge over a flooded section of a Murray River valley that now forms part of the Hume Dam. The bridge consists of nine [[Span (architecture)|spans]] of {{convert|82|m|ft|0}}, each span being supported between double reinforced concrete [[Pylon (architecture)|pylons]] by a riveted steel camel back Pratt [[truss]] plus a {{convert|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side. The overall span is {{convert|752|m|ft|0}}. The road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with the current concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. The road deck is {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}} wide. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam. In 2005 the waffle slab decking was replaced to raise ther load capacity, new guard rails were installed and the NSW approach to the bridge was widened for safety reasons. These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge comprises riveted steel [[Pratt truss|Pratt through trusses]] on multiple reinforced concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and reinforced concrete \"[[waffle slab]]\" deck on steel beams. There are nine identical principle spans of arched upper cord giving a truss variable depth. This form is also known as \"Hog-backed\" Camel-back\" and \"Parker\" truss in the USA. There are overhead diagonally braced frames and under deck diagonal \"X\" bracing between riveted plate cross girder beams. The short approach span on the NSW side has RSJ beams with straight transverse cross-braces. The main truss spans have ten [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with nine vertical compression chords and eight diagonal tension chords.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Murray River boundary between New South Wales and Victoria is on the southern bank of the river. All structures of the river are considered to be in New South Wales. Because of its unique location, over the waters of a dam with the border running down the centre of the body of water, the Bethanga Bridge is the only built structure shared by both New South Wales and Victoria and listed on both the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]]<ref name=nswshr-1750/> and the [[Victorian Heritage Register|Victorian Heritage Database]].<ref name=\"VHD\">{{cite VHD|12738|Bethanga Bridge|hr=12738|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nThe road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with a concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam. In 2005 the [[waffle slab]] decking was replaced to raise the load capacity, new guard rails were installed and the NSW approach to the bridge was widened for safety reasons. These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Pratt truss was an American style bridge truss that began the tide of change from British to American bridge technology in the nineteenth century. The Bethanga example comes from a period when Pratt trusses were an established design alternative, favoured by railways but generally shunned in Victorian road bridge design. It is a type of truss in which vertical web members are in compression and diagonal web members in tension. Many possible configurations include pitched, flat, or camelback top chords. It may be recognised by diagonal members which appear to form a \"V\" shape toward the centre of the truss when viewed in profile. Variations include the Baltimore truss and Pennsylvania truss. Elaboration in the form of variable depth from sloping upper chords as in the Camel-back arrangement, reduced the amount of steel required, and also dead weight for a similar strength. The Pratt truss compares to Warren truss and Howe designs in the different compression and tension arrangements of diagonal and vertical members. It was named for Thomas W. and Caleb Pratt (Boston railway engineers), who were issued a patent for a truss bearing their name in April 1844.<ref>Waddell 1891; Hughes Trueman Reinhold 1998, RTA NSW.</ref>\n\nThe overall length is given in VicRoads inventory as {{convert|733|m|ft|0}} although a deck length of {{convert|752.4|m|ft|0}} and total length of {{convert|750|m|ft|0}} in their inspection system appears more probable. The nine truss spans are each {{convert|82|m|ft|0}} with the NSW approach span being {{convert|12.5|m|0}}; clear height is {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} and width {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}}. Concrete endposts frame the entry to the bridge. The construction date is cast in the one end post.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe original wooden road surface has been raised once and twice replaced, the railings replaced and the NSW approach modified. Nevertheless, Bethanga Bridge remains substantially the same structure erected in the 1920s.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nBethanga Bridge was built between 1927 and 1930 as a joint venture between New South Wales and Victoria as part of the Hume Dam project as a key element of the River Murray Waters Agreement put in place in 1915 by the Victorian, New South Wales, South Australian and Federal governments to regulate the flow of the Murray River as a provision against drought and to ensure that the three states received their agreed share of water.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe use of Pratt trusses is unusual in Victoria, not being readily taken up as a viable bridge design. However they are more common in New South Wales. The use of the Pratt truss in this instance reflects the mode of construction employed during the construction of the Hume Dam whereby the New South Wales Department of Public Works and the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction of the bridge.

It is also of historical significance for its associations with The River Murray Waters Agreement and the River Murray Commission which had the task of putting the agreement into effect. The Agreement was a landmark document that drew on the cooperation of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to regulate the flow of the Murray River. The bridge reflects the engineering and design approaches of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission and New South Wales Public Works Department in the late 1920s and the influence of American engineering Practice in the use of the Pratt truss. The bridge is also a significanc marker of the anticipated development that the new Hume Weir was expected to bring to the region, serving, as it did, only a few small farming communities and the copper and gold mining areas of Bethanga and Talarno, which were already in steep decline at the time the bridge was completed.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of technical significance for the unusual use in Victoria of Pratt trusses, a predominantly NSW technology based on American engineering practice . The Pratt truss was frequently used in New South Wales but this represents a rare example of its use in Victoria. The use of this system in this instance, its design by New South Wales and construction by Victoria, also represents the cooperation of New South Wales and Victoria in the development and ongoing use of major infrastructure. Bethanga Bridge is a representative example of Pratt Truss design displaying the main characteristics at a scale that demonstrates the effectiveness of the design over long spans and of its repetition to create a bridge of considerable overall length. Its construction methods are also of note in the use of staged construction from abutments along temporary underslung Warren trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe bridge is of aesthetic significance for its dramatic rural setting over a wide expanse of water (when lake levels are high) and occasionally at great heights over broad river flats (when the lake is down). It is also of aesthetic significance for the vast scale and length and the rhythmic patterning of repeated geometric motifs of the trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of local social significance as an important local tourism destination and as the main link between the Bethanga/[[Granya]] region and the regional centre of [[Albury-Wodonga]] .<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAs a major bridge built by other than a state road or rail authority, Bethanga Bridge is rare and is the most substantial bridge erected by water authorities.

The dual heritage-listed<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=\"VHD\"/> bridge crosses the border between the Australian states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], linking the Victorian towns of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] and [[Bethanga]] with the regional New South Wales city of [[Albury]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\nThe first crossing of the Murray River by white men occurred in November 1824 when [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] led an expedition from [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] in search of an overland route to Westernport Bay. Their crossing point was some distance up river from Albury and an obelisk near the river commemorates this. Hume and Hovell came upon the river on 16 November 1824, naming it the Hume River, and inscribing a tree near the riverbank the next day before moving on to the south. In 1829, the explorer Captain Charles Sturt discovered the Hume River downstream at its junction with the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Not realising it was indeed the Hume, he named it the Murray River. Both names persisted for some time, Hume falling into disuse eventually in favour of Murray.<ref name=nswshr-1750>{{cite NSW SHR|5056556|Bethanga Bridge|hr=01750|fn=H00/00301, EF14/4310|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe explorers route was shortly followed by white squatters and their livestock, mainly sheep and cattle. Subsequently, many families took up parcels of grazing land on the rich river flatlands, among the first being William Wyse and [[Charles Ebden]]. The drovers track that developed along the line of the advancing squatters, and subsequently by their excess stock returning for sale at [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] markets, led naturally to the same point Hume and Hovell first sighted the river. Although an easier crossing point could be found 10 miles upstream (where the [[Hume Dam]] now stands) the original site by Hume and Hovel's inscribed tree became the popular crossing place for people and stock on their way to new settlements in the south.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nCrossing the river during the drier summer months could normally be achieved on foot. When the river was high after heavy rains or snow melting in the mountains crossing became difficult until a log punt was built in 1844. Stock, however, had to swim.\nThe first bridge over the Murray was built in 1860 near the present crossing at Albury. People up and down stream had to find their own fords, or trek back to Albury.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe arrival of the first railroad from Melbourne in 1873 boosted the district and captured the Southern [[Riverina]] markets for Melbourne. The rail line from Sydney reached Albury in 1881, but the first railway bridge over the Murray was not opened until 1883.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Bethanga-Talgarno gold and copper field became one of the top copper producers in Victoria although both minerals proved difficult to extract from the intractable ores. The alluvial field was first reported in 1852 and was visited by mining officials in 1854, but the field was not really opened up until the discovery of the New Year's Gift reef on 1 January 1876. This led to a number of highly capitalised mining ventures. Harris and Hollow, a mining partnership from [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen]], built a smelting works on the flats of lower Bethanga with a view to smelting copper for the public and opened the first furnace of their Great Eastern Copper Smelting works in January 1878. [[John Wallace (Australian politician)|John Wallace]] MLC took an interest in the Bethanga mining scene and purchased mining leases and major mines at Bethanga, then built his own smelting works to treat the ore, completing three furnaces by June 1878. The Bethanga Goldfields Ltd company made a takeover in 1895 and both metals were mined and treated. Mining however, continued only sporadically into the 20th century, with further leads opened at Mt Corryong and Mt. Talgarno. There was a brief revival in the 1930s and some mines struggled on to at least 1945, but in the latter half of the 20th century mining ceased and the town gradually diminished (Bannear).<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe concept of damning Australian rivers for irrigation and flood mitigation was first investigated back in the days of the steamers. The Hume Dam was proposed under the River Murray Waters Agreement, which was signed on 9 September 1914, by the Prime Minister, [[Joseph Cook]], and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and [[South Australia]]. The first sod was turned by His Excellency, the Right Honourable Sir Ronald Crawford Munro-Ferguson, [[Governor-General of Australia]], on 28 November 1919.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nH. V. Beresford was construction engineer on the Hume Weir from about 1925, but died while still engaged on the project in 1927. At the height of construction, more than 1100 workers were employed at the site. These workers were housed in two fully serviced towns adjacent to the site, one on either side of the river.<ref name=nswshr-1750-15>River Murray Commission 1928</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nConstruction of the weir took seventeen years with the reservoir being completed and officially opened by the Right Honourable Lord Gowrie, Governor of NSW, on 21 November 1936 and a plaque on the northern pier of the dam commemorates the occasion. The Bethanga Bridge was evidently constructed in the middle of this period, probably when water backing-up behind the rising dam wall, began to reach the low level bridge at Bethanga.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThree engineers of note were involved in formulating the agreement, [[Ernest de Burgh]], the Chief Engineer of the Water Supply Branch of the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]], J. S. Detheridge the Commissioner, State Rivers and Water Supply of Victoria, and G. Stewart in South Australia. The initial designs for Hume Dam were prepared by de Burgh and Detheridge. NSW was responsible for construction of the concrete dam and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria was responsible for the southern earth embankments.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nAnother Victorian engineer, Ettore Checchi (1853-1946) was closely connected with the Hume Dam project in the 1920s and 30s. However, as his skills were with hydrographic work, it is unclear what contribution he had to the associated structures such as Bethanga Bridge. The State Rivers and Water supply Commission undertook at least some of the Hume Weir works in conjunction with the NSW Public Works Department. The [[River Murray Commission]] evidently had an overriding supervision of the works, but engineering and design details were left to the established public works engineers in the two states.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe heavy cost of Victoria's irrigation infrastructure lead to a parliamentary inquiry into the Commission's finances in 1928, and recommendations against further irrigation investment in an era of low export returns from primary produce. However, the Hume scheme appears to have been immune to any cuts due to the State - Federal agreement and advanced stage of the project. The NSW Department of Public Works carried out modifications between 1950 and 1961 to enlarge the dam to about twice its original size to the present capacity of {{convert|3038|GL|e9impgal e9USgal}} to accommodate diverted water from the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n===The place===\nAs a result of the construction of the weir, the water level in the Murray River backed up behind the dam to permanently inundate the floodplain, which was up to several kilometres wide in many places.<ref name=nswshr-1750/> Although confirmation of the construction authority is yet to be found, there is later evidence in the form of lantern slides showing the construction of the bridge and clearly intended for public presentation, that the bridge was substantially the work of the SRWSC.<ref name=SWRSC>SRWSC collection, [[State Library of Victoria]], Pictures Collection.</ref> The involvement of the NSW Public Works Department is also implied by photographs of components fabricated by Charles Ruwolt and Sons held by Museum Victoria. It is therefore very likely that the New South Wales Public Works Department and Victorian State Rivers and Water supply commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction, as was the case with the Hume Dam itself.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is roughly contemporary with and is similar in design to the [[Yarrawonga, Victoria|Yarrawonga]] Bridge at [[Lake Mulwala]], which was designed by NSW [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] Engineer Percy Allen and constructed in 1924, also as a result of the creation of an artificial lake on the Murray River. The other prominent engineers involved in the Hume Project, Ettore Checchi, Ernest deBurgh, and J. S. Detheridge, were water supply engineers or had ceased to be involved when the bridge was built.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThere was a pattern in NSW/Victoria relationships over the Murray River border for NSW to design Murray River bridges, and Victoria to built them. Other examples of the arrangement can be found in the [[Swan Hill]] bridge and many timber bridges. Bethanga Bridge is similar to other large NSW bridges such as the Hawkesbury bridges, and uncharacteristic of Victorian bridge design practice.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe sequence of SRWSC lantern slides show the progressive construction of the Bethanga Bridge. Construction commenced in 1927 with clearance of the foundation sites and piling. By 1928 the piers were well under way and staging commenced from each bank. By 1929 all the piers were in place and waters had risen to the base of the piers. Erection of the trusses was underway. Falsework of underslung, divided Warren-type, metal trusses supported on three intermediate steel lattice towers, were used as staging for erecting the Pratt trusses. These were assembled in situ with the use of a travelling crane running across the falsework and hot riveting of preformed, punched and cut angle and flat section steel. As the permanent trusses were completed the staging was dismantled and moved on to the next span.<ref name=SWRSC/> Steel work for the bridge was fabricated at least in part, by Vickers Ruwolt of Burnley Melbourne. Photographs of components such as the truss members and bearings are in the collection of Museum Victoria. At least one of the main trusses was trial assembled at Vickers Ruwolt's Burnley works, probably one of the largest structures to be erected in this fashion.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe bridge was clearly seen as a landmark and complementary to the Hume Dam itself in terms of national pride and potential tourist value. The State Rivers documented the bridge's construction and produced a series of lantern slides showing progress. A number of hand coloured slides and images were produced of the finished bridge to show it at its most impressive. The Victorian Railways also produced its own series of photographs in the 1940s and 50s presenting the bridge as part of a dramatic landscape and engineering achievement, probably for promoting tourist visits(by train) to the region. The bridge has been included in several Postcard series of the natural and man-made features of Albury in the 1950s and 60s under titles such as ''A Souvenir of Beautiful Albury''.<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=SWRSC/> The bridge was constructed at a cost of {{circa}}&nbsp;[[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]194,000{{spaced endash}}210,000.<ref name=EA>{{cite web |url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Bethanga%20Bridge.Nomination.V5.Sept%202015.docx.pdf |title=Nomination for Recognition of the Bethanga Bridge |work=EHA Heritage Recognition Program |publisher=[[Engineers Australia]] |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|13.7|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side was constructed in 1963 as part of the upgrading of the Hume Dam.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe town of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] at the southern end of the bridge, was created to replace facilities inundated by the reservoir. The bridge is currently managed by River Murray Water, although it is understood that the RTA, [[VicRoads]] and River Murray Water are negotiating on the future management responsibility for the bridge. A current {{convert|33|t|ST LT|0|adj=on}} load limit applies and recent tenders have been advertised for the cleaning and repainting of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1750-16>Advertisement for Bethanga Bridge Rehabilitation VicRoads tenders 5858</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe Bethanga Bridge is a road bridge over a flooded section of a Murray River valley that now forms part of the Hume Dam. The bridge consists of nine [[Span (architecture)|spans]] of {{convert|82|m|ft|0}}, each span being supported between double reinforced concrete [[Pylon (architecture)|pylons]] by a riveted steel camel back Pratt [[truss]] plus a {{convert|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side. The overall span is {{convert|752|m|ft|0}}. The road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with the current concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. The road deck is {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}} wide. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam. In 2005 the waffle slab decking was replaced to raise ther load capacity, new guard rails were installed and the NSW approach to the bridge was widened for safety reasons. These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge comprises riveted steel [[Pratt truss|Pratt through trusses]] on multiple reinforced concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and reinforced concrete \"[[waffle slab]]\" deck on steel beams. There are nine identical principle spans of arched upper cord giving a truss variable depth. This form is also known as \"Hog-backed\" Camel-back\" and \"Parker\" truss in the USA. There are overhead diagonally braced frames and under deck diagonal \"X\" bracing between riveted plate cross girder beams. The short approach span on the NSW side has RSJ beams with straight transverse cross-braces. The main truss spans have ten [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with nine vertical compression chords and eight diagonal tension chords.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Murray River boundary between New South Wales and Victoria is on the southern bank of the river. All structures of the river are considered to be in New South Wales. Because of its unique location, over the waters of a dam with the border running down the centre of the body of water, the Bethanga Bridge is the only built structure shared by both New South Wales and Victoria and listed on both the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]]<ref name=nswshr-1750/> and the [[Victorian Heritage Register|Victorian Heritage Database]].<ref name=\"VHD\">{{cite VHD|12738|Bethanga Bridge|hr=12738|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nThe road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with a concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam.

These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Pratt truss was an American style bridge truss that began the tide of change from British to American bridge technology in the nineteenth century. The Bethanga example comes from a period when Pratt trusses were an established design alternative, favoured by railways but generally shunned in Victorian road bridge design. It is a type of truss in which vertical web members are in compression and diagonal web members in tension. Many possible configurations include pitched, flat, or camelback top chords. It may be recognised by diagonal members which appear to form a \"V\" shape toward the centre of the truss when viewed in profile. Variations include the Baltimore truss and Pennsylvania truss. Elaboration in the form of variable depth from sloping upper chords as in the Camel-back arrangement, reduced the amount of steel required, and also dead weight for a similar strength. The Pratt truss compares to Warren truss and Howe designs in the different compression and tension arrangements of diagonal and vertical members. It was named for Thomas W. and Caleb Pratt (Boston railway engineers), who were issued a patent for a truss bearing their name in April 1844.<ref>Waddell 1891; Hughes Trueman Reinhold 1998, RTA NSW.</ref>\n\nThe overall length is given in VicRoads inventory as {{convert|733|m|ft|0}} although a deck length of {{convert|752.4|m|ft|0}} and total length of {{convert|750|m|ft|0}} in their inspection system appears more probable. The nine truss spans are each {{convert|82|m|ft|0}} with the NSW approach span being {{convert|12.5|m|0}}; clear height is {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} and width {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}}. Concrete endposts frame the entry to the bridge. The construction date is cast in the one end post.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe original wooden road surface has been raised once and twice replaced, the railings replaced and the NSW approach modified. Nevertheless, Bethanga Bridge remains substantially the same structure erected in the 1920s.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nBethanga Bridge was built between 1927 and 1930 as a joint venture between New South Wales and Victoria as part of the Hume Dam project as a key element of the River Murray Waters Agreement put in place in 1915 by the Victorian, New South Wales, South Australian and Federal governments to regulate the flow of the Murray River as a provision against drought and to ensure that the three states received their agreed share of water.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe use of Pratt trusses is unusual in Victoria, not being readily taken up as a viable bridge design. However they are more common in New South Wales. The use of the Pratt truss in this instance reflects the mode of construction employed during the construction of the Hume Dam whereby the New South Wales Department of Public Works and the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction of the bridge. The bridge was designed in New South Wales by Department of Main Roads engineer Percy Allen and the trusses were built by Vickers Ruwolt in Melbourne.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Murray River boundary between New South Wales and Victoria is the top of the southern bank of the river. As such all structures of the river are considered to be in New South Wales. Because of its unique location, over the waters of a dam with the border running down the centre of the body of water, the Bethanga bridge is the only built structure shared by both New South Wales and Victoria.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is of historical and scientific (technical) significance to New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is of historical significance to tNew South Wales for its associations with the construction of Hume Dam. It is also of historical significance for its associations with The River Murray Waters Agreement and the River Murray Commission which had the task of putting the agreement into effect. The Agreement was a landmark document that drew on the cooperation of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to regulate the flow of the Murray River.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is of scientific (technical) significance for the unusual use in Victoria of Pratt trusses, a predominantly NSW technology, its construction. The Pratt truss was frequently used in New South Wales but this represents a rare example of its use in Victoria. The use of this system in this instance, its design by New South Wales and construction by Victoria, also represents the cooperation of New South Wales and Victoria in the development and ongoing use of major infrastructure.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 26 May 2006 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of historical significance to New South Wales for its associations with the construction of Hume Dam, a major national undertaking of the early twentieth century. It is also of historical significance for its associations with The River Murray Waters Agreement and the River Murray Commission which had the task of putting the agreement into effect. The Agreement was a landmark document that drew on the cooperation of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to regulate the flow of the Murray River. The bridge reflects the engineering and design approaches of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission and New South Wales Public Works Department in the late 1920s and the influence of American engineering Practice in the use of the Pratt truss. The bridge is also a significanc marker of the anticipated development that the new Hume Weir was expected to bring to the region, serving, as it did, only a few small farming communities and the copper and gold mining areas of Bethanga and Talarno, which were already in steep decline at the time the bridge was completed.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of technical significance for the unusual use in Victoria of Pratt trusses, a predominantly NSW technology based on American engineering practice . The Pratt truss was frequently used in New South Wales but this represents a rare example of its use in Victoria. The use of this system in this instance, its design by New South Wales and construction by Victoria, also represents the cooperation of New South Wales and Victoria in the development and ongoing use of major infrastructure. Bethanga Bridge is a representative example of Pratt Truss design displaying the main characteristics at a scale that demonstrates the effectiveness of the design over long spans and of its repetition to create a bridge of considerable overall length. Its construction methods are also of note in the use of staged construction from abutments along temporary underslung Warren trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe bridge is of aesthetic significance for its dramatic rural setting over a wide expanse of water (when lake levels are high) and occasionally at great heights over broad river flats (when the lake is down). It is also of aesthetic significance for the vast scale and length and the rhythmic patterning of repeated geometric motifs of the trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of local social significance as an important local tourism destination and as the main link between the Bethanga/[[Granya]] region and the regional centre of [[Albury-Wodonga]] .<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAs a major bridge built by other than a state road or rail authority, Bethanga Bridge is rare and is the most substantial bridge erected by water authorities. It is the only built structure shared by NSW and Victoria.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBethanga Bridge Stevage.jpeg|Bethanga Bridge in 2014.\nLake Hume - Bethanga Bridge at Bellbridge on the Murray River - 6502.jpg|Bethanga Bridge in 2007, during drought.\nBethanga Bridge 2010 002.JPG|Bethanga Bridge in 2010.\nLake Hume Bethanga Bridge 6498.jpg\nBethanga Bridge on the Murray River.jpg|Unknown date, from the NSW State Records.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Australia|Transport|Engineering}}}}\n*[[Truss bridge#Allan Truss|Allan truss bridge]]\n*[[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite NSW HD|4302002|Bethanga Bridge over the Murray River}}\n* {{cite web|author=Cridlebaugh, Bruce S.|date=|title=Bridge Basics|website=Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny  County,  Pennsylvania|url=http://pghbridges.com/basics.htm}}<!-- great linking by SHR -->\n* {{cite book|last=East|first=Ronald|date=1979|title=Checchi, Ettore (1853-1946), engineer}}\n* {{cite book|author=Hughes Trueman Reinhold|date=1998|title=Murray River Crossing Study}}\n* {{cite book|last=Philipp|first=June|date=1982|title=Poor Man's Diggings: Mining and Community at Bethanga, Victoria, 1875-1912}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Philipp, June|date=1993|title=The making of a mining community : Bethanga, Victoria, 1875-1885|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/27689928}}\n* {{cite book|author=River Murray Commission (Australia)|date=1928|title=Hume Reservoir, Australia|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22261182}}\n* {{cite book|author=VicRoads Bridge Design Files|date=1993|title=Drawing No 478282, 25/06/1993}}\n* {{cite book|author=Waddell, J.

In 1997, the [[Government of India]] banned DTH services when [[Rupert Murdoch]]-owned Indian Sky Broadcasting (ISkyB) was about to launch its DTH services in the country.<ref name=\"Rediff1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/mar/23spec.htm|title=What is DTH?|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}</ref> After deliberations among groups of ministers, DTH services were permitted by the [[Third Vajpayee ministry|NDA government]] in November 2000. The ministers made four key recommendations to govern DTH services: no single entity, either private or state-owned, should be permitted a [[monopoly]] in DTH services; the [[vertical integration]] of DTH and [[cable television]] services should be monitored in order to prevent the formation of a monopoly in television distribution; the vertical integration of DTH operators and television channels should be avoided in order to ensure fair competition among TV channels.\n\nThe new policy announced in November 2000 required all DTH operators to set up earth stations in India within 12 months of receiving a license. DTH licenses were priced at $2.14 million with a validity of 10 years. The FDI limit in the DTH sector was capped at 49%, and the company operating the services was required to be headed by an Indian citizen.<ref name=\"Rediff1\"/>\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe first DTH service was launched in India on 2 October 2003 by [[Dish TV]] owned by [[Zee Entertainment Enterprises|Zee]].
