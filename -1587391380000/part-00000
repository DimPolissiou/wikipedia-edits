His romantic feelings toward [[Rachel Green]], which began as a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative arc. Likewise, their on-again, off-again romantic relationship is a nearly constant theme of ''Friends''.\n\nBorn on May 12, 1967 (although in one episode he claims his birthday is in December and in episode 4 of season 1 he says that it is October 20 and his birthday was 7 months ago; in episode 2 of season 9, he states his birthday is October 18), and raised on [[Long Island]], Ross is the elder brother of [[Monica Geller]]. Ross and Monica are [[Jewish]] and see themselves as at least [[cultural Judaism|cultural Jews]], with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his son, Ben, about the faith. Ross gets divorced and is newly single in the very first episode because his wife, Carol, has realized she's a [[lesbian]]. Later in the series, he dates Rachel Green, but their relationship results in a break-up. After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross marries Emily Waltham, the niece of Rachel's boss. However, because Ross says \"I take thee Rachel\" instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn't last long. In season 5, Ross marries Rachel in Las Vegas when the two are drunk, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well, but they confess that if they ever got married properly it would be the one that lasted. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced 3 times. In the first episode of ''Joey'', the spinoff series, it is hinted that Ross and Rachel may have gotten married again, as he tells his sister Gina that all of his friends are married.\n\nA running theme in Ross's narrative is his competition with his younger sister, manifested through wrestling and paranoia. As children, they took part in an American football match for the Geller Cup every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. This tradition ended in its sixth year, after Monica \"accidentally\" [[Nasal fracture|broke]] Ross's nose. The siblings came up with a dance in primary school called \"The Routine\", which they performed as adults at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in a [[New Year's Eve]] TV broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Plot Summary for \"Friends\" The One with the Routine (1999)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583641/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl}}</ref>\n\nWhen they were kids, Monica used to hate Ross because he always got his way and she felt he was loved more than her, as their parents\u2019 first child. However, as time passed and they grew up, she actually liked Ross as a person and loved him more than out of a sense of family obligation. As adults they became close, though the competition between them was still visible as seen in the season three episode, \"The One with the Football\".\n\nRoss often comes into conflict with [[Phoebe Buffay]]. His [[rationality]] and Phoebe's eccentricity lead to conflict over [[evolution]], [[gravity]], and whether Phoebe's mother was [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a cat. It is also revealed that Phoebe once mugged Ross (stealing a copy of the comic book ''Science Boy'' that Ross had created) when they were teenagers. The two are roommates for a few weeks when a fire forces Phoebe to move out of her apartment. She first moves into [[Chandler Bing]] and Monica's apartment, but then decides she wants to give the newly engaged couple some privacy, so she moves in with Ross. In a \"flashback\" episode, they are alone at a bar and start kissing, but the moment quickly passes when Ross keeps bumping his head. Phoebe also helps Ross on numerous occasions, ultimately making him realize that he loves Rachel and they both are meant to be together.\n\nSince college, Ross' best friend has been Chandler Bing. In college, they were in a band called ''Way/No Way'', and Ross blamed Chandler when he was caught smoking [[marijuana]]. They become brothers-in-law after Chandler marries Monica. Though they are best friends, at times Chandler gets annoyed with Ross's geeky behavior.\n\nRoss is friends with Rachel Green, whom he has had a crush on since high school. Rachel viewed Ross as \u2018Monica\u2019s geeky older brother\u2019 during high school. During the first episode of the series, when they meet after years apart, he rediscovers his feelings for her. They become close and have an on-and-off romantic relationship through the series. In the final season of the show, Rachel tells him that he means more to her than any other member of their group.\n\nHe is also close friends with [[Joey Tribbiani]] and helps him with acting auditions. He kisses Joey once in order to help him practice a role as a gay man, only to find out that Joey had already done the audition and didn't get the part. Joey and Ross also briefly try to cut Chandler out of their friend group after Chandler ignores them. They once fall asleep together on the couch after watching ''Die Hard''. Toward the end of the series, however, Ross and Joey become closer friends, often hanging out together after Chandler gets married.\n\nRoss often tries to bring out the best of his friends in difficult situations. For instance, in season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for ''Another World'' after being fired from ''Days of Our Lives'' despite Joey's refusal to audition for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bike of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. Also, when he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to tell her about it and go for it instead of hiding it, even though he finds it difficult to accept the idea of Joey and Rachel being together. Above all, Ross is portrayed as a very sweet, loving and adorable character who is always looking out for everyone's best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang (despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia).\n\nHe has two children. Ross's son, Ben, was conceived while Ross and Carol were still married and born at the end of Season 1. Ross shares joint custody of Ben with his ex-wife Carol and her wife Susan.\n\nBen appeared in a total of 24 episodes (25 if you include uncut episodes) and was played chronologically as follows: as an infant by Michael Gunderson Season 1 to 2, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from Season 3 to 5, and by [[Cole Sprouse]] from Season 6 to 8.\n\nRoss's daughter with Rachel, Emma Geller-Green, was born at the end of Season 8. Rachel's pregnancy was originally revealed in the season finale of Season 7. The conception of Emma was predominantly the result of a [[one-night stand]], which was later revealed in the Season 8 episode, \"The One With The Videotape\".\n\nRoss claims to have \"given up a career in basketball\" to become a paleontologist, and claims that the ideas for ''Jurassic Park'' and ''Die Hard'' were stolen from him. He also had major interest in music, playing keyboard for hours in the basement of their house in Long Island.\n\nRoss had a pet in the earlier seasons of the show: a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey named Marcel.\n\n==Relationships==\nOver the course of the show, Ross dates a considerable number of women. He married three times and is divorced three times. His proclivity to marry and divorce is a [[running gag]] within the series.\n\n*Julie: An old graduate school colleague, portrayed by [[Lauren Tom]]. She first appears in the final scene of the season 1 finale, returning with Ross from an archeological dig in [[China]]. They start dating in season 2 but break up after Ross discovers Rachel's feelings for him and decides he wants to be with her instead. It is heavily implied that she starts a relationship with Russ, an ex-boyfriend of Rachel's with an uncanny resemblance to Ross.\n*Bonnie: A love interest (played by [[Christine Taylor]]) introduced to Ross by Phoebe, Bonnie is formerly a militant bald woman who no longer shaves her head. She enjoyed a sex-filled relationship with Ross, until a conniving Rachel broke them up by first encouraging Bonnie up to shave her head again, which she knows will bother Ross, and later by revealing she was interested in reuniting with Ross.\n*Mona: A love interest he met at Monica and Chandler's wedding (portrayed by [[Bonnie Somerville]]). Ross becomes paranoid after Mona proposes to send out Christmas cards together, and in a panic decides to give her a key to his apartment. It is later revealed that Mona is unable to say \"I love you\" yet, and delivers what the female friends refer to as \"an emotional slap in the face\" with \"I love spending time with you\". The relationship ends when Mona discovers that Rachel is living in Ross's apartment, after Ross neglects to tell her this himself. When he hides in her apartment to retrieve his shirt while she is on a date with another man, Mona, under the belief that Ross wanted to win her back, admits she still has feelings for him but states that they both need to move on.\n*Chloe: Ross's only relationship with Chloe (referred to in a few prior episodes as \"The cute girl from the copy place with the belly button ring\") was a one-night stand during a \"break\" with his relationship with Rachel, which interferes with their attempt to get back together. Although only covered over two episodes in season 3, Ross' fling with Chloe would be the basis of the \"We were on a break!\" running joke that would last until the very end of the series.\n*[[List of recurring characters in Friends#Janice Goralnik|Janice]]: Ross has a brief fling with Janice, Chandler's ex-girlfriend, in season 5. Phoebe said they would have very hairy children. Janice ironically dumps Ross because he whines too much. Ross, worried about how he would react, tells Chandler, who laughs, but chooses to forgive him.\n*Elizabeth Stevens: A pretty 20-year-old student who Ross teaches during his first year as a professor. The two go through a tremendous amount of effort to keep their relationship a secret from the faculty, as Ross would get fired for dating a student. He even tries to get on good terms with Elizabeth's father Paul ([[Bruce Willis]]), who in turn threatens to report him to the university. Ross eventually manages to blackmail Paul into pretending to like him by threatening to reveal Paul's embarrassing mirror dance routine to Rachel (who dates him briefly). Despite Paul no longer being a threat, Ross eventually realizes he sees no future in his relationship with Elizabeth and decides to break up with her due to her immaturity.\n*Charlie Wheeler: Ross meets Charlie ([[Aisha Tyler]]) in \"The One With The Soap Opera Party\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/27/david_schwimmer_puts_in_the_work_on_learning_wine_waiting_tables_and_why_he_campaigned_for_years_for_a_black_girlfriend_for_ross_geller/|title=David Schwimmer puts in the work: On learning wine, waiting tables and why he \"campaigned for years for a black girlfriend\" for Ross Geller|author=Sonia Saraiya|work=Salon|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref> She is a paleontologist who has recently joined Ross's department. She initially dates Joey before breaking up with him and gravitating toward Ross, after realizing she has more things in common with Ross. She eventually reconciles with her ex-boyfriend and breaks up with Ross.\n*Cheryl: A very attractive woman that Ross briefly dates. He decides he wants to pursue a relationship with her, but is stifled by her incredibly filthy apartment. Despite her own living quarters being littered with garbage and infested with all kinds of pests, she can't stand the \"weird smell\" of Ross' apartment, which is why she doesn't like being there. After Ross breaks off the relationship after being covered in all kinds of trash in an attempt to make out with Cheryl, Monica later visits her and offers to clean her apartment, revealing she \"couldn't sleep\" after Ross told her about it.\n*Jill Green: Ross very briefly dates Rachel's spoiled younger sister Jill (played by [[Reese Witherspoon]]) after her father sends her to New York to take lessons from Rachel in self-sufficiency. Although Jill actually finds Ross a geek, she dates him out of spite because Rachel is uncomfortable with it and tells her \"she's always wanted what she couldn't have\". Ross, upon realising he is being used, breaks it off with Jill because he does not want to end any possibility there could be of him and Rachel getting back together.\n\n===Rachel Green===\nRachel is Ross's most significant relationship during the series. His attraction to her is established early on; Ross met Rachel through his sister Monica, who was Rachel's best friend in high school. He developed an [[Unrequited love|unrequited crush]] on her, but never followed through on it. After leaving college, Ross married Carol, whom he had met at college, and had seemingly put his feelings for Rachel aside before he met her again in [[The Pilot (Friends)|The Pilot]].\n\nThey have an on-again, off-again dynamic throughout most of the show.\n\nIn the Season 1 finale, Ross has to go to China for his work so he asks Chandler to give Rachel a present on her birthday which he had bought for her. Chandler does give the present to Rachel during her birthday celebration while Ross is in China but also accidentally reveals Ross's feelings for Rachel, prompting Rachel to panic and start thinking about Ross in a romantic way. After Ross arrives back from China, Rachel goes to the airport to receive him on realising that she likes him, but she sees him with [[Julie (Friends)|Julie]] and reluctantly backs off.\n\nIn Season 2 episode [[The One Where Ross Finds Out]], Rachel is on a date with a guy when she confesses to Ross over the phone in a drunken state that she had feelings for him but now she is over him. Ross hears this message the next day at Monica's apartment with Rachel begging him not to check his messages. Later, in the same episode they share a passionate kiss at the doors of Central Perk. Later he breaks up with Julie but Rachel decides she doesn't want to be with him after finding out that he had made a list, on the insistence of Chandler, comparing the good and bad qualities about her and Julie.\n\nThe two begin dating each other only from Episode 15 of Season 2 after in the earlier episode [[The One with the Prom Video]] it is revealed that Ross, despite being two years senior to Rachel, had decided to be her date on her and Monica's prom, as Rachel's date had not arrived, only to be left disappointed as her date arrives and they both along with Monica and her date take off for the prom. Touched by this, Rachel kisses Ross on learning this revelation. However, they take a break from their relationship on their one-year anniversary together. That same night, Ross has a one-night stand with Chloe, which officially ends their relationship. They get together again at the end of Season 3 but again break up at the start of Season 4. Some of the later episodes show them to be still in love with each other such as when Ross cancels his Discovery channel show appearance to be with Rachel when she breaks her rib or when Rachel flies to London to tell Ross before his wedding with Emily, that she's still in love with him, only to realize that it would be better not to tell.\n\nRoss and Rachel also marry each other after getting heavily drunk in Las Vegas. This marriage ends in a divorce after a failed application for an annulment.\n\nIn the 7th-season premiere, after the news of Monica and Chandler's engagement, a passionate moment between them leads to Ross and Rachel kissing. Monica is hurt by this as she believed that Rachel was trying to \u201csteal her thunder\u201d. The kiss is later revealed to have happened because Rachel was upset thinking about the fact that she was \u201cnot even close\u201d to being engaged.\n\nIn beginning of season 8, it is revealed on the day of Monica and Chandler's wedding that Rachel is pregnant, with the father unknown to everyone but her. In the season 8 finale, Ross's daughter with Rachel named Emma Geller-Green is born, as a result of their one night stand prior to Chandler and Monica's wedding.\n\nIn the final episode of the show, when Rachel is moving to Paris for her job with a new fashion brand, Ross tells her at the airport that he loves her and asks not to leave. Rachel initially doesn't heed his feelings, but when the plane is about to take off, she realizes that she loves him too and gets off the plane. They profess their love for each other and decide to be together once and for all. \n\nIn the pilot episode of the spin-off/sequel series ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', it is mentioned that Ross and Rachel eventually re-married. In the fifteenth episode, Ross is mentioned, though not by name, in discussion when Joey tells his sister Gina that he confessed his love to Rachel but she was pregnant with Ross's baby and eventually ended up with him, the reason why Joey becomes reluctant to confess the same feelings to his girlfriend, Sarah.\n\n===Carol Willick===\nCarol ([[Anita Barone]] for pilot episode, [[Jane Sibbett]] thereafter) is Ross's first wife and the mother of his son Ben. In the very first episode, Carol has just moved out of their apartment after coming out of the closet as a [[lesbian]] and leaving Ross for a woman named Susan Bunch, whom she later marries.\n\nIn the early days, however, Ross and Carol seemed to have had a very passionate relationship. Carol is the only woman he's ever had sex with (and hence lost his virginity to) at the start of the series. It is also revealed they shared a steamy session at [[Disneyland]] behind the \"Dutch children\" in [[It's a Small World]], which got them a lifetime ban from the theme park. In the third season episode, \"The One with the Flashback\", it is revealed that Carol met Susan at her gym, and it is implied that they had a short affair before Carol could no longer bring herself to cheat on Ross, who innocently believed they were just friends, and told him the truth.\n\nRoss maintains a fairly healthy relationship with Carol after their divorce and both decide to raise Ben together through [[shared parenting]], but he doesn't hide his contempt for Susan as he believes she destroyed their marriage and since she initially wanted to keep him out of Ben's life, having once told him to his face that the baby was not his and would not have the surname \"Geller\". He briefly considers getting back together with Carol and they even share a kiss at a sushi restaurant, but Carol makes it clear that she can't reciprocate his feelings and has chosen to be with Susan. In the second season, when Carol and Susan briefly call off their wedding due to Carol's homophobic parents' refusal to bless their relationship, Ross gives Carol away at the wedding and shares a dance with Susan, who develops a newfound respect for him.\n\nIn the alternate timeline episode \"The One that Could have Been\" (season 6), Carol and Susan are portrayed in a far more negative light. Exploring what could have happened if Ross and Carol never got divorced, it is revealed that they have been on a sexual dry spell that has lasted for months, during which Carol has presumably been cheating on Ross with Susan. During ideas to improve their sex life, Carol suddenly becomes very excited when Ross proposes that they have a threesome with another woman. Picking Susan, whom she met at her gym just like in the real timeline, the two women immediately proceed to have sex without Ross right in front of him, indifferent to his feelings. Ross later explains to Joey that he felt like a third wheel and ended up being so bored he made himself a sandwich. Ross realizes his wife is a lesbian when Rachel states outright that Carol \"sounds gay.\"\n\n===Emily Waltham===\nDuring the [[Friends (season 4)|fourth season]], Ross meets and falls in love with Emily Waltham ([[Helen Baxendale]]), a British woman who is set up with Ross by Rachel. Six weeks into their relationship, Ross spontaneously asks Emily to move in with him. This escalates into a marriage proposal. The two plan a wedding in [[London]], to which [[Rachel Green|Rachel]] is invited.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Ross, upon seeing Rachel, has a slip of the tongue and says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his vows. Emily is furious and exits her own wedding. Later, however, she decides to forgive Ross, and reaches the airport in time to leave for their honeymoon, but is upset when she sees Ross and Rachel boarding the plane together after Ross, having given up on meeting Emily at the airport, invites Rachel on their honeymoon as friend. She flees again, and Ross unsuccessfully tries to follow her, and Rachel ends up going on the honeymoon alone. Emily, later, calls Ross only to confront him by saying that he has to stop calling and harassing her relatives, but Ross makes her reveal her love for him. She said that she will return only if Ross stops being friends with Rachel. Unable to do so, Ross ends his marriage with Emily.\n\nShortly before Emily gets remarried to an anonymous man (although it might be assumed it is former lover Colin, whom she previously dumped to be with Ross), she gets cold feet and calls Ross to ask if their divorce was a mistake. While Ross is on a police ride-a-long with Phoebe's cop boyfriend Gary, Rachel hears and accidentally deletes Emily's message on the answering machine. Despite Monica pleading to keep Ross in the dark about it, Rachel tells him that Emily called, as she believes he should be in charge of his own happiness. When he starts to doubt whether or not he should return Emily's call, however, Rachel is quick to convince him not to. From this point onwards, Emily is never seen in the show again.\n\n== Reception ==\nRoss Geller has become a well-known figure in pop culture, in particular due to his relationship with Rachel Green, his neurotic nature, and his love for dinosaurs.\n\nIn 2015, a play titled ''Ross & Rachel'' debuted at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.assemblyfestival.com/event/125/|title=Ross & Rachel \u2013 Assembly Festival \u2013 Edinburgh Fringe|website=www.assemblyfestival.com|access-date=May 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, Ross Geller was voted \"the Best Friends Character\" in an international poll held by [[Comedy Central]], during six weeks of ''\"FriendsFest\"'' on the channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/friends/articles/our-favourite-ever-ross-moments|title=It's Official: Ross Geller Is The Best Friend|website=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of Friends characters|List of ''Friends'' characters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Friends}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geller, Ross}}\n[[Category:Friends (1994 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional professors]]\n[[Category:Fictional paleontologists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional American Jews]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional TV character}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{in-universe|date=July 2015}}\n{{Infobox character\n| image              = David Schwimmer as Ross Geller.jpg\n| name               = Ross Geller\n| series             = [[Friends]]\n| first              = \"[[The Pilot (Friends)|The Pilot]]\" (1994)\n| last               = \"[[The Last One (Friends)|The Last One]]\" (2004)\n| occupation         = [[Paleontologist]]<br/>[[College professor]]\n| title              = [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor]]<br/>[[Professor]]\n| portrayer          = [[David Schwimmer]]\n| religion           = [[Irreligion|Non-religious]] ([[Cultural Judaism]])<ref>https://www.vulture.com/2014/12/friends-countdown-is-rachel-green-jewish.html</ref>\n| creator            = [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]]<br />[[Marta Kauffman]]\n| spouse             = [[List of Friends characters#Carol Willick and Susan Bunch|Carol Willick]] (ex-wife)<br />[[List of Friends characters#Emily Waltham-Geller|Emily Waltham]] (ex-wife)<br /> \n| family             = [[Jack Geller]] (father)<br />[[Judy Geller]] (mother)<br />[[Monica Geller]] (sister)<br/> Althea (maternal grandmother)\n| children           = [[Ben Geller]] (son)<br />[[List of Friends characters|Emma Geller-Green]] (daughter)\n| relatives          = [[Chandler Bing]] (brother-in-law)<br/>[[Jack Bing]] (nephew)<br/>[[Erica Bing]] (niece) <br/> Sylvia Geller (paternal aunt) <br/> Iris Geller (paternal aunt) <br/> Millie Geller (paternal aunt) <br/>  Cassie Geller (cousin) <br/> Nathan (cousin) <br/> Phyllis (maternal aunt) <br/> Lillian (maternal aunt) <br/> Cheryl (aunt) <br/> Freddie (uncle) <br/> Lisa (aunt) <br/> Marilyn (aunt) <br/> Dan (uncle) <br/> Murray (uncle) <br/> Ed (uncle)\n| gender             = Male\n}}\n\n'''Ross Eustace Geller''', [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], is one of the [[List of Friends characters|six main fictional characters]] of the [[NBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' portrayed by [[David Schwimmer]].

His romantic feelings toward [[Rachel Green]], which began as a high-school infatuation, are an ongoing theme of his narrative arc. Likewise, their on-again, off-again romantic relationship is a nearly constant theme of ''Friends''.\n\nBorn on May 12, 1967 (although in one episode he claims his birthday is in December and in episode 4 of season 1 he says that it is October 20 and his birthday was 7 months ago; in episode 2 of season 9, he states his birthday is October 18), and raised on [[Long Island]], Ross is the elder brother of [[Monica Geller]]. Ross and Monica are [[Jewish]] and see themselves as at least [[cultural Judaism|cultural Jews]], with Ross taking a more active role in wanting to teach his son, Ben, about the faith. Ross gets divorced and is newly single in the very first episode because his wife, Carol, has realized she's a [[lesbian]]. Later in the series, he dates Rachel Green, but their relationship results in a break-up. After his relationship with Rachel ends, Ross gets married to Emily Waltham, the niece of Rachel's boss. However, because Ross says \"I take thee Rachel\" instead of Emily during the nuptials, the marriage doesn't last long. In season 5, Ross marries Rachel in Las Vegas when the two are drunk, and ultimately that marriage results in a divorce as well, but they confess that if they ever got married properly it would be the one that lasted. Throughout the series, Ross gets divorced 3 times. In the first episode of ''Joey'', the spinoff series, it is hinted that Ross and Rachel may have gotten married again, as he tells his sister Gina that all of his friends are married.\n\nA running theme in Ross's narrative is his competition with his younger sister, manifested through wrestling and paranoia. As children, they took part in an American football match for the Geller Cup every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. This tradition ended in its sixth year, after Monica \"accidentally\" [[Nasal fracture|broke]] Ross's nose. The siblings came up with a dance in primary school called \"The Routine\", which they performed as adults at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in a [[New Year's Eve]] TV broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Plot Summary for \"Friends\" The One with the Routine (1999)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583641/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl}}</ref>\n\nWhen they were kids, Monica used to hate Ross because he always got his way and she felt he was loved more than her, as their parents\u2019 first child. However, as time passed and they grew up, she actually liked Ross as a person and loved him more than out of a sense of family obligation. As adults they became close, though the competition between them was still visible as seen in the season three episode, \"The One with the Football\".\n\nRoss often comes into conflict with [[Phoebe Buffay]]. His [[rationality]] and Phoebe's eccentricity lead to conflict over [[evolution]], [[gravity]], and whether Phoebe's mother was [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a cat. It is also revealed that Phoebe once mugged Ross (stealing a copy of the comic book ''Science Boy'' that Ross had created) when they were teenagers. The two are roommates for a few weeks when a fire forces Phoebe to move out of her apartment. She first moves into [[Chandler Bing]] and Monica's apartment, but then decides she wants to give the newly engaged couple some privacy, so she moves in with Ross. In a \"flashback\" episode, they are alone at a bar and start kissing, but the moment quickly passes when Ross keeps bumping his head. Phoebe also helps Ross on numerous occasions, ultimately making him realize that he loves Rachel and they both are meant to be together.\n\nSince college, Ross' best friend has been Chandler Bing. In college, they were in a band called ''Way/No Way'', and Ross blamed Chandler when he was caught smoking [[marijuana]]. They become brothers-in-law after Chandler marries Monica. Though they are best friends, at times Chandler gets annoyed with Ross's geeky behavior.\n\nRoss is friends with Rachel Green, whom he has had a crush on since high school. Rachel viewed Ross as \u2018Monica\u2019s geeky older brother\u2019 during high school. During the first episode of the series, when they meet after years apart, he rediscovers his feelings for her. They become close and have an on-and-off romantic relationship through the series. In the final season of the show, Rachel tells him that he means more to her than any other member of their group.\n\nHe is also close friends with [[Joey Tribbiani]] and helps him with acting auditions. He kisses Joey once in order to help him practice a role as a gay man, only to find out that Joey had already done the audition and didn't get the part. Joey and Ross also briefly try to cut Chandler out of their friend group after Chandler ignores them. They once fall asleep together on the couch after watching ''Die Hard''. Toward the end of the series, however, Ross and Joey become closer friends, often hanging out together after Chandler gets married.\n\nRoss often tries to bring out the best of his friends in difficult situations. For instance, in season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for ''Another World'' after being fired from ''Days of Our Lives'' despite Joey's refusal to audition for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bike of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. Also, when he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to tell her about it and go for it instead of hiding it, even though he finds it difficult to accept the idea of Joey and Rachel being together. Above all, Ross is portrayed as a very sweet, loving and adorable character who is always looking out for everyone's best interests and often the most mature compared to the rest of the gang (despite his ego, outbursts, and paranoia).\n\nHe has two children. Ross's son, Ben, was conceived while Ross and Carol were still married and born at the end of Season 1. Ross shares joint custody of Ben with his ex-wife Carol and her wife Susan.\n\nBen appeared in a total of 24 episodes (25 if you include uncut episodes) and was played chronologically as follows: as an infant by Michael Gunderson Season 1 to 2, by brothers Charles Thomas Allen and John Christopher Allen from Season 3 to 5, and by [[Cole Sprouse]] from Season 6 to 8.\n\nRoss's daughter with Rachel, Emma Geller-Green, was born at the end of Season 8. Rachel's pregnancy was originally revealed in the season finale of Season 7. The conception of Emma was predominantly the result of a [[one-night stand]], which was later revealed in the Season 8 episode, \"The One With The Videotape\".\n\nRoss claims to have \"given up a career in basketball\" to become a paleontologist, and claims that the ideas for ''Jurassic Park'' and ''Die Hard'' were stolen from him. He also had major interest in music, playing keyboard for hours in the basement of their house in Long Island.\n\nRoss had a pet in the earlier seasons of the show: a [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey named Marcel.\n\n==Relationships==\nOver the course of the show, Ross dates a considerable number of women. He married three times and is divorced three times. His proclivity to marry and divorce is a [[running gag]] within the series.\n\n*Julie: An old graduate school colleague, portrayed by [[Lauren Tom]]. She first appears in the final scene of the season 1 finale, returning with Ross from an archeological dig in [[China]]. They start dating in season 2 but break up after Ross discovers Rachel's feelings for him and decides he wants to be with her instead. It is heavily implied that she starts a relationship with Russ, an ex-boyfriend of Rachel's with an uncanny resemblance to Ross.\n*Bonnie: A love interest (played by [[Christine Taylor]]) introduced to Ross by Phoebe, Bonnie is formerly a militant bald woman who no longer shaves her head. She enjoyed a sex-filled relationship with Ross, until a conniving Rachel broke them up by first encouraging Bonnie up to shave her head again, which she knows will bother Ross, and later by revealing she was interested in reuniting with Ross.\n*Mona: A love interest he met at Monica and Chandler's wedding (portrayed by [[Bonnie Somerville]]). Ross becomes paranoid after Mona proposes to send out Christmas cards together, and in a panic decides to give her a key to his apartment. It is later revealed that Mona is unable to say \"I love you\" yet, and delivers what the female friends refer to as \"an emotional slap in the face\" with \"I love spending time with you\". The relationship ends when Mona discovers that Rachel is living in Ross's apartment, after Ross neglects to tell her this himself. When he hides in her apartment to retrieve his shirt while she is on a date with another man, Mona, under the belief that Ross wanted to win her back, admits she still has feelings for him but states that they both need to move on.\n*Chloe: Ross's only relationship with Chloe (referred to in a few prior episodes as \"The cute girl from the copy place with the belly button ring\") was a one-night stand during a \"break\" with his relationship with Rachel, which interferes with their attempt to get back together. Although only covered over two episodes in season 3, Ross' fling with Chloe would be the basis of the \"We were on a break!\" running joke that would last until the very end of the series.\n*[[List of recurring characters in Friends#Janice Goralnik|Janice]]: Ross has a brief fling with Janice, Chandler's ex-girlfriend, in season 5. Phoebe said they would have very hairy children. Janice ironically dumps Ross because he whines too much. Ross, worried about how he would react, tells Chandler, who laughs, but chooses to forgive him.\n*Elizabeth Stevens: A pretty 20-year-old student who Ross teaches during his first year as a professor. The two go through a tremendous amount of effort to keep their relationship a secret from the faculty, as Ross would get fired for dating a student. He even tries to get on good terms with Elizabeth's father Paul ([[Bruce Willis]]), who in turn threatens to report him to the university. Ross eventually manages to blackmail Paul into pretending to like him by threatening to reveal Paul's embarrassing mirror dance routine to Rachel (who dates him briefly). Despite Paul no longer being a threat, Ross eventually realizes he sees no future in his relationship with Elizabeth and decides to break up with her due to her immaturity.\n*Charlie Wheeler: Ross meets Charlie ([[Aisha Tyler]]) in \"The One With The Soap Opera Party\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/27/david_schwimmer_puts_in_the_work_on_learning_wine_waiting_tables_and_why_he_campaigned_for_years_for_a_black_girlfriend_for_ross_geller/|title=David Schwimmer puts in the work: On learning wine, waiting tables and why he \"campaigned for years for a black girlfriend\" for Ross Geller|author=Sonia Saraiya|work=Salon|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref> She is a paleontologist who has recently joined Ross's department. She initially dates Joey before breaking up with him and gravitating toward Ross, after realizing she has more things in common with Ross. She eventually reconciles with her ex-boyfriend and breaks up with Ross.\n*Cheryl: A very attractive woman that Ross briefly dates. He decides he wants to pursue a relationship with her, but is stifled by her incredibly filthy apartment. Despite her own living quarters being littered with garbage and infested with all kinds of pests, she can't stand the \"weird smell\" of Ross' apartment, which is why she doesn't like being there. After Ross breaks off the relationship after being covered in all kinds of trash in an attempt to make out with Cheryl, Monica later visits her and offers to clean her apartment, revealing she \"couldn't sleep\" after Ross told her about it.\n*Jill Green: Ross very briefly dates Rachel's spoiled younger sister Jill (played by [[Reese Witherspoon]]) after her father sends her to New York to take lessons from Rachel in self-sufficiency. Although Jill actually finds Ross a geek, she dates him out of spite because Rachel is uncomfortable with it and tells her \"she's always wanted what she couldn't have\". Ross, upon realising he is being used, breaks it off with Jill because he does not want to end any possibility there could be of him and Rachel getting back together.\n\n===Rachel Green===\nRachel is Ross's most significant relationship during the series. His attraction to her is established early on; Ross met Rachel through his sister Monica, who was Rachel's best friend in high school. He developed an [[Unrequited love|unrequited crush]] on her, but never followed through on it. After leaving college, Ross married Carol, whom he had met at college, and had seemingly put his feelings for Rachel aside before he met her again in [[The Pilot (Friends)|The Pilot]].\n\nThey have an on-again, off-again dynamic throughout most of the show.\n\nIn the Season 1 finale, Ross has to go to China for his work so he asks Chandler to give Rachel a present on her birthday which he had bought for her. Chandler does give the present to Rachel during her birthday celebration while Ross is in China but also accidentally reveals Ross's feelings for Rachel, prompting Rachel to panic and start thinking about Ross in a romantic way. After Ross arrives back from China, Rachel goes to the airport to receive him on realising that she likes him, but she sees him with [[Julie (Friends)|Julie]] and reluctantly backs off.\n\nIn Season 2 episode [[The One Where Ross Finds Out]], Rachel is on a date with a guy when she confesses to Ross over the phone in a drunken state that she had feelings for him but now she is over him. Ross hears this message the next day at Monica's apartment with Rachel begging him not to check his messages. Later, in the same episode they share a passionate kiss at the doors of Central Perk. Later he breaks up with Julie but Rachel decides she doesn't want to be with him after finding out that he had made a list, on the insistence of Chandler, comparing the good and bad qualities about her and Julie.\n\nThe two begin dating each other only from Episode 15 of Season 2 after in the earlier episode [[The One with the Prom Video]] it is revealed that Ross, despite being two years senior to Rachel, had decided to be her date on her and Monica's prom, as Rachel's date had not arrived, only to be left disappointed as her date arrives and they both along with Monica and her date take off for the prom. Touched by this, Rachel kisses Ross on learning this revelation. However, they take a break from their relationship on their one-year anniversary together. That same night, Ross has a one-night stand with Chloe, which officially ends their relationship. They get together again at the end of Season 3 but again break up at the start of Season 4. Some of the later episodes show them to be still in love with each other such as when Ross cancels his Discovery channel show appearance to be with Rachel when she breaks her rib or when Rachel flies to London to tell Ross before his wedding with Emily, that she's still in love with him, only to realize that it would be better not to tell.\n\nRoss and Rachel also marry each other after getting heavily drunk in Las Vegas. This marriage ends in a divorce after a failed application for an annulment.\n\nIn the 7th-season premiere, after the news of Monica and Chandler's engagement, a passionate moment between them leads to Ross and Rachel kissing. Monica is hurt by this as she believed that Rachel was trying to \u201csteal her thunder\u201d. The kiss is later revealed to have happened because Rachel was upset thinking about the fact that she was \u201cnot even close\u201d to being engaged.\n\nIn beginning of season 8, it is revealed on the day of Monica and Chandler's wedding that Rachel is pregnant, with the father unknown to everyone but her. In the season 8 finale, Ross's daughter with Rachel named Emma Geller-Green is born, as a result of their one night stand prior to Chandler and Monica's wedding.\n\nIn the final episode of the show, when Rachel is moving to Paris for her job with a new fashion brand, Ross tells her at the airport that he loves her and asks not to leave. Rachel initially doesn't heed his feelings, but when the plane is about to take off, she realizes that she loves him too and gets off the plane. They profess their love for each other and decide to be together once and for all. \n\nIn the pilot episode of the spin-off/sequel series ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', it is mentioned that Ross and Rachel eventually re-married. In the fifteenth episode, Ross is mentioned, though not by name, in discussion when Joey tells his sister Gina that he confessed his love to Rachel but she was pregnant with Ross's baby and eventually ended up with him, the reason why Joey becomes reluctant to confess the same feelings to his girlfriend, Sarah.\n\n===Carol Willick===\nCarol ([[Anita Barone]] for pilot episode, [[Jane Sibbett]] thereafter) is Ross's first wife and the mother of his son Ben. In the very first episode, Carol has just moved out of their apartment after coming out of the closet as a [[lesbian]] and leaving Ross for a woman named Susan Bunch, whom she later marries.\n\nIn the early days, however, Ross and Carol seemed to have had a very passionate relationship. Carol is the only woman he's ever had sex with (and hence lost his virginity to) at the start of the series. It is also revealed they shared a steamy session at [[Disneyland]] behind the \"Dutch children\" in [[It's a Small World]], which got them a lifetime ban from the theme park. In the third season episode, \"The One with the Flashback\", it is revealed that Carol met Susan at her gym, and it is implied that they had a short affair before Carol could no longer bring herself to cheat on Ross, who innocently believed they were just friends, and told him the truth.\n\nRoss maintains a fairly healthy relationship with Carol after their divorce and both decide to raise Ben together through [[shared parenting]], but he doesn't hide his contempt for Susan as he believes she destroyed their marriage and since she initially wanted to keep him out of Ben's life, having once told him to his face that the baby was not his and would not have the surname \"Geller\". He briefly considers getting back together with Carol and they even share a kiss at a sushi restaurant, but Carol makes it clear that she can't reciprocate his feelings and has chosen to be with Susan. In the second season, when Carol and Susan briefly call off their wedding due to Carol's homophobic parents' refusal to bless their relationship, Ross gives Carol away at the wedding and shares a dance with Susan, who develops a newfound respect for him.\n\nIn the alternate timeline episode \"The One that Could have Been\" (season 6), Carol and Susan are portrayed in a far more negative light. Exploring what could have happened if Ross and Carol never got divorced, it is revealed that they have been on a sexual dry spell that has lasted for months, during which Carol has presumably been cheating on Ross with Susan. During ideas to improve their sex life, Carol suddenly becomes very excited when Ross proposes that they have a threesome with another woman. Picking Susan, whom she met at her gym just like in the real timeline, the two women immediately proceed to have sex without Ross right in front of him, indifferent to his feelings. Ross later explains to Joey that he felt like a third wheel and ended up being so bored he made himself a sandwich. Ross realizes his wife is a lesbian when Rachel states outright that Carol \"sounds gay.\"\n\n===Emily Waltham===\nDuring the [[Friends (season 4)|fourth season]], Ross meets and falls in love with Emily Waltham ([[Helen Baxendale]]), a British woman who is set up with Ross by Rachel. Six weeks into their relationship, Ross spontaneously asks Emily to move in with him. This escalates into a marriage proposal. The two plan a wedding in [[London]], to which [[Rachel Green|Rachel]] is invited.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Ross, upon seeing Rachel, has a slip of the tongue and says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his vows. Emily is furious and exits her own wedding. Later, however, she decides to forgive Ross, and reaches the airport in time to leave for their honeymoon, but is upset when she sees Ross and Rachel boarding the plane together after Ross, having given up on meeting Emily at the airport, invites Rachel on their honeymoon as friend. She flees again, and Ross unsuccessfully tries to follow her, and Rachel ends up going on the honeymoon alone. Emily, later, calls Ross only to confront him by saying that he has to stop calling and harassing her relatives, but Ross makes her reveal her love for him. She said that she will return only if Ross stops being friends with Rachel. Unable to do so, Ross ends his marriage with Emily.\n\nShortly before Emily gets remarried to an anonymous man (although it might be assumed it is former lover Colin, whom she previously dumped to be with Ross), she gets cold feet and calls Ross to ask if their divorce was a mistake. While Ross is on a police ride-a-long with Phoebe's cop boyfriend Gary, Rachel hears and accidentally deletes Emily's message on the answering machine. Despite Monica pleading to keep Ross in the dark about it, Rachel tells him that Emily called, as she believes he should be in charge of his own happiness. When he starts to doubt whether or not he should return Emily's call, however, Rachel is quick to convince him not to.

The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularized by the Mexican government in 1834]], and most of the Mission lands were granted to former soldiers.

At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in [[Los Angeles]], the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General [[Stephen W. Kearney]] were at [[Warner's Ranch]]. Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain [[Archibald Gillespie]] to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of San Pasqual]], fought in the [[San Pasqual Valley]] which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v49-1/war.htm|first=Richard|last=Griswold del Castillo|title=The U.S.-Mexican War in San Diego, 1846\u20131847|publisher=The Journal of San Diego History|work=SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY|date=Winter 2003|volume=49|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nStockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the \"[[Treaty of Cahuenga]]\" on January 13, 1847.

The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was \"for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco,\" and the Mexican\u2013American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of [[San Diego Bay]], so as to include the entire bay within the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Griswold de Castillo|1990|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Alonzo Horton.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Oval, black and white shoulder-height portrait of a man in his forties or fifties, slightly balding wearing a suit|Namesake of [[Horton Plaza and Broadway Fountain|Horton Plaza]], [[Alonzo Horton]] developed \"New Town\" which became [[Downtown San Diego]].]]\nThe state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850.

After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by [[Steamboats of the Colorado River|steamboats on the Colorado River]] and the depot fell into disuse.  From 1857 to 1860, San Diego became the western terminus of the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]], the earliest overland [[stagecoach]] and mail operation from the [[Eastern United States]] to California, coming from [[Texas]] through [[New Mexico Territory]] in less than 30 days.<ref name = \"Pierce\">[http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/1969/april/jackass/ Basil C.

''[[Federal Communications Commission]]''. August 5, 1999.</ref> Though the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power]] television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly ([[Entravision Communications]] owns both [[XHAS-TV]] and XHDTV-TV, [[Azteca (multimedia company)|Azteca]] owns [[XHJK-TV]] and [[XHTIT-TV]], and [[Televisa|Grupo Televisa]] owns [[XHUAA-TV]] and [[XHWT-TV]] along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary [[Bay City Television]]).\n\nSan Diego's television market is limited to only [[San Diego county]]. The [[Imperial County, California|Imperial Valley]] has its own market (which also extends into western [[Arizona]]), while neighboring [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] counties are part of the Los Angeles market. (Sometimes in the past, a missing network affiliate in the Imperial Valley would be available on cable TV from San Diego.)\n\nThe radio stations in San Diego include nationwide broadcaster, [[iHeartMedia]]; [[CBS Radio]], Midwest Television, [[Entercom Communications]], Finest City Broadcasting, and many other smaller stations and networks. Stations include: [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO AM 600]], [[KFMB (AM)|KFMB AM 760]], [[KCEO|KCEO AM 1000]], [[KCBQ|KCBQ AM 1170]], [[KPRZ|K-Praise]], [[KLSD|KLSD AM 1360]] ''[[Air America Radio|Air America]]'', [[KFSD|KFSD 1450 AM]], [[KPBS-FM]] 89.5, [[KHTS-FM|Channel 933]], [[KMYI|Star 94.1]], [[KBZT|FM 94/9]], [[KSSX|FM News and Talk 95.7]], [[KYDO|Q96]] 96.1, [[KYXY|KyXy]] 96.5, [[Free Radio San Diego]] (AKA [[Pirate Radio]] San Diego) 96.9FM FRSD, [[KWFN]] 97.3, [[KXSN]] 98.1, [[KFMB-FM|Jack-FM 100.7]], 101.5 [[KGB-FM]], [[KLVJ (FM)|KLVJ]] 102.1, [[KSON (FM)|KSON]] 103.7, [[KIOZ|Rock 105.3]], and another ''[[Pirate Radio]]'' station at 106.9FM, as well as a number of local Spanish-language radio stations.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Utilities===\nWater is supplied to residents by the Water Department of the City of San Diego.

Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to [[utility cycling]]. This is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.<ref name=\"BestBike\">{{cite news|title=San Diego, Madison (WI) and Boulder (CO) Are Best among Cities of Their Size, While Atlanta, Boston and Houston Are Worst |publisher=Bicycling |date=January 26, 2006 |url=http://www.bikechattanooga.org/BicyclingMagazineRecognizesChattanoogainTop21Cities.html |accessdate=April 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131075226/http://www.bikechattanooga.org/BicyclingMagazineRecognizesChattanoogainTop21Cities.html |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:OverCoronadoSanDiegoAug07.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|View of [[Coronado, California|Coronado]] and San Diego from the air]]\n\nSan Diego is served by the [[San Diego Trolley]] light rail system,<ref name=\"SD-Trolley\">{{cite web | title=SDMTS \u2013 Trolley Information | publisher=San Diego Metropolitan Transit System | url=http://www.sdmts.com/Trolley/Trolley.asp | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> by the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System|SDMTS bus system]],<ref>{{cite web | title=SDMTS \u2013 Bus Routes | publisher=San Diego Metropolitan Transit System | url=http://www.sdmts.com/mtscr/BusRoutes.aspx | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> and by [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]]<ref name=\"Coaster\">{{cite web | title=COASTER \u2013 NCTD | publisher=North County Transit District | url=http://www.gonctd.com/coaster | date= | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> and [[Pacific Surfliner|Amtrak Pacific Surfliner]]<ref name=\"Surfliner\">{{cite web | title=Pacific Surfliner Train \u2013 from Los Angeles to San Diego & More \u2013 Amtrak | publisher=National Railroad Passenger Corporation | url=http://www.amtrak.com/pacific-surfliner-train | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> commuter rail; northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego county]] is also served by the [[Sprinter (light rail)|Sprinter]] light rail line.<ref>{{cite web | title=SPRINTER \u2013 NCTD | publisher=North County Transit District | url=http://www.gonctd.com/sprinter | date= | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> The trolley primarily serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, [[Mission Valley, San Diego, California|Mission Valley]], east county, and coastal south bay.

In 1822, Mexico began its attempt to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularized by the Mexican government in 1834]], and most of the Mission lands were granted to former soldiers. The 432 [[Vecino|residents]] of the town petitioned the governor to form a [[Cabildo (council)|pueblo]], and [[Juan Mar\u00eda Osuna]] was elected the first ''[[alcalde]]'' (\"municipal magistrate\"), defeating [[P\u00edo Pico]] in the vote. (See, ''[[List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego]]''.)

At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in [[Los Angeles]], the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General [[Stephen W. Kearney]] were at [[Warner's Ranch]]. Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain [[Archibald Gillespie]] to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of San Pasqual]], fought in the [[San Pasqual Valley]] which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v49-1/war.htm|first=Richard|last=Griswold del Castillo|title=The U.S.-Mexican War in San Diego, 1846\u20131847|publisher=The Journal of San Diego History|work=SAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY|date=Winter 2003|volume=49|issue=1}}</ref>\n\nStockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the \"[[Treaty of Cahuenga]]\" on January 13, 1847.

The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was \"for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco,\" and the Mexican\u2013American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of [[San Diego Bay]], so as to include the entire bay within the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Griswold de Castillo|1990|page=39}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Alonzo Horton.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Oval, black and white shoulder-height portrait of a man in his forties or fifties, slightly balding wearing a suit|Namesake of [[Horton Plaza and Broadway Fountain|Horton Plaza]], [[Alonzo Horton]] developed \"New Town\" which became [[Downtown San Diego]].]]\nThe state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850.

In 1850, [[William Heath Davis]] promoted a new development by the bay shore called \"New San Diego\", several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier, a few houses and an Army depot for the support of [[Fort Yuma]].  After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by [[Steamboats of the Colorado River|steamboats on the Colorado River]] and the depot fell into disuse.  From 1857 to 1860, San Diego became the western terminus of the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]], the earliest overland [[stagecoach]] and mail operation from the [[Eastern United States]] to California, coming from [[Texas]] through [[New Mexico Territory]] in less than 30 days.<ref name = \"Pierce\">[http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/1969/april/jackass/ Basil C.

Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to [[utility cycling]]. This is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.<ref name=\"BestBike\">{{cite news|title=San Diego, Madison (WI) and Boulder (CO) Are Best among Cities of Their Size, While Atlanta, Boston and Houston Are Worst |publisher=Bicycling |date=January 26, 2006 |url=http://www.bikechattanooga.org/BicyclingMagazineRecognizesChattanoogainTop21Cities.html |accessdate=April 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131075226/http://www.bikechattanooga.org/BicyclingMagazineRecognizesChattanoogainTop21Cities.html |archivedate=January 31, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:OverCoronadoSanDiegoAug07.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|View of [[Coronado, California|Coronado]] and San Diego from the air]]\n\nSan Diego is served by the [[San Diego Trolley]] light rail system,<ref name=\"SD-Trolley\">{{cite web | title=SDMTS \u2013 Trolley Information | publisher=San Diego Metropolitan Transit System | url=http://www.sdmts.com/Trolley/Trolley.asp | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> by the [[San Diego Metropolitan Transit System|SDMTS bus system]],<ref>{{cite web | title=SDMTS \u2013 Bus Routes | publisher=San Diego Metropolitan Transit System | url=http://www.sdmts.com/mtscr/BusRoutes.aspx | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> and by [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]]<ref name=\"Coaster\">{{cite web | title=COASTER \u2013 NCTD | publisher=North County Transit District | url=http://www.gonctd.com/coaster | date= | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> and [[Pacific Surfliner|Amtrak Pacific Surfliner]]<ref name=\"Surfliner\">{{cite web | title=Pacific Surfliner Train \u2013 from Los Angeles to San Diego & More \u2013 Amtrak | publisher=National Railroad Passenger Corporation | url=http://www.amtrak.com/pacific-surfliner-train | year=2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> commuter rail; northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego county]] is also served by the [[Sprinter (light rail)|Sprinter]] light rail line.<ref>{{cite web | title=SPRINTER \u2013 NCTD | publisher=North County Transit District | url=http://www.gonctd.com/sprinter | date= | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> The trolley primarily serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, [[Mission Valley, San Diego, California|Mission Valley]], east county, and coastal south bay.

She loves to draw and make believe, but does not fit in at school. Most people are not very comfortable in the woods, but \u201cThe woods of Briery Swamp fit May Bird like a fuzzy mitten.\u201d There, she is safe from school and the taunts and teases of the kids who do not understand her.

A ghost named Pumpkin (with a pumpkin head) is her house ghost, or her guardian, and follows her into the lake to help her through. So does her faithful cat after she does not return. It is a place few live ones (living people) have ever seen. \u201cHere, towns glow blue beneath zipping stars and the people walk through walls.\u201d Here the Book of the Dead holds the answers to everything in the universe. And here, if May is discovered, the horrifyingly evil Bo Cleevil will destroy her. May Bird must get out. This is the beginning of May Bird's daring journey into the Ever After, a haunting place where true friends\u2014and many terrible foes\u2014await her on every corner.  She gets help from Pumpkin , who lives with the Beekeeper Arista in a giant house shaped like a beehive.  She is told that she needs to go see the Lady of North Farm, a place no ghost is willing to go.\n\nAlong the journey May meets new friends and sees unimaginable sights and faces many strange adventures. The journey she is faced with is a journey that will forever be with her- whether she is dead or alive.\n\n==Trilogy==\nThis trilogy consists of three books;\n\n# May Bird and the Ever After\n# Among the Stars\n# Warrior Princess.\n\n==Reception==\nThe novel received a very positive reception from critics and readers, i.e., Kirkus Review starred the novel, describing it as \"rare fun.\"\n\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:2005 American novels]]\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in West Virginia]]\n[[Category:2005 children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Book by Jodi Lynn Anderson}}\n{{Infobox book  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name         = May Bird and the Ever After\n| translator   = \n| image        = File:May Bird and the Ever After.jpg\n| caption = First edition cover\n| author       = [[Jodi Lynn Anderson]]\n| illustrator  = Leonid Gore\n| cover_artist = \n| country      = United States\n| language     = English\n| series       = The May Bird Series\n| genre        = [[Young adult literature|Young adult]] [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]]/[[Action (fiction)|action]]\n| publisher    = [[Atheneum Books|Atheneum]]\n| release_date = 2005\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 336 (Original hardcover)<br>317 (Paperback)\n| isbn         = 0-689-86923-1\n| congress= PZ7.A53675 Mayb 2005\n| oclc= 56404439\n| preceded_by  = \n| followed_by  = [[May Bird: Among the Stars]]\n}}\n\n'''''May Bird and the Ever After''''' is a [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]]/[[Action (fiction)|action]] [[young adult novel]] by [[Jodi Lynn Anderson]].

It is a place few live ones (living people) have ever seen. \u201cHere, towns glow blue beneath zipping stars and the people walk through walls.\u201d Here the Book of the Dead holds the answers to everything in the universe. And here, if May is discovered, the horrifyingly evil Bo Cleevil will destroy her. May Bird must get out. This is the beginning of May Bird's daring journey into the Ever After, a haunting place where true friends\u2014and many terrible foes\u2014await her on every corner.  She gets help from Pumpkin , who lives with the Beekeeper Arista in a giant house shaped like a beehive.  She is told that she needs to go see the Lady of North Farm, a place no ghost is willing to go.\n\nAlong the journey May meets new friends and sees unimaginable sights and faces many strange adventures. The journey she is faced with is a journey that will forever be with her- whether she is dead or alive.\n\n==The Trilogy==\nThis trilogy consists of three books;\n\n# May Bird and the Ever After\n# Among the Stars\n# Warrior Princess.\n\n==Reception==\nThe novel received a very positive reception from critics and readers, i.e., Kirkus Review starred the novel, describing it as \"rare fun.\"\n\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:2005 American novels]]\n[[Category:Children's fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in West Virginia]]\n[[Category:2005 children's books]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Section heading change: The Trilogy \u2192 Trilogy using ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Bird_and_the_Ever_After"}
