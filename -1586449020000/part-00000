TR2282.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An Italian partisan in [[Florence]], 1944]]\n\"Bella Ciao\" was originally sung as \"''Alla mattina appena alzata''\" by [[Seasonal industry|seasonal]] workers of paddy fields of [[rice]], especially in Italy's [[Po Valley]] from the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th century with different lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G7m_91aU1TYC&pg=PA43&dq=bella+ciao#v=onepage&q=bella+ciao&f=false|title=Songs That Made History Around the World|first=JERRY|last=SILVERMAN|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Mel Bay Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781610650168}}</ref> They worked at [[wikt: mondare|monda]] ([[weeding]]) the rice fields in northern Italy, to help the healthy growth of young rice plants. It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

The song was modified and adopted as an anthem of the [[anti-fascist]] resistance by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] between 1943 and 1945 during the [[Italian Resistance]], the resistance of Italian partisans against the [[Nazi German]] forces occupying Italy, during the [[Italian Civil War]], and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] and its Nazi German allies.

It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work.

{"title_page": "Pierre Patrix", "text_new": "'''Pierre Patrix, seigneur de Sainte-Marie''', Norman gentleman (1583 &ndash; 6 October 1671), was a French poet.\n\nPatrix was born in 1583 at [[Caen]] ([[Normandy]]) from Claude Patrix, councilor to the bailiwick of the city and Margaret Bourgueville. His grandfather was a native of [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]] ([[Provence]]), who, having been in Caen in 1521, when the [[Parliament of Rouen]] sent some of its members to reform the [[University of Caen|University]], was chosen by them, although he only was a [[Bachelor of Laws]] at the time, to be appointed as a professor of civil law. Some time later, he became Counselor in Parliament and University regent.\n\nPatrix's father had envisioned a career in law for his son. However, after defending his thesis before the [[University of Caen|Law School at Caen]], on 19 August 1608, Patrix soon found out this line of duty to be utterly unattractive to him. To Patrix's lively, playful and independent frame of mind, the pleasures of his native Caen, then a haven of sociability and jollity, were far more attractive than practicing law, so he vowed to retain his independence. He contentedly kept this lifestyle until the age of forty, when, seeing himself left with very little in way of income, he sought to improve his prosperity for joining [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], the brother of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], as first marshal-master.\n\nThe prince's bright and cheerful court in residence at [[Blois]] surpassed his brother's in terms of politeness, in agreement, and good taste. There, Patrix had an opportunity to demonstrate his wits. Gaston liked and esteemed Patrix, who held the rank of Grand Vicar in a ''Grand Conseil de Vauriennerie''<ref>\"Grand Council of Scoundrelism\".</ref> which he had established. He also met the likes of [[Vincent Voiture|Voiture]], [[Segrais]], Chaudebonne, Rivi\u00e8rere, and Belot. The talents of his mind, as well as his honesty, and loyalty, earned him everyone's esteem.\" He also was the one to hide [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] in his house around the time he published his first ''[[Provincial Letters]]''.\n\nPatrix always followed his employer's fortunes, and after his demise, in 1660, he attached his fate to that his widow, [[Marguerite of Lorraine]], becoming her first squire. All Patrix got for his long and loyal service of Gaston of Orl\u00e9ans was the government of the county and castle of [[Limours]], [[Montlh\u00e9ry]], with an accommodation at the palace of [[Orl\u00e9ans]] and some rather insignificant pension. He even had to serve a local member of the aristocracy who was trying to deprive him of his command to benefit one of hits own cronies, with the divine commandment, \"You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land.\"\n\nPatrix was gifted with a very natural and markedly pleasant spirit. He loved nothing more than don that air of silliness, which he had brought from his native Caen where it was very much in vogue. This, added to a [[Norman language|Norman]] accent he never could shake off, made for a brilliant conversation, and this perhaps was no little part of his reputation.

His grandfather was a native of [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]] ([[Provence]]), who, having been in Caen in 1521, when the [[Parliament of Rouen]] sent some of its members to reform the [[University of Caen|University]], was chosen by them, although he only was a [[Bachelor of Laws]] at the time, to be appointed as a professor of civil law. Some time later, he became Counselor in Parliament and University regent.\n\nPatrix's father had envisioned a career in law for his son. However, after defending his thesis before the [[University of Caen|Law School at Caen]], on 19 August 1608, Patrix soon found out this line of duty to be utterly unattractive to him. To Patrix's lively, playful and independent frame of mind, the pleasures of his native Caen, then a haven of sociability and jollity, were far more attractive than practicing law, so he vowed to retain his independence. He contentedly kept this lifestyle until the age of forty, when, seeing himself left with very little in way of income, he sought to improve his prosperity for joining [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], the brother of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], as first marshal-master.\n\nThe prince's bright and cheerful court in residence at [[Blois]] surpassed his brother's in terms of politeness, in agreement, and good taste. There, Patrix had an opportunity to demonstrate his wits. Gaston liked and esteemed Patrix, who held the rank of Grand Vicar in a ''Grand Conseil de Vauriennerie''<ref>\"Grand Council of Scoundrelism\".</ref> which he had established. He also met the likes of [[Vincent Voiture|Voiture]], [[Segrais]], Chaudebonne, Rivi\u00e8rere, and Belot. The talents of his mind, as well as his honesty, and loyalty, earned him everyone's esteem.\" He also was the one to hide [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] in his house around the time he published his first ''[[Provincial Letters]]''.\n\nPatrix always followed his employer's fortunes, and after his demise, in 1660, he attached his fate to that his widow, [[Marguerite of Lorraine]], becoming her first squire. All Patrix got for his long and loyal service of Gaston of Orl\u00e9ans was the government of the county and castle of [[Limours]], [[Montlh\u00e9ry]], with an accommodation at the palace of [[Orl\u00e9ans]] and some rather insignificant pension. He even had to serve a local member of the aristocracy who was trying to deprive him of his command to benefit one of hits own cronies, with the divine commandment, \"You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land.\"\n\nPatrix was gifted with a very natural and markedly pleasant spirit. He loved nothing more than don that air of silliness, which he had brought from his native Caen where it was very much in vogue. This, added to a [[Norman language|Norman]] accent he never could shake off, made for a brilliant conversation, and this perhaps was no little part of his reputation. Huet reported hearing Patrix boast he had taught Voiture how to be silly, something for which Voiture indeed was known.\n\nPatrix was renowned for his witty repartees, many of which have been preserved. For instance, when people would talk about science in gatherings, he would tell those around him, he was going to taste their wine. After he suffered a severe illness at the age of eighty, his friends rejoiced at his recovery, and urged him to get back up: \"Alas! gentlemen, he replied, I need not bother to get dressed.\"\n\nAs he was on the end of his life, and concerned about death, he wrote, a few days before his end, those famous lines: {{quote| Je songeais cette nuit, que de mal consum\u00e9<br>\nC\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te d'un pauvre on m'avait inhum\u00e9 ;<br>\nMais ne pouvant souffrir ce f\u00e2cheux voisinage.<br>\nEn mort de qualit\u00e9, je lui tins ce langage.<br>\nRetire toi, Coquin, va pourrir loin d'ici,<br>\nIl ne t'appartient pas de m'approcher ainsi.<br>\nCoquin! ce m'a-t-il dit, d'une arrogance extr\u00eame,<br>\nVa chercher tes coquins ailleurs, coquin toi m\u00eame.<br>\nIci tous sont \u00e9gaux, je ne te dois plus rien,<br>\nJe suis sur mon fumier, comme toi sur le tien.<ref>''\"I was thinking last night that once illness had gotten the best of me / I had been buried side by side with a pauper. / Unwilling to put up with this inconvenient neighbor, / I spoke thus, like the high-ranking dead that I was: / Go away, you rascal, go and rot away from here / It is not for you to come near me. / Scoundrel! he retorted with an extreme arrogance, / Go get your rogues elsewhere, rogue yourself. / All are equal here, and I owe you nothing, / To each their muck.\"''</ref>}}\n\nPatrix is mentioned in one of [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s poems: {{quote|Et Patrix,<br>Quoique Normand, homme de prix.<ref>''\"And Patrix, / Though a Norman, is a worthy man.\"''</ref>}}\n\nPatrix left a ''La Mis\u00e9ricorde de Dieu sur la conduite d'un p\u00e9cheur p\u00e9nitent, avec quelques autres pieces chrestiennes, le tout compos\u00e9 et mis en lumiere par luy-mesme, en r\u00e9paration du pass\u00e9'',<ref>''God's mercy on the conduct of a penitent sinner, with a few other Christian pieces, all composed and brought to light her by himself, in atonement for the past, etc.''</ref> a collection he dedicated to the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. \"Ce recueil\", Huet wrote in his ''Les Origines de Caen'', \"m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre conserv\u00e9 pour sa singularit\u00e9; car encore que les vers soient sort n\u00e9glig\u00e9s, languissants, sentent le terroir Normand et le d\u00e9clin de l'\u00e2ge, l'on y voit n\u00e9anmoins briller cet esprit original d'o\u00f9 ils sont partis, et l'on y reconnait un c\u0153ur touch\u00e9 d'une pi\u00e9t\u00e9 sinc\u00e8re.
