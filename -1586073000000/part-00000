Upon his return, he couldn't walk without being in pain, and weighed only {{convert|180|lb}}. He was put on injured reserve for the season, but returned in 1971 and played on special teams.<ref name=tgopotr/> He spent several seasons trying to get increased playing time, and was waived on two occasions. But Bleier never gave up, and said that he worked hard so that \"some time in the future you didn't have to ask yourself 'what if?'\". An offseason training regimen brought Bleier back to {{convert|212|lb|abbr=on}} in the summer of [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1974]], and he earned a spot in the Steelers' starting lineup.\n\nSince [[Preston Pearson]] was wearing number 26 (the number Bleier wore his rookie season before he went to Vietnam), Bleier switched to number 20 when he returned to the team. After Pearson was traded to the [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1975]], Bleier kept the number 20, with which he had become associated.\n[[File:Rocky Bleier Pentagon.jpg|thumb|250px|Bleier's military service is commemorated in [[The Pentagon|the Pentagon's]] Wounded Warrior corridor]]\nIn addition to being a great lead blocker, Bleier was the second of the Steelers' rushing weapons ([[Franco Harris]] was the primary back), but was effective nonetheless at both blocking and rushing. In 1976, both Harris and Bleier rushed for over 1,000 yards, making this the second NFL team to accomplish [[List of NFL teams with multiple 1000 yard rushers|this feat]], after [[Mercury Morris]] and [[Larry Csonka]] of the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]].\n\nBleier played in the first four Steeler [[Super Bowl]] victories, and caught the touchdown pass from [[Terry Bradshaw]] that gave Pittsburgh a lead it would never surrender in [[Super Bowl XIII]]. He also recovered Dallas's onside kick in the closing seconds, sealing the Steelers' victory.\n\nBleier retired after the 1980 season with 3,865 rushing yards, 136 receptions for 1,294 yards, and 25 touchdowns.  At the time of his retirement, he was the Steelers' fourth all-time leading rusher.\n\n===NFL career statistics===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving\n|-\n!

He was put on injured reserve for the season, but returned in 1971 and played on special teams.<ref name=tgopotr/> He spent several seasons trying to get increased playing time, and was waived on two occasions. But Bleier never gave up, and said that he worked hard so that \"some time in the future you didn't have to ask yourself 'what if?'\". An offseason training regimen brought Bleier back to {{convert|212|lb|abbr=on}} in the summer of [[1974 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1974]], and he earned a spot in the Steelers' starting lineup.\n\nSince [[Preston Pearson]] was wearing number 26 (the number Bleier wore his rookie season before he went to Vietnam), Bleier switched to number 20 when he returned to the team. After Pearson was traded to the [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1975]], Bleier kept the number 20, with which he had become associated.\n[[File:Rocky Bleier Pentagon.jpg|thumb|250px|Bleier's military service is commemorated in [[The Pentagon|the Pentagon's]] Wounded Warrior corridor]]\nIn addition to being a great lead blocker, Bleier was the second of the Steelers' rushing weapons ([[Franco Harris]] was the primary back), but was effective nonetheless at both blocking and rushing. In 1976, both Harris and Bleier rushed for over 1,000 yards, making this the second NFL team to accomplish [[List of NFL teams with multiple 1000 yard rushers|this feat]], after [[Mercury Morris]] and [[Larry Csonka]] of the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]].\n\nBleier played in the first four Steeler [[Super Bowl]] victories, and caught the touchdown pass from [[Terry Bradshaw]] that gave Pittsburgh a lead it would never surrender in [[Super Bowl XIII]]. He also recovered Dallas's onside kick in the closing seconds, sealing the Steelers' victory.\n\nBleier retired after the 1980 season with 3,865 rushing yards, 136 receptions for 1,294 yards, and 25 touchdowns.  At the time of his retirement, he was the Steelers' fourth all-time leading rusher.\n\n===NFL career statistics===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving\n|-\n!

Bakewell was taken on as an [[able seaman]] by ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', but Blackborow was not hired; at 18, his youth and inexperience counted against him. Fearing that ''Endurance'' was shorthanded, Bakewell and [[Walter How]] helped Blackborow sneak aboard, and hid him in a locker amongst piles of clothing.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackletonexped/1914/t_blackborow.html NOVA Online | Shackleton's Antarctic Odyssey | Perce Blackborow, Steward<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On the third day at sea he was discovered. \n\nUnable to stand, he had to remain seated in a chair when he met [[Ernest Shackleton]] for the first time. Apparently in a fit of genuine rage, Shackleton subjected the stowaway to a most severe and terrifying tirade in front of the entire crew. This had the desired effect and the reactions of the two accomplices were enough to unmask them. Shackleton finished his performance by saying to Blackborow, \"Do you know that on these expeditions we often get very hungry, and if there is a stowaway available he is the first to be eaten?\" To which Blackborow replied, \"They\u2019d get a lot more meat off you, sir.\" Shackleton hid a grin and after chatting with one of the crew members said \"Introduce him to the cook first.\" <ref>Huntford, R. \"Shackleton\", p. 384.

On arrival, Shackleton thought to give Blackborow, the youngest of the crew, the honor of being the first to step on the island, forgetting that his feet had been frostbitten. Helped over the gunwale, he fell in the shallows, proclaiming that he was the first man to sit on Elephant Island, and was quickly carried ashore.\n\n===Frostbite===\nAfter the Endurance sank the crew salvaged what they could, with most of their clothing having been  already collected. Blackborow, however, had taken the wrong sort of boots and on the crew's journey to [[Elephant Island]] via lifeboat, he developed [[frostbite]] on his feet.\n\nOn 24 April the rescue party set sail in the ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' for [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], hoping to return in weeks. The rest of the crew resigned themselves to waiting. Almost to a man they were in poor health and spirits. Blackborow had contracted [[gangrene]] due to his frostbite, and was surgeon [[Alexander Macklin]]'s greatest medical concern.\n\nOn 15 June, with Shackleton and the ''James Caird'' crew having been away for a month, Macklin, assisted by [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|James McIlroy]], carried out an amputation operation on Blackborow, using [[chloroform]] for [[anesthesia]]. Greenstreet described the operation. \"Blackborow had \u2026 all the toes of his left foot taken off \u00bc inch stumps being left \u2026 The poor beggar behaved splendidly and it went without a hitch \u2026 Time from start to finish 55 minutes.
