Thus, habituation must be distinguished from [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds\u2014if a stuffed [[owl]] (or similar [[predator]]) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Science of Learning|last=Pear|first=Joseph|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-317-76280-5|location=London|page=15}}</ref> Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]''<ref name=\"gagliano2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliano | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 63\u201372 | doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7| pmid = 24390479 | bibcode = 2014Oecol.175...63G }}</ref> and the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]''.<ref name=\"wood1988\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.C. | year = 1988 | title = Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2254 | issue = | page = 8 }}</ref> This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Sensitization ====\n{{Main|Sensitization}}\n''Sensitization'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] (Bell et al., 1995).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Neurosciences \u2013 From Molecule to Behavior|last=Galizia|first=Giovanni|last2=Lledo|first2=Pierre-Marie|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2013|isbn=978-3-642-10768-9|location=Heidelberg|page=578}}</ref> An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously.

Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within [[metacognition]] have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.<ref>Bransford, 2000, pp. 15\u201320</ref> In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.<ref>{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J.

In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.\n\n==== Operant conditioning ====\n{{Main|Operant conditioning}}\nIn ''operant conditioning'', a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment given after a given behavior, change the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.\n\n==== Classical conditioning ====\n{{Main|Classical conditioning}}\nThe typical paradigm for ''classical conditioning'' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the \"conditioned stimulus\"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''. The classic example is [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his dogs.<ref name=\":1\" /> Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate\u2014salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species.

Watson]]. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views,\" in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, \"[[Little Albert]]\", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.\n\n==== Observational learning ====\n{{Main|Observational learning}}\n''Observational learning'' is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.\n\n==== Imprinting ====\n{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}\n''Imprinting'' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.\n\n=== Play ===\n{{Main|Play (activity)}}\n''Play'' generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as [[orca]]s playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to [[predator]]s and the risk of [[injury]] and possibly [[infection]]. It also consumes [[energy]], so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving [[physical fitness]].\n\nPlay, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.<ref name=\"Lillemyr, O.F. 2009\">Lillemyr, O.F. (2009). Taking play seriously. Children and play in early childhood education: an exciting challenge. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.</ref>\n\nThere are five types of play:\n# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity\n# role play occurs starting at the age of 3\n# rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary\n# construction play involves experimentation and building\n# movement play aka physical play<ref name=\"Lillemyr, O.F. 2009\"/>\n\nThese five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and [[problem-solving]] skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Whitebread | first1 = D. | last2 = Coltman | first2 = P. | last3 = Jameson | first3 = H. | last4 = Lander | first4 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Play, cognition and self-regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? | url =https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232442434 | journal = Educational & Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 40\u201352 }}</ref> Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.\n\n=== Enculturation ===\n{{Main|Enculturation}}\n''Enculturation'' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.<ref name=\"GrusecHastings\">Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. \"Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research\", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7|978-1-59385-332-7}}; at p. 547.</ref> Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.<ref name=\"GrusecHastings\"/> If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.<ref name=\"GrusecHastings\"/> This is different from [[acculturation]], where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.\n\nMultiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally. Collaborative practices in the Mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience.<ref name=\"Paradise1994\">{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|title=Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to Be Separate-But-Together|journal=Anthropology & Education Quarterly|date=1994|doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156\u2013172}}</ref> As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions.

This type of learning relies on [[dual-coding theory]] {{Harv|Paivio|1971}}.\n\n=== E-learning and augmented learning ===\n{{Main|Electronic learning}}\n''Electronic learning'' or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is [[mobile learning]] (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as [[cellular phone]]s.\n\nWhen a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called [[augmented learning]]. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime.<ref name=\"Augmented Learning\">[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning</ref> See also [[minimally invasive education]].\n\nMoore (1989)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = M | year = 1989 | title = Three types of interaction | url = | journal = American Journal of Distance Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1\u20136 | doi=10.1080/08923648909526659| citeseerx = 10.1.1.491.4800 }}</ref> purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:\n* learner\u2013learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),\n* learner\u2013instructor (i.e. student teacher communication), and\n* learner\u2013content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners' understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).\nIn his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993)<ref>Moore, M.G. (1993). Theory of transactional distance. In D. Keegan (Ed.), Theoretical principles of distance education (pp. 22\u201338). London and New York: Routledge</ref> contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).\n\n=== Rote learning ===\n{{Main|Rote learning}}\n''Rote learning'' is [[memorizing]] information so that it can be [[recollection|recalled]] by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.\n\n=== Meaningful learning ===\n{{See also|Deeper learning}}\n''Meaningful learning'' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with [[rote learning]] in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hassard|first=Jack|title=Backup of Meaningful Learning Model|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|accessdate=30 November 2011|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029042955/http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|archivedate=29 October 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Evidence-based learning===\n{{Main|Evidence-based learning}}\nEvidence-based learning is the use of evidence from well designed scientific studies to accelerate learning. Evidence-based learning methods such as [[spaced repetition]] can increase the rate at which a student learns.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smolen |first1=Paul |last2=Zhang |first2=Yili |last3=Byrne |first3=John H. |title=The right time to learn: mechanisms and optimization of spaced learning |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |date=25 January 2016 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201388 |doi=10.1038/nrn.2015.18 |pmid=26806627 |arxiv=1606.08370 |bibcode=2016arXiv160608370S |pmc=5126970}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal learning ===\n{{Main|Education}}\n[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|right|225px|thumb|A depiction of the world's oldest continually operating university, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy]]\n''Formal learning'' is learning that takes place within a teacher-student relationship, such as in a school system. The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.<ref>Bell, J., and Dale, M., [http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html \" Informal Learning in the Workplace\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121140538/http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html |date=2013-01-21 }}, '' Department for Education and Employment Research Report No. 134. London, England: Department for Education and Employment'', August 1999</ref>\n\n=== Nonformal learning ===\n{{Main|Nonformal learning}}\n''Nonformal learning'' is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.\n\n=== Informal learning ===\n{{Main|Informal learning}}\n''Informal learning'' is less structured than \"nonformal\" one. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, [[play (activity)|play]], exploring, etc.\n\n=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===\nThe educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, [[teaching]], etc.\n\nTo learn a skill, such as solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] quickly, several factors come into play at once:\n* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.\n* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build \"[[muscle memory]]\" and speed.\n* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.\n* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.\n* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.\n\n=== Tangential learning ===\n''Tangential learning'' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.<ref>Tangential Learning {{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |title=Penny Arcade \u2013 PATV \u2013 Tangential Learning |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104053746/http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}</ref> Self-education can be improved with systematization.

This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor's plans and the student's expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say \u201ctrain.\u201d Once the student says \u201ctrain,\u201d he gets access to the train set.\n\nHere are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|title=What is incidental teaching?|year=2017|website=North Shore Pediatric Therapy, Illinois|access-date=August 29, 2017|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829204217/http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=}}</ref>\n* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student's sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.\n* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.\n* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.\n* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.\n* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.\n\nIncidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Konetes|first1=George|title=The Effects of Distance Education and Student Involvement on Incidental Learning|journal=IUP Doctoral Dissertations|date=2011|page=115|url=https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=Incidental Learning|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130414/https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Domains ==\n[[File:France in XXI Century.

For example, in learning to play [[chess]], the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)\u2014but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its [[history of chess|history]] (affective domain).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/bloomstaxonomyoflearningdomains.htm|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|author=|date=|website=www.businessballs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Transfer ==\n[[Transfer of learning]] is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled.

Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the \"level of attention\", \"attitudes\", \"method of attack\" (or method for tackling a problem), a \"search for new points of view\", \"a careful testing of hypothesis\" and \"generalization\" were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ruger|first=Henry Alfred|title=The psychology of efficiency: an experimental study of the processes involved in the solution of mechanical puzzles and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation|journal=Science Press|year=1910|volume=19|issue=2}}</ref> To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning (\"hugging\") instruction with practice and assessment, and \"bridging\", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.<ref name=\"Perkins\" />\n\n== Factors affecting learning ==\n\n=== External factors ===\n# ''[[Heredity]]'': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use and develop it. Some learners are rich in hereditary endowment while others are poor. Each student is unique and has different abilities. The native intelligence is different in individuals. Heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning. The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.\n# ''Status of students'': Physical and home conditions also matter: Certain problems like malnutrition i.e.; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning. These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected. Home is a place where a family lives. If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously. Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc. These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.<ref name=\"Ref 1\">{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=S.K.|title=Essentials of Educational Psychology|year= 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sight lines to the instructor or instructional material is limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.<ref>[http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources ''New Teachers: Designing Learning Environments'', May 7, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328041804/http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources |date=March 28, 2016 }}.

A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him. A goal is an aim or desired result. There are 2 types of goals called immediate and distant goals. A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve. Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners. Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.\n# ''Motivational behavior'': Motivation means to provide with a motive. Motivation learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest. This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal energies.\n# ''Interest'': This is a quality that arouses a feeling. It encourages a student to move over tasks further. During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning. Interest is an apparent (clearly seen or understood) behaviour.\n# ''Attention'': Attention means consideration. It is concentration or focusing of consciousness upon one object or an idea. If effective learning should take place attention is essential. Instructors must secure the attention of the student.\n# ''Drill or practice'': This method includes repeating the tasks \"n\" number of times like needs, phrases, principles, etc. This makes learning more effective.\n# ''Fatigue'': Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental. Muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue. Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system. The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.\n# ''[[Aptitude]]'': Aptitude is natural ability. It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.\n# ''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]]'': It is a way of thinking. The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.\n# ''Emotional conditions'': Emotions are physiological states of being. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.\n# ''Speed, Accuracy and retention'': Speed is the rapidity of movement. Retention is the act of retaining. These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.\n# ''Learning activities'': Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.\n# ''Testing'': Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning. Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.\n# ''Guidance'': Everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life. Some need it constantly and some very rarely depending on the students conditions. Small learners need more guidance. Guidance is an advice to solve a problem. Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies. Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.\n\n===Epigenetic factors===\n{{Further|Epigenetics in learning and memory}}\nThe underlying molecular basis of learning appears to be dynamic changes in [[gene expression]] occurring in [[brain]] [[neuron]]s that are introduced by [[epigenetic]] mechanisms.  Epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves, most notably, chemical modification of [[DNA]] or DNA-associated [[histone]] proteins.  These chemical modifications can cause long lasting changes in gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms involved in learning include the [[DNA methylation|methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]] of neuronal DNA as well as [[histone methylation|methylation]], [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|acetylation and deacetylation of neuronal histone proteins]].\n\nDuring learning, information processing in the brain involves induction of [[DNA oxidation|oxidative modification in neuronal DNA]] followed by the employment of [[DNA repair]] processes that introduce epigenetic alterations.  In particular, the DNA repair processes of [[non-homologous end joining]] and [[base excision repair]] are employed in learning and memory formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X | last2 = Marshall | first2 = PR | last3 = Leighton | first3 = LJ | last4 = Zajaczkowski | first4 = EL | last5 = Wang | first5 = Z | last6 = Madugalle | first6 = SU | last7 = Yin | first7 = J | last8 = Bredy | first8 = TW | last9 = Wei | first9 = W | year = 2019 | title = The DNA Repair-Associated Protein Gadd45\u03b3 Regulates the Temporal Coding of Immediate Early Gene Expression within the Prelimbic Prefrontal Cortex and Is Required for the Consolidation of Associative Fear Memory | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 39 | issue = 6| pages = 970\u2013983 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2024-18.2018 | pmid = 30545945 }} Erratum in: {{cite journal | pmid = 30545945 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2024-18.2018 | volume=39 | title=The DNA Repair-Associated Protein Gadd45\u03b3 Regulates the Temporal Coding of Immediate Early Gene Expression within the Prelimbic Prefrontal Cortex and Is Required for the Consolidation of Associative Fear Memory | pmc=6363930 | year=2019 | journal=J Neurosci | pages=970\u2013983 | last1 = Li | first1 = X | last2 = Marshall | first2 = PR | last3 = Leighton | first3 = LJ | last4 = Zajaczkowski | first4 = EL | last5 = Wang | first5 = Z | last6 = Madugalle | first6 = SU | last7 = Yin | first7 = J | last8 = Bredy | first8 = TW | last9 = Wei | first9 = W}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brito | first1 = David V.C. | last2 = Kupke | first2 = Janina | last3 = Gulmez Karaca | first3 = Kubra | last4 = Zeuch | first4 = Benjamin | last5 = Oliveira | first5 = Ana M.M. | year = 2020| title = Mimicking Age-Associated Gadd45\u03b3 Dysregulation Results in Memory Impairments in Young Adult Mice | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 40 | issue = 6| pages = 1197\u20131210 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1621-19.2019 | pmid = 31826946 | pmc = 7002144 }}</ref>\n\n== In animal evolution ==\nAnimals gain knowledge in two ways. First is learning\u2014in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf. at <{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}></ref> In some scenarios, [[Instinct|innate knowledge]] is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true\u2014animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning [[Evolution|evolves]] in the species.\n\n=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===\nIn a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.\nEssentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario\u2014but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.<ref name=\"Dunlap\" />\n\nNon-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario\u2014and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information\u2014non-learning evolves. However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous. Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.<ref name=\"Dunlap\" /> The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.005 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=An operating cost of learning in Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=589\u2013598| year=2004 | last1=Mery | first1=Frederic | last2=Kawecki | first2=Tadeusz J. | url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/4149/files/1_kawecki_ocl.pdf }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.<ref name=\"Dunlap\" /> An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Odling-Smee | first1 = L. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = V.A. | year = 2003 | title = The role of learning in fish orientation | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 235\u2013246 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00127.x }}</ref>\n\n== In plants ==\nIn recent years, plant physiologists have examined the physiology of plant behavior and cognition. The concepts of learning and memory are relevant in identifying how plants respond to external cues, a behavior necessary for survival. Monica Gagliano, an Australian professor of evolutionary ecology, makes an argument for associative learning in the garden pea, ''Pisum sativum''. The garden pea is not specific to a region, but rather grows in cooler, higher altitude climates. Gagliano and colleagues\u2019 2016 paper aims to differentiate between innate phototropism behavior and learned behaviors.<ref name=\":3\" /> Plants use light cues in various ways, such as to sustain their metabolic needs and to maintain their internal circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms in plants are modulated by endogenous bioactive substances that encourage leaf-opening and leaf-closing and are the basis of nyctinastic behaviors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ueda|first=Minoru|date=2007|title=Endogenous factors involved in the regulation of movement and \"memory\" in plants|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d623/5e4ebd0ff824a4a8599aab9ea55201cf250c.pdf|journal=Pure Appl.

In each case, there was a fan blowing lightly down the tube in either the same or opposite arm as the light. The unconditioned stimulus (US) was the predicted occurrence of light and the conditioned stimulus (CS) was the wind blowing by the fan. Previous experimentation shows that plants respond to light by bending and growing towards it through differential cell growth and division on one side of the plant stem mediated by auxin signalling pathways.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liscum|first=Emmanuel|date=January 2014|title=Phototropism: Growing towards an Understanding of Plant Movement|journal=Plant Cell|volume=1|pages=38\u201355|pmc=3963583|pmid=24481074|doi=10.1105/tpc.113.119727}}</ref>\n\nDuring the testing phase of Gagliano's experiment, the pea seedlings were placed in different Y-pipes and exposed to the fan alone. Their direction of growth was subsequently recorded. The \u2018correct\u2019 response by the seedlings was deemed to be growing into the arm where the light was \u201cpredicted\u201d from the previous day.\u00a0 The majority of plants in both experimental conditions grew in a direction consistent with the predicted location of light based on the position of the fan the previous day.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, if the seedling was trained with the fan and light coming down the same arm of the Y-pipe, the following day the seedling grew towards the fan in the absence of light cues despite the fan being placed in the opposite side of the Y-arm. Plants in the control group showed no preference to a particular arm of the Y-pipe. The percentage difference in population behavior observed between the control and experimental groups is meant to distinguish innate phototropism behavior from active associative learning.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile the physiological mechanism of associative learning in plants is not known, Telewski et al. describes a hypothesis that describes photoreception as the basis of mechano-perception in plants.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Telewski|first=FW|date=October 2006|title=A unified hypothesis of mechanoperception in plants.|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=93|pages=1466\u201376|pmid=21642094|doi=10.3732/ajb.93.10.1466}}</ref> One mechanism for mechano-perception in plants relies on MS ion channels and calcium channels. Mechanosensory proteins in cell lipid bilayers, known as MS ion channels, are activated once they are physically deformed in response to pressure or tension. Ca2+ permeable ion channels are \u201cstretch-gated\u201d and allow for the influx of osmolytes and calcium, a well-known second messenger, into the cell. This ion influx triggers a passive flow of water into the cell down its osmotic gradient, effectively increasing turgor pressure and causing the cell to depolarize.<ref name=\":4\" /> Gagliano hypothesizes that the basis of associative learning in ''Pisum sativum'' is the coupling of mechanosensory and photosensory pathways and is mediated by auxin signaling pathways. The result is directional growth to maximize a plant's capture of sunlight.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGagliano et al. published another paper on habituation behaviors in the ''mimosa pudica'' plant whereby the innate behavior of the plant was diminished by repeated exposure to a stimulus.<ref name=\"gagliano2014\" /> There has been controversy around this paper and more generally around the topic of plant cognition. Charles Abrahmson, a psychologist and behavioral biologist, says that part of the issue of why scientists disagree about whether plants have the ability to learn is that researchers do not use a consistent definition of \"learning\" and \"cognition\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Charles I.|last2=Chicas-Mosier|first2=Ana M.|date=2016-03-31|title=Learning in Plants: Lessons from Mimosa pudica|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=7|pages=417|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00417|pmid=27065905|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4814444}}</ref> Similarly, Michael Pollan, an author and journalist, says in his piece ''The Intelligent Plant'' that researchers do not doubt Gagliano's data but rather her language, specifically her use of the term \u201clearning\u201d and \"cognition\" with respect to plants.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/the-intelligent-plant|title=The Intelligent Plant|last=Pollan|first=Michael|date=2013-12-16|access-date=2019-06-06|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> A direction for future research is testing whether circadian rhythms in plants modulate learning and behavior and surveying researchers' definitions of \u201ccognition\u201d and \u201clearning.\u201d\n\n== Machine learning ==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Evolution-of-Adaptive-Behaviour-in-Robots-by-Means-of-Darwinian-Selection-pbio.1000292.s007.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=46|Robots can learn to cooperate.]]\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning, a branch of [[artificial intelligence]], concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data.

Thus, habituation must be distinguished from [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds\u2014if a stuffed [[owl]] (or similar [[predator]]) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Science of Learning|last=Pear|first=Joseph|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-317-76280-5|location=London|page=15}}</ref> Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]''<ref name=\"gagliano2014\">{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliano | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 63\u201372 | doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7| pmid = 24390479 | bibcode = 2014Oecol.175...63G }}</ref> and the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]''.<ref name=\"wood1988\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.C. | year = 1988 | title = Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2254 | issue = | page = 8 }}</ref> This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Sensitization ====\n{{Main|Sensitization}}\n''Sensitization'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] (Bell et al., 1995).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Neurosciences \u2013 From Molecule to Behavior|last=Galizia|first=Giovanni|last2=Lledo|first2=Pierre-Marie|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2013|isbn=978-3-642-10768-9|location=Heidelberg|page=578}}</ref> An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously.

Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within [[metacognition]] have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.<ref>Bransford, 2000, pp. 15\u201320</ref> In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.<ref>{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J.

In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.\n\n==== Operant conditioning ====\n{{Main|Operant conditioning}}\nIn ''operant conditioning'', a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment given after a given behavior, change the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.\n\n==== Classical conditioning ====\n{{Main|Classical conditioning}}\nThe typical paradigm for ''classical conditioning'' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the \"conditioned stimulus\"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''. The classic example is [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his dogs.<ref name=\":1\" /> Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate\u2014salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the [[proboscis extension reflex]] paradigm.<ref name=\"bitterman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bitterman | display-authors = etal | year = 1983 | title = Classical Conditioning of Proboscis Extension in Honeybees (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = J.

Watson]]. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article \"Psychology as the Behaviorist Views,\" in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, \"[[Little Albert]]\", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.\n\n==== Observational learning ====\n{{Main|Observational learning}}\n''Observational learning'' is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.\n\n==== Imprinting ====\n{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}\n''Imprinting'' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.\n\n=== Play ===\n{{Main|Play (activity)}}\n''Play'' generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as [[orca]]s playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to [[predator]]s and the risk of [[injury]] and possibly [[infection]]. It also consumes [[energy]], so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving [[physical fitness]].\n\nPlay, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.<ref name=\"Lillemyr, O.F. 2009\">Lillemyr, O.F. (2009). Taking play seriously. Children and play in early childhood education: an exciting challenge. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.</ref>\n\nThere are five types of play:\n# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity\n# role play occurs starting at the age of 3\n# rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary\n# construction play involves experimentation and building\n# movement play aka physical play<ref name=\"Lillemyr, O.F. 2009\"/>\n\nThese five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and [[problem-solving]] skills in children.

Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.\n\n=== Enculturation ===\n{{Main|Enculturation}}\n''Enculturation'' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.<ref name=\"GrusecHastings\">Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. \"Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research\", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7|978-1-59385-332-7}}; at p. 547.</ref> Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.<ref name=\"GrusecHastings\"/> If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.<ref name=\"GrusecHastings\"/> This is different from [[acculturation]], where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.\n\nMultiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally.

A specific and always more diffused e-learning is [[mobile learning]] (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as [[cellular phone]]s.\n\nWhen a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called [[augmented learning]]. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime.<ref name=\"Augmented Learning\">[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning</ref> See also [[minimally invasive education]].\n\nMoore (1989)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = M | year = 1989 | title = Three types of interaction | url = | journal = American Journal of Distance Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1\u20136 | doi=10.1080/08923648909526659| citeseerx = 10.1.1.491.4800 }}</ref> purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:\n* learner\u2013learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),\n* learner\u2013instructor (i.e. student teacher communication), and\n* learner\u2013content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners' understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).\nIn his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993)<ref>Moore, M.G. (1993). Theory of transactional distance. In D. Keegan (Ed.), Theoretical principles of distance education (pp. 22\u201338). London and New York: Routledge</ref> contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).\n\n=== Rote learning ===\n{{Main|Rote learning}}\n''Rote learning'' is [[memorizing]] information so that it can be [[recollection|recalled]] by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.\n\n=== Meaningful learning ===\n{{See also|Deeper learning}}\n''Meaningful learning'' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with [[rote learning]] in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hassard|first=Jack|title=Backup of Meaningful Learning Model|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|accessdate=30 November 2011|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029042955/http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|archivedate=29 October 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Evidence-based learning===\n{{Main|Evidence-based learning}}\nEvidence-based learning is the use of evidence from well designed scientific studies to accelerate learning.

The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.<ref>Bell, J., and Dale, M., [http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html \" Informal Learning in the Workplace\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121140538/http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html |date=2013-01-21 }}, '' Department for Education and Employment Research Report No. 134. London, England: Department for Education and Employment'', August 1999</ref>\n\n=== Nonformal learning ===\n{{Main|Nonformal learning}}\n''Nonformal learning'' is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.\n\n=== Informal learning ===\n{{Main|Informal learning}}\n''Informal learning'' is less structured than \"nonformal\" one. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, [[play (activity)|play]], exploring, etc.\n\n=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===\nThe educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, [[teaching]], etc.\n\nTo learn a skill, such as solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] quickly, several factors come into play at once:\n* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.\n* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build \"[[muscle memory]]\" and speed.\n* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.\n* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.\n* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.\n\n=== Tangential learning ===\n''Tangential learning'' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.<ref>Tangential Learning {{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |title=Penny Arcade \u2013 PATV \u2013 Tangential Learning |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104053746/http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}</ref> Self-education can be improved with systematization.

This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor's plans and the student's expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say \u201ctrain.\u201d Once the student says \u201ctrain,\u201d he gets access to the train set.\n\nHere are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|title=What is incidental teaching?|year=2017|website=North Shore Pediatric Therapy, Illinois|access-date=August 29, 2017|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829204217/http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=}}</ref>\n* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student's sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.\n* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.\n* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.\n* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.\n* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.\n\nIncidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Konetes|first1=George|title=The Effects of Distance Education and Student Involvement on Incidental Learning|journal=IUP Doctoral Dissertations|date=2011|page=115|url=https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=Incidental Learning|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130414/https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Domains ==\n[[File:France in XXI Century. School.jpg|thumb|270px|''Future school'' (1901 or 1910)]]\n[[Benjamin Bloom]] has suggested three domains of learning:\n* [[Cognitive]]: To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.\n* [[Psychomotor learning|Psychomotor]]: To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.\n* [[Affective]]: To like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.\n\nThese domains are not mutually exclusive. For example, in learning to play [[chess]], the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)\u2014but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its [[history of chess|history]] (affective domain).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/bloomstaxonomyoflearningdomains.htm|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|author=|date=|website=www.businessballs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Transfer ==\n[[Transfer of learning]] is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when \"... cued, primed, and guided...\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Are Cognitive Skills Context-Bound?|journal=Educational Researcher|date=Jan\u2013Feb 1989|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16\u201325 [19]|doi=10.3102/0013189x018001016}}</ref> and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through instruction.\n\nOver the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced. First, it is speculated that different types of transfer exist, including: near transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context; and far transfer, the application of skill to solve novel problem presented in a different context.<ref>{{cite book|last=Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research|title=Chapter 3.

Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the \"level of attention\", \"attitudes\", \"method of attack\" (or method for tackling a problem), a \"search for new points of view\", \"a careful testing of hypothesis\" and \"generalization\" were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ruger|first=Henry Alfred|title=The psychology of efficiency: an experimental study of the processes involved in the solution of mechanical puzzles and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation|journal=Science Press|year=1910|volume=19|issue=2}}</ref> To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning (\"hugging\") instruction with practice and assessment, and \"bridging\", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.<ref name=\"Perkins\" />\n\n== Factors affecting learning ==\n\n=== External factors ===\n# ''[[Heredity]]'': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use and develop it. Some learners are rich in hereditary endowment while others are poor. Each student is unique and has different abilities. The native intelligence is different in individuals. Heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning. The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.\n# ''Status of students'': Physical and home conditions also matter: Certain problems like malnutrition i.e.; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning. These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected. Home is a place where a family lives. If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously. Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc. These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.<ref name=\"Ref 1\">{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=S.K.|title=Essentials of Educational Psychology|year= 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Size, configuration, comfort\u2014fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture\u2014can all affect a student's learning. The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies. For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sight lines to the instructor or instructional material is limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.<ref>[http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources ''New Teachers: Designing Learning Environments'', May 7, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328041804/http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources |date=March 28, 2016 }}.

A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him. A goal is an aim or desired result. There are 2 types of goals called immediate and distant goals. A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve. Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners. Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.\n# ''Motivational behavior'': Motivation means to provide with a motive. Motivation learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest. This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal energies.\n# ''Interest'': This is a quality that arouses a feeling. It encourages a student to move over tasks further. During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning. Interest is an apparent (clearly seen or understood) behaviour.\n# ''Attention'': Attention means consideration. It is concentration or focusing of consciousness upon one object or an idea. If effective learning should take place attention is essential. Instructors must secure the attention of the student.\n# ''Drill or practice'': This method includes repeating the tasks \"n\" number of times like needs, phrases, principles, etc. This makes learning more effective.\n# ''Fatigue'': Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental. Muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue. Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system. The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.\n# ''[[Aptitude]]'': Aptitude is natural ability. It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.\n# ''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]]'': It is a way of thinking. The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.\n# ''Emotional conditions'': Emotions are physiological states of being. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.\n# ''Speed, Accuracy and retention'': Speed is the rapidity of movement. Retention is the act of retaining. These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.\n# ''Learning activities'': Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.\n# ''Testing'': Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning. Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.\n# ''Guidance'': Everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life. Some need it constantly and some very rarely depending on the students conditions. Small learners need more guidance. Guidance is an advice to solve a problem. Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies. Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.\n\n===Epigenetic factors===\n{{Further|Epigenetics in learning and memory}}\nThe underlying molecular basis of learning appears to be dynamic changes in [[gene expression]] occurring in [[brain]] [[neuron]]s that are introduced by [[epigenetic]] mechanisms.  Epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves, most notably, chemical modification of [[DNA]] or DNA-associated [[histone]] proteins.  These chemical modifications can cause long lasting changes in gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms involved in learning include the [[DNA methylation|methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]] of neuronal DNA as well as [[histone methylation|methylation]], [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|acetylation and deacetylation of neuronal histone proteins]].\n\nDuring learning, information processing in the brain involves induction of [[DNA oxidation|oxidative modification in neuronal DNA]] followed by the employment of [[DNA repair]] processes that introduce epigenetic alterations.  In particular, the DNA repair processes of [[non-homologous end joining]] and [[base excision repair]] are employed in learning and memory formation.<ref>The DNA Repair-Associated Protein Gadd45\u03b3 Regulates the Temporal Coding of Immediate Early Gene Expression within the Prelimbic Prefrontal Cortex and Is Required for the Consolidation of Associative Fear Memory.

First is learning\u2014in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.<ref name=\"Dunlap\">DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf. at <{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}></ref> In some scenarios, [[Instinct|innate knowledge]] is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true\u2014animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning [[Evolution|evolves]] in the species.\n\n=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===\nIn a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.\nEssentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario\u2014but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.<ref name=\"Dunlap\" />\n\nNon-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario\u2014and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information\u2014non-learning evolves. However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous. Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.<ref name=\"Dunlap\" /> The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.005 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=An operating cost of learning in Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=589\u2013598| year=2004 | last1=Mery | first1=Frederic | last2=Kawecki | first2=Tadeusz J. | url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/4149/files/1_kawecki_ocl.pdf }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.<ref name=\"Dunlap\" /> An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Odling-Smee | first1 = L. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = V.A. | year = 2003 | title = The role of learning in fish orientation | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 235\u2013246 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00127.x }}</ref>\n\n== In plants ==\nIn recent years, plant physiologists have examined the physiology of plant behavior and cognition. The concepts of learning and memory are relevant in identifying how plants respond to external cues, a behavior necessary for survival. Monica Gagliano, an Australian professor of evolutionary ecology, makes an argument for associative learning in the garden pea, ''Pisum sativum''. The garden pea is not specific to a region, but rather grows in cooler, higher altitude climates. Gagliano and colleagues\u2019 2016 paper aims to differentiate between innate phototropism behavior and learned behaviors.<ref name=\":3\" /> Plants use light cues in various ways, such as to sustain their metabolic needs and to maintain their internal circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms in plants are modulated by endogenous bioactive substances that encourage leaf-opening and leaf-closing and are the basis of nyctinastic behaviors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ueda|first=Minoru|date=2007|title=Endogenous factors involved in the regulation of movement and \"memory\" in plants|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d623/5e4ebd0ff824a4a8599aab9ea55201cf250c.pdf|journal=Pure Appl.

In each case, there was a fan blowing lightly down the tube in either the same or opposite arm as the light. The unconditioned stimulus (US) was the predicted occurrence of light and the conditioned stimulus (CS) was the wind blowing by the fan. Previous experimentation shows that plants respond to light by bending and growing towards it through differential cell growth and division on one side of the plant stem mediated by auxin signalling pathways.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liscum|first=Emmanuel|date=January 2014|title=Phototropism: Growing towards an Understanding of Plant Movement|journal=Plant Cell|volume=1|pages=38\u201355|pmc=3963583|pmid=24481074|doi=10.1105/tpc.113.119727}}</ref>\n\nDuring the testing phase of Gagliano's experiment, the pea seedlings were placed in different Y-pipes and exposed to the fan alone. Their direction of growth was subsequently recorded. The \u2018correct\u2019 response by the seedlings was deemed to be growing into the arm where the light was \u201cpredicted\u201d from the previous day.\u00a0 The majority of plants in both experimental conditions grew in a direction consistent with the predicted location of light based on the position of the fan the previous day.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, if the seedling was trained with the fan and light coming down the same arm of the Y-pipe, the following day the seedling grew towards the fan in the absence of light cues despite the fan being placed in the opposite side of the Y-arm. Plants in the control group showed no preference to a particular arm of the Y-pipe. The percentage difference in population behavior observed between the control and experimental groups is meant to distinguish innate phototropism behavior from active associative learning.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile the physiological mechanism of associative learning in plants is not known, Telewski et al. describes a hypothesis that describes photoreception as the basis of mechano-perception in plants.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Telewski|first=FW|date=October 2006|title=A unified hypothesis of mechanoperception in plants.|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=93|pages=1466\u201376|pmid=21642094|doi=10.3732/ajb.93.10.1466}}</ref> One mechanism for mechano-perception in plants relies on MS ion channels and calcium channels. Mechanosensory proteins in cell lipid bilayers, known as MS ion channels, are activated once they are physically deformed in response to pressure or tension. Ca2+ permeable ion channels are \u201cstretch-gated\u201d and allow for the influx of osmolytes and calcium, a well-known second messenger, into the cell. This ion influx triggers a passive flow of water into the cell down its osmotic gradient, effectively increasing turgor pressure and causing the cell to depolarize.<ref name=\":4\" /> Gagliano hypothesizes that the basis of associative learning in ''Pisum sativum'' is the coupling of mechanosensory and photosensory pathways and is mediated by auxin signaling pathways. The result is directional growth to maximize a plant's capture of sunlight.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGagliano et al. published another paper on habituation behaviors in the ''mimosa pudica'' plant whereby the innate behavior of the plant was diminished by repeated exposure to a stimulus.<ref name=\"gagliano2014\" /> There has been controversy around this paper and more generally around the topic of plant cognition. Charles Abrahmson, a psychologist and behavioral biologist, says that part of the issue of why scientists disagree about whether plants have the ability to learn is that researchers do not use a consistent definition of \"learning\" and \"cognition\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Charles I.|last2=Chicas-Mosier|first2=Ana M.|date=2016-03-31|title=Learning in Plants: Lessons from Mimosa pudica|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=7|pages=417|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00417|pmid=27065905|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4814444}}</ref> Similarly, Michael Pollan, an author and journalist, says in his piece ''The Intelligent Plant'' that researchers do not doubt Gagliano's data but rather her language, specifically her use of the term \u201clearning\u201d and \"cognition\" with respect to plants.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/the-intelligent-plant|title=The Intelligent Plant|last=Pollan|first=Michael|date=2013-12-16|access-date=2019-06-06|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> A direction for future research is testing whether circadian rhythms in plants modulate learning and behavior and surveying researchers' definitions of \u201ccognition\u201d and \u201clearning.\u201d\n\n== Machine learning ==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Evolution-of-Adaptive-Behaviour-in-Robots-by-Means-of-Darwinian-Selection-pbio.1000292.s007.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=46|Robots can learn to cooperate.]]\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning, a branch of [[artificial intelligence]], concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data.

It forms the first part of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]''. The ''Charter'' guarantees certain [[Politics of Canada|political]] rights to Canadian citizens and [[civil rights]] of everyone in [[Canada]] from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the [[Government of Canada|government]]. It is designed to unify [[Canadians]] around a set of principles that embody those rights. The ''Charter'' was signed into law by [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen Elizabeth II of Canada]] on April 17, 1982, along with the rest of the Act.\n\nThe ''Charter'' was preceded by the ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'', which was enacted in 1960. However, the ''Bill of Rights'' is only a federal [[statute]], rather than a constitutional document. As a federal statute, it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process and has no application to provincial laws. The Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the ''Bill of Rights'' and the Court was reluctant to declare laws inoperative.<ref>Only one federal law was declared inoperative by the Supreme Court of Canada: ''[[R.&nbsp;v. Drybones]]'' (1969), [1970] S.C.R. 282. For an example of the narrow interpretation of the Supreme Court of Canada see Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell, [1974] S.C.R. 1349.</ref> The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of Rights motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada. The movement for [[human right]]s and freedoms that emerged after [[World War&nbsp;II]] also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref>Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 689.</ref> The British Parliament formally enacted the ''Charter'' as a part of the'' [[Canada Act 1982]]'' at the request of the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1982, the result of the efforts of the government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]].\n\nOne of the most notable effects of the adoption of the ''Charter'' was to greatly expand the scope of [[judicial review]], because the ''Charter'' is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the ''Bill of Rights''. The [[Court system of Canada|courts]], when confronted with violations of ''Charter'' rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when [[Law of Canada|Canadian case law]] was primarily concerned with resolving issues of [[Canadian federalism|federalism]]. The ''Charter'', however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the [[common law]] and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's parent country the [[United Kingdom]], was based upon [[Parliamentary supremacy]]. As a result, the ''Charter'' has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased [[judicial power]]. The ''Charter'' only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.\n\n==Features==\n{{Canadian Charter}}\nUnder the ''Charter'', people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and political rights. Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person (the ''Charter'' does not define the corporation as a \"legal person\"),<ref>Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 741\u2013742</ref> but a few of the rights belong exclusively to natural persons, or (as in sections 3 and 6) only to [[Canadian nationality law|citizens of Canada]]. The rights are enforceable by the courts through [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 24]] of the ''Charter'', which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the ''Charter'' and might damage the reputation of the justice system. [[Section 32 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 32]] confirms that the ''Charter'' is binding on the federal government, the territories under its authority, and the provincial governments.\nThe rights and freedoms enshrined in 34 sections of the ''Charter'' include:\n\n===Exceptions===\nPrecluding all the freedoms and forming the basis of the ''Charter'', the [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|very first section]], known as ''limitations clause'', allows governments to justify certain infringements of ''Charter'' rights. Every case in which a court discovers a violation of the ''Charter'' would therefore require a section 1 analysis to determine if the law can still be upheld. Infringements are upheld if the purpose for the government action is to achieve what would be recognized as an urgent or important objective in a free society, and if the infringement can be \"demonstrably justified.\" Section 1 has thus been used to uphold laws against objectionable conduct such as [[hate speech]] (e.g., in ''[[R v Keegstra]]'') and [[obscenity]] (e.g., in ''[[R. v. Butler]]''). Section 1 also confirms that the rights listed in the ''Charter'' are guaranteed.\n\nIn addition,  some of these rights are also subjected to the ''notwithstanding clause'' ([[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]]). The notwithstanding clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7\u201315 for up to five years, subject to renewal. The Canadian federal government has never invoked it, and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly.<ref>Heather Scoffield, \"Ottawa rules out invoking notwithstanding clause to stop migrant ships,\" Canadian Press, September 13, 2010</ref> In the past, the notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely by the province of [[Quebec]] (which did not support the enactment of the ''Charter'' but is subject to it nonetheless). The provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] have also invoked the notwithstanding clause, to end a [[strike action|strike]] and to protect an exclusively [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|heterosexual definition]] of marriage,<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html Marriage Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113082005/http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html |date=2007-01-13 }}, R.S.A. 2000, c.

Many of these rights were also included in the ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'', which the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]] enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the ''Charter'', it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the ''Bill of Rights'' conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative. The ''Bill of Rights'' did not contain all of the rights that are now included in the ''Charter'', omitting, for instance, the [[suffrage|right to vote]]<ref>Hogg, Peter W. Canada Act 1982 Annotated.

Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights, as well as [[patriation]] of the Constitution, meaning the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] would no longer have to approve [[constitutional amendment]]s. Subsequently, [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] appointed law professor [[Barry Strayer]] to research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars, including [[Walter Tarnopolsky]]. Strayer's report advocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the ''Charter'', including protection for language rights. Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights. Finally, he recommended allowing for limits on rights. Such limits are included in the ''Charter''{{'}}s limitation and notwithstanding clauses.<ref>Strayer, Barry L. [https://web.archive.org/web/20031025061505/http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/dept/pub/jc/vol2/no2/page4.html \"My Constitutional Summer of 1967\", ''Reflections on the Charter''], Department of Justice Canada. Retrieved March 18, 2006.</ref> In 1968, Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office and in 1974, he became Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice. During those years, Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trudeau, who had become [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader and prime minister in 1968, still very much wanted a constitutional bill of rights. The federal government and the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] discussed creating one during negotiations for patriation, which resulted in the [[Victoria Charter]] in 1971. This never came to be implemented. However, Trudeau continued with his efforts to patriate the Constitution and promised constitutional change during the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. He would succeed in 1982 with the passage of the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''. This enacted the ''Constitution Act, 1982''.\n\nThe inclusion of a charter of rights in the ''Constitution Act'' was a much-debated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-1092-6040/politics_economy/Patriation/ |title=Charting the Future: Canada's New Constitution &#124; CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> and announced his intention to constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include fundamental freedoms, democratic guarantees, freedom of movement, legal rights, [[social equality|equality]] and language rights.<ref>Weinrib, Lorraine Eisenstat. \"Trudeau and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: A Question of Constitutional Maturation.\" In ''Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau.''

During this time, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for television,<ref name=\"Weinrib, 270\"/> while civil rights experts and [[advocacy group]]s put forward their perceptions on the ''Charter'''s flaws and omissions and how to remedy them.<ref name=\"Weinrib, 270\"/> As Canada had a parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the ''Charter'', as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of [[civil libertarian]]s, judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of ''Charter'' rights in certain circumstances, something the ''Charter'' was not originally going to provide for. As the process continued, more features were added to the ''Charter'', including equality rights for people with disabilities, more sex equality guarantees and recognition of Canada's [[multiculturalism]]. The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on the justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II.<ref>Weinrib, pages 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pierre Elliot Trudeau-2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] was a major advocate of the ''Charter''.]]\nIn its decision in the ''[[Patriation Reference]]'' (1981), the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] had ruled there was a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that some provincial approval should be sought for constitutional reform. As the provinces still had doubts about the ''Charter''{{'}}s merits, Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow governments to opt out of certain obligations. The notwithstanding clause was accepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord, negotiated by the federal Attorney General [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], Ontario's justice minister [[Roy McMurtry]] and Saskatchewan's justice minister [[Roy Romanow]]. Pressure from provincial governments (which in Canada have jurisdiction over property) and from the country's [[left-wing politics|left wing]], especially the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting private property.<ref>David Johansen, \"[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp268-e.htm PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION],\" Library of Parliament (Canada), Law and Government Division, October 1991.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Quebec did not support the ''Charter'' (or the ''Canada Act 1982''), with \"conflicting interpretations\" as to why. The opposition could have owed to the ''[[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' leadership being allegedly uncooperative because it was more committed to gaining sovereignty for Quebec. It could have owed to Quebec leaders being excluded from the negotiation of the [[Kitchen Accord]], which they saw as being too centralist. It could have owed to provincial leaders' objections to the Accord's provisions relating to the process of future constitutional amendment.<ref>[http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpisContent.html&series_id=1&episode_id=17&chapter_id=1&page_id=3&lang=E \"The Night of Long Knives\"], ''Canada: A People's History.''

However, Quebec's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has led to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution (the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]]) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec's political approval of the Canadian constitutional order.\n\nWhile the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982, it was not until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights (section 15) came into effect. The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike potentially unconstitutional inequalities.\n\nThe typography of the physical document pictured here, and still distributed today, was typeset by Ottawa's [[David Berman (graphic designer)|David Berman]] intentionally in Carl Dair's [[Cartier (typeface)|Cartier]] typeface: at the time the most prominent Canadian typeface, having been commissioned by the Governor-General as a celebration of Canada's centenary in 1967.\n\nThe ''Charter'' has been amended since its enactment. Section 25 was amended in 1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding [[Aboriginal land claims]], and section 16.1 was added in 1993.  There have also been a number of [[Unsuccessful attempts to amend the Canadian Constitution|unsuccessful attempts to amend the ''Charter'']], including the failed [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the ''Charter'' to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec's [[distinct society]], and would have added further statements to the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' regarding racial and sexual equality and collective rights, and about [[minority language]] communities. Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups, the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau, then out of office, feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the ''Charter''{{'}}s individual rights. He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments, as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities. Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord.<ref>Behiels, Michael D. \"Who Speaks for Canada? Trudeau and the Constitutional Crisis.\" In ''Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau'', page 346.</ref>\n\n==Interpretation and enforcement==\nThe task of interpreting and enforcing the ''Charter'' falls to the courts, with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter.\n\nWith the ''Charter''{{'}}s supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding federalism. However, under section 24 of the ''Charter'', courts also gained new powers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials. Courts have since made many important decisions, including ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'' (1988), which struck down [[Abortion in Canada|Canada's abortion law]], and ''[[Vriend v. Alberta]]'' (1998), in which the Supreme Court found the province's exclusion of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] from protection against discrimination violated the equality rights under section 15. In the latter case, the Court then read the protection into the law.\n\nCourts may receive Charter questions in a number of ways. Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a [[Criminal law in Canada|criminal law]] that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the ''Charter'', and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the government (as was the case in ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]''). A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting [[reference question]]s to higher-level courts; for example, Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]]'s government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case ''[[Re Same-Sex Marriage]]'' (2004). Provinces may also do this with their superior courts. The government of [[Prince Edward Island]] initiated the ''[[Provincial Judges Reference]]'' by asking its [[PESCAD|provincial Supreme Court]] a question on [[judicial independence]] under section 11.\n\n[[Image:Ottawa - ON - Oberster Gerichtshof von Kanada.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The building of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], the chief authority on the interpretation of the ''Charter'']]\n\nIn several important cases, judges developed various tests and precedents for interpreting specific provisions of the ''Charter''. These include the ''Oakes test'' for section 1, set out in the case ''[[R. v. Oakes]]'' (1986), and the (now defunct<ref>''[[R. v. Kapp]]'', 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 SCR 483</ref>) ''Law test'' for section 15, developed in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'' (1999). Since ''[[Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act]]'' (1985), various approaches to defining and expanding the scope of [[fundamental justice]] (the Canadian name for [[natural justice]] or [[due process]]) under section 7 have been adopted. (''For more information, see the [[:Category:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|articles on each Charter section]]'').\n\nIn general, courts have embraced a ''[[purposive interpretation]]'' of ''Charter'' rights.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\">Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', 2003 Student Ed., pages 722 and 724\u2013725.</ref> This means that since early cases like ''[[Hunter v. Southam]]'' (1984) and ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart]]'' (1985), they have concentrated not on the traditional, limited understanding of what each right meant when the ''Charter'' was adopted in 1982, but rather on changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\"/> This is tied to the ''generous interpretation'' of rights, as the purpose of the ''Charter'' provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances, at the expense of the government powers.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\"/> Constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] has approved of the generous approach in some cases, although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\"/> Indeed, this approach has not been without its critics. Alberta politician [[Ted Morton]] and political scientist [[Rainer Knopff]] have been very critical of this phenomenon. Although they feel the basis for the approach, the [[living tree doctrine]] (the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution), is sound, they argue Charter case law has been more radical. When the living tree doctrine is applied right, the authors claim, \"The elm remained an elm; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow.\" The doctrine can be used, for example, so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology, as long as the essential right remains the same; but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to \"create new rights.\" As an example, the authors note that the ''Charter'' right against [[self-incrimination]] has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self-incrimination rights in other Canadian laws.<ref>Morton, F.L. and Rainer Knopff. ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party.'' Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000, pages 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nAnother general approach to interpreting ''Charter'' rights is to consider international legal precedents with countries that have specific rights protections, such as the [[United States Bill of Rights]] (an influence on aspects of the ''Charter'') and the [[Constitution of South Africa]]. However, international precedent is only of guiding value and is not binding. For example, the Supreme Court has referred to the ''Charter'' and the American Bill of Rights as being \"born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances.\"<ref>Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 732; the case quoted was ''[[R. v. Rahey]]'' (1987) by [[G\u00e9rard La Forest]].</ref>\n\nAdvocacy groups frequently [[intervention (law)|intervene]] in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the ''Charter''. Some examples are the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]], [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]], the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]], the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], the [[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]] (LEAF), and [[REAL Women of Canada]]. The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.\n\nA further approach to the ''Charter'', taken by the courts, is the [[dialogue principle]], which involves greater participation by elected governments. This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged.\n\n==Comparisons with other human rights documents==\n[[Image:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|right|thumb|The [[United States Bill of Rights]] influenced the text of the ''Charter'', but its rights provisions are interpreted more conservatively. Canadian civil-rights and constitutional cases as compared to American cases occasionally have dissimilar outcomes because the broader ''Charter'' rights are limited by the \"savings clause\" of [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1 of the ''Charter'']] as interpreted in ''[[R. v. Oakes]]'']]\nSome Canadian [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of [[Parliamentary supremacy]]. Others would say that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) has now limited British parliamentary power to a greater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures. Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the ''[[Human Rights Act 1998]]'', which allows the [[ECHR]] to be enforced directly in domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter.<ref name=\"saunders\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/features/constitution/ |title=The Charter at 20 |last=Saunders |first=Philip |publisher=CBC News Online |date=April 2002 |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307194214/http://www.cbc.ca/news/features/constitution/ |archivedate= 7 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Charter bears a number of similarities to the European Convention, specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in the European document.<ref name=\"Brice Dickson 1999\">Brice Dickson, \"Human Rights in the 21st Century,\" ''Amnesty International Lecture, Queen's University, Belfast'', 11 November 1999.</ref> Because of this similarity with European human rights law, the Supreme Court of Canada turns not only to the [[Constitution of the United States]] case law in interpreting the ''Charter'', but also to [[European Court of Human Rights]] cases.\n\nThe core distinction between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses. Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively.<ref name=\"Hogg732\">Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada.'' 2003 Student Ed., pages 732\u2013733.</ref> However, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists, the law will not necessarily grant protection of that right.<ref name=\"Hogg732\"/> In contrast, rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights.<ref name=\"Hogg732\"/> Fundamental justice (in section 7 of the Canadian Charter) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process, which is its US equivalent. Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide-ranging scope than the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s freedom of speech.<ref name=\"Hogg732\"/> In ''[[RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.]]'' (1986), the Canadian Supreme Court considered [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit, as it was disruptive conduct (though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect). The Supreme Court, however, ruled the picketing, including the disruptive conduct, were fully protected under section 2 of the ''Charter''. The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just.<ref>Manfredi, Christopher P. \"The Canadian Supreme Court and American Judicial Review: United States Constitutional Jurisprudence and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\" ''The American Journal of Comparative Law'', vol. 40, no. 1. (Winter, 1992), pages 12\u201313.</ref> The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US. The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec's limits on the use of [[English language|English]] on signs and has upheld [[publication ban]]s that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.\n\nSection 28 of the ''Charter'' performs a function similar to that of the unratified [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the US. While that proposed amendment had many critics, there was no comparable opposition to the ''Charter''{{'}}s section 28.<ref>Women's International Network News, \"Women on the Move in Canada.\" Summer 1993, Vol. 19 Issue 3, page 71.</ref> Still, Canadian feminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion of the section which had not been part of the original draft of the charter.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/><ref>Doris Anderson, \"Canadian Women and the Charter of Rights\" (2005) 19 Nat'l J Const L 369.</ref>\n\nThe [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] has several parallels with the Canadian Charter, but in some cases the Covenant goes further with regard to rights in its text. For example, a right to [[legal aid]] has been read into section 10 of the ''Charter'' (the right to counsel), but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused need not pay \"if he does not have sufficient means.\"<ref>Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada.'' 2003 Student Ed., pages 733\u2013734.</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Charter has little to say, explicitly at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]] and with the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to [[security of the person]] and section 15 equality rights to make the ''Charter'' similar to the Covenant.<ref name=\"lugtig\">Lugtig, Sarah and Debra Parkes, \"Where do we go from here?\" ''Herizons'', Spring 2002, Vol. 15 Issue 4, page 14.</ref> The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent [[standard of living]] and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/> Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are [[political question]]s and adding that as [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]], economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/>\n\nThe ''Charter'' itself influenced the [[Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in the Constitution of South Africa.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/> The limitations clause under section 36 of the South African law has been compared to section 1 of that ''Charter''.<ref name=\"Brice Dickson 1999\"/>\n\n[[Jamaica]]'s Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms was also influenced, in part, by the Canadian charter.<ref>http://jis.gov.jm/media/charter-of-rights1.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110417/cleisure/cleisure2.html|title=Rights and responsibilities under the charter|author=|date=|website=jamaica-gleaner.com}}</ref>\n\n==The ''Charter'' and national values==\n[[Image:March of Hearts crowd on Parliament Hill 2004.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The \"March of Hearts\" rally for [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] equality under the ''Charter'' in 2004.]]\nThe ''Charter'' was intended to be a source for [[Canadian values]] and national unity. As Professor [[Alan Cairns]] noted, \"The initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity.\"<ref name=\"saunders\"/> Trudeau himself later wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that \"Canada itself\" could now be defined as a \"society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom\", and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality.<ref>Trudeau, Pierre Elliott. ''Memoirs'', Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1993, pages 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nThe ''Charter''{{'}}'s unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights. According to author [[Rand Dyck]], some scholars believe section 23, with its minority language education rights, \"was the only part of the ''Charter'' with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned\".<ref>Dyck, Rand. ''Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches.'' Third ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000, page 442.</ref> Through the mobility and language rights, [[French Canadian]]s, who have been at the centre of unity debates, are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language. Hence, they are not confined to Quebec (the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based), which would polarize the country along regional lines. The ''Charter'' was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty.<ref name=\"hogg704\">Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 704\u2013705.</ref>\n\nFormer [[premier of Ontario]] [[Bob Rae]] has stated that the ''Charter'' \"functions as a symbol for all Canadians\" in practice because it represents the core value of freedom.<ref name=\"saunders\"/> Academic [[Peter H. Russell|Peter Russell]] has been more skeptical of the ''Charter''{{'}}s value in this field. Cairns, who feels the ''Charter'' is the most important constitutional document to many Canadians, and that the ''Charter'' was meant to shape the Canadian identity, has also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions as belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians.<ref name=\"saunders\"/> It has also been noted that issues like [[abortion]] and [[pornography]], raised by the ''Charter'', tend to be controversial.<ref name=\"hogg704\"/> Still, [[opinion polls]] in 2002 showed Canadians felt the ''Charter'' significantly represented Canada, although many were unaware of the document's actual contents.<ref>Byfield, Joanne. \"The right to be ignorant.\" ''Report/Newsmagazine'' (National Edition); December 16, 2002, Vol. 29, Issue 24, page 56.</ref>\n\nThe only values mentioned by the [[Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter's preamble]] are recognition for the supremacy of [[Constitutional references to God|God]] and the [[rule of law]], but these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence. In 1999, MP [[Svend Robinson]] brought forward a failed proposal before the [[House of Commons of Canada]] that would have amended the ''Charter'' by removing the mention of God, as he felt it did not reflect Canada's diversity.\n\nSection 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism. In 2002, polls found 86% of Canadians approved of this section.<ref>Tracey Tyler, \"Support for Charter runs strong: Survey; Approval highest in Quebec on 20-year-old rights law\", ''Toronto Star'', Apr 12, 2002, p. A07.</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nWhile the ''Charter'' has enjoyed a great deal of popularity, with 82% of Canadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999,<ref name=\"saunders\"/> the document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of the political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor [[Michael Mandel (law professor)|Michael Mandel]], who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy.<ref name=\"Dyck446\">Dyck, page 446, summarizing Mandel, Michael, ''The Charter of Rights and the Legalization of Politics in Canada'' (Toronto: Wall and Thompson, 1989; revised edition, 1994)</ref> Mandel has also asserted that the ''Charter'' makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and [[individual rights]] rather than group rights and social rights.<ref name=\"Dyck446\"/> He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the ''Charter'', such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived [[Americanization]] of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians.<ref name=\"Dyck446\"/> The labour movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the ''Charter'' to support various forms of union activity, such as the \"right to strike\".\n\nConservative critics Morton and Knopff have raised several concerns about the ''Charter'', notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups. In their book ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party'', Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Trudeau and Chr\u00e9tien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the [[Court Challenges Program of Canada|Court Challenges Program]] to support minority language educational rights claims. Morton and Knopff also assert that [[crown attorney|crown counsel]] has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights, particularly [[gay rights]] and [[women's rights]].<ref>Morton and Knopff, 95. They complain about crown counsels on page 117.</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Rand Dyck, in observing these criticisms, notes that while judges have had their scope of review widened, they have still upheld most laws challenged on Charter grounds. With regard to litigious interest groups, Dyck points out that \"the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply. All such groups have experienced wins and losses.\"<ref>Dyck, page 448.</ref>\n\nThe political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]] has criticized the ''Charter'' for contributing to the fragmentation of the country, at both the individual and group levels. In encouraging discourse based upon rights, the ''Charter'' is said to inject an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics, making it difficult to realize the common good. Blattberg also claims that the ''Charter'' undercuts the Canadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document. Finally, he argues that people would be more motivated to uphold individual liberties if they were expressed with terms that are much \"thicker\" (less abstract) than rights.<ref>Blattberg, Charles.

It forms the first part of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]''. The ''Charter'' guarantees certain [[Politics of Canada|political]] rights to Canadian citizens and [[civil rights]] of everyone in [[Canada]] from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the [[Government of Canada|government]]. It is designed to unify [[Canadians]] around a set of principles that embody those rights. The ''Charter'' was signed into law by [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen Elizabeth II of Canada]] on April 17, 1982, along with the rest of the Act.\n\nThe ''Charter'' was preceded by the ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'', which was enacted in 1960. However, the ''Bill of Rights'' is only a federal [[statute]], rather than a constitutional document. As a federal statute, it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process and has no application to provincial laws. The Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the ''Bill of Rights'' and the Court was reluctant to declare laws inoperative.<ref>Only one federal law was declared inoperative by the Supreme Court of Canada: ''[[R.&nbsp;v. Drybones]]'' (1969), [1970] S.C.R. 282. For an example of the narrow interpretation of the Supreme Court of Canada see Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell, [1974] S.C.R. 1349.</ref> The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of Rights motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada. The movement for [[human right]]s and freedoms that emerged after [[World War&nbsp;II]] also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref>Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 689.</ref> The British Parliament formally enacted the ''Charter'' as a part of the'' [[Canada Act 1982]]'' at the request of the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1982, the result of the efforts of the government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]].\n\nOne of the most notable effects of the adoption of the ''Charter'' was to greatly expand the scope of [[judicial review]], because the ''Charter'' is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the ''Bill of Rights''. The [[Court system of Canada|courts]], when confronted with violations of ''Charter'' rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when [[Law of Canada|Canadian case law]] was primarily concerned with resolving issues of [[Canadian federalism|federalism]]. The ''Charter'', however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the [[common law]] and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's parent country the [[United Kingdom]], was based upon [[Parliamentary supremacy]]. As a result, the ''Charter'' has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased [[judicial power]]. The ''Charter'' only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.\n\n==Features==\n{{Canadian Charter}}\nUnder the ''Charter'', people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and political rights. Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person (the ''Charter'' does not define the corporation as a \"legal person\"),<ref>Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 741\u2013742</ref> but a few of the rights belong exclusively to natural persons, or (as in sections 3 and 6) only to [[Canadian nationality law|citizens of Canada]]. The rights are enforceable by the courts through [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 24]] of the ''Charter'', which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the ''Charter'' and might damage the reputation of the justice system. [[Section 32 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 32]] confirms that the ''Charter'' is binding on the federal government, the territories under its authority, and the provincial governments.\nThe rights and freedoms enshrined in 34 sections of the ''Charter'' include:\n\n===Exceptions===\nPrecluding all the freedoms and forming the basis of the ''Charter'', the [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|very first section]], known as ''limitations clause'', allows governments to justify certain infringements of ''Charter'' rights. Every case in which a court discovers a violation of the ''Charter'' would therefore require a section 1 analysis to determine if the law can still be upheld. Infringements are upheld if the purpose for the government action is to achieve what would be recognized as an urgent or important objective in a free society, and if the infringement can be \"demonstrably justified.\" Section 1 has thus been used to uphold laws against objectionable conduct such as [[hate speech]] (e.g., in ''[[R. v. Keegstra]]'') and [[obscenity]] (e.g., in ''[[R. v. Butler]]''). Section 1 also confirms that the rights listed in the ''Charter'' are guaranteed.\n\nIn addition,  some of these rights are also subjected to the ''notwithstanding clause'' ([[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]]). The notwithstanding clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7\u201315 for up to five years, subject to renewal. The Canadian federal government has never invoked it, and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly.<ref>Heather Scoffield, \"Ottawa rules out invoking notwithstanding clause to stop migrant ships,\" Canadian Press, September 13, 2010</ref> In the past, the notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely by the province of [[Quebec]] (which did not support the enactment of the ''Charter'' but is subject to it nonetheless). The provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] have also invoked the notwithstanding clause, to end a [[strike action|strike]] and to protect an exclusively [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|heterosexual definition]] of marriage,<ref>[http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html Marriage Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113082005/http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html |date=2007-01-13 }}, R.S.A. 2000, c.

Many of these rights were also included in the ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'', which the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]] enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the ''Charter'', it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the ''Bill of Rights'' conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative. The ''Bill of Rights'' did not contain all of the rights that are now included in the ''Charter'', omitting, for instance, the [[suffrage|right to vote]]<ref>Hogg, Peter W. Canada Act 1982 Annotated.

Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights, as well as [[patriation]] of the Constitution, meaning the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] would no longer have to approve [[constitutional amendment]]s. Subsequently, [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] appointed law professor [[Barry Strayer]] to research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars, including [[Walter Tarnopolsky]]. Strayer's report advocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the ''Charter'', including protection for language rights. Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights. Finally, he recommended allowing for limits on rights. Such limits are included in the ''Charter''{{'}}s limitation and notwithstanding clauses.<ref>Strayer, Barry L.

During those years, Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trudeau, who had become [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader and prime minister in 1968, still very much wanted a constitutional bill of rights. The federal government and the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] discussed creating one during negotiations for patriation, which resulted in the [[Victoria Charter]] in 1971. This never came to be implemented. However, Trudeau continued with his efforts to patriate the Constitution and promised constitutional change during the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. He would succeed in 1982 with the passage of the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''. This enacted the ''Constitution Act, 1982''.\n\nThe inclusion of a charter of rights in the ''Constitution Act'' was a much-debated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-1092-6040/politics_economy/Patriation/ |title=Charting the Future: Canada's New Constitution &#124; CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> and announced his intention to constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include fundamental freedoms, democratic guarantees, freedom of movement, legal rights, [[social equality|equality]] and language rights.<ref>Weinrib, Lorraine Eisenstat. \"Trudeau and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: A Question of Constitutional Maturation.\" In ''Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau.''

During this time, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for television,<ref name=\"Weinrib, 270\"/> while civil rights experts and [[advocacy group]]s put forward their perceptions on the ''Charter'''s flaws and omissions and how to remedy them.<ref name=\"Weinrib, 270\"/> As Canada had a parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the ''Charter'', as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of [[civil libertarian]]s, judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of ''Charter'' rights in certain circumstances, something the ''Charter'' was not originally going to provide for. As the process continued, more features were added to the ''Charter'', including equality rights for people with disabilities, more sex equality guarantees and recognition of Canada's [[multiculturalism]]. The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on the justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II.<ref>Weinrib, pages 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pierre Elliot Trudeau-2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] was a major advocate of the ''Charter''.]]\nIn its decision in the ''[[Patriation Reference]]'' (1981), the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] had ruled there was a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that some provincial approval should be sought for constitutional reform. As the provinces still had doubts about the ''Charter''{{'}}s merits, Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow governments to opt out of certain obligations. The notwithstanding clause was accepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord, negotiated by the federal Attorney General [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], Ontario's justice minister [[Roy McMurtry]] and Saskatchewan's justice minister [[Roy Romanow]]. Pressure from provincial governments (which in Canada have jurisdiction over property) and from the country's [[left-wing politics|left wing]], especially the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting private property.<ref>David Johansen, \"[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp268-e.htm PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION],\" Library of Parliament (Canada), Law and Government Division, October 1991.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Quebec did not support the ''Charter'' (or the ''Canada Act 1982''), with \"conflicting interpretations\" as to why.

It could have owed to Quebec leaders being excluded from the negotiation of the [[Kitchen Accord]], which they saw as being too centralist.

However, Quebec's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has led to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution (the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]]) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec's political approval of the Canadian constitutional order.\n\nWhile the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982, it was not until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights (section 15) came into effect. The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike potentially unconstitutional inequalities.\n\nThe typography of the physical document pictured here, and still distributed today, was typeset by Ottawa's [[David Berman (graphic designer)|David Berman]] intentionally in Carl Dair's [[Cartier (typeface)|Cartier]] typeface: at the time the most prominent Canadian typeface, having been commissioned by the Governor-General as a celebration of Canada's centenary in 1967.\n\nThe ''Charter'' has been amended since its enactment. Section 25 was amended in 1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding [[Aboriginal land claims]], and section 16.1 was added in 1993.  There have also been a number of [[Unsuccessful attempts to amend the Canadian Constitution|unsuccessful attempts to amend the ''Charter'']], including the failed [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the ''Charter'' to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec's [[distinct society]], and would have added further statements to the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' regarding racial and sexual equality and collective rights, and about [[minority language]] communities. Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups, the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau, then out of office, feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the ''Charter''{{'}}s individual rights. He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments, as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities. Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord.<ref>Behiels, Michael D. \"Who Speaks for Canada? Trudeau and the Constitutional Crisis.\" In ''Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau'', page 346.</ref>\n\n==Interpretation and enforcement==\nThe task of interpreting and enforcing the ''Charter'' falls to the courts, with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter.\n\nWith the ''Charter''{{'}}s supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding federalism. However, under section 24 of the ''Charter'', courts also gained new powers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials. Courts have since made many important decisions, including ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'' (1988), which struck down [[Abortion in Canada|Canada's abortion law]], and ''[[Vriend v. Alberta]]'' (1998), in which the Supreme Court found the province's exclusion of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] from protection against discrimination violated the equality rights under section 15. In the latter case, the Court then read the protection into the law.\n\nCourts may receive Charter questions in a number of ways. Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a [[Criminal law in Canada|criminal law]] that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the ''Charter'', and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the government (as was the case in ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]''). A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting [[reference question]]s to higher-level courts; for example, Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]]'s government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case ''[[Re Same-Sex Marriage]]'' (2004). Provinces may also do this with their superior courts. The government of [[Prince Edward Island]] initiated the ''[[Provincial Judges Reference]]'' by asking its [[PESCAD|provincial Supreme Court]] a question on [[judicial independence]] under section 11.\n\n[[Image:Ottawa - ON - Oberster Gerichtshof von Kanada.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The building of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], the chief authority on the interpretation of the ''Charter'']]\n\nIn several important cases, judges developed various tests and precedents for interpreting specific provisions of the ''Charter''. These include the ''Oakes test'' for section 1, set out in the case ''[[R. v. Oakes]]'' (1986), and the (now defunct<ref>''[[R. v. Kapp]]'', 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 SCR 483</ref>) ''Law test'' for section 15, developed in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'' (1999). Since ''[[Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act]]'' (1985), various approaches to defining and expanding the scope of [[fundamental justice]] (the Canadian name for [[natural justice]] or [[due process]]) under section 7 have been adopted. (''For more information, see the [[:Category:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|articles on each Charter section]]'').\n\nIn general, courts have embraced a ''[[purposive interpretation]]'' of ''Charter'' rights.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\">Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', 2003 Student Ed., pages 722 and 724\u2013725.</ref> This means that since early cases like ''[[Hunter v. Southam]]'' (1984) and ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart]]'' (1985), they have concentrated not on the traditional, limited understanding of what each right meant when the ''Charter'' was adopted in 1982, but rather on changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\"/> This is tied to the ''generous interpretation'' of rights, as the purpose of the ''Charter'' provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances, at the expense of the government powers.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\"/> Constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] has approved of the generous approach in some cases, although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined.<ref name=\"Hogg722-725\"/> Indeed, this approach has not been without its critics. Alberta politician [[Ted Morton]] and political scientist [[Rainer Knopff]] have been very critical of this phenomenon. Although they feel the basis for the approach, the [[living tree doctrine]] (the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution), is sound, they argue Charter case law has been more radical. When the living tree doctrine is applied right, the authors claim, \"The elm remained an elm; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow.\" The doctrine can be used, for example, so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology, as long as the essential right remains the same; but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to \"create new rights.\" As an example, the authors note that the ''Charter'' right against [[self-incrimination]] has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self-incrimination rights in other Canadian laws.<ref>Morton, F.L. and Rainer Knopff. ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party.'' Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000, pages 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nAnother general approach to interpreting ''Charter'' rights is to consider international legal precedents with countries that have specific rights protections, such as the [[United States Bill of Rights]] (an influence on aspects of the ''Charter'') and the [[Constitution of South Africa]]. However, international precedent is only of guiding value and is not binding. For example, the Supreme Court has referred to the ''Charter'' and the American Bill of Rights as being \"born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances.\"<ref>Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 732; the case quoted was ''[[R. v. Rahey]]'' (1987) by [[G\u00e9rard La Forest]].</ref>\n\nAdvocacy groups frequently [[intervention (law)|intervene]] in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the ''Charter''. Some examples are the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]], [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]], the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]], the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], the [[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]] (LEAF), and [[REAL Women of Canada]]. The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.\n\nA further approach to the ''Charter'', taken by the courts, is the [[dialogue principle]], which involves greater participation by elected governments. This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged.\n\n==Comparisons with other human rights documents==\n[[Image:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|right|thumb|The [[United States Bill of Rights]] influenced the text of the ''Charter'', but its rights provisions are interpreted more conservatively. Canadian civil-rights and constitutional cases as compared to American cases occasionally have dissimilar outcomes because the broader ''Charter'' rights are limited by the \"savings clause\" of [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1 of the ''Charter'']] as interpreted in ''[[R. v. Oakes]]'']]\nSome Canadian [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of [[Parliamentary supremacy]]. Others would say that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) has now limited British parliamentary power to a greater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures. Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the ''[[Human Rights Act 1998]]'', which allows the [[ECHR]] to be enforced directly in domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter.<ref name=\"saunders\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/features/constitution/ |title=The Charter at 20 |last=Saunders |first=Philip |publisher=CBC News Online |date=April 2002 |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307194214/http://www.cbc.ca/news/features/constitution/ |archivedate= 7 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Charter bears a number of similarities to the European Convention, specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in the European document.<ref name=\"Brice Dickson 1999\">Brice Dickson, \"Human Rights in the 21st Century,\" ''Amnesty International Lecture, Queen's University, Belfast'', 11 November 1999.</ref> Because of this similarity with European human rights law, the Supreme Court of Canada turns not only to the [[Constitution of the United States]] case law in interpreting the ''Charter'', but also to [[European Court of Human Rights]] cases.\n\nThe core distinction between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses. Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively.<ref name=\"Hogg732\">Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada.'' 2003 Student Ed., pages 732\u2013733.</ref> However, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists, the law will not necessarily grant protection of that right.<ref name=\"Hogg732\"/> In contrast, rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights.<ref name=\"Hogg732\"/> Fundamental justice (in section 7 of the Canadian Charter) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process, which is its US equivalent. Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide-ranging scope than the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s freedom of speech.<ref name=\"Hogg732\"/> In ''[[RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.]]'' (1986), the Canadian Supreme Court considered [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit, as it was disruptive conduct (though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect). The Supreme Court, however, ruled the picketing, including the disruptive conduct, were fully protected under section 2 of the ''Charter''. The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just.<ref>Manfredi, Christopher P. \"The Canadian Supreme Court and American Judicial Review: United States Constitutional Jurisprudence and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\" ''The American Journal of Comparative Law'', vol. 40, no. 1. (Winter, 1992), pages 12\u201313.</ref> The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US. The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec's limits on the use of [[English language|English]] on signs and has upheld [[publication ban]]s that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.\n\nSection 28 of the ''Charter'' performs a function similar to that of the unratified [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the US. While that proposed amendment had many critics, there was no comparable opposition to the ''Charter''{{'}}s section 28.<ref>Women's International Network News, \"Women on the Move in Canada.\" Summer 1993, Vol. 19 Issue 3, page 71.</ref> Still, Canadian feminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion of the section which had not been part of the original draft of the charter.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/><ref>Doris Anderson, \"Canadian Women and the Charter of Rights\" (2005) 19 Nat'l J Const L 369.</ref>\n\nThe [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] has several parallels with the Canadian Charter, but in some cases the Covenant goes further with regard to rights in its text. For example, a right to [[legal aid]] has been read into section 10 of the ''Charter'' (the right to counsel), but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused need not pay \"if he does not have sufficient means.\"<ref>Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada.'' 2003 Student Ed., pages 733\u2013734.</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Charter has little to say, explicitly at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]] and with the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to [[security of the person]] and section 15 equality rights to make the ''Charter'' similar to the Covenant.<ref name=\"lugtig\">Lugtig, Sarah and Debra Parkes, \"Where do we go from here?\" ''Herizons'', Spring 2002, Vol. 15 Issue 4, page 14.</ref> The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent [[standard of living]] and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/> Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are [[political question]]s and adding that as [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]], economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/>\n\nThe ''Charter'' itself influenced the [[Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in the Constitution of South Africa.<ref name=\"lugtig\"/> The limitations clause under section 36 of the South African law has been compared to section 1 of that ''Charter''.<ref name=\"Brice Dickson 1999\"/>\n\n[[Jamaica]]'s Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms was also influenced, in part, by the Canadian charter.<ref>http://jis.gov.jm/media/charter-of-rights1.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110417/cleisure/cleisure2.html|title=Rights and responsibilities under the charter|author=|date=|website=jamaica-gleaner.com}}</ref>\n\n==The ''Charter'' and national values==\n[[Image:March of Hearts crowd on Parliament Hill 2004.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The \"March of Hearts\" rally for [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] equality under the ''Charter'' in 2004.]]\nThe ''Charter'' was intended to be a source for [[Canadian values]] and national unity. As Professor [[Alan Cairns]] noted, \"The initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity.\"<ref name=\"saunders\"/> Trudeau himself later wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that \"Canada itself\" could now be defined as a \"society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom\", and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality.<ref>Trudeau, Pierre Elliott. ''Memoirs'', Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1993, pages 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nThe ''Charter''{{'}}'s unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights. According to author [[Rand Dyck]], some scholars believe section 23, with its minority language education rights, \"was the only part of the ''Charter'' with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned\".<ref>Dyck, Rand. ''Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches.'' Third ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000, page 442.</ref> Through the mobility and language rights, [[French Canadian]]s, who have been at the centre of unity debates, are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language. Hence, they are not confined to Quebec (the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based), which would polarize the country along regional lines. The ''Charter'' was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty.<ref name=\"hogg704\">Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 704\u2013705.</ref>\n\nFormer [[premier of Ontario]] [[Bob Rae]] has stated that the ''Charter'' \"functions as a symbol for all Canadians\" in practice because it represents the core value of freedom.<ref name=\"saunders\"/> Academic [[Peter H. Russell|Peter Russell]] has been more skeptical of the ''Charter''{{'}}s value in this field. Cairns, who feels the ''Charter'' is the most important constitutional document to many Canadians, and that the ''Charter'' was meant to shape the Canadian identity, has also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions as belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians.<ref name=\"saunders\"/> It has also been noted that issues like [[abortion]] and [[pornography]], raised by the ''Charter'', tend to be controversial.<ref name=\"hogg704\"/> Still, [[opinion polls]] in 2002 showed Canadians felt the ''Charter'' significantly represented Canada, although many were unaware of the document's actual contents.<ref>Byfield, Joanne. \"The right to be ignorant.\" ''Report/Newsmagazine'' (National Edition); December 16, 2002, Vol. 29, Issue 24, page 56.</ref>\n\nThe only values mentioned by the [[Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter's preamble]] are recognition for the supremacy of [[Constitutional references to God|God]] and the [[rule of law]], but these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence. In 1999, MP [[Svend Robinson]] brought forward a failed proposal before the [[House of Commons of Canada]] that would have amended the ''Charter'' by removing the mention of God, as he felt it did not reflect Canada's diversity.\n\nSection 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism. In 2002, polls found 86% of Canadians approved of this section.<ref>Tracey Tyler, \"Support for Charter runs strong: Survey; Approval highest in Quebec on 20-year-old rights law\", ''Toronto Star'', Apr 12, 2002, p. A07.</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nWhile the ''Charter'' has enjoyed a great deal of popularity, with 82% of Canadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999,<ref name=\"saunders\"/> the document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of the political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor [[Michael Mandel (law professor)|Michael Mandel]], who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy.<ref name=\"Dyck446\">Dyck, page 446, summarizing Mandel, Michael, ''The Charter of Rights and the Legalization of Politics in Canada'' (Toronto: Wall and Thompson, 1989; revised edition, 1994)</ref> Mandel has also asserted that the ''Charter'' makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and [[individual rights]] rather than group rights and social rights.<ref name=\"Dyck446\"/> He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the ''Charter'', such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived [[Americanization]] of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians.<ref name=\"Dyck446\"/> The labour movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the ''Charter'' to support various forms of union activity, such as the \"right to strike\".\n\nConservative critics Morton and Knopff have raised several concerns about the ''Charter'', notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups. In their book ''The Charter Revolution & the Court Party'', Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Trudeau and Chr\u00e9tien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the [[Court Challenges Program of Canada|Court Challenges Program]] to support minority language educational rights claims. Morton and Knopff also assert that [[crown attorney|crown counsel]] has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights, particularly [[gay rights]] and [[women's rights]].<ref>Morton and Knopff, 95. They complain about crown counsels on page 117.</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Rand Dyck, in observing these criticisms, notes that while judges have had their scope of review widened, they have still upheld most laws challenged on Charter grounds. With regard to litigious interest groups, Dyck points out that \"the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply. All such groups have experienced wins and losses.\"<ref>Dyck, page 448.</ref>\n\nThe political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]] has criticized the ''Charter'' for contributing to the fragmentation of the country, at both the individual and group levels. In encouraging discourse based upon rights, the ''Charter'' is said to inject an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics, making it difficult to realize the common good. Blattberg also claims that the ''Charter'' undercuts the Canadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document. Finally, he argues that people would be more motivated to uphold individual liberties if they were expressed with terms that are much \"thicker\" (less abstract) than rights.<ref>Blattberg, Charles.

Following the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], the decisive point in the [[ethnogenesis]] of the South Slavic ethnic group was the creation of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after World War II, a state in the framework of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. This was followed by the development of a separate Macedonian language and national literature, and the foundation of a distinct [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and national historiography.\n\n===Ancient and Roman period===\nIn antiquity, much of central-northern Macedonia (the [[Vardar river|Vardar basin]]) was inhabited by [[Paionians]] who expanded from the lower Strymon basin.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)... Like Kosovo, Macedonia was slated for Serb settlements and internal colonization. The authorities projected the settlement of 50,000 families in Macedonia, though only 4,200 families had been placed in 280 colonies by 1940.\" For more see: Ivo Banac,  \"The National Question in Yugoslavia.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

The anti-Bulgariansim (or Bulgarophobia) increased almost to the level of state ideology during the ideological monopoly of the League of Communists of Macedonia, and still continues to do so today, although with less ferocity... However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations. Macedonia could confirm itself as a state with its own past, present and future only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. For more see: Mirjana Maleska.

It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw.

The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume.

The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

The suffering during the wars, the endless struggle of the Balkan monarchies for dominance over the population increased the Macedonians' sentiment that the institutionalization of an independent Macedonian nation would put an end to their suffering.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The Balkan communist parties supported the national consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian people and created Macedonian sections within the parties, headed by prominent IMRO (United) members. The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)...

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations.

They have a special reserved seat in the nations parliament. In 2002, they numbered 731.

(See also ''[[Macedonians in Slovenia]]''.)\n\nOther significant ethnic Macedonian communities can also be found in the other Western European countries such as Austria, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the whole European Union. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Also in Uruguay, with a significant population in [[Montevideo]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe culture of the people is characterized with both traditionalist and modernist attributes. It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw. Pantelejmona (02).jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the well-known monasteries \u2013 [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|St. Panteleimon]] in Ohrid.]]\n\nMost Macedonians are members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\". The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries.<ref>Matkovski, Aleksandar, ''Grbovite na Makedonija'', Skopje, 1970.</ref><ref>\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 (1990) \u0413\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u041c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430, Skopje, Macedonia&nbsp;\u2014 {{ISBN|86-15-00160-X}}<br></ref> Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] arose, which modeled itself after the earlier [[Internal Revolutionary Organization|Bulgarian revolutionary traditions]] and adopted their symbols as the [[Bulgarian lion|lion]], etc.<ref>Duncan M.

However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] is somewhat similar.\n* '''''[[Vergina Flag (North Macedonia)|Vergina Sun]]:''''' (official flag, 1992\u20131995) The [[Vergina Sun]] is used unofficially by various  associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

He first reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in January 2013.\n\nHe has won 17 World Tour Singles titles and has won the World Championships in men's doubles 3 times, mixed doubles 2 times, and fives times in the team event. In addition, Xu Xin along with Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the [[Table tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team|men's team]] title at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Playing style and equipment==\n[[File:Xu Xin 2012.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Xu Xin in the men's final of the Qatar Open 2012]]\nXu Xin is a Stiga sponsored athlete. He uses a Stiga Dynasty Carbon as his blade, with DHS TG2 Skyline national version for his forehand and DHS NEO Hurricane 3 custom sponge on his backhand (37degrees hardness). \n\nXu Xin is one of the few penhold grip players in China, especially among the younger generation who are mostly shakehand players. He follows the footsteps of other penhold champions such as [[Wang Hao (table tennis, born 1983)|Wang Hao]] and [[Ma Lin (table tennis)|Ma Lin]].\n\nWith his long arms and frame, he is able to more easily reach balls hit wide. His long arms enable a graceful, unique forehand loop, with his arm almost fully outstretched. He has also adopted the reverse penhold backhand grip (RPB), a recent development for China's penholders, allowing a two-winged attack. He still uses a traditional penhold backhand to lob and push the ball with the forehand side of his racket. More recently, Xu Xin has been more willing to counter with his RPB, allowing him to maintain aggression in the points on his backhand side.\n\nXu Xin's main strength is his shot variation and blazing forehand loops, often stepping very deep into his backhand corner to use his forehand. He sets these shots up with his extremely spinny and deceptive serves, and has some of the best footwork in table tennis. He is also something of a 'crowd entertainer\u2019, often coming up with wild, and sometimes inappropriate, shots. He has been dubbed the 'show man' in recent years. This is perhaps due to his playful nature and confidence in playing. He admitted that he hopes to try to be more efficient and effective with his shot selection as he matures and carries more responsibilities. More recently, Xu Xin has been called \"XUperman\", referring to his many \"superman-like\" moments. These names have been widely popularized by the use of Adam Bobrow, an ITTF commentator.\n\n==Career==\n===2013===\nIn January 2013, he reached the No. 1 spot in the World Rankings thanks to the points obtained by winning the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2012.\n\n===2014===\nIn January 2014, Xu Xin defended his title by beating world No. 1 ranked [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the finals match of the 2013 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals held in Dubai.\n\n===2016===\nIn 2016, Xu Xin defeated world No. 1 ranked and current World Champion Ma Long 4\u20132 in the semi-finals match of the 2016 Japan Open, but then was beaten by world No. 2 ranked [[Fan Zhendong]] in the finals. One week later after the Japan Open, Xu Xin won his third Korea Open title after beating [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] again 4\u20133 in the finals.<ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44790&Competition_ID=2663&</ref><ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44896&Competition_ID=2664&</ref>\n\nHowever, he was deemed not good enough to be entered into the singles tournament of the [[Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n===2017===\nIn late 2017, he had a disappointing German Open, where in doubles Xu and his partner Fan Zhendong were knocked out in the Round of 16, and lost in the Quarterfinals to Lee Sangsu 4\u20130 in the singles event. In the Swedish Open, he won the doubles event with Fan Zhendong, before defeating Fan, the world No. 2, 4\u20131 one hour later in the Men's Singles event. At the [[2017 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], Xu Xin was seeded 5th and lost to 3rd seed Fan Zhendong in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2018===\nXu Xin started his 2018 year by participating with teammates [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Lin Gaoyuan]] and [[Yu Ziyang]] in the [[2018 ITTF Team World Cup \u2013 Men's team|2018 ITTF Team World Cup]], beating Japan in the final. During the tournament, Xu only dropped one set.\n\nXu Xin entered one of the six platinum events of the tour, the [[2018 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open,]] seeking an unprecedented fourth title. He almost suffered a defeat to Zhou Yu winning 4\u20133, but he was beaten by Fan Zhendong in the semi-finals 4\u20131. The following day, Xu Xin along with Fan Zhendong beat Jun Mizutani and Yuya Oshima to claim the men's doubles title. One week later at the [[2018 German Open (table tennis)|German Open]], Xu was seeded third but lost to fifth seeded Ma Long in the final. Xu Xin partnered Ma Long to claim his second doubles title of the year defeating [[Lee Sang-su]] and [[Jeoung Young-sik|Jeong Young-sik]] in the final.\n\nThe next month, Xu Xin was a part of the winning team China at the [[2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships]] in his tenth appearance at the World Championships. Xu earned the final point for team China during the final, beating [[Patrick Franziska]] 3\u20131 for China to claim the title with a 3\u20130 win over Germany.\n\nAt the China Open, Xu Xin was looking for his first World Tour title of the year. However, his ambitions were stopped in his home country by Lim Jong-hoon in the Round of 32. At the next World Tour platinum event, the [[2018 Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin was seeded 3rd but lost in the Round of 16 to [[Jang Woo-jin]].\n\nLooking to redeem himself, Xu Xin claimed the title at the [[2018 Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]] beating qualifier [[Liu Dingshuo]] in the final, Xu Xin's first World Tour title of the year. Right after that, Xu Xin claimed another title at the [[2018 Bulgaria Open (table tennis)|Bulgaria Open]] beating Japan's [[Kenta Matsudaira]] in the final. Xu Xin claimed his third men's doubles titles with Ma Long at the Bulgarian Open, their second title as a pair in 2018.\n\nBecause of his lack of participation in the [[Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament|Asian Cup]] earlier that year, Xu Xin did not participate in the [[2018 ITTF Men's World Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2018 Swedish Open (table tennis)|Swedish Open]], Xu Xin was looking to defend his title, but lost to top seed Fan Zhendong in the final. Two days later at the [[2018 Austrian Open (table tennis)|Austrian Open]], Xu Xin lost in the final to qualifier Liang Jingkun 4\u20133 after Liang Jingkun had stunningly beat Fan Zhendong 4\u20132 in the semi-finals. Xu also claimed his first mixed doubles title ever at the Austrian Open, winning with Liu Shiwen over [[Cheng I-ching|Cheng-I-Ching]] and [[Chen Chien-an]] in the final.\n\nDue to Xu's appearance in five finals and claiming two of the titles, Xu Xin was seeded first in the [[2018 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], followed closely by Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Liang Jingkun. Xu Xin lost to compatriot Lin Gaoyuan in the quarter-finals, 4-2. \n\n=== 2019 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nXu Xin started off the year at the [[2019 Hungarian Open (table tennis)|2019 Hungarian Open]] where he reached the semi-finals. Xu Xin lost to the eventual champion [[Lin Gaoyuan]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open]], Xu Xin faced off against his old rival [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the semi-final stage. Ma Long had just returned from injury and was making his first appearance on the ITTF World Tour since many months before. In a highly anticipated match, Xu Xin eventually lost to eventual champion Ma Long, where he beat Lin Gaoyuan in the finals. \n\nHeading in as the number 2 seed at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]], Xu Xin was looking to prove himself during this competition. He participated in the men's singles and mixed doubles with [[Liu Shiwen]]. After the draw was made, Xu Xin was the only Chinese player in the bottom half of the draw. Because of the seedings, #1 [[Fan Zhendong]], #3 [[Lin Gaoyuan]], #9 [[Liang Jingkun]], and #11 [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] were all drawn in the top half of the draw. Much pressure was placed on Xu to help achieve an all Chinese final, but was also a large opportunity for Xu Xin to perform well at a World Championships. Xu Xin won his first round 4-1 against Jan Zibrat and his second round 4-0 over Austria's Stefan Fegerl. However, Xu's road to the final was stopped by Frenchman [[Simon Gauzy]] 4-2. Gauzy outperformed Xu and Gauzy is even said to have \"outspinned the spin master\". Xu's shocking defeat meant that for the first time in over 15 years, there would not be an all Chinese final. The last time this happened was at the [[2003 World Table Tennis Championships|2003 World Championships]], where Austria's [[Werner Schlager]] faced off against [[Joo Sae-hyuk|Joo Saehyuk]] in the men's final. In the mixed doubles event, Xu did not falter, where Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen claimed victory 4-1 over [[Kasumi Ishikawa]] and [[Maharu Yoshimura]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Japan Open (table tennis)|2019 Japan Open]], Xu Xin became the second person in history to achieve a coveted \"triple crown\", the first being Jang Woojin at the 2018 Korea Open. Xu Xin claimed the champion in singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. In the men's singles final, Xu Xin defeated [[Lin Yun-ju]], \"the silent assassin\", in a highly anticipated final. Xu Xin claimed doubles titles with Fan Zhendong and [[Zhu Yuling]].\n\nXu Xin's performance at the Japan Open was enough to place him again at number one in the world, a position that he last held in early 2015. He replaced Fan Zhendong from the position, who had previously held the spot for over a year. Fan Zhendong dropped to #3 in the world rankings.\n\nThe following week at the [[Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin once again claimed the singles title in the final, defeating his good-friend Ma Long in the final. Coming into the final, Xu Xin had lost his six previous encounters against Ma Long on the international stage, and Ma was heavily regarded as the favorite to win. After an amazing match, Xu Xin said that \"Winning the title is not the reason I am feeling so happy. It\u2019s because I beat Ma Long\", paying homage to Ma Long's dominance over the past years. Xu Xin again won the men's doubles title with Fan Zhendong, but in the mixed doubles Xu Xin and [[Liu Shiwen]] were defeated by [[Wong Chun Ting]] and [[Doo Hoi Kem]] at the final stage. This marked the first ever loss for the pairing of Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen, recent mixed doubles world champions at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships \u2013 Mixed Doubles|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]].\n\nThe next week at the [[Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]], Xu Xin claimed three men's singles championships in a row on the [[ITTF World Tour]], and became the first person to successfully defend a men's singles title at the Australian Open. Xu Xin beat his colleague [[Wang Chuqin]] in the final 4-0; Wang Chuqin had defeated Ma Long at the semi-final stage.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, the first of the T2 Events were played in Malaysia. In this tournament, Xu Xin showed signs of slowness and tiredness, proposed to be due to the many weeks of play on the world tour. Xu Xin made it to the semi-finals, where he lost to Fan Zhendong 4-0 in a rematch of their semi-final match at the Japan Open earlier this year, where Xu won 4-3.\n\nMany of the Chinese players have vocalized their dislike of many ITTF events being played one after the other, with no real breaks in between. After the final in Australia, Xu Xin responded \"too tired\". Ma Long and other Chinese players also said the same, but it is said that competitions must be played in order to maintain higher world rankings for the Chinese players, all in preparation for Tokyo 2020. \n\nAt the [[Chinese National Championships (table tennis)|2019 Chinese National Championships]], Xu Xin and four of his other prominent colleagues, [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Liu Shiwen]], and [[Ding Ning]] all pulled out of the competition. Their reasoning was for them to rest up after they had just played several events back to back on the ITTF World Tour.\n\nXu Xin ended the year as the World No. 1.\n\nDue to his outstanding performances and showman-like qualities, Xu Xin gained the nickname of \"XUperman\", holding true to his superhuman play. This nickname is one of Xu Xin's many, the others being the Showman and the Cloudwalker, all descriptive of his playing style.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open Xu Xin 05.jpg|thumb|235px|ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open|alt=]]\n\n===ITTF Major tournament performance timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n| style=\"background:lime;\" |W\n| style=\"background:thistle;\" |F\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |#R\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |RR\n|A\n|NH\n|}\n<small>(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semi-finalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (A) Absent; (NH) Not Held; (S) Singles Tournament; (D) Doubles Tournament; (XD) Mixed Doubles Tournament; (T) Team Tournament.</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align::center; font-size: small;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tournament\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Cup\n|S\n|A\n|A\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n|A\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n|A\n|-\n|T\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |World Championships\n|S\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|3R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n|-\n|T\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n|D\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|-\n|XD\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\"|QF\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Tour Grand Finals\n|S\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n|-\n|D\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Olympic Games\n|S\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|-\n|T\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|}\nSenior career highlights, as of April 2018:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.ittf.link/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158|title=ITTF Player Matches / Tomokazu Harimoto|website=ITTF|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Singles<ref name=\"ITTF statistics\">[http://ittfstats.alfaweb.gr/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158 ITTF Statistics.] International Table Tennis Federation.</ref>\n*[[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championships]]: SF (2013, 2017).\n*[[Table Tennis World Cup|World Cup]] appearances: 3.

by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] (ITTF), as of March 2020. He first reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in January 2013.\n\nHe has won 17 World Tour Singles titles and has won the World Championships in men's doubles 3 times, mixed doubles 2 times, and fives times in the team event. In addition, Xu Xin along with Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the [[Table tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team|men's team]] title at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Playing style and equipment==\n[[File:Xu Xin 2012.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Xu Xin in the men's final of the Qatar Open 2012]]\nXu Xin is a Stiga sponsored athlete. He uses a Stiga Dynasty Carbon as his blade, with DHS TG2 Skyline national version for his forehand and DHS NEO Hurricane 3 custom sponge on his backhand (37degrees hardness). \n\nXu Xin is one of the few penhold grip players in China, especially among the younger generation who are mostly shakehand players. He follows the footsteps of other penhold champions such as [[Wang Hao (table tennis, born 1983)|Wang Hao]] and [[Ma Lin (table tennis)|Ma Lin]].\n\nWith his long arms and frame, he is able to more easily reach balls hit wide. His long arms enable a graceful, unique forehand loop, with his arm almost fully outstretched. He has also adopted the reverse penhold backhand grip (RPB), a recent development for China's penholders, allowing a two-winged attack. He still uses a traditional penhold backhand to lob and push the ball with the forehand side of his racket. More recently, Xu Xin has been more willing to counter with his RPB, allowing him to maintain aggression in the points on his backhand side.\n\nXu Xin's main strength is his shot variation and blazing forehand loops, often stepping very deep into his backhand corner to use his forehand. He sets these shots up with his extremely spinny and deceptive serves, and has some of the best footwork in table tennis. He is also something of a 'crowd entertainer\u2019, often coming up with wild, and sometimes inappropriate, shots. He has been dubbed the 'show man' in recent years. This is perhaps due to his playful nature and confidence in playing. He admitted that he hopes to try to be more efficient and effective with his shot selection as he matures and carries more responsibilities. More recently, Xu Xin has been called \"XUperman\", referring to his many \"superman-like\" moments. These names have been widely popularized by the use of Adam Bobrow, an ITTF commentator.\n\n==Career==\n===2013===\nIn January 2013, he reached the No. 1 spot in the World Rankings thanks to the points obtained by winning the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2012.\n\n===2014===\nIn January 2014, Xu Xin defended his title by beating world No. 1 ranked [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the finals match of the 2013 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals held in Dubai.\n\n===2016===\nIn 2016, Xu Xin defeated world No. 1 ranked and current World Champion Ma Long 4\u20132 in the semi-finals match of the 2016 Japan Open, but then was beaten by world No. 2 ranked [[Fan Zhendong]] in the finals. One week later after the Japan Open, Xu Xin won his third Korea Open title after beating [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] again 4\u20133 in the finals.<ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44790&Competition_ID=2663&</ref><ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44896&Competition_ID=2664&</ref>\n\nHowever, he was deemed not good enough to be entered into the singles tournament of the [[Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n===2017===\nIn late 2017, he had a disappointing German Open, where in doubles Xu and his partner Fan Zhendong were knocked out in the Round of 16, and lost in the Quarterfinals to Lee Sangsu 4\u20130 in the singles event. In the Swedish Open, he won the doubles event with Fan Zhendong, before defeating Fan, the world No. 2, 4\u20131 one hour later in the Men's Singles event. At the [[2017 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], Xu Xin was seeded 5th and lost to 3rd seed Fan Zhendong in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2018===\nXu Xin started his 2018 year by participating with teammates [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Lin Gaoyuan]] and [[Yu Ziyang]] in the [[2018 ITTF Team World Cup \u2013 Men's team|2018 ITTF Team World Cup]], beating Japan in the final. During the tournament, Xu only dropped one set.\n\nXu Xin entered one of the six platinum events of the tour, the [[2018 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open,]] seeking an unprecedented fourth title. He almost suffered a defeat to Zhou Yu winning 4\u20133, but he was beaten by Fan Zhendong in the semi-finals 4\u20131. The following day, Xu Xin along with Fan Zhendong beat Jun Mizutani and Yuya Oshima to claim the men's doubles title. One week later at the [[2018 German Open (table tennis)|German Open]], Xu was seeded third but lost to fifth seeded Ma Long in the final. Xu Xin partnered Ma Long to claim his second doubles title of the year defeating [[Lee Sang-su]] and [[Jeoung Young-sik|Jeong Young-sik]] in the final.\n\nThe next month, Xu Xin was a part of the winning team China at the [[2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships]] in his tenth appearance at the World Championships. Xu earned the final point for team China during the final, beating [[Patrick Franziska]] 3\u20131 for China to claim the title with a 3\u20130 win over Germany.\n\nAt the China Open, Xu Xin was looking for his first World Tour title of the year. However, his ambitions were stopped in his home country by Lim Jong-hoon in the Round of 32. At the next World Tour platinum event, the [[2018 Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin was seeded 3rd but lost in the Round of 16 to [[Jang Woo-jin]].\n\nLooking to redeem himself, Xu Xin claimed the title at the [[2018 Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]] beating qualifier [[Liu Dingshuo]] in the final, Xu Xin's first World Tour title of the year. Right after that, Xu Xin claimed another title at the [[2018 Bulgaria Open (table tennis)|Bulgaria Open]] beating Japan's [[Kenta Matsudaira]] in the final. Xu Xin claimed his third men's doubles titles with Ma Long at the Bulgarian Open, their second title as a pair in 2018.\n\nBecause of his lack of participation in the [[Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament|Asian Cup]] earlier that year, Xu Xin did not participate in the [[2018 ITTF Men's World Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2018 Swedish Open (table tennis)|Swedish Open]], Xu Xin was looking to defend his title, but lost to top seed Fan Zhendong in the final. Two days later at the [[2018 Austrian Open (table tennis)|Austrian Open]], Xu Xin lost in the final to qualifier Liang Jingkun 4\u20133 after Liang Jingkun had stunningly beat Fan Zhendong 4\u20132 in the semi-finals. Xu also claimed his first mixed doubles title ever at the Austrian Open, winning with Liu Shiwen over [[Cheng I-ching|Cheng-I-Ching]] and [[Chen Chien-an]] in the final.\n\nDue to Xu's appearance in five finals and claiming two of the titles, Xu Xin was seeded first in the [[2018 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], followed closely by Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Liang Jingkun. Xu Xin lost to compatriot Lin Gaoyuan in the quarter-finals, 4-2. \n\n=== 2019 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nXu Xin started off the year at the [[2019 Hungarian Open (table tennis)|2019 Hungarian Open]] where he reached the semi-finals. Xu Xin lost to the eventual champion [[Lin Gaoyuan]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open]], Xu Xin faced off against his old rival [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the semi-final stage. Ma Long had just returned from injury and was making his first appearance on the ITTF World Tour since many months before. In a highly anticipated match, Xu Xin eventually lost to eventual champion Ma Long, where he beat Lin Gaoyuan in the finals. \n\nHeading in as the number 2 seed at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]], Xu Xin was looking to prove himself during this competition. He participated in the men's singles and mixed doubles with [[Liu Shiwen]]. After the draw was made, Xu Xin was the only Chinese player in the bottom half of the draw. Because of the seedings, #1 [[Fan Zhendong]], #3 [[Lin Gaoyuan]], #9 [[Liang Jingkun]], and #11 [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] were all drawn in the top half of the draw. Much pressure was placed on Xu to help achieve an all Chinese final, but was also a large opportunity for Xu Xin to perform well at a World Championships. Xu Xin won his first round 4-1 against Jan Zibrat and his second round 4-0 over Austria's Stefan Fegerl. However, Xu's road to the final was stopped by Frenchman [[Simon Gauzy]] 4-2. Gauzy outperformed Xu and Gauzy is even said to have \"outspinned the spin master\". Xu's shocking defeat meant that for the first time in over 15 years, there would not be an all Chinese final. The last time this happened was at the [[2003 World Table Tennis Championships|2003 World Championships]], where Austria's [[Werner Schlager]] faced off against [[Joo Sae-hyuk|Joo Saehyuk]] in the men's final. In the mixed doubles event, Xu did not falter, where Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen claimed victory 4-1 over [[Kasumi Ishikawa]] and [[Maharu Yoshimura]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Japan Open (table tennis)|2019 Japan Open]], Xu Xin became the second person in history to achieve a coveted \"triple crown\", the first being Jang Woojin at the 2018 Korea Open. Xu Xin claimed the champion in singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. In the men's singles final, Xu Xin defeated [[Lin Yun-ju]], \"the silent assassin\", in a highly anticipated final. Xu Xin claimed doubles titles with Fan Zhendong and [[Zhu Yuling]].\n\nXu Xin's performance at the Japan Open was enough to place him again at number one in the world, a position that he last held in early 2015. He replaced Fan Zhendong from the position, who had previously held the spot for over a year. Fan Zhendong dropped to #3 in the world rankings.\n\nThe following week at the [[Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin once again claimed the singles title in the final, defeating his good-friend Ma Long in the final. Coming into the final, Xu Xin had lost his six previous encounters against Ma Long on the international stage, and Ma was heavily regarded as the favorite to win. After an amazing match, Xu Xin said that \"Winning the title is not the reason I am feeling so happy. It\u2019s because I beat Ma Long\", paying homage to Ma Long's dominance over the past years. Xu Xin again won the men's doubles title with Fan Zhendong, but in the mixed doubles Xu Xin and [[Liu Shiwen]] were defeated by [[Wong Chun Ting]] and [[Doo Hoi Kem]] at the final stage. This marked the first ever loss for the pairing of Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen, recent mixed doubles world champions at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships \u2013 Mixed Doubles|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]].\n\nThe next week at the [[Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]], Xu Xin claimed three men's singles championships in a row on the [[ITTF World Tour]], and became the first person to successfully defend a men's singles title at the Australian Open. Xu Xin beat his colleague [[Wang Chuqin]] in the final 4-0; Wang Chuqin had defeated Ma Long at the semi-final stage.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, the first of the T2 Events were played in Malaysia. In this tournament, Xu Xin showed signs of slowness and tiredness, proposed to be due to the many weeks of play on the world tour. Xu Xin made it to the semi-finals, where he lost to Fan Zhendong 4-0 in a rematch of their semi-final match at the Japan Open earlier this year, where Xu won 4-3.\n\nMany of the Chinese players have vocalized their dislike of many ITTF events being played one after the other, with no real breaks in between. After the final in Australia, Xu Xin responded \"too tired\". Ma Long and other Chinese players also said the same, but it is said that competitions must be played in order to maintain higher world rankings for the Chinese players, all in preparation for Tokyo 2020. \n\nAt the [[Chinese National Championships (table tennis)|2019 Chinese National Championships]], Xu Xin and four of his other prominent colleagues, [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Liu Shiwen]], and [[Ding Ning]] all pulled out of the competition. Their reasoning was for them to rest up after they had just played several events back to back on the ITTF World Tour.\n\nXu Xin ended the year as the World No. 1.\n\nDue to his outstanding performances and showman-like qualities, Xu Xin gained the nickname of \"XUperman\", holding true to his superhuman play. This nickname is one of Xu Xin's many, the others being the Showman and the Cloudwalker, all descriptive of his playing style.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open Xu Xin 05.jpg|thumb|235px|ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open|alt=]]\n\n===ITTF Major tournament performance timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n| style=\"background:lime;\" |W\n| style=\"background:thistle;\" |F\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |#R\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |RR\n|A\n|NH\n|}\n<small>(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semi-finalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (A) Absent; (NH) Not Held; (S) Singles Tournament; (D) Doubles Tournament; (XD) Mixed Doubles Tournament; (T) Team Tournament.</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align::center; font-size: small;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tournament\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Cup\n|S\n|A\n|A\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n|A\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n|A\n|-\n|T\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |World Championships\n|S\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|3R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n|-\n|T\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n|D\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|-\n|XD\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\"|QF\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Tour Grand Finals\n|S\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n|-\n|D\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Olympic Games\n|S\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|-\n|T\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|}\nSenior career highlights, as of April 2018:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.ittf.link/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158|title=ITTF Player Matches / Tomokazu Harimoto|website=ITTF|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Singles<ref name=\"ITTF statistics\">[http://ittfstats.alfaweb.gr/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158 ITTF Statistics.] International Table Tennis Federation.</ref>\n*[[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championships]]: SF (2013, 2017).\n*[[Table Tennis World Cup|World Cup]] appearances: 3.

('''MLSE''') is a [[professional sports]] and [[commercial real estate]] company based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including [[BMO Field]], home of Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts; [[Coca-Cola Coliseum]], home of the Marlies; [[Ford Performance Centre]], the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies; [[BMO Training Ground]] practice facility for Toronto FC and home of Toronto FC II and the [[TFC Academy]]; and [[Lamport Stadium]], practice facility for the Argonauts.\n\nMLSE was founded by [[Conn Smythe]] in 1931 as '''Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL)''' to act as a [[holding company]] for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], from which the company got its name. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena. While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of [[professional ice hockey|minor]] and [[junior hockey]] clubs including the [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], the company later branched out to own the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the CFL from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998. The company launched Toronto FC in 2007. Most recently, the company completed its purchase of the Argonauts in January 2018.<ref name=ArgosApprove>{{citeweb|url=https://www.argonauts.ca/2018/01/19/mlse-acquisition-toronto-argonauts-approved-cfl-board-governors/|title=MLSE ACQUISITION OF TORONTO ARGONAUTS APPROVED BY CFL BOARD OF GOVERNORS|date=January 19, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2018|publisher=[[Toronto Argonauts]]}}</ref>\n\nOver most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a [[public company]]. Following the death of majority owner [[Harold Ballard]] in 1990, [[Steve Stavro]] led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it [[Privately held company|private]]. In 2012, the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] sold their 79.53% share of the company for {{CAD|1.32}} billion to a joint venture between [[Rogers Communications]] and [[BCE Inc.]], two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of {{CAD|1.66}} billion and an enterprise value of {{CAD|2}} billion.\n\n==Corporate history==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Maple Leafs}}\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens' roof under construction, 1931 (public domain).png|thumb|left|300px|Maple Leaf Gardens roof under construction, pictured in 1931]]\nThe corporation's roots can be traced back to 1927, when [[Conn Smythe]] organized a group of investors to purchase Toronto's premier hockey franchise, the [[Toronto St. Patricks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), which had won [[Stanley Cup]] championships in [[1917\u201318 NHL season|1918]] (as the [[Toronto Arenas]]) and [[1921\u201322 NHL season|1922]], from a group headed by [[Charles Querrie]]. The club was playing poorly and minority partner [[Jack Bickell]] contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team.  However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team. Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]] over ownership of the franchise, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them to [[C. C.

MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with [[Frank J. Selke]]. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder Percy Gardiner, and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner<ref name=powerplay>{{cite news|title=Gardens power plays|date=April 3, 1995|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> and installed himself as president on November 19, 1947, replacing Edward Bickle.<ref>{{cite news |title=Baseball's bankroll gone |last=Dunnell|first=Milt|authorlink=Milt Dunnell|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 5, 1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |year=1997 |title=Champions: The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties. |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=1-57243-213-6 |page=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Smythe is elected Gardens' president|date=November 20, 1947|newspaper=[[Toronto Daily Star]]}}</ref>  The loan was paid off in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |title=Centre Ice: The Smythe Family, the Gardens, and the Toronto Maple Leafs Hockey Club |last1=Smythe |first1=Thomas Stafford |last2=Shea |first2=Kevin Shea |publisher=Fenn Publishing Co. |year=2000 |location=Bolton, Ontario, Canada |isbn=1-55168-250-8 |ref=harv|pages=156\u2013167}}</ref>  In November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by his son [[Stafford Smythe]], [[Harold Ballard]], and John Bassett (owner of the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' and part-owner of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts) for $2.3 million.

He had hoped that Stafford would keep MLGL for his son, Tommy.<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|217\u2013218}} However, it is unlikely that Stafford could have raised the millions needed for the deal on his own. Stafford became president of MLGL and governor of the Maple Leafs, with Ballard becoming executive vice president and Bassett chairman of the board.<ref name=powerplay/>\n\n===Harold Ballard, John Bassett, and Stafford Smythe===\nIn March 1966, Conn sold his remaining MLGL shares and resigned from the board of directors after a [[Muhammad Ali]] boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to be offensive,<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|232}} and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had \"put cash ahead of class.\"<ref>{{cite news |title='Cash rated over class' Conn quits |author=McKee, Ken |work=Toronto Star |date=March 8, 1966}}</ref>  Within three years under the new owners, profits had tripled to just under $1 million.

Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board of directors that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. On June 26, 1969, following an 8\u20137 vote of the board, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board.  This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them.  They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970, and Stafford was once again appointed president.<ref name=powerplay/>  Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 MLGL shares he controlled to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argonauts.<ref name=death/><ref name=bassettsells>{{cite news|title=Bassett sells Gardens stock, buys control of Argos|first=Dick|last=Beddoes|authorlink=Dick Beddoes|date=September 2, 1971|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref name=shakeup/> Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock.<ref name=bassettsells/><ref name=shakeup/>  Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at only 50 years of age, just before his trial was scheduled to begin.<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=death/><ref name=repeats/> Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an [[executor]],<ref name=repeats>{{cite news|title=History repeats itself&nbsp;... almost|date=March 22, 1999|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|newspaper=[[National Post]]}}</ref> each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death.

('''MLSE''') is a [[professional sports]] and [[commercial real estate]] company based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. With assets that include franchises in four of the six [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]], it is the largest sports and entertainment company in Canada, and one of the largest in [[North America]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/rogers-bell-buy-control-of-mlse-1.997655|title=Rogers, Bell buy control of MLSE|date=2011-12-09|accessdate=2020-04-04|publisher=[[CBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe primary holdings of the company are its major sports franchises, the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]], [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], and [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], as well as their minor league [[farm team]]s, the [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), [[Raptors 905]] of the [[NBA G League]] and [[Toronto FC II]] of the [[USL League One]], respectively.\n\nIn addition, it owns [[Scotiabank Arena]] (originally named Air Canada Centre), the home arena of the Maple Leafs and Raptors, and the [[OVO Athletic Centre]] (originally named BioSteel Centre), the practice facility for the Raptors. MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including [[BMO Field]], home of Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts; [[Coca-Cola Coliseum]], home of the Marlies; [[Ford Performance Centre]], the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies; [[BMO Training Ground]] practice facility for Toronto FC and home of Toronto FC II and the [[TFC Academy]]; and [[Lamport Stadium]], practice facility for the Argonauts.\n\nMLSE was founded by [[Conn Smythe]] in 1931 as '''Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL)''' to act as a [[holding company]] for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], from which the company got its name. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena. While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of [[professional ice hockey|minor]] and [[junior hockey]] clubs including the [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], the company later branched out to own the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the CFL from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998. The company launched Toronto FC in 2007. Most recently, the company completed its purchase of the Argonauts in January 2018.<ref name=ArgosApprove>{{citeweb|url=https://www.argonauts.ca/2018/01/19/mlse-acquisition-toronto-argonauts-approved-cfl-board-governors/|title=MLSE ACQUISITION OF TORONTO ARGONAUTS APPROVED BY CFL BOARD OF GOVERNORS|date=January 19, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2018|publisher=[[Toronto Argonauts]]}}</ref>\n\nOver most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a [[public company]]. Following the death of majority owner [[Harold Ballard]] in 1990, [[Steve Stavro]] led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it [[Privately held company|private]]. In 2012, the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] sold their 79.53% share of the company for {{CAD|1.32}} billion to a joint venture between [[Rogers Communications]] and [[BCE Inc.]], two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of {{CAD|1.66}} billion and an enterprise value of {{CAD|2}} billion.\n\n==Corporate history==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Maple Leafs}}\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens' roof under construction, 1931 (public domain).png|thumb|left|300px|Maple Leaf Gardens roof under construction, pictured in 1931]]\nThe corporation's roots can be traced back to 1927, when [[Conn Smythe]] organized a group of investors to purchase Toronto's premier hockey franchise, the [[Toronto St. Patricks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), which had won [[Stanley Cup]] championships in [[1917\u201318 NHL season|1918]] (as the [[Toronto Arenas]]) and [[1921\u201322 NHL season|1922]], from a group headed by [[Charles Querrie]]. The club was playing poorly and minority partner [[Jack Bickell]] contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team.  However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team. Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]] over ownership of the franchise, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them to [[C. C.

MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with [[Frank J. Selke]]. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder Percy Gardiner, and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner<ref name=powerplay>{{cite news|title=Gardens power plays|date=April 3, 1995|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> and installed himself as president on November 19, 1947, replacing Edward Bickle.<ref>{{cite news |title=Baseball's bankroll gone |last=Dunnell|first=Milt|authorlink=Milt Dunnell|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 5, 1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |year=1997 |title=Champions: The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties. |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=1-57243-213-6 |page=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Smythe is elected Gardens' president|date=November 20, 1947|newspaper=[[Toronto Daily Star]]}}</ref>  The loan was paid off in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |title=Centre Ice: The Smythe Family, the Gardens, and the Toronto Maple Leafs Hockey Club |last1=Smythe |first1=Thomas Stafford |last2=Shea |first2=Kevin Shea |publisher=Fenn Publishing Co. |year=2000 |location=Bolton, Ontario, Canada |isbn=1-55168-250-8 |ref=harv|pages=156\u2013167}}</ref>  In November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by his son [[Stafford Smythe]], [[Harold Ballard]], and John Bassett (owner of the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' and part-owner of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts) for $2.3 million.

Stafford became president of MLGL and governor of the Maple Leafs, with Ballard becoming executive vice president and Bassett chairman of the board.<ref name=powerplay/>\n\n===Harold Ballard, John Bassett, and Stafford Smythe===\nIn March 1966, Conn sold his remaining MLGL shares and resigned from the board of directors after a [[Muhammad Ali]] boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to be offensive,<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|232}} and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had \"put cash ahead of class.\"<ref>{{cite news |title='Cash rated over class' Conn quits |author=McKee, Ken |work=Toronto Star |date=March 8, 1966}}</ref>  Within three years under the new owners, profits had tripled to just under $1 million.

Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board of directors that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. On June 26, 1969, following an 8\u20137 vote of the board, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board.  This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them.  They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970, and Stafford was once again appointed president.<ref name=powerplay/>  Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 MLGL shares he controlled to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argonauts.<ref name=death/><ref name=bassettsells>{{cite news|title=Bassett sells Gardens stock, buys control of Argos|first=Dick|last=Beddoes|authorlink=Dick Beddoes|date=September 2, 1971|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref name=shakeup/> Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock.<ref name=bassettsells/><ref name=shakeup/>  Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at only 50 years of age, just before his trial was scheduled to begin.<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=death/><ref name=repeats/> Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an [[executor]],<ref name=repeats>{{cite news|title=History repeats itself&nbsp;... almost|date=March 22, 1999|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|newspaper=[[National Post]]}}</ref> each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death.
