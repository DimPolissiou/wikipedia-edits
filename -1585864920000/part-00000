Passengers using the stairs or escalator are welcomed by a couple of [[Chinese guardian lions|lion statues]], called \"foo dogs,\" meant to protect against evil spirits at the entrance. The bins on the platform are painted in red and green, the Chinese color for prosperity and longevity, with Welcome written in Chinese on the next one.\n\nLike the other eight stations of the Dan Ryan Branch, Cermak\u2013Chinatown was built by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], looking identical to {{cta|95th/Dan Ryan}}. Customers outside the station can also see Chinese character masks of Chinese opera and theater productions on the walls. Cermak\u2013Chinatown is open 24/7 as part of the service on the [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]].

Passengers using the stairs or escalator are welcomed by a couple of [[Chinese guardian lions|lion statues]], called \"foo dogs,\" meant to protect against evil spirits at the entrance. The bins on the platform are painted in red and green, the Chinese color for prosperity and longevity, with Welcome written in Chinese on the next one.\n\nLike the other eight stations of the Dan Ryan Branch, Cermak\u2013Chinatown was built by [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], looking identical to {{cta|95th/Dan Ryan}}.

He is also a noted songwriter, pianist, arranger and producer.\n\n==Early life and early career==\nHatch was born in [[Pinner]], Middlesex. Encouraged by his musical abilities, his mother&nbsp;\u2013 also a pianist&nbsp;\u2013 enrolled him in the London Choir School in Wansunt Road, [[Bexley]], Kent when he was 10. Instead of continuing at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], he left school in 1955 and found a job with Robert Mellin Music in London's [[Tin Pan Alley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.org/news/tony-hatch-variety-international-past-president-and-his-induction-into-the-songwriters-hall-of-fame/|title=Tony Hatch, Variety International Past President and his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=13 June 2015|accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nNot long after working as a tea boy, he was writing songs (under the name \"Mark Anthony\") and making a name for himself within the recording industry, joining [[The Rank Organisation]]'s new subsidiary [[Top Rank Records]]; there he worked for future [[Decca Records]] [[A&R]] man [[Dick Rowe]]. While he served his [[National Service]], he became involved with the [[Band of the Coldstream Guards]].\n\nOn his return in 1959, Hatch began producing Top Rank artists such as [[Bert Weedon]], the then unknown [[Adam Faith]] (\"Ah, Poor Little Baby\"), [[Josh MacRae]] (together with MacRae's early recordings with Scottish folk trio ''The Reivers''), [[Jackie Dennis]], [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry On'']] comedy actor [[Kenneth Connor]], and The Knightsbridge Strings, and started his own recording career with a cover version of [[Russ Conway]]'s piano instrumental \"[[Side Saddle]]\".  Though he used his real name Tony Hatch as a performer and producer, through about 1964 virtually all his compositions were credited to \"Mark Anthony\".\n\nIn 1960, [[Garry Mills]]'s (trumpeter [[Nat Gonella]]'s nephew) recording of the \"Mark Anthony\" composition \"[[Look for a Star (song)|Look for a Star]]\", featured in the film ''[[Circus of Horrors]]'', became a Top Ten hit in the UK for Top Rank. Four versions of the song charted simultaneously in the United States, including Mills' original and a version by '[[Garry Miles]]' (a recording alias of future member of [[The Crickets]], [[Buzz Cason]]). Top Rank, despite some worldwide success with artists such as [[Jack Scott (singer)|Jack Scott]] and [[The Fireballs]], ultimately failed because of an unusual distribution arrangement with EMI.\n\nA swift succession of events ensued through 1961 that Top Rank was sold to EMI, briefly operated as a subsidiary, with hits by [[John Leyton]], and shuttered, with its artists transferred to other EMI labels. Hatch moved on to a part-time job with [[Pye Records]], where he assisted his new mentor, [[Alan A. Freeman]], with the recording of \"Sailor\", a number 1 hit for [[Petula Clark]].\n\nAs \"Mark Anthony\", Hatch continued to write songs for Pye artists, including the popular \"Messing About on the River\" for [[Josh MacRae]]. In 1963, [[Philadelphia]] teen idol [[Bobby Rydell]] hit the charts with \"[[Forget Him (Bobby Rydell song)|Forget Him]]\" written and produced by Hatch (still writing as \"Mark Anthony\"); Hatch went on to produce, arrange and write for other American stars such as [[Chubby Checker]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Big Dee Irwin]] and [[Keely Smith]].

He is also a noted songwriter, pianist, arranger and producer.\n\n==Early life and early career==\nHatch was born in [[Pinner]], Middlesex. Encouraged by his musical abilities, his mother&nbsp;\u2013 also a pianist&nbsp;\u2013 enrolled him in the London Choir School in Wansunt Road, [[Bexley]], Kent when he was 10. Instead of continuing at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], he left school in 1955 and found a job with Robert Mellin Music in London's [[Tin Pan Alley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.org/news/tony-hatch-variety-international-past-president-and-his-induction-into-the-songwriters-hall-of-fame/|title=Tony Hatch, Variety International Past President and his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=13 June 2015|accessdate=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nNot long after working as a tea boy, he was writing songs (under the name \"Mark Anthony\") and making a name for himself within the recording industry, joining [[The Rank Organisation]]'s new subsidiary [[Top Rank Records]]; there he worked for future [[Decca Records]] [[A&R]] man [[Dick Rowe]]. While he served his [[National Service]], he became involved with the [[Band of the Coldstream Guards]].\n\nOn his return in 1959, Hatch began producing Top Rank artists such as [[Bert Weedon]], the then unknown [[Adam Faith]] (\"Ah, Poor Little Baby\"), [[Josh MacRae]] (together with MacRae's early recordings with Scottish folk trio ''The Reivers''), [[Jackie Dennis]], [[Carry On (film series)|''Carry On'']] comedy actor [[Kenneth Connor]], and The Knightsbridge Strings, and started his own recording career with a cover version of [[Russ Conway]]'s piano instrumental \"[[Side Saddle]]\".  Though he used his real name Tony Hatch as a performer and producer, through about 1964 virtually all his compositions were credited to \"Mark Anthony\".\n\nIn 1960, [[Garry Mills]]'s (trumpeter [[Nat Gonella]]'s nephew) recording of the \"Mark Anthony\" composition \"[[Look for a Star (song)|Look for a Star]]\", featured in the film ''[[Circus of Horrors]]'', became a Top Ten hit in the UK for Top Rank. Four versions of the song charted simultaneously in the United States, including Mills' original and a version by '[[Garry Miles]]' (a recording alias of future member of [[The Crickets]], [[Buzz Cason]]). Top Rank, despite some worldwide success with artists such as [[Jack Scott (singer)|Jack Scott]] and [[The Fireballs]], ultimately failed because of an unusual distribution arrangement with EMI.\n\nA swift succession of events ensued through 1961 that Top Rank was sold to EMI, briefly operated as a subsidiary, with hits by [[John Leyton]], and shuttered, with its artists transferred to other EMI labels. Hatch moved on to a part-time job with [[Pye Records]], where he assisted his new mentor, [[Alan A. Freeman]], with the recording of \"Sailor\", a number 1 hit for [[Petula Clark]].\n\nAs \"Mark Anthony\", Hatch continued to write songs for Pye artists, including the popular \"Messing About on the River\" for [[Josh MacRae]]. In 1963, [[Philadelphia]] teen idol [[Bobby Rydell]] hit the charts with \"[[Forget Him (Bobby Rydell song)|Forget Him]]\" written and produced by Hatch (still writing as \"Mark Anthony\"); Hatch went on to produce, arrange and write for other American stars such as [[Chubby Checker]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Big Dee Irwin]] and [[Keely Smith]]. In 1964 he wrote (under the pseudonym of 'Fred Nightingale') the [[The Searchers (band)|Searchers]]' hit \"[[Sugar and Spice (The Searchers song)|Sugar and Spice]]\".

In 1337 it appeared as ''Keethkapul'', in 1347 as ''Egyh\u00e1zaskapoly'', in 1400 as ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1skapoly''. It belonged to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Diocese of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] in 1229, but according to a papal bull also the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Tihany]] had lands there. Kapoly was mentioned also in the papal [[tithe]] register between 1332 and 1337. In 1400 the lands of Kapoly were donated by [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] to ''B\u00e1lint'' and ''P\u00e9ter Osztop\u00e1ni''. ''Imre Ugron'' was its landlord in 1460. ''Orb\u00e1n Nagylucsei'' [[Bishop of Eger]], his brothers and ''Bern\u00e1t Somogyi de Endr\u00e9d'' got the lands of ''Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00e1lv\u00e1nyosi'' in ''Egyh\u00e1zas'' and ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1s'' in 1488. Between 1488 and 1489 ''Jakab Bocskai'' also had lands there. The son of ''P\u00e1l Perneszi'', ''Imre'' got ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1s-Kapoly'' from [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]]. ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1s-Kapoly'' was in the hands of ''M\u00e1t\u00e9 Baronyay'', ''L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ewleweldy (\u00d3leveldi)'', the widow of ''Istv\u00e1n Perneszi'', ''Imre'' and ''Egyed Perneszi'' meanwhile ''Egyh\u00e1zas-Kapoly'' belonged to ''Bern\u00e1t'' and ''P\u00e1l Ugron'', ''Imre Perneszi'', the [[Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m]], ''Mih\u00e1ly Kys'' and ''M\u00e1t\u00e9 Baronyay''. According to the tax register of 1557 both Kapolys were possessions of the [[Perneszy family]]. ''Andr\u00e1s Perneszy de Osztop\u00e1n'', castellan of [[Grad, Grad|Fels\u0151lendva]] got the village in 1577 from [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].

Around 1598 and 1599 they were a possession of the ''Castle of [[Tihany]]'' under the name ''Nagykapoly''. According to the 1609 Urbarium ''Nagykapoly'' had 10 peasant residents. The Court of [[Zala County (former)|Zala County]] awarded ''J\u00e1nos Lengyel T\u00f3ti'' the villages of ''Nagykapoly'', [[Lulla|Lullya]], [[Balatonendr\u00e9d|Endr\u00e9d]] in 1612. It was a possession of [[Tihany Abbey]] in 1645. Then in 1660 it belonged to the [[Perneszy family]]. ''J\u00e1nos Perneszi'' gave his lands in ''Kis-Kapoly'' to ''J\u00e1nos Szab\u00f3'' in 1665. ''Zsigmond Perneszi'' and ''Julianna Perneszi'' owned ''Kapoly'' in 1695. In the 1715 register there were 6 households and belonged to ''Anna Julianna Perneszi'', the widow of ''Ferenc Bab\u00f3csay''. One half of the settlement was in the hands of the [[Perneszy family]] the other half in the hands of the [[Tihany Abbey]] in 1733.\n\nBetween 1720 and 1727 the first wave of German settlers arrived in Kapoly.

In 1337 it appeared as ''Keethkapul'', in 1347 as ''Egyh\u00e1zaskapoly'', in 1400 as ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1skapoly''. It belonged to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Diocese of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] in 1229, but according to a papal bull also the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Tihany]] had lands there. Kapoly was mentioned also in the papal [[tithe]] register between 1332 and 1337. In 1400 the lands of Kapoly were donated by [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] to ''B\u00e1lint'' and ''P\u00e9ter Osztop\u00e1ni''. ''Imre Ugron'' was its landlord in 1460. ''Orb\u00e1n Nagylucsei'' [[Bishop of Eger]], his brothers and ''Bern\u00e1t Somogyi de Endr\u00e9d'' got the lands of ''Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00e1lv\u00e1nyosi'' in ''Egyh\u00e1zas'' and ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1s'' in 1488. Between 1488 and 1489 ''Jakab Bocskai'' also had lands there. The son of ''P\u00e1l Perneszi'', ''Imre'' got ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1s-Kapoly'' from [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]]. ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1s-Kapoly'' was in the hands of ''M\u00e1t\u00e9 Baronyay'', ''L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ewleweldy (\u00d3leveldi)'', the widow of ''Istv\u00e1n Perneszi'', ''Imre'' and ''Egyed Perneszi'' meanwhile ''Egyh\u00e1zas-Kapoly'' belonged to ''Bern\u00e1t'' and ''P\u00e1l Ugron'', ''Imre Perneszi'', the [[Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m]], ''Mih\u00e1ly Kys'' and ''M\u00e1t\u00e9 Baronyay''. According to the tax register of 1557 both Kapolys were possessions of the [[Perneszy family]]. ''Andr\u00e1s Perneszy de Osztop\u00e1n'', castellan of [[Grad, Grad|Fels\u0151lendva]] got the village in 1577 from [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]]. In 1583 ''K\u00e1poln\u00e1s-Kapoly'' was owned by ''Andr\u00e1s Perneszi'', ''Egyh\u00e1zas-Kapoly'' by the [[Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m]]. Around 1598 and 1599 they were a possession of the ''Castle of [[Tihany]]'' under the name ''Nagykapoly''. According to the 1609 Urbarium ''Nagykapoly'' had 10 peasant residents. The Court of [[Zala County (former)|Zala County]] awarded ''J\u00e1nos Lengyel T\u00f3ti'' the villages of ''Nagykapoly'', [[Lulla|Lullya]], [[Balatonendr\u00e9d|Endr\u00e9d]] in 1612. It was a possession of [[Tihany Abbey]] in 1645. Then in 1660 it belonged to the [[Perneszy family]]. ''J\u00e1nos Perneszi'' gave his lands in ''Kis-Kapoly'' to ''J\u00e1nos Szab\u00f3'' in 1665. ''Zsigmond Perneszi'' and ''Julianna Perneszi'' owned ''Kapoly'' in 1695. In the 1715 register there were 6 households and belonged to ''Anna Julianna Perneszi'', the widow of ''Ferenc Bab\u00f3csay''. One half of the settlement was in the hands of the [[Perneszy family]] the other half in the hands of the [[Tihany Abbey]] in 1733.\n\nBetween 1720 and 1727 the first wave of German settlers arrived in Kapoly. There were also some Slovak families. But the village preserved its Hungarian dominance throughout the next centuries.<ref>[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/SOMM_SomAlm_052/ L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szita : Somogy megyei nemzetis\u00e9gek telep\u00fcl\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9nete a XVIII-XIX. sz\u00e1zadban - Somogyi Almanach 52.
