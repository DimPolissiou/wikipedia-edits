It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe climate zones in Hesse are quite similar to some annual temperature differences. At the moment, Hesse's climate is made up by [[Temperate climate|temperate oceanic climates]] (''Cfb''), [[Subtropical highland climate|subtropical highland climates]] (''Cwb'') and some few [[Tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest climates]] (''Af''). Especially in the Southern part, there can be even found some [[seasonal tropical forest]]. \n\n{{Climate chart\n| [[Kreis Offenbach]]\n|11.0|22.0|48.9\n|10.0|21.0|50.1\n|9.0|20.0|52.5\n|9.0|20.0|56.4\n|11.0|22.0|66.1\n|15.0|26.0|71.4\n|18.0|29.0|72.7\n|21.0|32.0|64.5\n|17.0|28.0|62.7\n|15.0|26.0|61.9\n|13.0|24.0|61.0\n|12.0|23.0|49.9\n|maxprecip = 72.7\n|float     = both\n|clear     = both\n|units     = SI\n}}\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.

Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

HR provides a statewide TV channel as well as a range of regional radio stations (HR&nbsp;1, HR&nbsp;2, HR&nbsp;3, HR&nbsp;4, you&nbsp;fm and HR&nbsp;info). Besides the state run HR, privately run TV stations exist and are an important line of commerce. Among the commercial radio stations that are active in Hesse, Hit Radio FFH, Planet Radio, Harmony FM, Radio BOB and Antenne Frankfurt are the most popular.\n\n== Economy ==\nWith Hesse's largest city [[Frankfurt am Main]] being home of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bundesbank|German Bundesbank]] and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], Hesse is home to the financial capital of mainland Europe. Furthermore, Hesse has always been one of the largest and healthiest economies in Germany. Its [[GDP]] in 2013 exceeded \u20ac236&nbsp;billion (about US$316&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|title=Bruttoinlandsprodukt|publisher=Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt|year=2012|work=Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnungen|accessdate=27 March 2013|language=de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120914010546/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2012}}</ref> This makes Hesse itself one of the largest economies in Europe and the 38th largest in the world.<ref>See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)]].</ref> According to GDP-per-capita figures, Hesse is the wealthiest state (after the [[city-state]]s [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]) in Germany with approx. US$52,500.\n\nThe [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]] has the second largest industrial density in Germany after the [[Ruhr area]]. The main economic fields of importance are the [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries with [[Sanofi]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], [[Heraeus]], [[Messer Griesheim]] and [[Degussa]]. In the mechanical and automotive engineering field [[Opel]] in R\u00fcsselsheim is worth mentioning. Frankfurt is crucial as a [[financial center]], with both the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]'s headquarters located there. Numerous smaller banks and [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW|KfW Bank]], [[Commerzbank]] are also headquartered in Frankfurt, with the offices of several international banks also being housed there. Frankfurt is also the location of the most important German stock exchange, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. [[Insurance]] companies have settled mostly in [[Wiesbaden]]. The city's largest private employer is the [[R+V Versicherung]], with about 3,900 employees, other major employers are [[Winterthur Group|DBV-Winterthur]], the [[SV SparkassenVersicherung]] and the [[Delta Lloyd Group]]. The leather industry is predominantly settled in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]].

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''.

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe climate zones in Hesse are quite similar to some annual temperature differences. Especially in the Southern part, there can be even found some [[seasonal tropical forest]] climates. \n\n{{Climate chart\n| [[Kreis Offenbach]]\n|11.0|22.0|48.9\n|10.0|21.0|50.1\n|9.0|20.0|52.5\n|9.0|20.0|56.4\n|11.0|22.0|66.1\n|15.0|26.0|71.4\n|18.0|29.0|72.7\n|21.0|32.0|64.5\n|17.0|28.0|62.7\n|15.0|26.0|61.9\n|13.0|24.0|61.0\n|12.0|23.0|49.9\n|maxprecip = 72.7\n|float     = both\n|clear     = both\n|units     = SI\n}}\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area. The administrative regions have no legislature of their own, but are executive agencies of the state government.\n\n[[File:Map of Hesse with districts (with numbers).svg|frameless|upright=1.45]]\n[[File:0472-0490R-Hessische Staatskanzlei.jpg|thumb|The state chancellery building in the capital city of [[Wiesbaden]]]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Schlosspark Wilhelmsh\u00f6he 001.jpg|thumb|[[Kassel]]]]\n[[File:Luisenplatz.jpg|thumb|[[Darmstadt]]]]\n[[File:Offenbach am main from drone.jpg|thumb|[[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach am Main]]]]\nHesse is divided into 21 districts (Kreise) and five independent cities, each with their own local governments.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

HR is a member of the federal [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcasting association. HR provides a statewide TV channel as well as a range of regional radio stations (HR&nbsp;1, HR&nbsp;2, HR&nbsp;3, HR&nbsp;4, you&nbsp;fm and HR&nbsp;info). Besides the state run HR, privately run TV stations exist and are an important line of commerce. Among the commercial radio stations that are active in Hesse, Hit Radio FFH, Planet Radio, Harmony FM, Radio BOB and Antenne Frankfurt are the most popular.\n\n== Economy ==\nWith Hesse's largest city [[Frankfurt am Main]] being home of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bundesbank|German Bundesbank]] and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], Hesse is home to the financial capital of mainland Europe. Furthermore, Hesse has always been one of the largest and healthiest economies in Germany. Its [[GDP]] in 2013 exceeded \u20ac236&nbsp;billion (about US$316&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|title=Bruttoinlandsprodukt|publisher=Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt|year=2012|work=Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnungen|accessdate=27 March 2013|language=de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120914010546/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2012}}</ref> This makes Hesse itself one of the largest economies in Europe and the 38th largest in the world.<ref>See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)]].</ref> According to GDP-per-capita figures, Hesse is the wealthiest state (after the [[city-state]]s [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]) in Germany with approx. US$52,500.\n\nThe [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]] has the second largest industrial density in Germany after the [[Ruhr area]]. The main economic fields of importance are the [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries with [[Sanofi]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], [[Heraeus]], [[Messer Griesheim]] and [[Degussa]]. In the mechanical and automotive engineering field [[Opel]] in R\u00fcsselsheim is worth mentioning. Frankfurt is crucial as a [[financial center]], with both the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]'s headquarters located there. Numerous smaller banks and [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW|KfW Bank]], [[Commerzbank]] are also headquartered in Frankfurt, with the offices of several international banks also being housed there. Frankfurt is also the location of the most important German stock exchange, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. [[Insurance]] companies have settled mostly in [[Wiesbaden]]. The city's largest private employer is the [[R+V Versicherung]], with about 3,900 employees, other major employers are [[Winterthur Group|DBV-Winterthur]], the [[SV SparkassenVersicherung]] and the [[Delta Lloyd Group]]. The leather industry is predominantly settled in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]].

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

There have been several types os reserach locally, ranging from the predominant study of the Geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the Geochemical, Climatic, and ecosistemic reserach to set the different changes that have been documented along the Formation. Paleogeography, Paleontology, Palynology, Tectonics, and several other knids of works have been done along the Formation.

There have been several types os reserach locally, ranging from the predominant study of the Geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the Geochemical, Climatic, and ecosistemic reserach to set the different changes that have been documented along the Formation. Paleogeography, Paleontology, Palynology, Tectonics, and several other knids of works have been done along the Formation. The Most Studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on Late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

It turned out that from 2000 to 2008 Thorning-Schmidt had made use of tax deductions applicable to her husband, even though he was not subject to Danish taxes and had no income in Denmark. The mistake was corrected by SKAT for the three years from 2006 to 2008, and Thorning-Schmidt paid the amount she had saved due to the error. She was however not required to pay the amounts saved for the six years from 2000 to 2005, because of the statutory time limit for liability in such cases.<ref>[http://www.bt.dk/politik/thorning-fik-uberettiget-fradrag-i-seks-aar/ Thorning fik uberettiget fradrag i seks \u00e5r], [[B.T.

This would be unlawful under Danish law as the Tax Ministry may not interfere with the decisions taken in individual tax cases.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1447272/ministers-hoejre-haand-skrev-afsnit-i-thorning-sag/ Ministers h\u00f8jre h\u00e5nd skrev afsnit i Thorning-sag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112125917/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1447272/ministers-hoejre-haand-skrev-afsnit-i-thorning-sag/ |date=12 November 2011 }}, [[Politiken]] 11 November 2011</ref> This set off a flurry of speculation in the press, as to whether there had been any political pressure from the then government to pursue a stricter course in the tax case. The Tax Minister in the new government, Thor M\u00f6ger Pedersen, subsequently asked Peter Loft and the director of the revenue service's Copenhagen branch, Erling Andersen, to give a report on the happenings. On 2 December, Pedersen disclosed that he had found such big discrepancies in the two reports that he would set up a commission of inquiry to determine the actual course of events.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2011/12/02/093947.htm/ Kommission skal kulegrave skattesag], [[Danmarks Radio|DR]] 2 December 2011</ref>\n\nFurther controversy erupted when two days later the tabloid daily, ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'', reported that they had also been offered the confidential information that was made public during the election campaign.

This would constitute a hitherto unseen level of abuse of power in Danish political life. The commission of inquiry that had already been announced two days previously, was broadly supported by the Danish Parliament to also look into whether the former government was involved in, or knew of, the leak.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1470465/undersoegelseskommissionen-ventes-klar-hurtigt/ Unders\u00f8gelseskommissionen ventes klar hurtigt] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120716235207/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1470465/undersoegelseskommissionen-ventes-klar-hurtigt/ |date=16 July 2012 }}, [[Politiken]] 5 December 2011</ref> On the same day, Troels Lund Poulsen announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Danish Parliament.

Kinnock had declared that he was not a resident of Denmark and thus not subject to Danish taxes, while at the same time Thorning-Schmidt had declared, in an application for dispensation for Kinnock to own property in Denmark, that he resided in Denmark \"every weekend of the year from Friday through to Monday\".<ref name=BBC>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10856352 Danish politics rocked over Kinnock tax status], BBC News 3 August 2010</ref>  Thorning-Schmidt attributed the discrepancy to a \"big and sloppy error\".<ref name=BBC/> On 16 September 2010, Danish tax authorities acquitted the couple and the charges of tax evasion were dropped.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120728142430/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1061397/revisor-skat-frikender-thorning-i-skattesag/ Revisor: Skat frikender Thorning i skattesag], [[Politiken]] 16 September 2010 {{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\nA week before the 15 September 2011 elections to the Danish Parliament, the 2010 decision from SKAT (the taxation department) surfaced in the Danish tabloid ''[[B.T. (tabloid)|B.T.]]'' The case had been leaked to the newspaper several months previously. It turned out that from 2000 to 2008 Thorning-Schmidt had made use of tax deductions applicable to her husband, even though he was not subject to Danish taxes and had no income in Denmark. The mistake was corrected by SKAT for the three years from 2006 to 2008, and Thorning-Schmidt paid the amount she had saved due to the error. She was however not required to pay the amounts saved for the six years from 2000 to 2005, because of the statutory time limit for liability in such cases.<ref>[http://www.bt.dk/politik/thorning-fik-uberettiget-fradrag-i-seks-aar/ Thorning fik uberettiget fradrag i seks \u00e5r], [[B.T.

This would be unlawful under Danish law as the Tax Ministry may not interfere with the decisions taken in individual tax cases.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1447272/ministers-hoejre-haand-skrev-afsnit-i-thorning-sag/ Ministers h\u00f8jre h\u00e5nd skrev afsnit i Thorning-sag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112125917/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1447272/ministers-hoejre-haand-skrev-afsnit-i-thorning-sag/ |date=12 November 2011 }}, [[Politiken]] 11 November 2011</ref> This set off a flurry of speculation in the press, as to whether there had been any political pressure from the then government to pursue a stricter course in the tax case. The Tax Minister in the new government, Thor M\u00f6ger Pedersen, subsequently asked Peter Loft and the director of the revenue service's Copenhagen branch, Erling Andersen, to give a report on the happenings. On 2 December, Pedersen disclosed that he had found such big discrepancies in the two reports that he would set up a commission of inquiry to determine the actual course of events.<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2011/12/02/093947.htm/ Kommission skal kulegrave skattesag], [[Danmarks Radio|DR]] 2 December 2011</ref>\n\nFurther controversy erupted when two days later the tabloid daily, ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'', reported that they had also been offered the confidential information that was made public during the election campaign. The source of the leak was determined to be Peter Arnfeldt, spin doctor for then Minister for Taxation [[Troels Lund Poulsen]].<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1469714/avis-troels-lunds-spindoktor-ville-laekke-thornings-skattepapirer/ Avis: Troels Lunds spindoktor ville l\u00e6kke Thornings skattepapirer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204171731/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1469714/avis-troels-lunds-spindoktor-ville-laekke-thornings-skattepapirer/ |date=4 February 2012 }}, [[Politiken]] 4 December 2011 {{in lang|da}}</ref> This led to intense media speculation that the former government, and specifically Troels Lund Poulsen, were engaged in leaking confidential tax information and trying to pressure the revenue service into changing its decision in the case, in an active attempt to discredit the opposition leader in the then imminent election. This would constitute a hitherto unseen level of abuse of power in Danish political life. The commission of inquiry that had already been announced two days previously, was broadly supported by the Danish Parliament to also look into whether the former government was involved in, or knew of, the leak.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1470465/undersoegelseskommissionen-ventes-klar-hurtigt/ Unders\u00f8gelseskommissionen ventes klar hurtigt] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120716235207/http://politiken.dk/politik/ECE1470465/undersoegelseskommissionen-ventes-klar-hurtigt/ |date=16 July 2012 }}, [[Politiken]] 5 December 2011</ref> On the same day, Troels Lund Poulsen announced he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from the Danish Parliament.

First admirals were mentioned in 14th century as commanders of the royal fleet of Croatian-Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942\u201391). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]]. [[Croats of Boka Kotorska|Historical Croat community in Boka Kotorska]] has produced a long line of admirals (Russian Grand admiral [[Matija Zmajevi\u0107]], Austrian vice-admiral [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Bujacovich,_Alexander_Freiherr Aleksandar Bujakovi\u0107] (1792-1870) etc.), but these are excluded from this list.\n\n==Admiral flote==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horisontal\n| image1   = Zastava admirala flote OS RH.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>1991\u2013</small></center>\n| width1     = 70\n| image2   = SFR Yugoslavia Fleet Admiral.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>1956-91?\u2013</small></center>\n| width2     = 70\n| header    = <center>Rank Flag</center>\n| footer    = <center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''Admiral Flote'''</span></center>\n| footer_background = #007\n}}\n\nIn Yugoslav Navy, [[Branko Mamula]] was promoted to the rank of the Admiral of the Fleet in 1983.

First admirals were mentioned in 14th century as commanders of the royal fleet of Croatian-Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941-45), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942-91). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]]. [[Croats of Boka Kotorska|Historical Croat community in Boka Kotorska]] has produced a long line of admirals (Russian Grand admiral [[Matija Zmajevi\u0107]], austrian vice-admiral [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Bujacovich,_Alexander_Freiherr Aleksandar Bujakovi\u0107] (1792-1870) etc.), but these are excluded from this list. \n\n==Admiral flote==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horisontal\n| image1   = Zastava admirala flote OS RH.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>1991\u2013</small></center>\n| width1     = 70\n| image2   = SFR Yugoslavia Fleet Admiral.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>1956-91?\u2013</small></center>\n| width2     = 70\n| header    = <center>Rank Flag</center>\n| footer    = <center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''Admiral Flote'''</span></center>\n| footer_background = #007\n}}\n\nIn Yugoslav Navy, [[Branko Mamula]] was promoted to the rank of the Admiral of the Fleet in 1983. In [[Croatian Navy]], rank of Fleet Admiral was introduced in 1995 as the naval equivalent to the [[five-star rank]] of the  [[OF-10]]. Commending him on his role as the commander of Croatian Navy during the [[Croatian War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1991-5), president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man|Tu\u0111man]] conferred the rank on admiral Letica. ''[[Sveto Letica|Sveto Letica-Barba]]'' was the first and so far the only Croatian [[flag officer]] to hold this rank. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Large cam pulleys. +3cc PG6B pistons, non-pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC it appeared in JDM AV Integra Si and JDM E-AT Civic/CR-X Si. Commonly produced at the time but now over twenty years old and getting harder to find. D-series version is called D16A1, 1986-1987.\n\n2nd Gen ZC (rarest) \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB mounted on slight angle forward, bolts on top of cam cover, black cam cover, large cam pulleys. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC appeared in JDM facelift AV bodied Integra Si did not appear in Civic or CR-X, rarest ZC only produced for less than one year. D-series version D16A1 '88-'89 (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n3rd Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB. Black cam cover. Cam cover bolts on the sides. Small cam pulleys. Inlet Manifold stamped PM7. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a \"ZC\" this appeared in the JDM EF3 Civic and EF7 CR-X, and also in the JDM Honda Quint Integra GSi (DA1 chassis). This is the most commonly produced ZC, manufactured in Japan from end of '87 through to early '91 D-series version D16A8/9 (Euro Civic Si) (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n4th Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil. OBD1 EFi system (grey plug). No cam angle sensor on exhaust cam, now located in distributor. Rubber plug where cam angle sensor would mount. Black cam cover. No PGM-EFi plate on the inlet manifold, replaced with three ribs instead. P29 stamped on inlet manifold. MAP sensor on TB. +7cc PM7 pistons, pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC only appeared in EG5 Civic bodies, no Integra or CRX received this engine. Reasonably common produced from '92 to '94.

The non-VTEC SOHC ZC is similar to the D16A6 ('91\u2013'96) and D16Y4 ('96\u20132000) engine, but with more aggressive cam timing. The SOHC VTEC ZC is similar to the D16Z6 ('91\u2013'96). The DOHC ZC is similar to the D16A1, D16A3, D16A8, D16A9 and D16Z5 engines.\n\n===SOHC ZC VTEC===\n\nVTEC\n*Found in\n**1991\u20131993 Honda Civic Ferio EJ3 (JDM)\n**1992\u20131995 Honda Civic EJ1 (JDM)\n**1992\u20131995 Honda Domani MA4 (JDM)\n***Displacement : 1590&nbsp;cc (97 cu in)\n***Bore and Stroke : 75&nbsp;mm \u00d7 90&nbsp;mm (3.0 in \u00d7 3.5 in)\n***Rod Length : 137MM\n***Rod/Stroke : 1.52\n***Compression : 9.2:1\n***Power : 125&nbsp;hp (95.6&nbsp;kW, 130 ps) at 6600&nbsp;rpm\n***Torque : 107&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (14.8&nbsp;kg/m, 145 Nm) at 5200&nbsp;rpm\n***Redline : 7200&nbsp;rpm\n***Fuel Cut : 7300&nbsp;rpm\n***VTEC Switchover : 5500&nbsp;rpm\n***Fuel Control : OBD-1 MPFI\n***ECU Code : P70 (Domani), P91 (Civic Coup\u00e9), P29\n\n===DOHC ZC===\n\nNon-VTEC\n*Found in (JDM)\n**1984\u20131987 Honda Ballade CRX AS\n**1984\u20131987 Honda Civic AT\n**1985\u20131987 Honda Integra AV/DA1 (Lower trim packages equipped with Single Carburetor)\n**1986\u20131991 Honda CRX EF7\n**1992\u20131995 Honda Civic EH1\n***Displacement : 1590&nbsp;cc\n***Bore and Stroke : 75&nbsp;mm X 90&nbsp;mm\n***1984\u20131987 Compression : 9.3:1 1988\u20131989 Compression : 9.5: 1\n***Single Carburetor : {{convert|100|PS|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 6800&nbsp;rpm; Torque : 92&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (12.8&nbsp;kg/m, 126 Nm) at 5500&nbsp;rpm\n***1984\u20131987 Power : {{convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6250&nbsp;rpm; Torque : 99&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (13.7&nbsp;kg/m, 134 Nm) at 5500&nbsp;rpm\n***1988\u20131989 Power : {{convert|120|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6500&nbsp;rpm; Torque : 103&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (14.0&nbsp;kg/m, 137 Nm) at 5500&nbsp;rpm\n***1988\u20131991 Power : {{convert|130|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6800&nbsp;rpm; Torque : 106&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (14.7&nbsp;kg/m, 144 Nm) at 5700&nbsp;rpm\n***Valvetrain : DOHC\n***Piston Code 1986-'87 : PG6\n***Piston Code 1988-'89 : PM7\n***Fuel Control : OBD-0 MPFI\n\nEuro Mk1 ('85-'87) 1.6 CRX's are fitted with an engine designated \"ZC1\" which is a higher spec {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the D16A1. These were later replaced by the D16A8 or B16A, depending on the specs.\n\n1st Gen ZC \nIdentified by: External coil, small distributor, dual butterfly TB, cam cover bolts on top, brown/gold cam cover. Large cam pulleys. +3cc PG6B pistons, non-pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC it appeared in JDM AV Integra Si and JDM E-AT Civic/CR-X Si. Commonly produced at the time but now over twenty years old and getting harder to find. D-series version is called D16A1, 1986-1987.\n\n2nd Gen ZC (rarest) \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB mounted on slight angle forward, bolts on top of cam cover, black cam cover, large cam pulleys. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC appeared in JDM facelift AV bodied Integra Si did not appear in Civic or CR-X, rarest ZC only produced for less than one year. D-series version D16A1 '88-'89 (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n3rd Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil, large distributor, single butterfly TB. Black cam cover. Cam cover bolts on the sides. Small cam pulleys. Inlet Manifold stamped PM7. +7cc PM7 pistons, 43 cc Pent roof combustion chamber. As a \"ZC\" this appeared in the JDM EF3 Civic and EF7 CR-X, and also in the JDM Honda Quint Integra GSi (DA1 chassis). This is the most commonly produced ZC, manufactured in Japan from end of '87 through to early '91 D-series version D16A8/9 (Euro Civic Si) (sometimes +7cc P29 pistons)\n\n4th Gen ZC \nIdentified by: Internal coil. OBD1 EFi system (grey plug). No cam angle sensor on exhaust cam, now located in distributor. Rubber plug where cam angle sensor would mount. Black cam cover. No PGM-EFi plate on the inlet manifold, replaced with three ribs instead. P29 stamped on inlet manifold. MAP sensor on TB. +7cc PM7 pistons, pent roof combustion chamber. As a ZC only appeared in EG5 Civic bodies, no Integra or CRX received this engine. Reasonably common produced from '92 to '94.

The platoon commander, the vehicle\u2019s gunner and a number of other soldiers in the vehicle were injured. Due to damage to his periscope optics, Pte. Beharry was forced to open his hatch to steer his vehicle, exposing his face and head to withering small arms fire.

Both were in direct face of the enemy, under intense fire, at great personal risk to himself (one leading to him sustaining very serious injuries). His valour is worthy of the highest recognition.\nIn the early hours of May 1, 2004 Beharry's company was ordered to replenish an isolated coalition forces outpost located in the centre of the troubled city of Al Amarah. He was the driver of a platoon commander's warrior armoured fighting vehicle. His platoon was the company's reserve force and was placed on immediate notice to move.\n\nAs the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment, they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack. Beharry's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company, who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol.\n\nAs his platoon passed a roundabout, en route to the pinned-down patrol, they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead. The platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt, so that he could assess the situation. The vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nEyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions, which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior. As a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire, both the platoon commander and the vehicle's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds, and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded.\n\nDue to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle's radio systems, Beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him. He did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive, or how serious their injuries may be.\n\nIn this confusing and dangerous situation, on his own initiative, he closed his driver's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications, halting just short of a barricade placed across the road. The vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle.\n\nFurther damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick, noxious smoke. Beharry opened up his armoured hatch cover to clear his view and orientate himself to the situation. He still had no radio communications and was now acting on his own initiative, as the lead vehicle of a six warrior convoy in an enemy-controlled area of the city at night.\n\nHe assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through, out of the ambush. He drove his warrior directly through the barricade, not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle. By doing this he was able to lead the remaining five warriors behind him towards safety.\n\nAs the smoke in his driver's tunnel cleared, he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him. He pulled the heavy armoured hatch down with one hand, whilst still controlling his vehicle with the other. However, the overpressure from the explosion of the rocket wrenched the hatch out of his grip, and the flames and force of the blast passed directly over him, down the driver's tunnel, further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret.\n\nThe impact of this rocket destroyed Beharry's armoured periscope, so he was forced to drive the vehicle through the remainder of the ambushed route, some 1500m long, with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire, all the time with no communications with any other vehicle. During this long surge through the ambushes the vehicle was again struck by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.\n\nWhile his head remained out of the hatch, to enable him to see the route ahead, he was directly exposed to much of this fire, and was himself hit by a 7.62mm bullet, which penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface. Despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire Beharry continued to push through the extended ambush, still leading his platoon until he broke clean.\n\nHe then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of Al Amarah to the outside of the Cimic House outpost, which was receiving small arms fire from the surrounding area. Once he had brought his vehicle to a halt outside, without thought for his own personal safety, he climbed onto the turret of the still-burning vehicle and, seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire, manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret, off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby warrior.\n\nHe then returned once again to his vehicle and again mounted the exposed turret to lift out the vehicle's gunner and move him to a position of safety. Exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety.\n\nRemounting his burning vehicle for the third time, he drove it through a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost, thus denying it to the enemy.\n\nOnly at this stage did Beharry pull the fire extinguisher handles, immobilising the engine of the vehicle, dismounted and then moved himself into the relative safety of the back of another warrior. Once inside Beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated.\n\nHaving returned to duty following medical treatment, on June 11, 2004 Beharry's warrior was part of a quick reaction force tasked to attempt to cut off a mortar team that had attacked a coalition force base in Al Amarah. As the lead vehicle of the platoon he was moving rapidly through the dark city streets towards the suspected firing point, when his vehicle was ambushed by the enemy from a series of rooftop positions.\n\nDuring this initial heavy weight of enemy fire, a rocket-propelled grenade detonated on the vehicle's frontal armour, just six inches [15cm] from Beharry's head, resulting in a serious head injury. Other rockets struck the turret and sides of the vehicle, incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew.\n\nWith the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision, Beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle, and forcefully reversed the warrior out of the ambush area. The vehicle continued to move until it struck the wall of a nearby building and came to rest. Beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds.\n\nBy moving the vehicle out of the enemy's chosen killing area he enabled other warrior crews to be able to extract his crew from his vehicle, with a greatly reduced risk from incoming fire.\n\nDespite receiving a serious head injury, which later saw him being listed as very seriously injured and in a coma for some time, his level-headed actions in the face of heavy and accurate enemy fire at short range again almost certainly saved the lives of his crew and provided the conditions for their safe evacuation to medical treatment.\n\nBeharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour, despite intense direct attacks, personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/18/iraq.military1|title=Private Beharry's Victoria Cross citation|date=18 March 2005|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref>}}\n\nBeharry is the first recipient of the Victoria Cross since the [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] awards to Lieutenant Colonel [[H.

Both were in direct face of the enemy, under intense fire, at great personal risk to himself (one leading to him sustaining very serious injuries). His valour is worthy of the highest recognition.\nIn the early hours of May 1, 2004 Beharry's company was ordered to replenish an isolated coalition forces outpost located in the centre of the troubled city of Al Amarah. He was the driver of a platoon commander's warrior armoured fighting vehicle. His platoon was the company's reserve force and was placed on immediate notice to move.\n\nAs the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment, they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack. Beharry's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company, who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol.\n\nAs his platoon passed a roundabout, en route to the pinned-down patrol, they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead. The platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt, so that he could assess the situation. The vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nEyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions, which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior. As a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire, both the platoon commander and the vehicle's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds, and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded.\n\nDue to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle's radio systems, Beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him. He did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive, or how serious their injuries may be.\n\nIn this confusing and dangerous situation, on his own initiative, he closed his driver's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications, halting just short of a barricade placed across the road. The vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle.\n\nFurther damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick, noxious smoke. Beharry opened up his armoured hatch cover to clear his view and orientate himself to the situation. He still had no radio communications and was now acting on his own initiative, as the lead vehicle of a six warrior convoy in an enemy-controlled area of the city at night.\n\nHe assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through, out of the ambush. He drove his warrior directly through the barricade, not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle. By doing this he was able to lead the remaining five warriors behind him towards safety.\n\nAs the smoke in his driver's tunnel cleared, he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him. He pulled the heavy armoured hatch down with one hand, whilst still controlling his vehicle with the other. However, the overpressure from the explosion of the rocket wrenched the hatch out of his grip, and the flames and force of the blast passed directly over him, down the driver's tunnel, further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret.\n\nThe impact of this rocket destroyed Beharry's armoured periscope, so he was forced to drive the vehicle through the remainder of the ambushed route, some 1500m long, with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire, all the time with no communications with any other vehicle. During this long surge through the ambushes the vehicle was again struck by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.\n\nWhile his head remained out of the hatch, to enable him to see the route ahead, he was directly exposed to much of this fire, and was himself hit by a 7.62mm bullet, which penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface. Despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire Beharry continued to push through the extended ambush, still leading his platoon until he broke clean.\n\nHe then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of Al Amarah to the outside of the Cimic House outpost, which was receiving small arms fire from the surrounding area. Once he had brought his vehicle to a halt outside, without thought for his own personal safety, he climbed onto the turret of the still-burning vehicle and, seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire, manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret, off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby warrior.\n\nHe then returned once again to his vehicle and again mounted the exposed turret to lift out the vehicle's gunner and move him to a position of safety. Exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety.\n\nRemounting his burning vehicle for the third time, he drove it through a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost, thus denying it to the enemy.\n\nOnly at this stage did Beharry pull the fire extinguisher handles, immobilising the engine of the vehicle, dismounted and then moved himself into the relative safety of the back of another warrior. Once inside Beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated.\n\nHaving returned to duty following medical treatment, on June 11, 2004 Beharry's warrior was part of a quick reaction force tasked to attempt to cut off a mortar team that had attacked a coalition force base in Al Amarah. As the lead vehicle of the platoon he was moving rapidly through the dark city streets towards the suspected firing point, when his vehicle was ambushed by the enemy from a series of rooftop positions.\n\nDuring this initial heavy weight of enemy fire, a rocket-propelled grenade detonated on the vehicle's frontal armour, just six inches [15cm] from Beharry's head, resulting in a serious head injury. Other rockets struck the turret and sides of the vehicle, incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew.\n\nWith the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision, Beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle, and forcefully reversed the warrior out of the ambush area. The vehicle continued to move until it struck the wall of a nearby building and came to rest. Beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds.\n\nBy moving the vehicle out of the enemy's chosen killing area he enabled other warrior crews to be able to extract his crew from his vehicle, with a greatly reduced risk from incoming fire.\n\nDespite receiving a serious head injury, which later saw him being listed as very seriously injured and in a coma for some time, his level-headed actions in the face of heavy and accurate enemy fire at short range again almost certainly saved the lives of his crew and provided the conditions for their safe evacuation to medical treatment.\n\nBeharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour, despite intense direct attacks, personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/18/iraq.military1|title=Private Beharry's Victoria Cross citation|date=18 March 2005|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref>}}\n\nBeharry is the first recipient of the Victoria Cross since the [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] awards to Lieutenant Colonel [[H.
