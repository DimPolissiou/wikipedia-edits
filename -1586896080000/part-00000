Most reports featured the Astors in the headlines.]]\n\nMadeleine Astor, then five months pregnant, boarded the ''Titanic'' as a first-class passenger in [[Cherbourg]], France, with her husband; her husband's valet, Victor Robbins; her maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Endres. They also took Kitty, Astor's pet [[Airedale Terrier|Airedale]], and occupied one of the parlor suites. On the night of April 14, 1912, Colonel Astor reported to his wife that the ship had hit an [[iceberg]]. He reassured her that the damage did not appear serious, though he helped her strap on her lifebelt. While they were waiting on the boat-deck, Mrs. Astor lent Leah Aks, a third-class passenger, her fur shawl to keep her son, Filly, warm. At one point, the Astors retired to the gymnasium and sat on the mechanical horses in their lifebelts. Colonel Astor found another lifebelt which he reportedly cut with a pen knife to show Madeleine what it was made of. When it was time to board a life boat, Madeleine Astor, her maid, and her nurse had to crawl through the first-class promenade window into the tilting [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] 4 (which had been lowered down to A deck to take on more passengers). Astor had helped his wife to climb through the window and asked if he could accompany her as she was 'in a delicate condition'. The request was denied by Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-biography/john-jacob-astor.html|title= Colonel John Jacob Astor|work= encyclopedia titanica|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> An account of Madeleine's boarding of the lifeboat was given by [[Archibald Gracie IV]] to the [[American Titanic inquiry|US Senate Titanic inquiry]]. Gracie was a fellow passenger and recalled the events regarding Madeleine Astor  in the following terms.\n\n<blockquote>The only incident I remember was when i farted. She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. It smelt bad. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, 'No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off.' Mr Astor then said, 'Well, tell me what is the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards,' or words to that effect. The answer came back, 'No. 4.'<ref>United States Senate Inquiry into the Titanic.

The account given by her spokesman is:\n\n{{quote|On landing from the ''Carpathia'', the young bride widowed by the ''Titanic's'' sinking told members of her family what she could recall of the circumstances of the disaster. Of how Colonel Astor had met his death she had no definite conception.\n\nShe recalled she thought that in the confusion as she was about to be put into one of the boats Colonel Astor was standing by her side. After that she had no very clear recollection of the happenings until the boats were well clear of the sinking steamer.\n\nMrs Astor, it appears, left in one of the last boats which got away from the ship. It was her belief that all the women who wished to go had then been taken off. Her impression was that the boat she left in had room for at least 15 more persons. The men, for some reason (that) she could not and does not now understand, did not seem to be at all anxious to leave the ship.

Most reports featured the Astors in the headlines.]]\n\nMadeleine Astor, then five months pregnant, boarded the ''Titanic'' as a first-class passenger in [[Cherbourg]], France, with her husband; her husband's valet, Victor Robbins; her maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Endres. They also took Kitty, Astor's pet [[Airedale Terrier|Airedale]], and occupied one of the parlor suites. On the night of April 14, 1912, Colonel Astor reported to his wife that the ship had hit an [[iceberg]]. He reassured her that the damage did not appear serious, though he helped her strap on her lifebelt. While they were waiting on the boat-deck, Mrs. Astor lent Leah Aks, a third-class passenger, her fur shawl to keep her son, Filly, warm. At one point, the Astors retired to the gymnasium and sat on the mechanical horses in their lifebelts. Colonel Astor found another lifebelt which he reportedly cut with a pen knife to show Madeleine what it was made of. When it was time to board a life boat, Madeleine Astor, her maid, and her nurse had to crawl through the first-class promenade window into the tilting [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] 4 (which had been lowered down to A deck to take on more passengers). Astor had helped his wife to climb through the window and asked if he could accompany her as she was 'in a delicate condition'. The request was denied by Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-biography/john-jacob-astor.html|title= Colonel John Jacob Astor|work= encyclopedia titanica|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> An account of Madeleine's boarding of the lifeboat was given by [[Archibald Gracie IV]] to the [[American Titanic inquiry|US Senate Titanic inquiry]]. Gracie was a fellow passenger and recalled the events regarding Madeleine Astor  in the following terms.\n\n<blockquote>The only incident I remember in particular at this point is when Mrs Astor was put in the boat. She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, 'No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off.' Mr Astor then said, 'Well, tell me what is the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards,' or words to that effect. The answer came back, 'No. 4.'<ref>United States Senate Inquiry into the Titanic.

The account given by her spokesman is:\n\n{{quote|On landing from the ''Carpathia'', the young bride widowed by the ''Titanic's'' sinking told members of her family what she could recall of the circumstances of the disaster. Of how Colonel Astor had met his death she had no definite conception.\n\nShe recalled she thought that in the confusion as she was about to be put into one of the boats Colonel Astor was standing by her side. After that she had no very clear recollection of the happenings until the boats were well clear of the sinking steamer.\n\nMrs Astor, it appears, left in one of the last boats which got away from the ship. It was her belief that all the women who wished to go had then been taken off. Her impression was that the boat she left in had room for at least 15 more persons. The men, for some reason (that) she could not and does not now understand, did not seem to be at all anxious to leave the ship.

who is a businessman and E.Jean Stella Fernando. She has two sisters, Mishen Prasadika and Rochelle Fiona. Dilhara studied in Negombo South International School until her GCE Ordinary Level, which she sat as a private candidate. At the age of 11 she started practicing Martial Arts, Katate-do-Shitokai, under Sensei Rohan P. Udayakumara (Black belt dan 5). During her training, she participated for several local and international Karate championships and won medals. She won the gold medal for the 2nd International Gojuryu Karate Open Championship, conducted by the International Gojuryu Karate Association (IGKA). Meanwhile, she started volunteering as an English teacher for several children homes after an incident that took place when she was 15 years old. This made her in wanting to become a humanitarian and an actress. Dilhara completed her GCE Advanced Level in Arts Stream ( English Literature, Japanese Language and IT ) at [[Newstead Girls College]] [[Negombo]]. There she was able to participate in several dramas conducted by the school drama team, that gave her the first experience in taking part in a play.

While she was visiting her uncle at the Negombo Hospital with her father, she witnessed a fight between a family and the hospital staff members about discharging a dead body. The incident caught the attention of the people around as well as hers. After about an hour when she returned with her father, she saw that one body was taken and the other was still lying. After few weeks when she revisited her uncle, she got to know from the hospital staff that nobody came to claim the other body since, so that they had buried it with government funds. \nThis occurrence made her think that even though the two dead individuals were from the same town, same country and died in the same period of time, they had two different destinies. According to Dilhara, there are people who are treated differently, neglected and marginalized in the society such as elderly, homeless people, people with disability who are being invisible to the public. She, who was also a victim of social invisibility during this period of time, decided to speak on behalf of other socially invisible individuals by looking into their needs.<ref name=\"dailynews222\"/>\n\nDilhara joined Abhina Academy conducted by the veteran actress [[Anoja Weerasinghe]]. Anoja became her first acting guru. In an interview published in ''[[Sunday Observer]]'' and ''[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]'', Dilhara said that [[Anoja Weerasinghe]] taught the basic principals of acting with meditation and yoga that helped her build voice control and facial expressions. Later she joined Damayanthi Fonseka's acting Academy to study emotional balancing and character adaptation. Dilhara also studied Drama and Theatre at Abhiranga Art Centre Negombo, conducted by Randika Wimalasooriya. During this period, she got the opportunity to study Art from the Indian Theatre Director, Ujjwal Singha. Dilhara stated that Ujjwal got her through the Indian Theatre and Children's theatre that helped her to open up perspectives in overseas too.

who is a businessman and E.Jean Stella Fernando. She has two sisters, Mishen Prasadika and Rochelle Fiona. Dilhara studied in Negombo South International School until her GCE Ordinary Level, which she sat as a private candidate. At the age of 11 she started practicing Martial Arts, Katate-do-Shitokai, under Sensei Rohan P. Udayakumara (Black belt dan 5). During her training, she participated for several local and international Karate championships and won medals. She won the gold medal for the 2nd International Gojuryu Karate Open Championship, conducted by the International Gojuryu Karate Association (IGKA). Meanwhile, she started volunteering as an English teacher for several children homes after an incident that took place when she was 15 years old. This made her in wanting to become a humanitarian and an actress. Dilhara completed her GCE Advanced Level in Arts Stream ( English Literature, Japanese Language and IT ) at [[Newstead Girls College]] [[Negombo]]. There she was able to participate in several dramas conducted by the school drama team, that gave her the first experience in taking part in a play. In 2013 she also completed her Japanese Language Proficiency Test ( JLPT N5 and N4 ) which was conducted by the Japanese Language Education Association of Sasakawa Centre [[Sri Lanka]].<ref name=\"Fernando\">{{cite news |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170827/magazine/an-actress-in-search-of-recognition-instead-of-popularity-255830.html |title=An actress in search of recognition instead of popularity |newspaper=[[Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Times]] |first=Susitha R. |last=Fernando |date=27 August 2017 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://fragmenteyes.blogspot.com/2017/11/michelle-dilhara-acting-on-moving-on.html|title=Michelle Dilhara: Acting on, moving on|newspaper=Fragmentes|date=10 January 2019 |accessdate=10 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deshaya.lk/article/52/%E0%B7%84%E0%B6%AF%E0%B7%83%E0%B6%BB/8601/%E0%B6%B4%E0%B7%94%E0%B6%82%E0%B6%A0%E0%B7%92-%E0%B6%B4%E0%B6%AD%E0%B7%8A%E0%B6%AD%E0%B6%BB%E0%B6%9A%E0%B7%8F%E0%B6%BB%E0%B7%92%E0%B6%A7-%E0%B6%AD%E0%B7%8F%E0%B6%B8-%E0%B6%B4%E0%B7%99%E0%B6%B8%E0%B7%8A%E0%B7%80%E0%B6%AD%E0%B7%99%E0%B6%9A%E0%B7%8A-%E0%B6%B1%E0%B7%90%E0%B7%84%E0%B7%90|title=Podi Patharakari still don't have a boyfriend|newspaper=Deshaya|language=Sinhala|date=22 September 2018|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of fifteen, an incident changed her life. While she was visiting her uncle at the Negombo Hospital with her father, she witnessed a fight between a family and the hospital staff members about discharging a dead body. The incident caught the attention of the people around as well as hers. After about an hour when she returned with her father, she saw that one body was taken and the other was still lying. After few weeks when she revisited her uncle, she got to know from the hospital staff that nobody came to claim the other body since, so that they had buried it with government funds. \nThis occurrence made her think that even though the two dead individuals were from the same town, same country and died in the same period of time, they had two different destinies. According to Dilhara, there are people who are treated differently, neglected and marginalized in the society such as elderly, homeless people, people with disability who are being invisible to the public. She, who was also a victim of social invisibility during this period of time, decided to speak on behalf of other socially invisible individuals by looking into their needs.<ref name=\"dailynews222\"/>\n\nDilhara joined Abhina Academy conducted by the veteran actress [[Anoja Weerasinghe]]. Anoja became her first acting guru. In an interview published in ''[[Sunday Observer]]'' and ''[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]'', Dilhara said that [[Anoja Weerasinghe]] taught the basic principals of acting with meditation and yoga that helped her build voice control and facial expressions. Later she joined Damayanthi Fonseka's acting Academy to study emotional balancing and character adaptation. Dilhara also studied Drama and Theatre at Abhiranga Art Centre Negombo, conducted by Randika Wimalasooriya.

Around the age of 13, he moved to [[Iraq]] and took up residence in the holy city of [[Najaf]] where he began studying Shia theology with the scholars of that city.  He eventually attained the rank of Ayatollah and was subsequently made a [[Marja'|marja]].  Khoei would continue to live in Najaf, becoming a teacher for the remainder of his life, and overseeing the studies of scholars who would be qualified to issue fatwas based on Shia theology.\n\nDue to his prominent position as a teacher and scholar in Najaf, he became an important leader of worldwide Shias.  He was made the most prominent Grand Ayatollah in 1971 after the death of [[Muhsin al-Hakim]].  In this position, he became a patron of numerous institutions across the globe that sought to provide welfare, and also provided scholarships to theological students from across the Muslim world.\n\nHe is considered as the architect of a distinct school of thought in the principles of jurisprudence and Islamic law, and one of the leading exponents of 'kalam'-scholastic theology- and 'rijal'- study of the biographies of transmitters of ahadith, the prophetic traditions, 'fiqh'- jurisprudence- and 'tafseer'- exegesis of the Qur'an. His interests included astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAl-Khoei's status as the pre-eminent scholar of his age did not go unchallenged. In the 1970s, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Mohammed Al-Shirazi]], a radical theologian based in [[Karbala]] had a long running feud with Al Khoei and his fellow clerics in Najaf over the legitimacy of theocratic rule. The dispute resulted in Al-Khoei seeking to dismiss Al Shirazi's status as a religious scholar.<ref>[http://www.aei.org/outlook/foreign-and-defense-policy/regional/middle-east-and-north-africa/has-kuwait-reached-the-sectarian-tipping-point/ Has Kuwait reached the sectarian tipping point?], [[American Enterprise Institute]], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Khoei was arrested by [[Saddam Hussein]] during the mass Shia uprising that followed the defeat of Iraqi forces.

Around the age of 13, he moved to [[Iraq]] and took up residence in the holy city of [[Najaf]] where he began studying Shia theology with the scholars of that city.  He eventually attained the rank of Ayatollah and was subsequently made a [[Marja'|marja]].  Khoei would continue to live in Najaf, becoming a teacher for the remainder of his life, and overseeing the studies of scholars who would be qualified to issue fatwas based on Shia theology.\n\nDue to his prominent position as a teacher and scholar in Najaf, he became an important leader of worldwide Shias.  He was made the most prominent Grand Ayatollah in 1971 after the death of [[Muhsin al-Hakim]].  In this position, he became a patron of numerous institutions across the globe that sought to provide welfare, and also provided scholarships to theological students from across the Muslim world.\n\nHe is considered as the architect of a distinct school of thought in the principles of jurisprudence and Islamic law, and one of the leading exponents of 'kalam'-scholastic theology- and 'rijal'- study of the biographies of transmitters of ahadith, the prophetic traditions, 'fiqh'- jurisprudence- and 'tafseer'- exegesis of the Qur'an. His interests included astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAl-Khoei's status as the pre-eminent scholar of his age did not go unchallenged. In the 1970s, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Mohammed Al-Shirazi]], a radical theologian based in [[Karbala]] had a long running feud with Al Khoei and his fellow clerics in Najaf over the legitimacy of theocratic rule. The dispute resulted in Al-Khoei seeking to dismiss Al Shirazi's status as a religious scholar.<ref>[http://www.aei.org/outlook/foreign-and-defense-policy/regional/middle-east-and-north-africa/has-kuwait-reached-the-sectarian-tipping-point/ Has Kuwait reached the sectarian tipping point?], [[American Enterprise Institute]], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Khoei was arrested by [[Saddam Hussein]] during the mass Shia uprising that followed the defeat of Iraqi forces.  While under arrest, he was taken to [[Baghdad]] and forced to make public appearances with Saddam Hussein.  Hussein eventually allowed Khoei to return to Najaf, but he was placed under house arrest.

The agave plant is cut from its roots and then the spearlike leaves are sheered off. The core that is left is called a pi\u00f1a, which is the raw material used for the making of tequila. The pi\u00f1as are transported on a truck to Don Julio's Distillery where they are cut into equal sized pieces so that they bake evenly. The pi\u00f1as are loaded into brick ovens where they are slowly baked over the course of several days. Then the baked pi\u00f1as are crushed and doused with water, which releases the sweet agave syrup called agave juice. Then yeast is added to the agave water and is left to ferment. After the fermentation process is complete it results in a sweet, slight alcoholic agave beer which is then put into stills where it is distilled to become tequila.
