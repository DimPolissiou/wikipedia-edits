The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory. [[Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6]] was developed to permit launches into [[polar orbit]].\n\nMOL competed with the [[Vietnam War]] for funds, and was beset by budget cuts that caused the date of the first operational flight to be repeatedly postponed. A single test flight, [[OPS 0855]], was launched on 3 November 1966. The program was canceled in June 1969, after it was demonstrated that automated [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were more cost-effective.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Bernard Adolph Schriever.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]] ]]\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11\u201312}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}}\n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101\u2013102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}\n\n[[File:MOL patch from NRO.jpg|thumb|left|MOL patch]]\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase. Dyna-Soar would be launched into orbit by a [[Titan III]] booster.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|p=353}}{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=311}}\n\nThe same 22 February memorandum tacit approval for the development of a space station. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program \u2013 Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million in funding for MODS and $102 million for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120\u2013122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft. Crews would rotate every 30 days, with resupply arriving every 120 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=370\u2013371}} On 10 December 1963, McNamara issued a press release that officially announced the cancellation of Dyna-Soar and the initiation the MOL program.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after coming to office, the [[Kennedy administration]] tightened security regarding spy satellites in response to Soviet sensitivities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}} No administration official could even admit they existed until President [[Jimmy Carter]] did so in 1978.{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=378\u2013379}} MOL therefore became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the Discoverer/Corona spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n==Planning==\n[[File:Major General Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Major General Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr.]]\nOn 16 December 1963, USAF Headquarters ordered Schriever to submit a development plan for the MOL.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=36}} About $6 million was spent on preliminary studies, most of which were completed by September 1964. McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} In all, some $3,237,716 was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500, followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[General Electric]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} MOL needed some \"white\" experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1,653 million. The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, an human operated system was superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, this could be greatly reduced. He also noted that while the notion of satellites passing overhead was accepted, a crewed space station might be a different matter,{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71\u201379}} but the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Rusk]], thought that this could be managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dean Rusk to Robert McNamar |date=16 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/125.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite then under development justified the cost. The [[Director of Central Intelligence]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William Raborn]] thought that it might. McNamara took the proposal to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] on 24 August 1965, who approved it, and issued an official announcement at a press conference the following day.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71\u201379}}<ref>{{cite press release |title=President Johnson's Statement on MOL |date=25 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/129.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MOL foot restraints.jpg|thumb|left|MOL training]]\nIn January 1965, Schriever had appointed [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Harry L.

Under this agreement, the Deputy Director MOL would forward black cost estimates to the NRO Controller, who had the authority to obligate NRO funds. This was followed by a corresponding MOL White Financial Procedures Agreement, which was approved by Flax in December and signed by [[Leonard Marks Jr.]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller)]]. This provided for a more regular channel, with funds going through the AFSC to its Space Systems Division (SSD) and thence to the MOL SPO.  Thus far no definition contracts had been let, except for the Titan III booster. On 30 September, Brown released $12 million in fiscal year 1965 funds and $50 million in fiscal year 1966 funds for the MOL definition phase activities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=85\u201388}}\n\n[[File:MOL mockup.jpg|thumb|right|MOL mockup.

A $10.55 million [[Fixed-price contract]] was signed with Douglas on 17 October. Contract negotiations with General Electric were also completed around this time, and it was given $4.922 mullion, all but $0.975 million of it in black funds.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=85\u201388}} [[The Aerospace Corporation]] was given responsibility for general systems engineering/technical direction (GSE/TD).{{sfn|Strom|2004|p=12}} Douglas selected four major subcontractors: [[Hamilton-Standard]] for environmental control and life support; [[Collins Radio]] for the communications; [[Honeywell]] for the attitude control; and [[Pratt & Whitney]] for the electrical power; and [[IBM]] for data management.

The Gemini capsule had little room inside, and the MOL astronauts gained access to the laboratory through a hatch in the heat shield. This required a more flexible suit than those of NASA astronauts. The NASA astronauts had custom-made set of flight, training and backup suits, but for the MOL the inttion was that spacesuits would be provided in standard sizes with adjustable elements. The USAF sounded out the [[David Clark Company]], [[International Latex Corporation]], [[B. F. Goodrich]] and [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1964. Hamilton Standard and David Clark each developed four prototype suits for the MOL.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=212\u2013219}} A competition was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1967, and a production contract awarded to Hamilton Standard. At least 17 blue MOL MH-7 training suits were delivered between May 1968 and July 1969. A single MH-8 flight configuration suit was delivered in October 1968 for certification testing. The flight suit was intended to be worn during launch and reentry.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=223\u2013230}}\n\nThe contract for the launch/reentry suit was followed by a second competition in September 1967 for a suit for [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA).{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}} This too was won by Hamilton Standard. The design was complicated by USAF concerns that a crew member might slip their tethers and float away. As a result, an  [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|astronaut maneuvering unit]] (AMU) was deeloped and integrated with the life support system as an integrated maneuvering and life support system (IMLSS). The design was completed by October 1968, and a full prototype with cover garments was delivered in March 1969. The cover garments were never completed owing to the cancellation of the MOL program in June. The protortype IMLSS was ultimately delivered to the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}}  \n==Astronauts==\n\n=== Selection ===\n{{see also|NASA Astronaut Group 7}}\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) on 12 October 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11\u201313}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi\u2013xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Schriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ARPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronaut groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nFor the selection of first three NASA astronaut groups in [[Mercury Seven|1959]], [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|1962]] and [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963]], the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Schriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On 15 September, the selection criteria for MOL was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\nIn October 1965, the MOL Policy Committee decided that MOL crew members would be designated a \"MOL Aerospace Research Pilots\" rather than astronauts.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=59}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL pilots were publicly announced on 12 November 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J.

This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL program Office selected 25, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected.

One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66-B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on 11 May 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed.

Phase II lasted for five months, and was conducted at the ARPS, where the astronauts were given technical training on the MOL vehicles and their operation procedures. This training was conducted in classrooms, in training flights, and win sessions on the T-27 space flight simulator. Phase III was continuous training on the MOL systems and providing crew input them. The pilots spent most of their time in this phase. Phase IV was training for specific missions. Simulators were developed for each of the different MOL systems. There was a Laboratory Module Simulator, Mission Payload Simulator, and Gemini B Procedures Simulator. Training was conducted in a [[zero-G]] environment on a [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter]] [[reduced-gravity aircraft]]. A Flotation-Egress trainer allowed the astronauts to prepare for a splashdown and the possibility of the spacecraft sinking.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=54}}\n\nNASA had pioneered [[neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid]] to simulate the space environment. The pilots were given [[scuba diving]] training at the U.S. Navy Underwater Swimmers School in [[Key West, Florida]]. Training was then conducted on a General Electric simulator on [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge|Buck Island]], near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].  Water survival training was conducted at the USAF Sea Survival School at [[Homestead Air Force Base]] in Florida, and jungle survival training at the Tropical Survival School at [[Howard Air Force Base]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. In July 1967, the pilots underwent training at the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center]] in Washington, DC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Facilities==\n===Launch complex===\n{{main|Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6}}\nThe military director of the NRO, Brigadier General [[John L.

MOL needed to be flown in a [[polar orbit]], but a launch due south from Cape Kennedy would overfly southern Florida, which raised safety concerns.<ref name=\"Vandenberg\" /> The [[TIROS]] [[weather satellite]]s had performed a \"dog leg\" maneuver, flying east and then south to avoid southern Florida. This required special State Department approval, as it meant overflying Cuba. The loss of a MOL with a classified payload over Cuba would not only be a danger to life and property, but a serious security concern as well. Moreover, the dog leg maneuver would reduce the {{convert|30000|lb|adj=on}} orbital payload by {{convert|2000|to|5000|lb|-2}}, reducing the equipment that could be carried or the duration of the mission or both. The cost of construction of a Titan III facility, including the purchase of the land, was estimated to cost $31 million, and the required supporting ground equipment would cost another $79 million.<ref name=\"Vandenberg\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/219.pdf |first=Harold |last=Brown |author-link=Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|title= Memorandum for Chairman Revers from Harold Brown, Subject: Determination of the Launch Site for MOL |date=14 March 1966 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>    \n\n[[File:SLC-6 in 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Space Launch Complex 6 under construction]]\nThe announcement that the MOL would be launched from the [[Western Test Range]] caused an outcry in the Florida news media, which decried it as a wasteful duplication of facilities, given that the recently-completed $154 million [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41]] was specifically built to handle Titan III launches. The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from California, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather satellites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians. Hearings in the House were followed by ones in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]] on 24 February, chaired by the influential Senator [[Clinton P. Anderson]].   This time the witnesses were Seamans, Flax and [[John S. Foster Jr.]], Brown's successor as DDR&E. The logic of the arguments and the united front presented dampened criticism, and none of the nine members of the House from Florida opposed the 1966 MOL budget allocation.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=118\u2013123}}\n\nThe USAF attempted to purchase the land to the south of [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] for the new space launch complex from the owners, but negotiations failed to reach agreement on a suitable price.

The US insisted that the MOL was in line with the 17 October 1963 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution that the exploration and use of outer space should be used\nonly for the betterment of mankind. To allay Soviet fears that the MOL would carry nuclear weapons, the State Department suggested that Soviet officials be permitted to inspect it for them before launch, but Brown opposed this on security grounds.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=73}}\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]].

In November 1965, Flax arbitraily cut $20 million from the MOL Program's fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to $374 million. Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million in 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\n[[File:MOL computers.jpg|thumb|left|The MOL program used state-of-the-art computers for design and simulation]]\n\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne Day |date=2 November 2015 |url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2858/1 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology\">{{cite web |title= MOL Program Chronology |date=December 1967 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/97.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Contracts were signed in May 1967.

This entailed yet another schedule slippage. On 15 July 1968, the MOL SPO convened a conference with major contractors in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]], and it was agreed to defer the first crewed mission from August to December 1971.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]], replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May,  concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version. Although it did not fly until July 1966, the authors were aware of the capabilities of the [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite.

Humans added flexibility, but complicated spacecraft design]]The report pointed out that crewed systems had many advantages over automated ones, which lost up to half their images to cloud cover on a typical mission. A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|mi|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|mi|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\" />\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74\u201375}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S. Benson, a former Department of Defense employee, described the MOL as a program that \"receives a half a billion dollars a year and ought to rank dead last on any rational scale of national priorities.\"{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=157}} Stewart briefed the new [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], [[David Packard]], on the MOL, which Stewart described as the best path to VHR at the earliest date. Laird, who as a Congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL Program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL Program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970. This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million, but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million. The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program. Seamans even offered to find $250 million to continue the program from elsewhere in the USAF budget. They thought the meeting went well, but Nixon accepted the Bureau of the Budget's recommendation to cancel the MOL and proceed with Hexagon instead.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=158\u2013162}}     \n\nOn 7 June, Stewart ordered Bleymaier to cease all work on Gemini B, the Titan IIIM, and the MOL spacesuit, and to cancel or curtail all other contracts. The official announcement that the MOL was canceled was made on 10 June.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=162\u2013163}}{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nFollowing the decision to cancel the project, a committee was formed to handle the disposal of its property, valued at $12.5 million. The MOL's Acquisition and Tracking System, Mission Development Simulator, Laboratory Module Simulator and Mission Simulator were transferred to NASA by the end of 1973. The MOL program office at the Pentagon closed on 15 February 1970, and the office in Los Angeles on 30 September 1970. The Director of Space Systems, Brigadier General [[Lew Allen]], became the point of contact for MOL Contracts were terminated, but those with [[Aerojet]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and the [[United Technologies Corporation]] (UTC) remained open in June 1973.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=92\u201393}} The Aerojet contract had only small claims totaling $9,888, but there remained reservations of $771,569 on the McDonnel-Douglas contract due to a subcontractor dispute and California Franchise Tax. The UTC contract was still worth up to $51,000,000, with the actual amount depending on how much work was attributable to the MOL, and how much to the ongoing work on Titan III.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOL Status |date=5 June 1973 |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/822.pdf |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MOL-Space-Suit-02.jpg|thumb|MH-7 training suit]]\nAt the time of the MOL was cancelled, 192 service and 100 civilian personnel were employed on MOL activities.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions. Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory. [[Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6]] was developed to permit launches into [[polar orbit]].\n\nMOL competed with the [[Vietnam War]] for funds, and was beset by budget cuts that caused the date of the first operational flight to be repeatedly postponed. A single test flight, [[OPS 0855]], was launched on 3 November 1966. The program was canceled in June 1969, after it was demonstrated that automated [[reconnaissance satellite]]s were more cost-effective.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The USAF already started a satellite program in 1956 called WS-117L. It had three components: [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]], a spy satellite; [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]], an experimental program to develop the technology; and [[Missile Defense Alarm System|MIDAS]], an early warning system.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Bernard Adolph Schriever.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]] ]]\nThe launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11\u201312}} Starting in 1956, the United States had conducted covert [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane overflights of the Soviet Union. Twenty-four U-2 missions produced images of about 15 percent of the country with a maximum resolution of {{convert|2|ft}} before the [[1960 U-2 incident|downing of a U-2 in 1960]] abruptly ended the program.{{sfn|David|2017|p=768}} This left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2\u20133}}  In February 1958, in the wake of Sputnik, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ordered the USAF to proceed as quickly as possible with Discover (also known as Corona) as a joint [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)-USAF interim project.{{sfn|Wheeldon|1998|p=33}}{{sfn|Day|1998|p=49}}\n\nOn 18 August 1958, Eisenhower decided to give responsibility for most forms of human space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101\u2013102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}}\n\n[[File:MOL patch from NRO.jpg|thumb|left|MOL patch]]\nIn its 26 April 1961 project plan, Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan I]] booster, with its first piloted suborbital flight in April 1965, followed by its first piloted orbital flight in April 1966,{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=273}} but concerns were raised as to whether over whether permission to land in Brazil would be forthcoming.{{sfn|Houchin|1995|p=279}}  In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara decided to fast track Dyna-Soar and save money by skipping the suborbital testing phase.

With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a modified NASA [[Gemini spacecraft]] that became known as [[Blue Gemini]], and a Titan III launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6\u20138}} On 25 August 1962, Zuckert informed General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever]], the commander of the AFSC, that he was to proceed with studies of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) as the director of the program.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/2.pdf |title=Memorandum for Director, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program \u2013 Subject: Authorization To Proceed With MOL Program |first=Eugene |last=Zuckert |author-link=Eugene Zuckert |publisher=Department of Defence |date=25 August 1962 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he requested $75 million in funding for MODS and $102 million for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} This involved some negotiation with NASA, but McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on cooperation on Project Gemini on 21 January 1963.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120\u2013122}} On 18 January 1963, McNamara called for a review of Dyna-Soar, specifically whether it had a military capability that could not be met by Gemini. In his 14 November response, the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] (DDR&E), [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], examined various options for a space station. He preferred a four-man station that would be launched separately and crewed by astronauts arriving in Gemini spacecraft. Crews would rotate every 30 days, with resupply arriving every 120 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=370\u2013371}} On 10 December 1963, McNamara issued a press release that officially announced the cancellation of Dyna-Soar and the initiation the MOL program.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963 |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after coming to office, the [[Kennedy administration]] tightened security regarding spy satellites in response to Soviet sensitivities.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}} No administration official could even admit they existed until President [[Jimmy Carter]] did so in 1978.{{sfn|Erickson|2005|pp=378\u2013379}} MOL therefore became a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the Discoverer/Corona spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n==Planning==\n[[File:Major General Joseph S.

McDonnell prepared a study of the Gemini B spacecraft, [[Martin Marietta]] of the Titan III booster,{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} and [[Eastman Kodak]] of camera optics.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=37\u201338}}  Other studies examined key MOL subsystems such as environmental control, electrical power, navigation, attitude control stabilization, guidance, communications, and radar.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}} The [[United States Under Secretary of the Air Force]] and the Director of the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO), [[Brockway McMillan]], asked the NRO Program A Director (responsible for the Air Force aspects of NRO activities), [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Robert Evans Greer]], to look into its potential reconnaissance capabilities.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} In all, some $3,237,716 was expended on these studies. The most expensive was of the Gemini B spacecraft, which cost $1,189,500, followed by the Titan III interface, which cost $910,000.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=43\u201344}}  \n\nWith these studies in hand, the USAF issued an RFP to twenty firms in January 1965. At the end of February, [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[General Electric]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] were selected to carry out design studies.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=4\u20135}} Covert NRO activities to be carried out by MOL were classified [[classified information#Secret|secret]] and given the code name \"Dorian\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=40}} MOL needed some \"white\" experiments as cover. An MOL Experiments Working Group was created under Colonel William Brady. Some 400 experiments proposed by various agencies were examined. These were consolidated and reduced to 59, and twelve primary and eighteen secondary ones were selected. A 499-page report on the experiments was issued on 1 April 1964.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe USAF recommended that the MOL use the Gemini B spacecraft with the Titan III booster. A program of six flights (one uncrewed and five crewed) was proposed, with the first flight taking place in 1966. The program was costed at $1,653 million. The [[Science Advisor to the President]], [[Donald Hornig]], reviewed the USAF's submission. He noted that for the sophisticated reconnaissance missions proposed, an human operated system was superior to an automated one, but speculated that with sufficient effort, this could be greatly reduced. He also noted that while the notion of satellites passing overhead was accepted, a crewed space station might be a different matter,{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=71\u201379}} but the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Rusk]], thought that this could be managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dean Rusk to Robert McNamar |date=16 August 1965 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/125.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> There remained the question of whether the improved performance compared to the automated [[KH-8 Gambit 3]] satellite then under development justified the cost.

The Gemini capsule had little room inside, and the MOL astronauts gained access to the laboratory through a hatch in the heat shield. This required a more flexible suit than those of NASA astronauts. The NASA astronauts had custom-made set of flight, training and backup suits, but for the MOL the inttion was that spacesuits would be provided in standard sizes with adjustable elements. The USAF sounded out the [[David Clark Company]], [[International Latex Corporation]], [[B. F. Goodrich]] and [[Hamilton Standard]] in 1964. Hamilton Standard and David Clark each developed four prototype suits for the MOL.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=212\u2013219}} A competition was held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in January 1967, and a production contract awarded to Hamilton Standard. At least 17 blue MOL MH-7 training suits were delivered between May 1968 and July 1969. A single MH-8 flight configuration suit was delivered in October 1968 for certification testing. The flight suit was intended to be worn during launch and reentry.{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=223\u2013230}}\n\nThe contract for the launch/reentry suit was followed by a second competition in September 1967 for a suit for [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA).{{sfn|Thomas|McMann|2006|pp=230\u2013233}} This too was won by Hamilton Standard. The design was complicated by USAF concerns that a crew member might slip their tethers and float away. As a result, an  [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|astronaut maneuvering unit]] (AMU) was deeloped and integrated with the life support system as an integrated maneuvering and life support system (IMLSS).

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS) on 12 October 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11\u201313}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi\u2013xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Schriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ARPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronaut groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nFor the selection of first three NASA astronaut groups in [[Mercury Seven|1959]], [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|1962]] and [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963]], the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Schriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On 15 September, the selection criteria for MOL was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\nIn October 1965, the MOL Policy Committee decided that MOL crew members would be designated a \"MOL Aerospace Research Pilots\" rather than astronauts.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=59}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL pilots were publicly announced on 12 November 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J.

This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL program Office selected 25, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected.

Phase II lasted for five months, and was conducted at the ARPS, where the astronauts were given technical training on the MOL vehicles and their operation procedures. This training was conducted in classrooms, in training flights, and win sessions on the T-27 space flight simulator. Phase III was continuous training on the MOL systems and providing crew input them. The pilots spent most of their time in this phase. Phase IV was training for specific missions. Simulators were developed for each of the different MOL systems. There was a Laboratory Module Simulator, Mission Payload Simulator, and Gemini B Procedures Simulator. Training was conducted in a [[zero-G]] environment on a [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter]] [[reduced-gravity aircraft]]. A Flotation-Egress trainer allowed the astronauts to prepare for a splashdown and the possibility of the spacecraft sinking.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=54}}\n\nNASA had pioneered [[neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid]] to simulate the space environment. The pilots were given [[scuba diving]] training at the U.S. Navy Underwater Swimmers School in [[Key West, Florida]]. Training was then conducted on a a General Electric simulator on [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge|Buck Island]], near [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]].  Water survival training was conducted at the USAF Sea Survival School at [[Homestead Air Force Base]] in Florida, and jungle survival training at the Tropical Survival School at [[Howard Air Force Base]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. In July 1967, the pilots underwent training at the [[National Photographic Interpretation Center]] in Washington, DC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Facilities==\n===Launch complex===\n{{main|Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 6}}\nThe military director of the NRO, Brigadier General [[John L.

MOL needed to be flown in a [[polar orbit]], but a launch due south from Cape Kennedy would overfly southern Florida, which raised safety concerns.<ref name=\"Vandenberg\" /> The [[TIROS]] [[weather satellite]]s had performed a \"dog leg\" maneuver, flying east and then south to avoid southern Florida. This required special State Department approval, as it meant overflying Cuba.

Moreover, the dog leg maneuver would reduce the {{convert|30000|lb|adj=on}} orbital payload by {{convert|2000|to|5000|lb|-2}}, reducing the equipment that could be carried or the duration of the mission or both.

The Chairman of the [[House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Congressman [[George P. Miller]]from California, convened a special session on the MOL Program on 7 February 1966. The first witness, the Associate Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans]], supported the MOL Program, and the decision to launch satellites into polar orbit from the West Coast, and said that NASA planned to launch weather satellites from there. He was followed by Schriever, who detailed the issues involved. The arguments did not satisfy Floridians. Hearings in the House were followed by ones in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] before the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]] on 24 February, chaired by the influential Senator [[Clinton P. Anderson]].   This time the witnesses were Seamans, Flax and [[John S. Foster Jr.]], Brown's successor as DDR&E. The logic of the arguments and the united front presented dampened criticism, and none of the nine members of the House from Florida opposed the 1966 MOL budget allocation.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=118\u2013123}}\n\nThe USAF attempted to purchase the land to the south of [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] for the new space launch complex from the owners, but negotiations failed to reach agreement on a suitable price.

The US insisted that the MOL was in line with the 17 October 1963 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution that the exploration and use of outer space should be used\nonly for the betterment of mankind. To allay Soviet fears that the MOL would carry nuclear weapons, the State Department suggested that Soviet officials be permitted to inspect it for them before launch, but Brown opposed this on security grounds.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=73}}\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]].

In November 1965, Flax arbitraily cut $20 million from the MOL Program's fiscal year 1967 budget, bringing it down to $374 million. Brown soon received word that McNamara intended to limit the program to $150 million in 1967, the same allocation as in fiscal year 1966, in response to the rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}} In August 1965, the first uncrewed qualification flight had been expected to take place in late 1968, with the first crewed mission in early 1970,<ref name=\"Red Ink\" /><ref name=\"Chronology\" /> on the assumption that engineering development would commence in January 1966. Since this was now unlikely, McNamara saw no reason to continue with the original budget. Brown examined the schedules, and advised McNamara that a crewed mission in April 1969 would require a minimum of $294 million in fiscal year 1967, and that the minimum budget that the MOL Program required was $230 million, which would impose a delay of the first flight of three to eighteen months. McNamara was unmoved, and $150 million was the sum requested in the President's budget submitted to Congress in January 1966.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=107}}\n\n[[File:MOL computers.jpg|thumb|left|The MOL program used state-of-the-art computers for design and simulation]]\n\nWhen the MOL engineering development phase commenced in September 1966, it became clear that the USAF estimates of project costs and those of the major contractors were a long way apart. McDonnell requested $205.5 million for a fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) contract to design and build Gemini B, which the USAF budgeted $147.9 million; Douglas wanted $815.8 million for the laboratory vehicles which the USAF budgeted at $611.3 million; and General Electric sought $198 million for work budgeted at $147.3 million. In response the MOL SPO reopened negotiations for systems not under contract, and halted the issuance of Dorian clearances to contractor personnel. This had the desired effect, and by December the major contractors had reduced their prices, bringing them closer to the USAF estimates. However, on 7 January, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) informed the MOL SPO that it intended to limit contracts in fiscal year 1968 to $430 million, which was $157 million short of what the MOL SPO wanted, and $381 below what the contractors wanted. This meant that the prime contracts had to be renegotiated,{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=143}}\n\nBudget cuts were not the only reason for the project's schedule slipping. On 9 December 1966, Eastman Kodak advised that it would not be able to deliver the optical sensors by the original target date of January 1969 for a crewed mission in April, and asked for a ten-month extension to October 1969, which pushed the date of the first crewed mission back to January 1970.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=108}} Eventually, $480 million was found for fiscal year 1968, with $50 million obtained by reprogramming funds from other programs, and $661 million agreed upon for fiscal year 1969.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=145}} To meet this, the date of the first qualification flight was pushed back still further, to December 1970, with the first crewed mission in August 1971.<ref name=\"Red Ink\">{{cite news |title=Blue Suits and Red Ink: Budget Overruns and Schedule Slips of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program |publisher=The Space Review |first=Dwayne |last=Day |author-link=Dwayne Day |date=2 November 2015 |url=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/2858/1 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Chronology\">{{cite web |title= MOL Program Chronology |date=December 1967 |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/97.pdf |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> Contracts were signed in May 1967.

This entailed yet another schedule slippage.

In February 1966, Schriever commissioned a report examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report, which was submitted on 25 May,  concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.

A human could select the best angle for a photograph, and could switch between color and infrared, or some other special film, depending on the target. This was especially useful for dealing with camouflaged targets. The MOL also had the ability to change orbits, and could shift from its regular {{convert|80|mi|adj=on}} orbit to a {{convert|200|to|300|mi|adj=on}} one, giving it a view of the entire Soviet Union.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=102}} Experience on Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], Gemini and the X-15 had demonstrated that crew initiative, innovation and improvisation was often the difference between success and failure of the mission.<ref name=\"The Measure of a Man (part 1)\" />\nDebate also persisted about the value of the very high resolution (VHR) imaging being developed for the MOL and [[KH-9 Hexagon]], or whether the resolution provided by Gambit 3 was sufficient.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=74\u201375}} In the wake of the [[Liberty incident|''Liberty'' incident]] in June 1967 and the [[Pueblo incident|''Pueblo'' incident]] in January 1968, there was an increased focus on intelligence gathering by satellite. The Director of Central Intelligence, [[Richard M. Helms]], commissioned a report on the value of VHR, which was completed in May 1968. It concluded that it would help identify smaller items and features, and increase the understanding of Soviet procedures and processes, and the capacities of some of its industrial facilities, it would not alter estimates of technical capabilities, or assessments of the size and deployment of forces. The question of whether the cost justified the benefit was left open.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nOn 20 January 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] was sworn in as President.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=155}} He directed Director of the new  [[Bureau of the Budget]], [[Robert Mayo]], and Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]] to find ways to cut defense spending.{{sfn|David|2017|p=769}} The MOL was an obvious target; an article in the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' titled \"How The Pentagon Can Save $9 Billion\", written by Robert S. Benson, a former Department of Defense employee, described the MOL as a program that \"receives a half a billion dollars a year and ought to rank dead last on any rational scale of national priorities.\"{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=157}} Stewart briefed the new [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], [[David Packard]], on the MOL, which Stewart described as the best path to VHR at the earliest date. Laird, who as a Congressman had criticized McNamara for inadequately funding the MOL Program, was favorably disposed towards the MOL Program, as was Seamans, who was now the Secretary of the Air Force. On 6 March, Packard directed Foster to proceed on the basis of $556 million for fiscal year 1970. This entailed postponement of the first crewed mission to February 1972.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nThe Bureau of the Budget did not accept Laird's decision.  Mayo argued that the resolution provided by Gambit 3, and proposed canceling both the MOL and Hexagon. A MOL mission was expected to cost $150 million, but a Gambit 3 launch only cost $23 million. The value of VLR, Mayo argued, was not worth the additional cost. On 9 April, Nixon reduce the MOL's funding to $360 million, and canceled Hexagon. This meant further postponement of the first crewed flight, by up to a year, and the Bureau of the Budget continued to press for the MOL to be cancelled. In a last ditch attempt to save the MOL, Laird, Seamans and Stewart met with Nixon at the White House on 17 May, and briefed him on the history of the program.

The UTC contract was still worth up to $51,000,000, with the actual amount depending on how much work was attributable to the MOL, and how much to the ongoing work on Titan III.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOL Status |date=5 June 1973 |url=https://www.nro.gov/Portals/65/documents/foia/declass/mol/822.pdf |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MOL-Space-Suit-02.jpg|thumb|MH-7 training suit]]\nAt the time of the MOL was cancelled, 192 service and 100 civilian personnel were employed on MOL activities.

With the win, Folayang became the new title holder.\n\nAfter 5 wins, Folayang suffered his first defeat at the hands of Guam's [[Jon Tuck]] via knockout in just 8 seconds on November 21, 2009.

This debate was heightened by controversy over [[Dragon Skin]], produced by the now defunct [[Pinnacle Armor]].  Various claims surfaced that Dragon Skin was more effective at protecting soldiers than the then standard issue Interceptor body armor system, with independent studies and reports seeming to back these claims, eventually leading to multiple congressional members asking for further evaluation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18720550/ns/nbc_nightly_news_with_brian_williams-nbc_news_investigates/t/are-us-soldiers-wearing-best-body-armor/#.V0J9B5ErKUk|title=Are U.S. soldiers wearing the best body armor?|date=2007-05-20|website=msnbc.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>  In response, the military made public testing that showed widespread failures in the testing of the Dragon Skin armor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dailynightly.msnbc.com/2007/05/army_responds_t.html|title=The Daily Nightly - MSNBC.com|website=dailynightly.msnbc.com|access-date=2016-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030539/http://dailynightly.msnbc.com/2007/05/army_responds_t.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Ultimately, Dragon Skin never saw widespread adoption, and many of the perceived shortfalls of the Outer Tactical Vest such as standard of protection or modularity were addressed in the new Improved Outer Tactical Vest and E-SAPI plates.\n\n==Technical details==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Program Executive Office Soldier fields the Improved Outer Tactical Vest, upgraded body armor, in April 2007.jpg\n|caption1=U.S. soldier showcasing the IOTV for PEO Soldier in April 2007.\n|image2=Hires 080217-F-3873G-169-1- - Copy.jpg\n|caption2=A soldier from the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] wears an Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) with a groin protector in Iraq in February 2008.}}\n\nA size Medium IOTV weighs {{convert|3.6|lbs}},<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kdhdefensesystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/iotv-iii.pdf|title=IOTV-III Sales Sheet|website=kdhdefensesystems.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> less than a Medium OTV vest, while providing more coverage.  However, a fully equipped IOTV, complete with all its components (soft armor panel inserts, four ballistic plate inserts (front and back plates and two side plates), collar, and groin protectors) still weighs {{convert|30|lbs}}, with a Large IOTV weighing about {{convert|35|lbs}}. The functionality of the enhanced side ballistic inserts, which provide coverage under the arms and down the sides of the torso, is built into the IOTV.\n\nThe IOTV provides the ability to don the vest in two ways. The first is to simply place the vest over the head and pull down, and the second is to remove fasteners on the wearer's left shoulder, sliding into the vest to the right. To complete the procedure for both methods the wearer then lifts up the front panel of the vest and fastens the waistband, which takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders somewhat, and then fastens the side protection modules.\n\nA key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/04/02/2497-army-to-field-improved-body-armor/ Army to Field Improved Body Armor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to a casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor.\n\nIt also features a grid of [[PALS webbing]] on the front, back, and sides for the attachment of modular pouches and accessories such as neck and throat protection, groin protection, or deltoid protection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.military.com/equipment/improved-outer-tactical-vest-iotv|title=Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV)|last=Harper|first=John|website=Military.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\n===Female model===\nIn response to the large numbers of female soldiers in the army, a female-specific version of the IOTV (F-IOTV) was developed.  Previously, standard tactical vests were issued to women in combat. Army soldiers found that women's movement was restricted, in ways such as bending over, getting in and out of tight spaces, or positioning their rifles against their shoulders.  The long armor plates inside the vests would also rub against their hips and cut into their thighs when they sat down.  Development of a model for women began in 2009.  After much testing and measurements, the Army came up with a vest that is shorter to accommodate smaller torsos and has tailoring to fit closer to women's chests. The new vest eliminates gaps between the material and the body and can be fitted with smaller side ballistic inserts for small waist sizes.  The vest has a lighter feel because it doesn\u2019t rest on the female soldier's shoulders like the male vest.  The first female soldier vests were given to soldiers deploying for Afghanistan in September 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/87464/|title=Deploying Soldiers test new female body armor prototype {{!}} Article {{!}} The United States Army|last=Service|first=Donna Miles, American Forces Press|website=www.army.mil|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nNearly all modern military body armor is designed to prevent penetration from bullets to vital areas of the body, in addition to protection against knives and fragmentation from explosives.  Typically this is accomplished through both highly durable woven synthetic fibers such as [[Kevlar]] or [[Dyneema]], and either metal or ceramic trauma plates.  The IOTV is the standard issue torso protection component to the United States Army.\n\nThe IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide significant ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear if using the older [[Small Arms Protective Insert|SAPI]] plates (NIJ standard III).  Use of the new [[E-SAPI]] plates increase protection to armor-piercing versions of the aforementioned rounds in addition to .30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]]) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9&nbsp;mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400&nbsp;ft/s (426&nbsp;m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525&nbsp;ft/s (465&nbsp;m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525&nbsp;ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified as this is primarily a law enforcement standard.\n\nThe modular design of the vest allows greater tactical flexibility in regards to different situations faced by ground troops.  A US Army medical research report concluded that greater modular design leads to the ability to find a more effective balance between projectile protection and the physical endurance of the soldier, preventing losses in agility and mobility, and therefore reducing potential injuries or casualties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a585406.pdf|title=Injury Control in the Military|last=Potter|first=Adam|date=2013-04-09|website=Defense Technical Information Center|publisher=US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref>\n\n=== E-SAPI Plates ===\n[[Small Arms Protective Insert|E-SAPI]] (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert) plates and their smaller counterparts E-SBI (Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts) plates, are [[Trauma plate|ceramic trauma plates]] <nowiki/>that provide the bulk of the protection against projectiles when carried in an Improved Outer Tactical Vest, and are also used as part of many other body armors such as the [[Modular Tactical Vest]].  E-SAPI plates are designed to cover the vital front and back torso areas of the torso, while E-SBI plates are designed to protect the sides of the torso. The plate component itself is made of boron carbide, a widely used and extremely hard boron-carbon ceramic.  Backing the plate is a layer of Spectra, a woven polymer material with extremely high tensile strength meant to stop any projectile that manages to pass through the ceramic strikeface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/Armor-Piercing-Myths-10-9-2011.asp|title=Armor Piercing Myths|website=www.strategypage.com|access-date=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\nWhen a bullet strikes the E-SAPI plate, the kinetic energy is dispersed throughout the ceramic layer, and the majority of military rounds in common use are stopped or broken up.  If the bullet continues through the boron carbide layer, the Spectra backing either stops the bullet, or, if the bullet was powerful enough, allows the bullet to pass through into the IOTV itself, and likely the wearer.  Even in the event of the E-SAPI plate failing to prevent penetration, the velocity and energy of the penetrating round is oftentimes reduced to the point where the resulting wound is non lethal.  E-SAPI plates are manufactured by Armorworks Enterprises, Ceradyne, Simula, and BAE Systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/Portals/105/PdMICE/Docs/PI%20Sheets/ESAPI%20PI%20Sheet%20%20Dec%202014.pdf|title=ESAPI PI Sheet|last=|first=|date=December 2014|website=Marine Corps Systems Command|publisher=United States Marine Corps|access-date=2016-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125184254/http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/Portals/105/PdMICE/Docs/PI%20Sheets/ESAPI%20PI%20Sheet%20%20Dec%202014.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDurability standards are high for E-SAPI plates, with Army requirements on environmental condition testing involving the plates being kept 6 hours at both a high temperature and a low temperature in addition to being dropped twice among a variety of other requirements.

This debate was heightened by controversy over [[Dragon Skin]], produced by the now defunct [[Pinnacle Armor]].  Various claims surfaced that Dragon Skin was more effective at protecting soldiers than the then standard issue Interceptor body armor system, with independent studies and reports seeming to back these claims, eventually leading to multiple congressional members asking for further evaluation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18720550/ns/nbc_nightly_news_with_brian_williams-nbc_news_investigates/t/are-us-soldiers-wearing-best-body-armor/#.V0J9B5ErKUk|title=Are U.S. soldiers wearing the best body armor?|date=2007-05-20|website=msnbc.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>  In response, the military made public testing that showed widespread failures in the testing of the Dragon Skin armor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dailynightly.msnbc.com/2007/05/army_responds_t.html|title=The Daily Nightly - MSNBC.com|website=dailynightly.msnbc.com|access-date=2016-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030539/http://dailynightly.msnbc.com/2007/05/army_responds_t.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Ultimately, Dragon Skin never saw widespread adoption, and many of the perceived shortfalls of the Outer Tactical Vest such as standard of protection or modularity were addressed in the new Improved Outer Tactical Vest and E-SAPI plates.\n\n==Technical details==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Program Executive Office Soldier fields the Improved Outer Tactical Vest, upgraded body armor, in April 2007.jpg\n|caption1=U.S. soldier showcasing the IOTV for PEO Soldier in April 2007.\n|image2=Hires 080217-F-3873G-169-1- - Copy.jpg\n|caption2=A soldier from the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] wears an Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) with a groin protector in Iraq in February 2008.}}\n\nA size Medium IOTV weighs {{convert|3.6|lbs}},<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kdhdefensesystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/iotv-iii.pdf|title=IOTV-III Sales Sheet|website=kdhdefensesystems.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref> less than a Medium OTV vest, while providing more coverage.  However, a fully equipped IOTV, complete with all its components (soft armor panel inserts, four ballistic plate inserts (front and back plates and two side plates), collar, and groin protectors) still weighs {{convert|30|lbs}}, with a Large IOTV weighing about {{convert|35|lbs}}. The functionality of the enhanced side ballistic inserts, which provide coverage under the arms and down the sides of the torso, is built into the IOTV.\n\nThe IOTV provides the ability to don the vest in two ways. The first is to simply place the vest over the head and pull down, and the second is to remove fasteners on the wearer's left shoulder, sliding into the vest to the right. To complete the procedure for both methods the wearer then lifts up the front panel of the vest and fastens the waistband, which takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders somewhat, and then fastens the side protection modules.\n\nA key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/04/02/2497-army-to-field-improved-body-armor/ Army to Field Improved Body Armor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to a casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor.\n\nIt also features a grid of [[PALS webbing]] on the front, back, and sides for the attachment of modular pouches and accessories such as neck and throat protection, groin protection, or deltoid protection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.military.com/equipment/improved-outer-tactical-vest-iotv|title=Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV)|last=Harper|first=John|website=Military.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\n===Female model===\nIn response to the large numbers of female soldiers in the army, a female-specific version of the IOTV (F-IOTV) was developed.  Previously, standard tactical vests were issued to women in combat. Army soldiers found that women's movement was restricted, in ways such as bending over, getting in and out of tight spaces, or positioning their rifles against their shoulders.  The long armor plates inside the vests would also rub against their hips and cut into their thighs when they sat down.  Development of a model for women began in 2009.  After much testing and measurements, the Army came up with a vest that is shorter to accommodate smaller torsos and has tailoring to fit closer to women's chests. The new vest eliminates gaps between the material and the body and can be fitted with smaller side ballistic inserts for small waist sizes.  The vest has a lighter feel because it doesn\u2019t rest on the female soldier's shoulders like the male vest.  The first female soldier vests were given to soldiers deploying for Afghanistan in September 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/87464/|title=Deploying Soldiers test new female body armor prototype {{!}} Article {{!}} The United States Army|last=Service|first=Donna Miles, American Forces Press|website=www.army.mil|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nNearly all modern military body armor is designed to prevent penetration from bullets to vital areas of the body, in addition to protection against knives and fragmentation from explosives.  Typically this is accomplished through both highly durable woven synthetic fibers such as [[Kevlar]] or [[Dyneema]], and either metal or ceramic trauma plates.  The IOTV is the standard issue torso protection component to the United States Army.\n\nThe IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide significant ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear if using the older [[Small Arms Protective Insert|SAPI]] plates (NIJ standard III).  Use of the new [[E-SAPI]] plates increase protection to armor-piercing versions of the aforementioned rounds in addition to .30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]]) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9&nbsp;mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400&nbsp;ft/s (426&nbsp;m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525&nbsp;ft/s (465&nbsp;m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525&nbsp;ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified as this is primarily a law enforcement standard.\n\nThe modular design of the vest allows greater tactical flexibility in regards to different situations faced by ground troops.  A US Army medical research report concluded that greater modular design leads to the ability to find a more effective balance between projectile protection and the physical endurance of the soldier, preventing losses in agility and mobility, and therefore reducing potential injuries or casualties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a585406.pdf|title=Injury Control in the Military|last=Potter|first=Adam|date=2013-04-09|website=Defense Technical Information Center|publisher=US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref>\n\n=== E-SAPI Plates ===\n[[Small Arms Protective Insert|E-SAPI]] (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert) plates and their smaller counterparts E-SBI (Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts) plates, are [[Trauma plate|ceramic trauma plates]] <nowiki/>that provide the bulk of the protection against projectiles when carried in an Improved Outer Tactical Vest, and are also used as part of many other body armors such as the [[Modular Tactical Vest]].  E-SAPI plates are designed to cover the vital front and back torso areas of the torso, while E-SBI plates are designed to protect the sides of the torso. The plate component itself is made of boron carbide, a widely used and extremely hard boron-carbon ceramic.  Backing the plate is a layer of Spectra, a woven polymer material with extremely high tensile strength meant to stop any projectile that manages to pass through the ceramic strikeface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/Armor-Piercing-Myths-10-9-2011.asp|title=Armor Piercing Myths|website=www.strategypage.com|access-date=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\nWhen a bullet strikes the E-SAPI plate, the kinetic energy is dispersed throughout the ceramic layer, and the majority of military rounds in common use are stopped or broken up.  If the bullet continues through the boron carbide layer, the Spectra backing either stops the bullet, or, if the bullet was powerful enough, allows the bullet to pass through into the IOTV itself, and likely the wearer.  Even in the event of the E-SAPI plate failing to prevent penetration, the velocity and energy of the penetrating round is oftentimes reduced to the point where the resulting wound is non lethal.  E-SAPI plates are manufactured by Armorworks Enterprises, Ceradyne, Simula, and BAE Systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/Portals/105/PdMICE/Docs/PI%20Sheets/ESAPI%20PI%20Sheet%20%20Dec%202014.pdf|title=ESAPI PI Sheet|last=|first=|date=December 2014|website=Marine Corps Systems Command|publisher=United States Marine Corps|access-date=2016-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125184254/http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/Portals/105/PdMICE/Docs/PI%20Sheets/ESAPI%20PI%20Sheet%20%20Dec%202014.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDurability standards are high for E-SAPI plates, with Army requirements on environmental condition testing involving the plates being kept 6 hours at both a high temperature and a low temperature in addition to being dropped twice among a variety of other requirements.  USSOCOM requirements are even more stringent, involving 24 hours at high and low temperatures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dodig.mil/Inspections/IE/Reports/FINAL%20REPORT-%20DoD%20Testing%20Requirements%20for%20Body%20Armor-Reduced.pdf|title=Final Report-Testing Requirements For Body Armor|last=Granetto|first=Paul|date=January 29, 2009|website=Department of Defense Inspections|publisher=Department of Defense|access-date=May 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212004406/http://www.dodig.mil/Inspections/IE/Reports/FINAL%20REPORT-%20DoD%20Testing%20Requirements%20for%20Body%20Armor-Reduced.pdf|archive-date=February 12, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhile E-SAPI plates do hold significant defensive advantages over the preceding SAPI plates, the increased protection comes at the cost of increased weight and significantly increased cost.

The MBAV and SPCS do provide less soft body armor coverage, but are lighter than the IOTV, thus more suitable for patrol in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/02/11/army-plans-to-field-new-protective-vest-armored-shirt-in-2019.html|title=Army Plans to Field New Protective Vest, Armored Shirt in 2019|last=Sweeney|first=Heather|website=Military.com|language=en|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> The Army plans to introduce the torso and extremity protection (TEP) system beginning in 2018, which includes a modular scalable vest, ballistic combat shirt, blast pelvic protection system, and battle belt to reduce overall weight from {{convert|26|to|21|lb|kg|abbr=on}} while maintaining coverage by reducing excess bulk.<ref>[https://www.armytimes.com/articles/deploying-soldiers-could-see-lighter-body-armor-by-2018 Deploying soldiers could see lighter body armor by 2018] - Armytimes.com, 16 April 2017</ref>\n\n== Users ==\n* {{USA}}: U.S. Army<ref>http://www.tactical-life.com/news/iotv-body-armor-improved-outer-tactical-vest/</ref><ref>https://2002-2009-fpc.state.gov/88477.htm</ref>\n* {{UKR}}: Nearly a thousand vests purchased by Ukraine from private owners between 2014 and 2016, and utilized by Ukrainian soldiers involved in combating the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modular Tactical Vest]]\n*[[PRU-70]]\n*[[Dragon Skin]]\n*[[Osprey body armour|Osprey body armor]]\n*[[Soldier Plate Carrier System]]\n*[[Gold Flex]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.army.mil/article/2497/army-to-field-improved-body-armor/ ''Army to Field Improved Body Armor''] at United States Army Official Homepage\n*[https://www.hardshell.ae/wpcproduct/tactical-vest-operator/ ''Tactical Vest Outer''] Outer Tactical Vest - Body Armor\n\n{{commons category|Improved Outer Tactical Vest}}\n\n{{US Army uniforms}}\n\n[[Category:Ballistic vests]]\n[[Category:Military equipment of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improved_Outer_Tactical_Vest"}

Bill Hodges, a recently retired detective from the local police department living the life of a retiree, receives a letter from an individual claiming to be the person responsible for the job fair incident, referring to himself as \"Mr. Mercedes.\" Hodges is divorced, lonely, and fed up with his life, occasionally considering [[suicide]]. The incident had taken place at the end of Hodges' career and was still unresolved when he retired. Mr. Mercedes knows details of the murder and also mentions Olivia Trelawney, from whom he had stolen the Mercedes. Olivia had committed suicide soon after the massacre out of guilt. Hodges is intrigued and starts to investigate the case instead of turning the letter over to his former police colleague, Pete Huntley.\n\nBrady Hartsfield, who is revealed to be Mr. Mercedes, is an emotionally disturbed [[psychopath]] in his late twenties who lost his father at age eight. When he was a young boy, he killed his mentally handicapped brother at his mother's prompting. He now lives and has an incestuous relationship with his alcoholic mother and works in an electronics shop and as an ice-cream seller. Riding in a van, this second job enables him to observe Hodges and Hodges' neighbors, among them seventeen-year-old Jerome Robinson, who does little chores for Hodges.\n\nDuring his research about the wealthy Olivia Trelawney, Hodges meets her sister Janey, who hires him to investigate Olivia's suicide and the stealing of the Mercedes. Shortly after Hodges begins to work for Janey, the two begin dating. Hodges finds out, with the help of bright, computer savvy Jerome, how Mr. Mercedes stole the car and then drove Olivia (whom he made contact with through his job at the electronics shop) to suicide by leaving eerie sound files on her computer that were set to go off at unpredictable intervals, which worked on her feelings of guilt. Olivia, when hearing these sounds, believed them to be the ghosts of the victims of the Mercedes Massacre. At the funeral of Janey and Olivia's recently deceased mother, Hodges meets Janey's unpleasant relatives, among them Janey's emotionally unstable cousin Holly. After the funeral, Mr. Mercedes blows up Hodges' car, not realizing that Hodges wasn't in it. However, Janey was, and she is killed in the explosion. Hodges feels remorse but becomes even more eager to solve the case without the help of the police. Holly joins Hodges and Jerome in the investigation.\n\nHartsfield accidentally kills his mother with a poisoned hamburger, which he had prepared for Jerome's dog. With her rotting body in their house, he plans to kill himself by blowing himself up at a giant concert for young girls by feigning the need for a wheelchair and utilizing explosives hidden inside the wheelchair. Jerome, Hodges, and Holly manage to uncover Hartsfield's real identity and search his computer hard drives. They eventually deduce that Hartsfield's target is the concert, and the trio rush to the concert venue to stop him. Hodges begins to suffer a heart attack and is unable to venture into the concert with Holly and Jerome, but urges them to press on. Holly locates Hartsfield and delivers several harsh blows to his head using Hodges's \"Happy Slapper\" \u2013 a sock filled with ball bearings. Hartsfield is left bleeding and unconscious on the concert floor.\n\nHodges (who had been saved by concert staff), Holly, and Jerome have a picnic to discuss the recently transpired events. Hodges has learned that he will not be criminally charged for his actions regarding the Hartsfield investigation. They have received a medal from the city, congratulating them on their work. Hartsfield wakes up in the hospital, asking for his mother.\n\n== Main characters ==\n*'''Kermit William \"Bill\" Hodges''' \u2013 The main protagonist and a retired detective.

King will be King, and he\u2019s never less than scary. Who in their right mind would want him to be?\" and noted that this is one of his books where instead of it being \"horrific, King expresses outright tenderness and it\u2019s evident here.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/stephen-king-new-thriller-mr-mercedes-article-1.1803803|title=Book review: Stephen King's new thriller 'Mr. Mercedes'|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTasha Robinson of [[The A.V. Club]] was more reserved, writing that the novel opens with its best moment and \"sags significantly in the middle, but it barrels toward a memorable conclusion \u2026 his tense, propulsive, ultra-fast-paced climax here seems like it was written with the movie in mind\". Her main complaint was \"a collection of laughably creaky old tropes at the center \u2026 a halfhearted stop at Se\u00f1or Lazy\u2019s Bargain Clich\u00e9 Bin \u2026 predictable King-isms \u2026 a cutout character following a well-worn path\".
