He is among the most notable Slavicists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the first to prepare complete monographs on the history of [[Polish language]] and [[Polish culture|culture]]. He published more than 1,500 titles and discovered the oldest extant prose text in Polish (the ''[[Holy Cross Sermons]]'').\n\n==Life==\nBr\u00fcckner was born in [[Berezhany|Brze\u017cany (Berezhany)]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Austrian Empire]], to an Austro-Polish family who had moved there from [[Stryi|Stryj]] three generations earlier. He studied at the German Gymnasium in [[Lw\u00f3w|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w)]] under Omelian Ohonovsky, in [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] under [[Franz Miklosich]], and in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] under [[Vatroslav Jagi\u0107]]. Br\u00fcckner first taught at Lemberg ([[Lw\u00f3w University]]).  In 1876 he received a [[doctorate]] at the University of Vienna, and in 1878 his [[habilitation]] for a study on Slavic settlements around [[Magdeburg]] (''Die slawischen Aussiedlungen in der Altmark und im Magdeburgischen''). In 1881 he received professorship at the Berlin Universary, where he long held (1881\u20131924) the chair in Slavic Philology. He received funds for travel and  studies from his University and he resided in Berlin continuously for 58 years until his death. He was a member of many learned societies, including the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], the [[Imperial Academy of Sciences|Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]], the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] in Lemberg, and the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], as well as academies in [[Prague]] and [[Belgrade]].\n\nBr\u00fcckner wrote extensively in both [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[German language|German]] on the history of the [[Slavic languages]] and literature, on folklore, ancient Slavic and [[Baltic mythology]], and on the history of Polish and Russian literature. His most important works include a history of the Polish language (Lemberg, 1906), several histories of Polish literature in Polish and German, a history of Russian literature, an [[etymological dictionary]] of the Polish language (''[[S\u0142ownik etymologiczny j\u0119zyka polskiego]]'', 1927), works on Slavic and Baltic mythology, an encyclopedia of Old Poland, and a 4-volume history of Polish culture (Krak\u00f3w, 1930\u201346). Br\u00fcckner was a specialist on the older periods of Polish and Slavic culture and was the discoverer, interpreter, and publisher of the oldest known manuscript in Polish, the ''[[Holy Cross Sermons]]''. He had an incomparable knowledge of medieval Polish literature, which he knew from the original manuscripts, and was an expert on Renaissance and early modern Polish literature.\n\nIn general, Br\u00fcckner tried to raise the prestige of old Slavic culture both in the eyes of the Germans among whom he worked and in the eyes of the Poles with whom he sympathized. He was critical of the Russian autocracy and the centralized Russian state of his time, including the Russian liberals ([[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]]) who supported a centralized state and opposed either federalism or national autonomy for the non-Russian peoples of the Russian Empire. During the [[First World War]], he favored the [[Central Powers]] but opposed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], which he believed was largely directed against a resurgent Poland and, moreover, made deep concessions to the [[Ukrainians]] in his native eastern Galicia. It was, however, scholarship, not politics, which always remained his main concern.\n\nOn the most central questions of Slavic scholarship, he believed that in ancient times the Slavic and Baltic languages had a common ancestor and he always stressed this common Balto-Slavic bond. He placed the original homeland of the Slavs farther west than most Slavists, on the territory of today's Poland. He believed that the apostles to the Slavs, [[Cyril and Methodius]], had originated the idea of their mission on their own, and he played down the invitation from [[Moravia]]; and finally, in a polemic with the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], he took a Normanist position on the origins of the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], stressing the linguistic and historical evidence for a Scandinavian connection.\n\nIn 1924, he retired from the university and spent most of his time writing concise histories of Polish culture and language, especially of the Old Polish period. After his death in Berlin, his final book, a short German-language synthetic history of Polish culture, went unpublished.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Aleksander Br\u00fcckner 1856-1939'' ed.

It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with Highway 97C East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], Highway 97C Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], Highway 5A North to [[Kamloops]], Highway 5 South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and Highway 5 North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as [[Indo-Canadians]], they continue to play a crucial part in the economy\u2014Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=SFU Archives|url=http://aabc.bc.ca/access/aabc/archbc/display/SFU-143}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kamloops/democracy-watch-calls-for-audit-after-voting-mix-ups-1.3270400|title=Democracy Watch calls for audit after voting mix-ups - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n[[File:Merritt-panorama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Merritt in winter]]\nMerritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale. The Bench is a residential mountain bench, hence the name, sited on the northwest side of the valley. Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: [[Merritt Bench Elementary School|Bench Elementary]], [[Collettville Elementary School|Collettville Elementary and French Immersion]], [[Merritt Central Elementary School|Central Elementary]], [[Diamond Vale Elementary School|Diamond Vale Elementary]]. Also, a high school, [[Merritt Secondary School]], that services the area. The main office for [[School District 58 Nicola-Similkameen]], which operates the schools in the area, is also located in Merritt. The town is also served by the [[Nicola Valley Museum and Archives]].\n\n== Commerce and industry ==\n\nToday, [[ranching]], [[farming]], [[forestry]], [[transport]]ation and [[tourism]] are the primary [[industry|industries]]. Merritt is the nearest large community to the [[Douglas Lake Cattle Company]], Canada's largest working cattle ranch.\n\nMerritt was once host to an annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] that is estimated to have drawn as many as 148,000 people at its peak in the summer of 2005. The Mountain Music Festival, combined with the development of the Merritt Walk of Stars - a display of bronzed handprints of Mountainfest artists placed around the community - the Mural Project, designed by artist [[Michelle Loughery]]{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} , the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, Music in the Square and in the Park along with other tourism development activities have been used to solidify the city's branding as the Country Music Capital of Canada.\n\nMerritt's prime location has provided the opportunity to host many events, the West Coast Rally Association's Pacific Forest Rally, an off-road rally conducted as part of the Canadian Rally Championship series every October, also the annual winter Thunderbird Rally often begins and ends in Merritt. The Bass Coast Festival held annually on the BC Day weekend and supports electronic music and creative arts draws attendees from all over North America. The annual Labour Day Rodeo and Fall Fair are long standing traditions in this ranching valley, drawing participants from all over Canada and the US.\n\n== Merritt on film ==\n\nMerritt provided the backdrop for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated movie ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120255/locations|title=Filming Locations for The Sweet Hereafter|publisher=The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> The debut episode of ''[[Smallville]]'' was partly filmed on location in Merritt. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'' and the 2006 remake of ''[[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' were also filmed partly in the area. In 2013 ''[[Shana: The Wolf's Music]]'' directed by Nino Jacusso was released, it is a drama about a First Nations girl coming of age set in a First Nations location. The Nicola Valley is also host to the shooting of numerous commercials. Merritt is a member of the Thompson-Nicola Film Commission, which is a full-time, full service film commission representing the Thompson Nicola Regional District.\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe Merritt Mountain Music Festival was an outdoor music festival in Merritt. In 2005 the festival hosted a record-breaking attendance of approximately 148,000 people throughout the six-day event. Over the years it has hosted country stars such as [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Reba McEntire]], and [[Wynonna Judd]].

It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] North to [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as [[Indo-Canadians]], they continue to play a crucial part in the economy\u2014Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=SFU Archives|url=http://aabc.bc.ca/access/aabc/archbc/display/SFU-143}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kamloops/democracy-watch-calls-for-audit-after-voting-mix-ups-1.3270400|title=Democracy Watch calls for audit after voting mix-ups - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n[[File:Merritt-panorama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Merritt in winter]]\nMerritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale. The Bench is a residential mountain bench, hence the name, sited on the northwest side of the valley. Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: [[Merritt Bench Elementary School|Bench Elementary]], [[Collettville Elementary School|Collettville Elementary and French Immersion]], [[Merritt Central Elementary School|Central Elementary]], [[Diamond Vale Elementary School|Diamond Vale Elementary]].

Nicknamed the '''Empress of the Blues''', she was the most popular female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s.

She sang and danced as he played the guitar. Their favorite location was in front of the White Elephant Saloon at Thirteenth and Elm streets, in the heart of the city's African-American community.\n\nIn 1904, her oldest brother Clarence left home, joining a small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"<ref>Albertson, 2003, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Clarence returned to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and arranged an audition for his sister with the troupe managers, Lonnie and Cora Fisher. Bessie was hired as a dancer rather than a vocalist since the company already included popular singer [[Ma Rainey]]. Contemporary accounts indicate that, while Ma Rainey did not teach Smith to sing, she likely helped her develop a stage presence.<ref>Albertson, 2003, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Smith eventually moved on to performing in [[chorus line]]s, making the \"81\" Theater in [[Atlanta]] her home base. She also performed in shows on the black-owned [[Theater Owners Booking Association]] (T.O.B.A.) circuit and would become one of its major attractions.\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Bessiesmith3.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Smith by Carl Van Vechten]]\nSmith began forming her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theater. By 1920, she had established a reputation in the [[American South|South]] and along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. At the time, sales of over 100,000 copies of \"Crazy Blues,\" recorded for [[Okeh Records]] by the singer [[Mamie Smith]] (no relation), pointed to a new market. The recording industry had not directed its product to black people, but the success of the record led to a search for female blues singers. \n\nHoping to capitalize on this new market, Smith's began her recording career in 1923.<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books |location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=978-1-85868-255-6}}</ref> Bessie Smith was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1923 by [[Frank Buckley Walker|Frank Walker]], a talent agent who had seen her perform years earlier. Her first session for Columbia was on February 15, 1923; it was engineered by [[Dan Hornsby]]. For most of 1923, her records were issued on Columbia's regular A-series. When the company established a \"[[race records]]\" series, Smith's \"Cemetery Blues\" (September 26, 1923) was the first issued. Both sides of her first record, \"[[Downhearted Blues]]\" backed with \"Gulf Coast Blues\", were hits (an earlier recording of \"Downhearted Blues\" by its co-writer [[Alberta Hunter]] had previously been released by [[Paramount Records]]).<ref>Lieb, Sandra R.

She once auditioned for Black Swan records ([[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was on its board of directors) and was dismissed because she was considered too rough, she supposedly stopped singing to spit.<ref name=\"Women and Rhetoric 2013\"/> In fact, even her admirers, white and black, considered her a \"rough\" (i.e., working class or even \"low class\") woman.\n\nSmith had a strong [[contralto]] voice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmusic.net/legends-series/bessie-smith-the-empress-of-the-blues/|title=Bessie Smith: The Empress Of The Blues|website=World Music Network|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref> which recorded well from her first session, which was conducted when recordings were made acoustically. The advent of electrical recording made the power of her voice even more evident. Her first electrical recording was \"Cake Walking Babies [From Home]\", recorded on May 5, 1925.<ref>Albertson, Chris. CD booklet. ''Bessie Smith, The Complete Recordings Vol. 2''. Columbia COL 468767 2.</ref> Smith also benefited from the new technology of radio broadcasting, even on stations in the segregated South. For example, after giving a concert to a white-only audience at a theater in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in October 1923, she performed a late-night concert on station WMC, which was well received by the radio audience.<ref>\"Hit on Radio\", ''Chicago Defender'', October 6, 1923, p. 8.</ref>\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Bessie Smith - Alexander's Ragtime Band 1927 - Sample.ogg|title=\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" (1927)|description=A sample of Bessie Smith's 1927 cover of \"[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]].\"|pos=right|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nShe made 160 recordings for Columbia, often accompanied by the finest musicians of the day, notably [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[James P.

She never stopped performing, however. The days of elaborate vaudeville shows were over, but Smith continued touring and occasionally sang in clubs. In 1929, she appeared in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''Pansy''. The play was a flop; top critics said she was its only asset.\n\n=== ''St. Louis Blues'' ===\n{{further|St. Louis Blues (1929 film)}}\n[[File:St Louis Blues (1929).webm|thumb|thumbtime=396|start=396|end=633|''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', Smith's only film,1929]]\nIn November 1929, Smith made her only film appearance, starring in a [[short film|two-reeler]], ''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', based on [[W. C. Handy]]'s [[St. Louis Blues (song)|song]] of the same name. In the film, directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and shot in [[Astoria, Queens]], she sings the title song accompanied by members of [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra, the Hall Johnson Choir, the pianist [[James P. Johnson]] and a string section\u2014a musical environment radically different from that of any of her recordings.\n\n===Swing era===\nIn 1933, [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who also mentored [[Billie Holiday]], asked Smith to record four sides for Okeh (which had been acquired by Columbia Records in 1925). He claimed to have found her in semi-obscurity, working as a hostess in a speakeasy on Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia.<ref>Hammond, John. ''John Hammond on Record''. p. 120.</ref> Smith worked at Art's Cafe on Ridge Avenue, but not as a hostess and not until the summer of 1936. In 1933, when she made the Okeh sides, she was still touring. Hammond was known for his selective memory and gratuitous embellishments.<ref>Albertson, ''Bessie'', pp. 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nSmith was paid a non-royalty fee of $37.50 for each selection on these Okeh sides, which were her last recordings. Made on November 24, 1933, they serve as a hint of the transformation she made in her performances as she shifted her blues artistry into something that fit the [[swing era]]. The relatively modern accompaniment is notable. The band included such swing era musicians as the [[trombone|trombonist]] [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpeter [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]], the [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Chu Berry]], the pianist Buck Washington, the guitarist Bobby Johnson, and the bassist [[Billy Taylor]]. [[Benny Goodman]], who happened to be recording with [[Ethel Waters]] in the adjoining studio, dropped by and is barely audible on one selection. Hammond was not entirely pleased with the results, preferring to have Smith revisit her old blues sound. \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" and \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)\", both written by [[Wesley Wilson]], were among her most popular recordings.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n== Death ==\n=== Automobile collision ===\n[[File:Death certificate (1).jpg|thumb|right|Smith's [[death certificate]]]]\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was critically injured in a car crash on [[U.S. Route 61]] between [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving, and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.\n\nThe first person on the scene was a Memphis surgeon, Dr. Hugh Smith (no relation). In the early 1970s, Hugh Smith gave a detailed account of his experience to Bessie's biographer [[Chris Albertson]]. This is the most reliable eyewitness testimony about the events surrounding her death.\n\nArriving at the scene, Hugh Smith examined Smith, who was lying in the middle of the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half pint of blood, and immediately noted a major traumatic injury: her right arm was almost completely severed at the elbow.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a2VGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ecMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1073,6477849&dq=theater+owners+booking+association&hl=en|title=Blues Legend Bessie Smith Dead 50 Years|date=September 26, 1987|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Though the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.<ref>Albertson, Chris (1972). ''Bessie: Empress of the Blues''. London: Sphere Books. pp. 192\u2013195. {{ISBN|0-300-09902-9}}.</ref>\n\nHenry Broughton (a fishing partner of Dr. Smith's) helped him move Bessie Smith to the shoulder of the road. Dr. Smith dressed her arm injury with a clean handkerchief and asked Broughton to go to a house about 500 feet off the road to call an ambulance. By the time Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. \n\n=== Second accident ===\nTime passed with no sign of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith suggested that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.<ref>Albertson (1972), p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe young couple in the new car did not have life-threatening injuries. Two ambulances then arrived from Clarksdale\u2014one from the black hospital, summoned by Broughton, the other from the white hospital, acting on a report from the truck driver, who had not seen the accident victims.\n\nBessie Smith was taken to the [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale, Mississippi)|G.&nbsp;T. Thomas Afro-American Hospital]] in Clarksdale, where her right arm was [[amputate]]d. She died that morning without regaining consciousness. After her death, an often repeated but now discredited story emerged that she died because a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] hospital in Clarksdale refused to admit her. The jazz writer and producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] gave this account in an article in the November 1937 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine. The circumstances of Smith's death and the rumor promoted by Hammond formed the basis for [[Edward Albee]]'s 1959 one-act play ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]''.<ref name=Love-1997>{{cite book|last=Love|first=Spencie|title=One Blood: The Death and Resurrection of Charles R.

Her body was originally laid out at Upshur's funeral home. As word of her death spread through Philadelphia's black community, the body had to be moved to the O.V.

During the marriage Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car. Their marriage was stormy with infidelity on both sides, including numerous female lovers for Bessie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Devi|first1=Debra|title=Bessie Smith: Music's Original, Bitchinest Bad Girl|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-devi/bessie-smith_b_1450477.html|accessdate=February 17, 2017|work=HuffPost|date=June 25, 2012}}</ref> Gee was impressed by the money but never adjusted to show business life or to Smith's [[bisexuality]]. In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, [[Gertrude Saunders]], Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce.\n\nSmith later entered a [[common-law marriage]] with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was [[Lionel Hampton]]'s uncle. She stayed with him until her death.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n== Musical themes ==\nSongs like ''Jail House Blues'', ''Work House Blues'', ''Prison Blues'', ''Sing Sing Prison Blues'' and ''Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair'' dealt critically with important issues of the day like the [[chain gang]], the [[convict lease]] system and capital punishment. ''Poor Man's Blues'' and ''Washwoman's Blues'' are widely considered to be an early form of African American protest music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rabaka |first=Reiland |title=Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Movement |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2012 |page=78}}</ref>\n\nWhat becomes evident after listening to her music and studying her lyrics is that Smith emphasized and channeled a subculture within the African American working class. Additionally, she incorporated commentary on social issues like poverty, intra-racial conflict, and female sexuality into her lyrics. Her lyrical sincerity and public behavior were not widely accepted as appropriate expressions for African American women; therefore, her work was often written off as distasteful or unseemly, rather than as an accurate representation of the African-American experience. \n\nSmith's work challenged elitist norms by encouraging working-class women to embrace their right to drink, party, and satisfy their sexual needs as a means of coping with stress and dissatisfaction in their daily lives. Smith advocated for a wider vision of African-American womanhood beyond domesticity, piety, and conformity; she sought empowerment and happiness through independence, sassiness, and sexual freedom.<ref name=\"Women and Rhetoric 2013\"/> Although Smith was a voice for many minority groups and one of the most gifted blues performers of her time, the themes in her music were precocious, which led to many believing that her work was undeserving of serious recognition.\n\n== Hit records ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Single\n!<small>[[Billboard Hot 100|US<br

They altered the apparent [[Key signature|key]] of her performances (sometimes raised or lowered by as much as a [[semitone]]). The \"center hole\" in some of the master recordings had not been in the true middle of the master disc, so that there were wide variations in tone, pitch, key and phrasing, as commercially released records revolved around the spindle.\n\nGiven those historic limitations, the current [[Remaster|digitally remastered]] versions of her work deliver significant improvements in the sound quality of Smith's performances. Some critics believe that the American [[Columbia Records]] compact disc releases are somewhat inferior to subsequent transfers made by the late [[John R. T. Davies]] for [[Frog Records]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/6515486/100-Best-Jazz-Recordings.html |title=100 Best Jazz Recordings |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The popular musical ''Bessie: The Life & Music of Bessie Smith'', by the playwright Douglas M. Parker, follows Smith's rise, personal life and career, incorporating many of the songs that made her famous.\n* ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]'' by [[Edward Albee]] also deals with her.\n* The 1948 short story \"[[Blue Melody]]\", by [[J. D.

She sang and danced as he played the guitar. Their favorite location was in front of the White Elephant Saloon at Thirteenth and Elm streets, in the heart of the city's African-American community.\n\nIn 1904, her oldest brother Clarence left home, joining a small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"<ref>Albertson, 2003, p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn 1912, Clarence returned to Chattanooga with the Stokes troupe and arranged an audition for his sister with the troupe managers, Lonnie and Cora Fisher. Bessie was hired as a dancer rather than a vocalist since the company already included popular singer [[Ma Rainey]]. Contemporary accounts indicate that, while Ma Rainey did not teach Smith to sing, she likely helped her develop a stage presence.<ref>Albertson, 2003, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Smith eventually moved on to performing in [[chorus line]]s, making the \"81\" Theater in [[Atlanta]] her home base. She also performed in shows on the black-owned [[Theater Owners Booking Association]] (T.O.B.A.) circuit and would become one of its major attractions.\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Bessiesmith3.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Smith by Carl Van Vechten]]\nSmith began forming her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theater. By 1920, she had established a reputation in the [[American South|South]] and along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. At the time, sales of over 100,000 copies of \"Crazy Blues,\" recorded for [[Okeh Records]] by the singer [[Mamie Smith]] (no relation), pointed to a new market. The recording industry had not directed its product to black people, but the success of the record led to a search for female blues singers. \n\nHoping to capitalize on this new market, Smith's began her recording career in 1923.<ref name=\"Russell\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books |location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=978-1-85868-255-6}}</ref> Bessie Smith was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1923 by [[Frank Buckley Walker|Frank Walker]], a talent agent who had seen her perform years earlier. Her first session for Columbia was on February 15, 1923; it was engineered by [[Dan Hornsby]]. For most of 1923, her records were issued on Columbia's regular A-series. When the company established a \"[[race records]]\" series, Smith's \"Cemetery Blues\" (September 26, 1923) was the first issued. Both sides of her first record, \"[[Downhearted Blues]]\" backed with \"Gulf Coast Blues\", were hits (an earlier recording of \"Downhearted Blues\" by its co-writer [[Alberta Hunter]] had previously been released by [[Paramount Records]]).<ref>Lieb, Sandra R.

Columbia COL 468767 2.</ref> Smith also benefited from the new technology of radio broadcasting, even on stations in the segregated South. For example, after giving a concert to a white-only audience at a theater in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in October 1923, she performed a late-night concert on station WMC, which was well received by the radio audience.<ref>\"Hit on Radio\", ''Chicago Defender'', October 6, 1923, p. 8.</ref>\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Bessie Smith - Alexander's Ragtime Band 1927 - Sample.ogg|title=\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" (1927)|description=A sample of Bessie Smith's 1927 cover of \"[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]].\"|pos=right|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nShe made 160 recordings for Columbia, often accompanied by the finest musicians of the day, notably [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[James P.

She never stopped performing, however. The days of elaborate vaudeville shows were over, but Smith continued touring and occasionally sang in clubs. In 1929, she appeared in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''Pansy''. The play was a flop; top critics said she was its only asset.\n\n=== ''St. Louis Blues'' ===\n{{further|St. Louis Blues (1929 film)}}\n[[File:St Louis Blues (1929).webm|thumb|thumbtime=396|start=396|end=633|''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', Smith's only film,1929]]\nIn November 1929, Smith made her only film appearance, starring in a [[short film|two-reeler]], ''[[St. Louis Blues (1929 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', based on [[W. C. Handy]]'s [[St. Louis Blues (song)|song]] of the same name. In the film, directed by [[Dudley Murphy]] and shot in [[Astoria, Queens]], she sings the title song accompanied by members of [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s orchestra, the Hall Johnson Choir, the pianist [[James P. Johnson]] and a string section\u2014a musical environment radically different from that of any of her recordings.\n\n===Swing era===\nIn 1933, [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who also mentored [[Billie Holiday]], asked Smith to record four sides for Okeh (which had been acquired by Columbia Records in 1925). He claimed to have found her in semi-obscurity, working as a hostess in a speakeasy on Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia.<ref>Hammond, John. ''John Hammond on Record''. p. 120.</ref> Smith worked at Art's Cafe on Ridge Avenue, but not as a hostess and not until the summer of 1936. In 1933, when she made the Okeh sides, she was still touring. Hammond was known for his selective memory and gratuitous embellishments.<ref>Albertson, ''Bessie'', pp. 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nSmith was paid a non-royalty fee of $37.50 for each selection on these Okeh sides, which were her last recordings. Made on November 24, 1933, they serve as a hint of the transformation she made in her performances as she shifted her blues artistry into something that fit the [[swing era]]. The relatively modern accompaniment is notable. The band included such swing era musicians as the [[trombone|trombonist]] [[Jack Teagarden]], the trumpeter [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]], the [[tenor saxophone|tenor saxophonist]] [[Chu Berry]], the pianist Buck Washington, the guitarist Bobby Johnson, and the bassist [[Billy Taylor]]. [[Benny Goodman]], who happened to be recording with [[Ethel Waters]] in the adjoining studio, dropped by and is barely audible on one selection. Hammond was not entirely pleased with the results, preferring to have Smith revisit her old blues sound. \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" and \"Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer)\", both written by [[Wesley Wilson]], were among her most popular recordings.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n== Death ==\n=== Automobile collision ===\n[[File:Death certificate (1).jpg|thumb|right|Smith's [[death certificate]]]]\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was critically injured in a car crash on [[U.S. Route 61]] between [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]]. Her lover, Richard Morgan, was driving, and misjudged the speed of a slow-moving truck ahead of him. Tire marks at the scene suggested that Morgan tried to avoid the truck by driving around its left side, but he hit the rear of the truck side-on at high speed. The tailgate of the truck sheared off the wooden roof of Smith's old Packard. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, probably with her right arm or elbow out the window, took the full brunt of the impact. Morgan escaped without injuries.\n\nThe first person on the scene was a Memphis surgeon, Dr. Hugh Smith (no relation). In the early 1970s, Hugh Smith gave a detailed account of his experience to Bessie's biographer [[Chris Albertson]]. This is the most reliable eyewitness testimony about the events surrounding her death.\n\nArriving at the scene, Hugh Smith examined Smith, who was lying in the middle of the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half pint of blood, and immediately noted a major traumatic injury: her right arm was almost completely severed at the elbow.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a2VGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ecMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1073,6477849&dq=theater+owners+booking+association&hl=en|title=Blues Legend Bessie Smith Dead 50 Years|date=September 26, 1987|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=November 16, 2010}}</ref> He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Though the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.<ref>Albertson, Chris (1972). ''Bessie: Empress of the Blues''. London: Sphere Books. pp. 192\u2013195. {{ISBN|0-300-09902-9}}.</ref>\n\nHenry Broughton (a fishing partner of Dr. Smith's) helped him move Bessie Smith to the shoulder of the road. Dr. Smith dressed her arm injury with a clean handkerchief and asked Broughton to go to a house about 500 feet off the road to call an ambulance. By the time Broughton returned, about 25 minutes later, Bessie Smith was in shock. \n\n=== Second accident ===\nTime passed with no sign of the ambulance, so Hugh Smith suggested that they take her into Clarksdale in his car. He and Broughton had almost finished clearing the back seat when they heard the sound of a car approaching at high speed. Smith flashed his lights in warning, but the oncoming car failed to stop and plowed into his car at full speed. It sent his car careening into Bessie Smith's overturned Packard, completely wrecking it. The oncoming car ricocheted off Hugh Smith's car into the ditch on the right, barely missing Broughton and Bessie Smith.<ref>Albertson (1972), p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe young couple in the new car did not have life-threatening injuries. Two ambulances then arrived from Clarksdale\u2014one from the black hospital, summoned by Broughton, the other from the white hospital, acting on a report from the truck driver, who had not seen the accident victims.\n\nBessie Smith was taken to the [[Riverside Hotel (Clarksdale, Mississippi)|G.&nbsp;T. Thomas Afro-American Hospital]] in Clarksdale, where her right arm was [[amputate]]d. She died that morning without regaining consciousness. After her death, an often repeated but now discredited story emerged that she died because a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] hospital in Clarksdale refused to admit her. The jazz writer and producer [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] gave this account in an article in the November 1937 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine. The circumstances of Smith's death and the rumor promoted by Hammond formed the basis for [[Edward Albee]]'s 1959 one-act play ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]''.<ref name=Love-1997>{{cite book|last=Love|first=Spencie|title=One Blood: The Death and Resurrection of Charles R.

During the marriage Smith became the highest-paid black entertainer of the day, heading her own shows, which sometimes featured as many as 40 troupers, and touring in her own custom-built railroad car. Their marriage was stormy with infidelity on both sides, including numerous female lovers for Bessie.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Devi|first1=Debra|title=Bessie Smith: Music's Original, Bitchinest Bad Girl|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-devi/bessie-smith_b_1450477.html|accessdate=February 17, 2017|work=HuffPost|date=June 25, 2012}}</ref> Gee was impressed by the money but never adjusted to show business life or to Smith's [[bisexuality]]. In 1929, when she learned of his affair with another singer, [[Gertrude Saunders]], Smith ended the relationship, although neither of them sought a divorce.\n\nSmith later entered a [[common-law marriage]] with an old friend, Richard Morgan, who was [[Lionel Hampton]]'s uncle. She stayed with him until her death.<ref name=Albertson2003 />\n\n== Musical themes ==\nSongs like ''Jail House Blues'', ''Work House Blues'', ''Prison Blues'', ''Sing Sing Prison Blues'' and ''Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair'' dealt critically with important issues of the day like the [[chain gang]], the [[convict lease]] system and capital punishment. ''Poor Man's Blues'' and ''Washwoman's Blues'' are widely considered to be an early form of African American protest music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rabaka |first=Reiland |title=Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the Hip Hop Movement |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2012 |page=78}}</ref>\n\nWhat becomes evident after listening to her music and studying her lyrics is that Smith emphasized and channeled a subculture within the African American working class. Additionally, she incorporated commentary on social issues like poverty, intra-racial conflict, and female sexuality into her lyrics. Her lyrical sincerity and public behavior were not widely accepted as appropriate expressions for African American women; therefore, her work was often written off as distasteful or unseemly, rather than as an accurate representation of the African-American experience. \n\nSmith's work challenged elitist norms by encouraging working-class women to embrace their right to drink, party, and satisfy their sexual needs as a means of coping with stress and dissatisfaction in their daily lives. Smith advocated for a wider vision of African-American womanhood beyond domesticity, piety, and conformity; she sought empowerment and happiness through independence, sassiness, and sexual freedom.<ref name=\"Women and Rhetoric 2013\"/> Although Smith was a voice for many minority groups and one of the most gifted blues performers of her time, the themes in her music were precocious, which led to many believing that her work was undeserving of serious recognition.\n\n== Hit records ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Single\n!<small>[[Billboard Hot 100|US<br

They altered the apparent [[Key signature|key]] of her performances (sometimes raised or lowered by as much as a [[semitone]]). The \"center hole\" in some of the master recordings had not been in the true middle of the master disc, so that there were wide variations in tone, pitch, key and phrasing, as commercially released records revolved around the spindle.\n\nGiven those historic limitations, the current [[Remaster|digitally remastered]] versions of her work deliver significant improvements in the sound quality of Smith's performances. Some critics believe that the American [[Columbia Records]] compact disc releases are somewhat inferior to subsequent transfers made by the late [[John R. T. Davies]] for [[Frog Records]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/6515486/100-Best-Jazz-Recordings.html |title=100 Best Jazz Recordings |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n* The popular musical ''Bessie: The Life & Music of Bessie Smith'', by the playwright Douglas M. Parker, follows Smith's rise, personal life and career, incorporating many of the songs that made her famous.\n* ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]'' by [[Edward Albee]] also deals with her.\n* The 1948 short story \"[[Blue Melody]]\", by [[J. D. Salinger]], and the 1959 play ''[[The Death of Bessie Smith]]'', by [[Edward Albee]], are based on Smith's life and death, but poetic license was taken by both authors; for instance, Albee's play distorts the circumstances of her medical treatment, or lack of it, before her death, attributing it to racist medical practitioners.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n* ''Bessie's Back in Town'', a musical in production by Barry Edelson, presents as accurately as possible aspects of her life and death, while remaining true to her music.<ref>{{YouTube|JWvtE4Z2Dzs|\"Bessie's Back in Town: The Bessie Smith Story\"}}</ref>\n* The song ''Bessie'', sung by [[Patricia Kaas]] on the 1990 album [[Sc\u00e8ne de vie]], is about Smith's death.\n* The playwright [[Angelo Parra]] wrote the 2001 musical ''The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith'', with [[Miche Braden]] in the title role.\n* In the video game series ''[[BioShock (series)|BioShock]]'' ([[BioShock|1]] and [[BioShock 2|2]]), Smith is portrayed as a cameo of a character by the name of Grace Holloway. Smith's music can be heard during the loading screen and in the level Paupers Drop, and in the various hallways and rooms of the sunken city. Her 1929 song \"I'm Wild About That Thing\" is ([[anachronism|anachronistically]]) included in the sequel, ''[[BioShock: Infinite]]'', set in 1912.\n* HBO released a movie about Smith, ''[[Bessie (film)|Bessie]]'', starring [[Queen Latifah]], on May 16, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/01/08/bessie-starring-queen-latifah-to-premiere-this-spring-on-hbo/348055/ |title='Bessie' Starring Queen Latifah to Premiere This Spring on HBO \u2013 Ratings |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com |date= January 8, 2015|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n*\"Bessie Smith\", a song by the [[The Band|Band]], is about her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/bessie_smith_viney.html|title=Peter Viney on 'Bessie Smith'|website=Theband.hiof.no|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n* Each June, the Bessie Smith Cultural Center in Chattanooga sponsors the Bessie Smith Strut as part of the city's [[Riverbend Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bessiesmithcc.org/event/bessie-smith-strut-3/ |title= Bessie Smith Strut |website=Bessiesmithcc.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chattanooga.events/event/bessie-smith-strut-2/ |title= Chattanooga Events-Bessie Smith Strut|website=Chattanooga.events |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n* The NBC show ''[[Timeless (TV series)|Timeless]]'' features Bessie Smith briefly in the season 2 episode \"The King of the Delta Blues\".\n* Her 1933 recording \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" was featured prominently in the 1981 film ''[[Rich and Famous (1981 film)|Rich and Famous]]''.\n*In the tv-series [[New Amsterdam (2018 TV series)|New Amsterdam]] (season 2, episode 16) Dr Reynolds, an African Americans [[Chief Surgeon|chief surgeron]], tells  he decided to become a doctor when learning that Bessie Smith had died after being refused treatment in an all-white hospital.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Chris Albertson|Albertson, Chris]] (1991).

There is no indigenous term for the language; however linguists have adopted the term ''Paamese'' to refer to it. Both a grammar and a dictionary of Paamese have been produced by [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]].\n\n==Classification==\nPaamese is an [[Austronesian language]] of Vanuatu. It is most closely related to [[Southeast Ambrym language|the language]] of Southeastern [[Ambrym]]. The two languages, while sharing 60-70% of the lexical cognate, are not [[mutually intelligible]].\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Paamamap.png|thumb|250px|Paama, neighbouring islands and main centres]]\nPaama itself is a small island in the [[Malampa Province]]. The island is no more than 5&nbsp;km wide and 8&nbsp;km long. There is no running water on the island except after heavy storms.\n\nIn the 1999 census in Vanuatu, 7000 people identified as Paamese. 2000 on the island itself and others through the urban hubs of Vanuatu, particularly [[Port Vila]].\n\n===Dialects/Varieties===\n\nPaamese spoken in different parts of the island (and then those on other islands) does differ slightly phonologically and morphologically but not enough to determine definite \u2018dialects splits\u2019. Even in the extreme north and extreme south, places with the biggest difference, both groups can still communicate fully. There is no question of mutual intelligibility being impaired.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! Labial\n! Alveolar\n! Velar/Glottal\n|-\n| Prenasalised stop\n| b\n| d\n| g\n|-\n| Oral stop\n| p\n| t\n| k\n|-\n| Nasal\n| m\n| n\n| \u014b\n|-\n| Fricative\n| f\n| s\n| h\n|-\n| Lateral\n|\n| l\n|\n|-\n|Trill\n|\n| r\n|\n|-\n| Glide\n| \n| j\n| w\n|}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! front\n! central\n! back\n|-\n| high\n| i i:\n| \n| u u:\n|-\n| mid\n| e e:\n| \n| o o:\n|-\n| low\n| \n| a a:\n| \n|}\n\nStress is phonologically distinctive in Paamese.\n\n===Writing system===\n\nThere is a Paamese orthography which has been in use for over 75 years which accurately represents almost all of the consonant phonemes. The only point of difference is the labial fricative, which, although voiceless in most environments, is written {{angle bracket|v}}. The [[velar nasal]] is written with the diagraph {{angle bracket|ng}}. A long vowel is written with a macron over the vowel: {{angle bracket|\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b}}.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Nominal phrases===\n\nIn Paamese nominals can occur in four environments:\n* as verbal subjects with cross-reference on the verb for person and number\n* as verbal objects with cross-reference on the verb for properness.\n* as prepositional objects\n* as heads of nominal phrases with associated adjuncts\n\nThere are four major classes of nominals:\n* Pronouns\n* Indefinites\n* Possessives\n* Nouns\n\n====Pronouns====\nFree pronouns in paamese:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! SG\n! \n! DL\n! PCL\n! PL\n|-\n| 1\n| inau\n| incl.\n| ialue\n| iatelu\n| iire\n|-\n| \n|\n| excl.\n| komalu\n| komaitelu\n| komai\n|-\n|2\n| kaiko\n| \n| kamilu\n| kamiitelu\n| kamii\n|-\n|3\n| kaie\n| \n| kailue\n| kaitelu\n| kaile\n|}\n\nThe [[paucal]] is generally used for numbers in the range of about 3 to 6, and the plural is generally used for numbers greater than 12. In the range 6 to 12, whether a speaker of Paamese uses paucal or plural is dependent on what the thing being spoken about is contrasted with. For example one\u2019s patrilineage will be referred to paucally when it is contrasted with that of the whole village but plurally when it is contrasted with just the nuclear family. The paucal is also sometimes used even when it is referring to a really big number if it is contrasted with an even bigger number. For example comparing the population of Paama with that of Vanuatu as a whole. However using the paucal with numbers above a dozen is rare.\n\n====Indefinites====\nUnlike other nominals, indefinites can occur not only as nominal phrase heads, but also as adjuncts to other heads. There are two types of indefinites. The first are numerals. When Crowley was writing in 1982 he said that the numeral system of Paamese was not used by anyone under the age of 30 and only rarely by those older than 30. It is unlikely, therefore, that many people use it today.\n\nThe following is a list of the seven non-numeral indefinites in Paamese:\n* sav - another (sg)\n* savosav - other (non-sg)\n* tet\u0101i - any; koa(n), some\n* tei - some of it/them\n* haulu - many/much\n* musav - many/much (archaic)\n\n====Possessives====\n\nAll nouns fall into one of two subclasses using different constructions for [[possession (linguistics)|possession]]. Categories can roughly be defined semantically into [[inalienable possession|alienable and inalienable possession]]. Inalienability, semantically can be described as the relationship held between an animate possessor and an aspect of this possessor which can\u2019t exist independently of that being.\n\nBody parts are the most common inalienable possession but not all body parts are treated as inalienable; internal body parts are largely seen as alienable unless they are perceived to be central to emotions, individuality or maintenance of life itself. This can be explained through the experience of butchering or cooking of animals in which the internal organs are removed and thus alienated from the body. Exusions that are expelled in normal bodily functions are regarded as inalienable while those that are periodically expelled or as a result of sickness are regarded as alienable so bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, blood and excrement are treated as inalienable while sweat, blood clots and ear wax are alienable. An exception to this rule is vomit, however, which is treated as inalienable. Inalienability also extends to relations between people with blood relations being expressed in the alienable possessive construction\n\nInalienable and alienable possessions are marked using different possessive constructions. Inalienable possessions are marked with a possessive suffix attaching directly onto the noun\n\n    NOUN-SUFFIX \n    vatu-k \n    head-1SG \n    \u2018my head\u2019\n\nWhile alienable possessions are marked with a possessive constituent to which the possessive suffix attaches\n\n    NOUN POSS-SUFFIX \n    vakili ona-k \n    canoe POSS-1SG \n    \u2018my canoe\u2019\n\nThe possessive suffix in both subclasses, however, is the same.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! SG\n! \n! DL\n! PCL\n! PL\n|-\n| 1\n| -k\n| INCL\n| -ralu\n| -ratel\n| -r\n|-\n|\n|\n|EXCL\n| -mal\n| -maitel\n| -mai\n|-\n|2\n| -m\n|\n| -mil\n| -mitel\n| -mi\n|-\n| 3\n| -n\n| After -e\n| -alu\n| -atel\n| -\u00f8\n|-\n|\n|\n| After -a/-o\n| -ialu\n| -iatel\n| -i\n|-\n|\n|\n| After -i/-u\n| -ialu\n| -latel\n| -l\n|}\n\nThese classes are quite rigid and if an inalienable noun, semantically, can be alienated it would still have to be expressed using the inalienable construction.\n\nAlienable possessions can be split into further subclasses represented by the different possessive constituent that the noun takes, again these have a semantic correspondence indicating the relationship between the possessed noun and the possessor\n\n*A-n \u2018his/her/its (to eat); \u2018intended specially for him/her/it\u2019; \u2018specially characteristic of him/her/it\u2019\n*Emo-n \u2018his/her/its (to drink, to wear, to use domestically) \u2019\n*Ese-n \u2018his/her (owned as something that one has planted, as an animal one has reared, or as something kept on one\u2019s own land) \u2019\n*One-n \u2018his/her/its (in all other kinds of possession) \u2019\n\nThese subclasses are not so rigid and a noun can be used with different possessive constituent according to its use.\n\nWhen the possessed noun isn\u2019t a pronoun, the third person singular possessive suffix is attached to the possessed noun, which is then followed by the possessor noun\n\n     Ani emo-n ehon  \n     coconut POSS:POT-3SG child \n     \u2018child\u2019s drinking coconut\u2019\n\nIf the possessed noun is inalienable, the third person singular suffix attaches directly to the noun with the possessor noun following\n\n    Vati-n ehon\n    head-3SG child \n    \u2018child\u2019s head\u2019\n\nNo morpheme of any kind can intervene between a possessive suffix and the possessed noun in this construction.\n\n====Nouns====\n\nThere are five subtypes of nouns in Paamese. The first are individual names of people or animals, that is of some particular person or animal. So Schnookims or Fido rather than cat or dog. Individual names are cross-referenced on the verb in object position with the same suffix used for pronouns (-e/-ie), rather than the suffix used for non-proper objects (-nV).\n\n=====Location nouns=====\nThere are two kinds of location nouns, relative and absolute. The relative nouns are a closed class of 10 words with meanings like above or nearby. The absolute nouns are an open class and refer to some specific location. Location nouns generally occur in the spatial case. Unlike all other nouns, in this case they take a zero marking rather than the preposition \u2018eni\u2019. Relative location nouns are distinguished grammatically from the absolute location nouns on the basis that they can freely enter into prepositionally linked complex nominal phrases while the absolute nouns cannot.\n\n=====Time nouns=====\nTime nouns are distinguished from other nouns grammatically on the basis that they can only be in the oblique or relative case. Like location nouns they come in two delicious flavours. The first can only receive a zero marking in the oblique case while the second can marked with either a zero marking or with the prepositions eni or teni.\n\n=====Descriptive nouns=====\nAre marginal members of the noun category. Semantically the describe some property or quality attributed to something and grammatically they usually behave like adjectives, that is they occur as adjuncts in a copular verb phrase. However unlike adjectives they do occasionally appear in distinctly nominal slots such as in the subject or object position to a verb. Further, unlike an adjective, they cannot simply follow a head noun as an adjunct.\n\n=====Common nouns=====\nCommon nouns are essentially the dumping ground for everything that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet. They are characterised grammatically as not having any of the special grammatical restrictions that apply to the other nouns and also by the verb taking the non-proper suffix (-nV) when a common noun is in the object position. Semantically they include anything that can be considered alienable or inalienable.\n\n===Verb phrases===\n\nPaamese demonstrates extensive [[inflectional morphology]] on verbs, distinguishing between a number of different [[linguistic modality|modal categories]] that are expressed as prefixes. Verb phrases in Paamese are distinguishable as they have as their head a member of the class of verbs followed by its associated verbal adjuncts and modifiers.\n\n====Verb roots====\n\nThe verb root form is bounded on the left by subject-mood prefixes and on the right by inflectional suffixes and the root itself differs in form according to the nature of the environment it occurs in. Verb roots fall into one of six different classes according to the ways that the initial segment inflects. This inflection is demonstrated in the following table.\n\t\t\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Class\n! A\n! B\n! C\n! D\n|-\n| I\n| t-\n| t-\n| r-\n| d-\n|-\n| II\n| k-\n| k-\n| k-\n| g-\n|-\n| III\n| k-\n| \u00d8-\n| k-\n| g-\n|-\n| IV\n| h-\n| h-\n| v-\n| v-\n|-\n|V\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| mu-\n|-\n| VI\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n|}\n\nEach of the four root forms denotes a specific set of morpho-syntactic environments;\n*A\n**as the second part of a compound noun\n*B\n**in all affirmative irrealis moods of the verb\n**when there is some preceding derivational morpheme\n**when there is no preceding morpheme and the verb carries the nominaliser \u2013ene\n*C\n**as an adjunct to a verb phrase head\n*D\n**in the realis mood of the verb\n**in the negative form of the verb\n\nA verb is entered into the lexicon in its A-form.\n\nTransitive verbs can be further subdivided into classes according to the variation of the final segment of the root\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because of this, the negative in Paamese is incompatible with [[imperative mood|imperative]], prohibitive and potential moods. This is due to the fact that these moods, despite being irrealis, do not express any form of expectation that the event will become real from the speaker. \nThere are two distinct constructions of negation: the [[partitive]] and the non-partitive. These constructions differ in that the partitive takes the partitive suffix -tei obligatorily, while non-partitive constructions only take this suffix optionally.\n====== Partitive Negative ======\nThe partitive negative is the most common form of negation in everyday speech. It is used as the negative forms of:\n\n'''Transitive verbs with non-generic objects'''\n\n    Kai rongadei veta \n    3SG 3SG.real.neg.eat.part breadfruit\n    'He didn't eat the breadfruit\n\nThe use of the partitive in these examples expresses that a non-generic object is entirely unaffected by an event, rather than being only partially unaffected (the example above describes the breadfruit being entirely uneaten, as opposed to only some remaining uneaten).\n\n'''Any Intransitive verb'''\n    Inau naromesaitei\n    1SG 1SG.real.neg.sick.part\n    \u2018I am not sick\u2019\n\nUsing the partitive to express intransitive verbs acts to express that the state or event is completely unachieved rather than being partially instead of only being partially achieved.\n\n====== Non-Partitive Negative ======\nThe non-partitive negative is used to as a negator of transitive verbs with generic objects such as:\n\n    Letau kail aropipile pi\n    woman PL 3PL.real.neg.REdup.play marbles\n    \u2018Women never play marbles\u2019\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuas kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nThe above examples are also able to be expressed using the partitive negative construction as seen in the below example:\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuastei kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit.part 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nHowever, this construction has no apparent change in meaning to non-partitive constructions.\n\nAll examples are taken from Crowley, 1982, pp. 140-141.\n\n====Inflectional Suffixes====\n\nThere are three sets of inflectional suffixes; those expressing bound pronominal objects, those expressing the common-proper marking of a free form object, and that which marks the verb as being partitive.\n\n=====Bound Pronominal Objects=====\n\nA singular pronominal object can be expressed as a suffix. There are two sets of bound object markers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Person\n! I\n! II\n|-\n| 1\n| -nau\n| -inau\n|-\n| 2\n| -ko\n| -iko\n|-\n|3\n| -e\n| -ie\n|}\n\nThe first set is used with the greatest number of verbs, the second set is used only with roots ending in \u2013e and those belonging to Class IV (see above). Class I verbs cannot take the first person singular bound object, although they can take the second and third person objects.\n\n=====Common-proper Objects=====\n\nWhen a transitive verb is followed by a free form object, this is cross-referenced on the verb according to whether it is common or proper with certain phonological categories of verb stems. When the object is a name or a pronoun this is marked on certain verbs by the suffix \u2013i/-ie. When the verb has a common object, this is cross-referenced with the suffix \u2013nV\n\n====Reduplication====\n\n[[Reduplication]] has a fairly wide range of semantic functions in Paamese and can in some cases even change the class which a form belongs. When a verb is reduplicated, the new verb can differ semantically from its corresponding unreduplicated form in that it describes an event that is not seen as having a spatial or temporal setting or a single specific patient. When a numeral verb is reduplicated, the meaning is that of distribution. Reduplication can occur in a number of ways, it can reduplicate just the initial syllable, the initial two syllables or the final two syllables with no consistent semantic difference between these three types.\n\n====Adjuncts====\n\nA verb phrase can contain one or more adjuncts always following the head of the verb phrase. All of the inflectional suffixes above attach onto the last filler of the adjunct slot and if there is no adjunct, onto the verb phrase head. There are two different types of adjuncts, tightly bound and loosely bound. A tightly bound adjunct must always be followed by the inflectional suffixes as no constituent can intervene between it and the verb phrase head. Tightly bound adjuncts include prepositional and verbal adjuncts and adjectival adjuncts to a non-copula verb phrase head. A loosely bound adjunct can have inflectional suffixes attached to either the final adjunct or the verb phrase head. All adjuncts to the copula verb, nominal adjuncts in the \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction and modifiers are loosely bound. The \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction is one in which there is an intransitive verb in the position of the head and a loosely bound nominal phrase adjunct following the head. The transitivity of the final adjunct determines the transitivity of the entire verb phrase.\n\n=====The Serial Verb Construction=====\n\nBy far the most common adjunct is a verb stem itself; this construction is called a [[serial verb construction]]. In this construction, prefixes attach to the head and suffixes to the final constituent of the adjunct slot, thus marking this a tightly bound adjunct. It is not often possible to predict the meanings of serial verbs in Paamese and there are a large number of verbal adjuncts which do not occur as heads themselves.\n\n===Clauses===\n\n====Declarative clauses====\nThere are three types of morphosyntactic relationship between phrase-level constituents:\n* '''(NP)(VP)''' A clause may contain one or more NP. The NPs may be subjects, objects, prepositional objects, or a bound complement.\n* '''(NP)(NP)''' NPs may relate to each other as part of a prepositional construction or the bond complement construction.\n* There is also a third type that holds between modifiers and other constituents.\n\n====Yes/no Questions====\nThere are four types of yes/no questions.\n\n=====Intonation Questions=====\nThis takes the syntactic form of a declarative however while a declarative typically ends in falling intonation whereas a rise-fall turns the clause into a question.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a semantically negative declarative clause. This is used as a polite way of asking permission for something.\n\n=====Tag Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a declarative clause with the tag \"aa\" placed at the end. This takes a sharply rising intonation.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Tag Questions=====\nThere are two different types of opposite polarity tag, \"vuoli\" and \"mukavee\". There is no appreciable difference in meaning between these two forms.\n\n====content questions====\nThese take the form of a declarative clause but insert one of the following words into the syntactic slot that information is being requested about:\n*'''asaa''' asking about nouns with non-human reference\n*'''isei''' asking about nouns with human reference\n*'''kavee''' asking about location nouns, or which of a number on non-human nouns\n*'''nengaise''' asking about time nouns\n\n==Vocabulary/Lexis==\nKinship Terms:\n\n*Tamen- father\n*Latin- mother\n*Auve- grandparent\n*Natin- son/daughter\n*Tuak- brother of a man, sister of a woman\n*Monali- brother of a woman\n*Ahinali- sister of a man\n*Uan- brother/sister in law\n\n[[Bislama]] is contributing to the vocabulary  of Paamese especially for new kinds of technology, items foreign to local paamese and for the slang of the younger generation. Some examples of these follow.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Bislama\n! Paamese\n! Gloss\n|-\n| Busi (Fr. Bougie)\n| Busi\n| Spark plug\n|-\n| Botel (E.

There is no indigenous term for the language; however linguists have adopted the term ''Paamese'' to refer to it. Both a grammar and a dictionary of Paamese have been produced by [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]].\n\n==Classification==\nPaamese is an [[Austronesian language]] of Vanuatu. It is most closely related to [[Southeast Ambrym language|the language]] of Southeastern [[Ambrym]]. The two languages, while sharing 60-70% of the lexical cognate, are not [[mutually intelligible]].\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Paamamap.png|thumb|250px|Paama, neighbouring islands and main centres]]\nPaama itself is a small island in the [[Malampa Province]]. The island is no more than 5&nbsp;km wide and 8&nbsp;km long. There is no running water on the island except after heavy storms.\n\nIn the 1999 census in Vanuatu, 7000 people identified as Paamese. 2000 on the island itself and others through the urban hubs of Vanuatu, particularly [[Port Vila]].\n\n===Dialects/Varieties===\n\nPaamese spoken in different parts of the island (and then those on other islands) does differ slightly phonologically and morphologically but not enough to determine definite \u2018dialects splits\u2019. Even in the extreme north and extreme south, places with the biggest difference, both groups can still communicate fully. There is no question of mutual intelligibility being impaired.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! labial\n! alveolar\n! velar/glottal\n|-\n| prenasalised stop\n| b\n| d\n| g\n|-\n| oral stop\n| p\n| t\n| k\n|-\n| nasal\n| m\n| n\n| \u014b\n|-\n| fricative\n| f\n| s\n| h\n|-\n| lateral\n|\n| l\n|\n|-\n|trill\n|\n| r\n|\n|-\n| glide\n| \n| j\n| w\n|}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! front\n! central\n! back\n|-\n| high\n| i i:\n| \n| u u:\n|-\n| mid\n| e e:\n| \n| o o:\n|-\n| low\n| \n| a a:\n| \n|}\n\nStress is phonologically distinctive in Paamese.\n\n===Writing system===\n\nThere is a Paamese orthography which has been in use for over 75 years which accurately represents almost all of the consonant phonemes. The only point of difference is the labial fricative, which, although voiceless in most environments, is written {{angle bracket|v}}. The [[velar nasal]] is written with the diagraph {{angle bracket|ng}}. A long vowel is written with a macron over the vowel: {{angle bracket|\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b}}.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Nominal phrases===\n\nIn Paamese nominals can occur in four environments:\n* as verbal subjects with cross-reference on the verb for person and number\n* as verbal objects with cross-reference on the verb for properness.\n* as prepositional objects\n* as heads of nominal phrases with associated adjuncts\n\nThere are four major classes of nominals:\n* Pronouns\n* Indefinites\n* Possessives\n* Nouns\n\n====Pronouns====\nFree pronouns in paamese:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! SG\n! \n! DL\n! PCL\n! PL\n|-\n| 1\n| inau\n| incl.\n| ialue\n| iatelu\n| iire\n|-\n| \n|\n| excl.\n| komalu\n| komaitelu\n| komai\n|-\n|2\n| kaiko\n| \n| kamilu\n| kamiitelu\n| kamii\n|-\n|3\n| kaie\n| \n| kailue\n| kaitelu\n| kaile\n|}\n\nThe [[paucal]] is generally used for numbers in the range of about 3 to 6, and the plural is generally used for numbers greater than 12. In the range 6 to 12, whether a speaker of Paamese uses paucal or plural is dependent on what the thing being spoken about is contrasted with. For example one\u2019s patrilineage will be referred to paucally when it is contrasted with that of the whole village but plurally when it is contrasted with just the nuclear family. The paucal is also sometimes used even when it is referring to a really big number if it is contrasted with an even bigger number. For example comparing the population of Paama with that of Vanuatu as a whole. However using the paucal with numbers above a dozen is rare.\n\n====Indefinites====\nUnlike other nominals, indefinites can occur not only as nominal phrase heads, but also as adjuncts to other heads. There are two types of indefinites. The first are numerals. When Crowley was writing in 1982 he said that the numeral system of Paamese was not used by anyone under the age of 30 and only rarely by those older than 30. It is unlikely, therefore, that many people use it today.\n\nThe following is a list of the seven non-numeral indefinites in Paamese:\n* sav - another (sg)\n* savosav - other (non-sg)\n* tet\u0101i - any; koa(n), some\n* tei - some of it/them\n* haulu - many/much\n* musav - many/much (archaic)\n\n====Possessives====\n\nAll nouns fall into one of two subclasses using different constructions for [[possession (linguistics)|possession]]. Categories can roughly be defined semantically into [[inalienable possession|alienable and inalienable possession]]. Inalienability, semantically can be described as the relationship held between an animate possessor and an aspect of this possessor which can\u2019t exist independently of that being.\n\nBody parts are the most common inalienable possession but not all body parts are treated as inalienable; internal body parts are largely seen as alienable unless they are perceived to be central to emotions, individuality or maintenance of life itself. This can be explained through the experience of butchering or cooking of animals in which the internal organs are removed and thus alienated from the body. Exusions that are expelled in normal bodily functions are regarded as inalienable while those that are periodically expelled or as a result of sickness are regarded as alienable so bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, blood and excrement are treated as inalienable while sweat, blood clots and ear wax are alienable. An exception to this rule is vomit, however, which is treated as inalienable. Inalienability also extends to relations between people with blood relations being expressed in the alienable possessive construction\n\nInalienable and alienable possessions are marked using different possessive constructions. Inalienable possessions are marked with a possessive suffix attaching directly onto the noun\n\n    NOUN-SUFFIX \n    vatu-k \n    head-1SG \n    \u2018my head\u2019\n\nWhile alienable possessions are marked with a possessive constituent to which the possessive suffix attaches\n\n    NOUN POSS-SUFFIX \n    vakili ona-k \n    canoe POSS-1SG \n    \u2018my canoe\u2019\n\nThe possessive suffix in both subclasses, however, is the same.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n!

The first are individual names of people or animals, that is of some particular person or animal. So Schnookims or Fido rather than cat or dog. Individual names are cross-referenced on the verb in object position with the same suffix used for pronouns (-e/-ie), rather than the suffix used for non-proper objects (-nV).\n\n=====Location nouns=====\nThere are two kinds of location nouns, relative and absolute. The relative nouns are a closed class of 10 words with meanings like above or nearby. The absolute nouns are an open class and refer to some specific location. Location nouns generally occur in the spatial case. Unlike all other nouns, in this case they take a zero marking rather than the preposition \u2018eni\u2019. Relative location nouns are distinguished grammatically from the absolute location nouns on the basis that they can freely enter into prepositionally linked complex nominal phrases while the absolute nouns cannot.\n\n=====Time nouns=====\nTime nouns are distinguished from other nouns grammatically on the basis that they can only be in the oblique or relative case. Like location nouns they come in two delicious flavours. The first can only receive a zero marking in the oblique case while the second can marked with either a zero marking or with the prepositions eni or teni.\n\n=====Descriptive nouns=====\nAre marginal members of the noun category. Semantically the describe some property or quality attributed to something and grammatically they usually behave like adjectives, that is they occur as adjuncts in a copular verb phrase. However unlike adjectives they do occasionally appear in distinctly nominal slots such as in the subject or object position to a verb. Further, unlike an adjective, they cannot simply follow a head noun as an adjunct.\n\n=====Common nouns=====\nCommon nouns are essentially the dumping ground for everything that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet. They are characterised grammatically as not having any of the special grammatical restrictions that apply to the other nouns and also by the verb taking the non-proper suffix (-nV) when a common noun is in the object position. Semantically they include anything that can be considered alienable or inalienable.\n\n===Verb phrases===\n\nPaamese demonstrates extensive [[inflectional morphology]] on verbs, distinguishing between a number of different [[linguistic modality|modal categories]] that are expressed as prefixes. Verb phrases in Paamese are distinguishable as they have as their head a member of the class of verbs followed by its associated verbal adjuncts and modifiers.\n\n====Verb roots====\n\nThe verb root form is bounded on the left by subject-mood prefixes and on the right by inflectional suffixes and the root itself differs in form according to the nature of the environment it occurs in. Verb roots fall into one of six different classes according to the ways that the initial segment inflects. This inflection is demonstrated in the following table.\n\t\t\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Class\n! A\n! B\n! C\n! D\n|-\n| I\n| t-\n| t-\n| r-\n| d-\n|-\n| II\n| k-\n| k-\n| k-\n| g-\n|-\n| III\n| k-\n| \u00d8-\n| k-\n| g-\n|-\n| IV\n| h-\n| h-\n| v-\n| v-\n|-\n|V\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| mu-\n|-\n| VI\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n|}\n\nEach of the four root forms denotes a specific set of morpho-syntactic environments;\n*A\n**as the second part of a compound noun\n*B\n**in all affirmative irrealis moods of the verb\n**when there is some preceding derivational morpheme\n**when there is no preceding morpheme and the verb carries the nominaliser \u2013ene\n*C\n**as an adjunct to a verb phrase head\n*D\n**in the realis mood of the verb\n**in the negative form of the verb\n\nA verb is entered into the lexicon in its A-form.\n\nTransitive verbs can be further subdivided into classes according to the variation of the final segment of the root\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because of this, the negative in Paamese is incompatible with [[imperative mood|imperative]], prohibitive and potential moods. This is due to the fact that these moods, despite being irrealis, do not express any form of expectation that the event will become real from the speaker. \nThere are two distinct constructions of negation: the [[partitive]] and the non-partitive. These constructions differ in that the partitive takes the partitive suffix -tei obligatorily, while non-partitive constructions only take this suffix optionally.\n====== Partitive Negative ======\nThe partitive negative is the most common form of negation in everyday speech. It is used as the negative forms of:\n\n'''Transitive verbs with non-generic objects'''\n\n    Kai rongadei veta \n    3SG 3SG.real.neg.eat.part breadfruit\n    'He didn't eat the breadfruit\n\nThe use of the partitive in these examples expresses that a non-generic object is entirely unaffected by an event, rather than being only partially unaffected (the example above describes the breadfruit being entirely uneaten, as opposed to only some remaining uneaten).\n\n'''Any Intransitive verb'''\n    Inau naromesaitei\n    1SG 1SG.real.neg.sick.part\n    \u2018I am not sick\u2019\n\nUsing the partitive to express intransitive verbs acts to express that the state or event is completely unachieved rather than being partially instead of only being partially achieved.\n\n====== Non-Partitive Negative ======\nThe non-partitive negative is used to as a negator of transitive verbs with generic objects such as:\n\n    Letau kail aropipile pi\n    woman PL 3PL.real.neg.REdup.play marbles\n    \u2018Women never play marbles\u2019\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuas kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nThe above examples are also able to be expressed using the partitive negative construction as seen in the below example:\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuastei kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit.part 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nHowever, this construction has no apparent change in meaning to non-partitive constructions.\n\nAll examples are taken from Crowley, 1982, pp. 140-141.\n\n====Inflectional Suffixes====\n\nThere are three sets of inflectional suffixes; those expressing bound pronominal objects, those expressing the common-proper marking of a free form object, and that which marks the verb as being partitive.\n\n=====Bound Pronominal Objects=====\n\nA singular pronominal object can be expressed as a suffix. There are two sets of bound object markers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Person\n! I\n! II\n|-\n| 1\n| -nau\n| -inau\n|-\n| 2\n| -ko\n| -iko\n|-\n|3\n| -e\n| -ie\n|}\n\nThe first set is used with the greatest number of verbs, the second set is used only with roots ending in \u2013e and those belonging to Class IV (see above). Class I verbs cannot take the first person singular bound object, although they can take the second and third person objects.\n\n=====Common-proper Objects=====\n\nWhen a transitive verb is followed by a free form object, this is cross-referenced on the verb according to whether it is common or proper with certain phonological categories of verb stems. When the object is a name or a pronoun this is marked on certain verbs by the suffix \u2013i/-ie. When the verb has a common object, this is cross-referenced with the suffix \u2013nV\n\n====Reduplication====\n\n[[Reduplication]] has a fairly wide range of semantic functions in Paamese and can in some cases even change the class which a form belongs. When a verb is reduplicated, the new verb can differ semantically from its corresponding unreduplicated form in that it describes an event that is not seen as having a spatial or temporal setting or a single specific patient. When a numeral verb is reduplicated, the meaning is that of distribution. Reduplication can occur in a number of ways, it can reduplicate just the initial syllable, the initial two syllables or the final two syllables with no consistent semantic difference between these three types.\n\n====Adjuncts====\n\nA verb phrase can contain one or more adjuncts always following the head of the verb phrase. All of the inflectional suffixes above attach onto the last filler of the adjunct slot and if there is no adjunct, onto the verb phrase head. There are two different types of adjuncts, tightly bound and loosely bound. A tightly bound adjunct must always be followed by the inflectional suffixes as no constituent can intervene between it and the verb phrase head. Tightly bound adjuncts include prepositional and verbal adjuncts and adjectival adjuncts to a non-copula verb phrase head. A loosely bound adjunct can have inflectional suffixes attached to either the final adjunct or the verb phrase head. All adjuncts to the copula verb, nominal adjuncts in the \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction and modifiers are loosely bound. The \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction is one in which there is an intransitive verb in the position of the head and a loosely bound nominal phrase adjunct following the head. The transitivity of the final adjunct determines the transitivity of the entire verb phrase.\n\n=====The Serial Verb Construction=====\n\nBy far the most common adjunct is a verb stem itself; this construction is called a [[serial verb construction]]. In this construction, prefixes attach to the head and suffixes to the final constituent of the adjunct slot, thus marking this a tightly bound adjunct. It is not often possible to predict the meanings of serial verbs in Paamese and there are a large number of verbal adjuncts which do not occur as heads themselves.\n\n===Clauses===\n\n====Declarative clauses====\nThere are three types of morphosyntactic relationship between phrase-level constituents:\n* '''(NP)(VP)''' A clause may contain one or more NP. The NPs may be subjects, objects, prepositional objects, or a bound complement.\n* '''(NP)(NP)''' NPs may relate to each other as part of a prepositional construction or the bond complement construction.\n* There is also a third type that holds between modifiers and other constituents.\n\n====Yes/no Questions====\nThere are four types of yes/no questions.\n\n=====Intonation Questions=====\nThis takes the syntactic form of a declarative however while a declarative typically ends in falling intonation whereas a rise-fall turns the clause into a question.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a semantically negative declarative clause. This is used as a polite way of asking permission for something.\n\n=====Tag Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a declarative clause with the tag \"aa\" placed at the end. This takes a sharply rising intonation.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Tag Questions=====\nThere are two different types of opposite polarity tag, \"vuoli\" and \"mukavee\". There is no appreciable difference in meaning between these two forms.\n\n====content questions====\nThese take the form of a declarative clause but insert one of the following words into the syntactic slot that information is being requested about:\n*'''asaa''' asking about nouns with non-human reference\n*'''isei''' asking about nouns with human reference\n*'''kavee''' asking about location nouns, or which of a number on non-human nouns\n*'''nengaise''' asking about time nouns\n\n==Vocabulary/Lexis==\nKinship Terms:\n\n*Tamen- father\n*Latin- mother\n*Auve- grandparent\n*Natin- son/daughter\n*Tuak- brother of a man, sister of a woman\n*Monali- brother of a woman\n*Ahinali- sister of a man\n*Uan- brother/sister in law\n\n[[Bislama]] is contributing to the vocabulary  of Paamese especially for new kinds of technology, items foreign to local paamese and for the slang of the younger generation. Some examples of these follow.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Bislama\n! Paamese\n! Gloss\n|-\n| Busi (Fr. Bougie)\n| Busi\n| Spark plug\n|-\n| Botel (E.
