President [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s family and his [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] have remained dominant forces in the country's politics since a [[Corrective Movement (Syria)|1970 coup]].<ref name=\"CIA - The World Factbook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=Zirulnick/>\n\nUntil the early stages of the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian uprising]], the president had broad and unchecked [[decree]] authority under a long-standing [[state of emergency]].

After his death in 2000 his son, Bashar al-Assad, succeeded him as President. A surge of interest in political reform took place after Bashar al-Assad assumed power in 2000. [[Human-rights]] activists and other civil-society advocates, as well as some parliamentarians, became more outspoken during a period referred to as the \"[[Damascus Spring]]\" (July 2000-February 2001). Assad also made a series of appointments of reform-minded advisors to formal and less formal positions and is included a number of similarly oriented individuals in his Cabinet.\n\n==Neo-Ba'athism==\n{{further|Neo-Ba'athism| Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)}}\nThe Ba'ath platform is proclaimed succinctly in the [[List of political slogans|party's slogan]]: \"Unity, freedom, and socialism.\" The party is both socialist, advocating state ownership of the means of industrial production and the redistribution of agricultural land (in practice, Syria's nominally socialist economy is effectively a mixed economy, composed of large state enterprises and private small businesses), and revolutionary, dedicated to carrying a pan-Arab revolution to every part of the Arab world. Founded by [[Michel Aflaq]], a Syrian [[Christians|Christian]], [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], a Syrian [[Sunni]], and [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], an [[alawite]], the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]], which was dissolved in 1966 following the [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat]] which led to the establishment of one [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Iraqi-dominated ba'ath movement]] and one [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Syrian-led ba'ath movement]]. The party embraces secularism and has attracted supporters of all faiths in many Arab countries, especially Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon.\n\nSince August 1990, however, the party has tended to downplay its socialism and to stress [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] unity.\n\nSix smaller political parties are permitted to exist and, along with the Ba'ath Party, make up the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]] (NPF), a grouping of parties that represents the sole framework of legal political party participation for citizens. While created ostensibly to give the appearance of a multi-party system, the NPF is dominated by the Ba'ath Party and does not change the essentially one-party character of the political system. Non-Ba'ath Party members of the NPF exist as political parties largely in name only and conform strictly to Ba'ath Party and government policies. There were reports in 2000 that the government was considering legislation to expand the NPF to include new parties and several parties previously banned; these changes have not taken place. However, one such party- the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]]- was legalised in 2005.\n\nTraditionally, the parties of the NPF accepted the socialist and Arab nationalist ideology of the government. However, the SSNP was the first party that is neither socialist nor Arab nationalist in orientation to be legalised and admitted to the NPF. This has given rise to suggestions that broader ideological perspectives may be afforded some degree of toleration in the future, but ethnically-based (Kurdish and Assyrian) parties continue to be repressed and a strict ban on religious parties is still enforced.\n\nSyria's Emergency Law was in force from 1963, when the Ba'ath Party came to power, until 21 April 2011 when it was rescinded by Bashar al-Assad (decree 161). The law, justified on the grounds of the continuing war with [[Israel]] and the threats posed by terrorists, suspended most constitutional protections.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm|title=Syria|publisher=|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/22/pr-342711.htm Decrees on Ending State of Emergency, Abolishing SSSC, Regulating Right to Peaceful Demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328221640/http://sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/22/pr-342711.htm |date=28 March 2012 }}, ''[[SANA]]'', 22 April 2011</ref>\n\n==Government administration==\nLeadership in [[Damascus]]:\n{{office-table}}\n|[[List of heads of state of Syria|President]]\n|[[Bashar al-Assad]]\n|[[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Ba'ath Party]]\n|17 July 2000\n|-\n|[[List of Prime Ministers of Syria|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Imad Khamis]]\n|[[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Ba'ath Party]]\n|3 July 2016\n|}\n\nLeadership of the [[Syrian opposition]] in [[Idlib]]:\n{{office-table}}\n|[[List of heads of state of Syria|President]]\n|[[Riad Seif]]\n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n| 6 May 2017\n|-\n|[[List of Prime Ministers of Syria|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Jawad Abu Hatab]]\n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n| 17 May 2016\n|}\nThe previous [[Constitution of Syria|Syrian constitution]] of 1973 vested the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] (formally the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party) with leadership functions in the state and society and provided broad powers to the president. The [[President (government title)|president]], approved by [[referendum]] for a 7-year term, was also Secretary General of the Ba'ath Party and leader of the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]]. During the [[Syrian civil war|2011\u20132012 Syrian uprising]], a [[Constitution of Syria|new constitution]] was put to [[Syrian constitutional referendum, 2012|a referendum]]. Amongst other changes, it abolished the old article 8 which entrenched the power of the Ba'ath party.

The late President [[Hafiz al-Asad]] was confirmed by unopposed [[Referendum|plebiscite]]s five times. His son and current President [[Bashar al-Asad]], was confirmed by an unopposed referendum in July 2000. He was confirmed again on 27 May 2007 with 97.6% of the vote<ref name=\"CIA - The World Factbook\"/><ref>Wright, ''Dreams and Shadows'', (2008), p.261</ref>\n\nAlong with the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]], the president decides issues of war and peace and approves the state's 5-year economic plans. The National Progressive Front also acts as a forum in which economic policies are debated and the country's political orientation is determined.\n\nThe Syrian constitution of 2012 requires that the president be Muslim but does not make [[Islam]] the state religion. The judicial system in Syria is an amalgam of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[France|French]], and Islamic laws, with three levels of courts: courts of first instance, [[court of appeal|courts of appeals]], and the constitutional court, the highest tribunal. In addition, religious courts handle questions of personal and [[family law]].\n\nThe Ba'ath Party emphasizes [[socialism]] and secular [[Pan-Arabism]]. Despite the Ba'ath Party's doctrine on building national rather than [[ethnic]] identity, the issues of ethnic, religious, and regional allegiances still remain important in Syria.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nThe [[People's Council of Syria|People's Council]] (''Majlis al-Sha'ab'') has 250 members elected for a four-year term in 15 multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. According to the previous [[Constitution of Syria|Syrian constitution]] of 1973 Syria was a [[one-party state]] and only one political party, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] was legally allowed to hold effective power. Of the 250 seats in the council, 167 were guaranteed for the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]] (founded in 1972) and 134 of these (as of 2007) were members of the Ba'ath Party. The minor [[political parties|parties]] in the Progressive Front, were legally required to accept the leadership of the Ba'ath Party. The other parties in the Progressive Front, for example, are not allowed to canvass for supporters in the army or the student body which are \"reserved exclusively for the Ba'ath.\"<ref>Seale, Patrick, ''Asad, the Struggle for the Middle East'', University of California Press, 1989, p.176</ref> The new [[Constitution of Syria|Syrian constitution]] of 2012 introduced multi-party system  without guaranteed leadership of any political party.<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\n==Political parties and elections==\nThe last parliamentary election was on 7 May 2012 and the results were announced on 15 May.\n\nThe Baath party won an even larger victory than it did in previous elections. They won a majority of around 60% of the 250 parliamentary seats. Previously, the Baath had a majority of just over 50% of the seats in parliament. If one adds in the independent MPs aligned with the Baath Party, the MPs who support the president make up over 90% of the seats in new parliament. The National Unity List, which is dominated by the Syrian Baath Party, won more than 150 seats in the 250 member parliament. Independent individuals won more than 90 seats. Among the newly established opposition parties (established since August 2011), only one single seat was won, namely a seat in Aleppo won by the Syrian Democratic Party, Ahmad Koussa. In addition three representatives of longstanding opposition parties have been elected to Parliament: Qadri Jamil and Ali Haydar from the Front for Change and Liberation, and Amro Osi from the Initiative of Syrian Kurds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=14669|title=Election Results of the May 7, 2012 Syrian Elections|date=20 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 June

After his death in 2000 his son, Bashar al-Assad, succeeded him as President. A surge of interest in political reform took place after Bashar al-Assad assumed power in 2000. [[Human-rights]] activists and other civil-society advocates, as well as some parliamentarians, became more outspoken during a period referred to as the \"[[Damascus Spring]]\" (July 2000-February 2001). Assad also made a series of appointments of reform-minded advisors to formal and less formal positions and is included a number of similarly oriented individuals in his Cabinet.\n\n==Neo-Ba'athism==\n{{further|Neo-Ba'athism| Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)}}\nThe Ba'ath platform is proclaimed succinctly in the [[List of political slogans|party's slogan]]: \"Unity, freedom, and socialism.\" The party is both socialist, advocating state ownership of the means of industrial production and the redistribution of agricultural land (in practice, Syria's nominally socialist economy is effectively a mixed economy, composed of large state enterprises and private small businesses), and revolutionary, dedicated to carrying a pan-Arab revolution to every part of the Arab world. Founded by [[Michel Aflaq]], a Syrian [[Christians|Christian]], [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]], a Syrian [[Sunni]], and [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], an [[alawite]], the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]], which was dissolved in 1966 following the [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat]] which led to the establishment of one [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Iraqi-dominated ba'ath movement]] and one [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Syrian-led ba'ath movement]]. The party embraces secularism and has attracted supporters of all faiths in many Arab countries, especially Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon.\n\nSince August 1990, however, the party has tended to downplay its socialism and to stress [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] unity.\n\nSix smaller political parties are permitted to exist and, along with the Ba'ath Party, make up the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]] (NPF), a grouping of parties that represents the sole framework of legal political party participation for citizens. While created ostensibly to give the appearance of a multi-party system, the NPF is dominated by the Ba'ath Party and does not change the essentially one-party character of the political system. Non-Ba'ath Party members of the NPF exist as political parties largely in name only and conform strictly to Ba'ath Party and government policies. There were reports in 2000 that the government was considering legislation to expand the NPF to include new parties and several parties previously banned; these changes have not taken place. However, one such party- the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]]- was legalised in 2005.\n\nTraditionally, the parties of the NPF accepted the socialist and Arab nationalist ideology of the government. However, the SSNP was the first party that is neither socialist nor Arab nationalist in orientation to be legalised and admitted to the NPF. This has given rise to suggestions that broader ideological perspectives may be afforded some degree of toleration in the future, but ethnically-based (Kurdish and Assyrian) parties continue to be repressed and a strict ban on religious parties is still enforced.\n\nSyria's Emergency Law was in force from 1963, when the Ba'ath Party came to power, until 21 April 2011 when it was rescinded by Bashar al-Assad (decree 161). The law, justified on the grounds of the continuing war with [[Israel]] and the threats posed by terrorists, suspended most constitutional protections.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3580.htm|title=Syria|publisher=|accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/22/pr-342711.htm Decrees on Ending State of Emergency, Abolishing SSSC, Regulating Right to Peaceful Demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328221640/http://sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/22/pr-342711.htm |date=28 March 2012 }}, ''[[SANA]]'', 22 April 2011</ref>\n\n==Government administration==\nLeadership in [[Damascus]]:\n{{office-table}}\n|[[List of heads of state of Syria|President]]\n|[[Bashar al-Assad]]\n|[[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Ba'ath Party]]\n|17 July 2000\n|-\n|[[List of Prime Ministers of Syria|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Imad Khamis]]\n|[[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-led faction)|Ba'ath Party]]\n|3 July 2016\n|}\n\nLeadership of the [[Syrian opposition]] in [[Idlib]]:\n{{office-table}}\n|[[List of heads of state of Syria|President]]\n|[[Riad Seif]]\n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n| 6 May 2017\n|-\n|[[List of Prime Ministers of Syria|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Jawad Abu Hatab]]\n|[[Independent politician|Independent]]\n| 17 May 2016\n|}\nThe previous [[Constitution of Syria|Syrian constitution]] of 1973 vested the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] (formally the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party) with leadership functions in the state and society and provided broad powers to the president. The [[President (government title)|president]], approved by [[referendum]] for a 7-year term, was also Secretary General of the Ba'ath Party and leader of the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]].

The late President [[Hafiz al-Asad]] was confirmed by unopposed [[Referendum|plebiscite]]s five times. His son and current President [[Bashar al-Asad]], was confirmed by an unopposed referendum in July 2000. He was confirmed again on 27 May 2007 with 97.6% of the vote<ref name=\"CIA - The World Factbook\"/><ref>Wright, ''Dreams and Shadows'', (2008), p.261</ref>\n\nAlong with the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]], the president decides issues of war and peace and approves the state's 5-year economic plans. The National Progressive Front also acts as a forum in which economic policies are debated and the country's political orientation is determined.\n\nThe Syrian constitution of 2012 requires that the president be Muslim but does not make [[Islam]] the state religion. The judicial system in Syria is an amalgam of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[France|French]], and Islamic laws, with three levels of courts: courts of first instance, [[court of appeal|courts of appeals]], and the constitutional court, the highest tribunal. In addition, religious courts handle questions of personal and [[family law]].\n\nThe Ba'ath Party emphasizes [[socialism]] and secular [[Pan-Arabism]]. Despite the Ba'ath Party's doctrine on building national rather than [[ethnic]] identity, the issues of ethnic, religious, and regional allegiances still remain important in Syria.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nThe [[People's Council of Syria|People's Council]] (''Majlis al-Sha'ab'') has 250 members elected for a four-year term in 15 multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. According to the previous [[Constitution of Syria|Syrian constitution]] of 1973 Syria was a [[one-party state]] and only one political party, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] was legally allowed to hold effective power. Of the 250 seats in the council, 167 were guaranteed for the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]] (founded in 1972) and 134 of these (as of 2007) were members of the Ba'ath Party. The minor [[political parties|parties]] in the Progressive Front, were legally required to accept the leadership of the Ba'ath Party. The other parties in the Progressive Front, for example, are not allowed to canvass for supporters in the army or the student body which are \"reserved exclusively for the Ba'ath.\"<ref>Seale, Patrick, ''Asad, the Struggle for the Middle East'', University of California Press, 1989, p.176</ref> The new [[Constitution of Syria|Syrian constitution]] of 2012 introduced multi-party system  without guaranteed leadership of any political party.<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\n==Political parties and elections==\nThe last parliamentary election was on 7 May 2012 and the results were announced on 15 May.\n\nThe Baath party won an even larger victory than it did in previous elections. They won a majority of around 60% of the 250 parliamentary seats. Previously, the Baath had a majority of just over 50% of the seats in parliament. If one adds in the independent MPs aligned with the Baath Party, the MPs who support the president make up over 90% of the seats in new parliament. The National Unity List, which is dominated by the Syrian Baath Party, won more than 150 seats in the 250 member parliament. Independent individuals won more than 90 seats. Among the newly established opposition parties (established since August 2011), only one single seat was won, namely a seat in Aleppo won by the Syrian Democratic Party, Ahmad Koussa. In addition three representatives of longstanding opposition parties have been elected to Parliament: Qadri Jamil and Ali Haydar from the Front for Change and Liberation, and Amro Osi from the Initiative of Syrian Kurds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=14669|title=Election Results of the May 7, 2012 Syrian Elections|date=20 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 June

Ironstone was mined by [[Open cast mining|open cast methods]] from the 1850s onwards, and by underground mining from the late 1930s. In the 1970s the steel industry in Scunthorpe transitioned to use of ores imported from outside the UK with higher iron content. Underground mining in the area ceased in 1981.\n\nScunthorpe was close to the epicentre (at [[Middle Rasen]]) of the [[2008 Market Rasen earthquake]], the second largest earthquake experienced in the British Isles, which had a magnitude of 5.2.

It opened in 1963 as the Civic Centre, and was the home of Scunthorpe Borough Council until 1996. Briefly renamed Pittwood House, it was named after Edwin Pittwood, a local Labour politician, who worked in the opencast ironstone workings near Normanby Park.  There are also offices at Church Square House near the former Scunthorpe Market. Pittwood House has since been renamed as Civic Centre due to the relocation of the Register Office from its old premises in Oswald road.\n\n===Civic history===\n{{see also|Municipal Borough of Scunthorpe}}\nIn 1889 the area was included in the Lincolnshire, [[Parts of Lindsey]] [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]]. Separate local government began in 1890 when the Scunthorpe [[local board of health]] was formed. In 1894 the local board was replaced with an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] council. At the same time the neighbouring townships of Brumby and Frodingham were also constituted an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. The two urban districts were amalgamated, along with the [[Civil parishes of England|parishes]] of Crosby and Ashby in 1919 to form an enlarged Scunthorpe urban district.<ref>http://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10450380</ref> Scunthorpe received a charter incorporating the town as a [[municipal borough]] in 1936.<ref>Youngs, F.A., ''Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol. II'', London 1991</ref>\n\nLocal authority boundary changes brought the town into the new county of [[Humberside]] in 1974, and a new [[non-metropolitan district]], the Borough of Scunthorpe was formed with the same boundaries as the old municipal borough. The opening of the [[Humber Bridge]] on 24 June 1981 provided a permanent link between North and South Humberside but did not secure Humberside's future. To the relief of its many detractors, the county of Humberside (and [[Humberside County Council]]) was abolished on 1 April 1996 and succeeded by four [[unitary authorities]].\n\nThe previous Humberside districts of [[Glanford]] and Scunthorpe, and that part of [[Boothferry (district)|Boothferry]] district south of the northern boundaries of the parishes of [[Crowle, Lincolnshire|Crowle]], [[Eastoft]], [[Luddington, North Lincolnshire|Luddington]], Haldenby and [[Amcotts]], now compose the unitary authority of [[North Lincolnshire]].<ref name=humbso /> On amalgamation [[charter trustees]] were formed for Scunthorpe,<ref name=trustees /> and they continue to elect a town mayor.\n[[File:Scunthorpe arms.png|right|thumb|upright|Arms of former [[municipal borough]] of Scunthorpe]]\n\n===Coat of arms===\nWhen Scunthorpe was incorporated as a borough in 1936, it also received a grant of a [[coat of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]].<ref>Letters Patent dated 25 September 1936</ref> These arms were transferred to the new borough council formed in 1974,<ref>The Local Authorities (Armorial Bearings) Order 1974 (1974 No.869)</ref> and are now used by the town's charter trustees.\n\nThe green shield and golden wheatsheaf recall that the area was until recently agricultural in nature.

Initially iron ore was exported to iron producers in [[South Yorkshire]]. Later, after the construction of the [[Trent, Ancholme and Grimsby Railway]] (1860s) gave rail access to the area iron production in the area rapidly expanded using local ironstone and imported coal or coke. Rapid industrial expansion in the area led directly to the development of the town of Scunthorpe, eventually incorporating several other former hamlets and villages, in a formerly sparsely populated entirely agricultural area.\n\nFrom the early 1910s to the 1930s the industry consolidated, with three main ownership concerns formed \u2013 the [[Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company]], part of the [[United Steel Companies]]; the [[Redbourn Iron Works]], part of [[Richard Thomas and Company]] of South Wales (later [[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]]); and [[John Lysaght and Co.|John Lysaght]]'s [[Normanby Iron Works]], part of [[Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]].\n\nIn 1967 all three works became part of the nationalised [[British Steel Corporation]] (BSC), leading to a period of further consolidation \u2013 from the 1970s the use of local or regional ironstone diminished, being replaced by imported ore via the [[Immingham Bulk Terminal]]. Conversion to the [[Linz-Donawitz process]] (or \"basic oxygen\" process) of steel making from the [[open hearth process]] took place from the late 1960s onwards and was complete by the 1990s. Both the Normanby Park and the Redbourn works closed in the early 1980s. \n\nFollowing privatisation in 1988 the company, together with the rest of BSC, became part of [[Corus Group plc|Corus]] (1999), later [[Tata Steel Europe]] (2007).

Scunthorpe station (SCU), has two platforms and runs three different services. Platform 1 serves the TransPennine Express Cleethorpes route, whilst Platform 2 serves the TransPennine Express Manchester Airport route, and the Northern Doncaster route. The Northern train is the local stopping service, which runs from Monday-Saturday, and is served by TransPennine Express at the first and last service of the day. For local people traveling to Doncaster, it is often preferred to use the TransPennine Express services, as they go direct into Doncaster, and don't rely upon the 1980s pacer trains that Northern run today. The station is operated by TransPennine Express, and was made more accessible when lifts were added in 2019. The town lies five miles (8&nbsp;km) north of the [[M180 motorway|M180]], and the [[M181 motorway|M181]] terminates Glanford Park, on the outskirts of the town. Before this motorway was opened in 1979, all the east-west goods traffic took the [[A18 road (England)|A18]] to [[Grimsby]]. [[Humberside Airport]] is a short drive to the east along the M180. The town's bus station is off Fenton Street. The bus station is predominantly used by [[Stagecoach in Lincolnshire]] that operate services within and out of the town along with Hornsby Travel. [[East Yorkshire (bus company)|East Yorkshire]] operate services to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Goole]].\n\n==Religion==\nThe church of [[St John the Evangelist]], in Church Square, was completed in 1891 and consecrated on 15 April that same year.

The original striking clock was installed, in 1890 by [[Potts of Leeds|William Potts and Sons]] of the Guildford Clock Works in [[Leeds]]. In 1897 quarter chimes were added. The peal of eight bells were hung in 1893, in memory of the Lord St Oswald.

Ironstone was mined by [[Open cast mining|open cast methods]] from the 1850s onwards, and by underground mining from the late 1930s. In the 1970s the steel industry in Scunthorpe transitioned to use of ores imported from outside the UK with higher iron content. Underground mining in the area ceased in 1981.\n\nScunthorpe was close to the epicentre (at [[Middle Rasen]]) of the [[2008 Market Rasen earthquake]], the second largest earthquake experienced in the British Isles, which had a magnitude of 5.2.

It opened in 1963 as the Civic Centre, and was the home of Scunthorpe Borough Council until 1996. Briefly renamed Pittwood House, it was named after Edwin Pittwood, a local Labour politician, who worked in the opencast ironstone workings near Normanby Park.  There are also offices at Church Square House near the former Scunthorpe Market. Pittwood House has since been renamed as Civic Centre due to the relocation of the Register Office from its old premises in Oswald road.\n\n===Civic history===\n{{see also|Municipal Borough of Scunthorpe}}\nIn 1889 the area was included in the Lincolnshire, [[Parts of Lindsey]] [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]]. Separate local government began in 1890 when the Scunthorpe [[local board of health]] was formed. In 1894 the local board was replaced with an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] council. At the same time the neighbouring townships of Brumby and Frodingham were also constituted an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. The two urban districts were amalgamated, along with the [[Civil parishes of England|parishes]] of Crosby and Ashby in 1919 to form an enlarged Scunthorpe urban district.<ref>http://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10450380</ref> Scunthorpe received a charter incorporating the town as a [[municipal borough]] in 1936.<ref>Youngs, F.A., ''Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol. II'', London 1991</ref>\n\nLocal authority boundary changes brought the town into the new county of [[Humberside]] in 1974, and a new [[non-metropolitan district]], the Borough of Scunthorpe was formed with the same boundaries as the old municipal borough. The opening of the [[Humber Bridge]] on 24 June 1981 provided a permanent link between North and South Humberside but did not secure Humberside's future. To the relief of its many detractors, the county of Humberside (and [[Humberside County Council]]) was abolished on 1 April 1996 and succeeded by four [[unitary authorities]].\n\nThe previous Humberside districts of [[Glanford]] and Scunthorpe, and that part of [[Boothferry (district)|Boothferry]] district south of the northern boundaries of the parishes of [[Crowle, Lincolnshire|Crowle]], [[Eastoft]], [[Luddington, North Lincolnshire|Luddington]], Haldenby and [[Amcotts]], now compose the unitary authority of [[North Lincolnshire]].<ref name=humbso /> On amalgamation [[charter trustees]] were formed for Scunthorpe,<ref name=trustees /> and they continue to elect a town mayor.\n[[File:Scunthorpe arms.png|right|thumb|upright|Arms of former [[municipal borough]] of Scunthorpe]]\n\n===Coat of arms===\nWhen Scunthorpe was incorporated as a borough in 1936, it also received a grant of a [[coat of arms]] from the [[College of Arms]].<ref>Letters Patent dated 25 September 1936</ref> These arms were transferred to the new borough council formed in 1974,<ref>The Local Authorities (Armorial Bearings) Order 1974 (1974 No.869)</ref> and are now used by the town's charter trustees.\n\nThe green shield and golden wheatsheaf recall that the area was until recently agricultural in nature.

Initially iron ore was exported to iron producers in [[South Yorkshire]]. Later, after the construction of the [[Trent, Ancholme and Grimsby Railway]] (1860s) gave rail access to the area iron production in the area rapidly expanded using local ironstone and imported coal or coke. Rapid industrial expansion in the area led directly to the development of the town of Scunthorpe, eventually incorporating several other former hamlets and villages, in a formerly sparsely populated entirely agricultural area.\n\nFrom the early 1910s to the 1930s the industry consolidated, with three main ownership concerns formed \u2013 the [[Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company]], part of the [[United Steel Companies]]; the [[Redbourn Iron Works]], part of [[Richard Thomas and Company]] of South Wales (later [[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]]); and [[John Lysaght and Co.|John Lysaght]]'s [[Normanby Iron Works]], part of [[Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]].\n\nIn 1967 all three works became part of the nationalised [[British Steel Corporation]] (BSC), leading to a period of further consolidation \u2013 from the 1970s the use of local or regional ironstone diminished, being replaced by imported ore via the [[Immingham Bulk Terminal]]. Both the Normanby Park and the Redbourn works closed in the early 1980s. Conversion to the [[Linz-Donawitz process]] (or \"basic oxygen\" process) of steel making from the [[open hearth process]] took place from the late 1960s onwards and was complete by the 1990s.\n\nFollowing privatisation in 1988, the company together with the rest of BSC became part of [[Corus Group plc|Corus]] (1999), later [[Tata Steel Europe]] (2007). In 2016 the [[long products]] division of Tata Steel Europe was sold to [[Greybull Capital]] with Scunthorpe as the primary steel production site.\n\nAs of 2012, the steel industry remains the major employer in the area and the largest operator within it is [[Tata Steel Europe]]; the number employed in the industry fell from 27,000 at its height{{when|date=April 2012}} to around 4,500 (excluding outside contractors) by the mid 2010s. In addition to being a major employer the works and former ironstone workings have or have had large scale environmental effects, including air pollution and subsidence.\n\nIn 2019, after a drop in future orders due to [[Brexit]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-uk/the-death-of-british-steel-and-the-myth-of-the-good-brexit|title=The Death of British Steel and the Myth of the Good Brexit|last=Knight|first=Sam|date=10 July 2019|accessdate=8 August 2019|issn=0028-792X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8c0267a6-77d3-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab|title=British Steel's cry of Brexit pain|website=Financial Times}}</ref> [[British Steel Limited]] entered insolvency.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48365241|title=British Steel collapse threatens 5,000 jobs|date=22 May 2019|accessdate=8 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIndustries associated with the steelworks include metal engineering as well as a [[The BOC Group|BOC]] plant.\n\n===Other industries===\n\n[[File:Crosby Highrise Flats - geograph.org.uk - 11053.jpg|thumb|Crosby Highrise Flats]]\n\nThe historical predominance of the steel industry made Scunthorpe a virtual [[monotown]]; other industries in the town do exist.

For local people traveling to Doncaster, it is often preferred to use the TransPennine Express services, as they go direct into Doncaster, and don't rely upon the 1980s pacer trains that Northern run today. The station is operated by TransPennine Express, and was made more accessible when lifts were added in 2019. The town lies five miles (8&nbsp;km) north of the [[M180 motorway|M180]], and the [[M181 motorway|M181]] terminates Glanford Park, on the outskirts of the town. Before this motorway was opened in 1979, all the east-west goods traffic took the [[A18 road (England)|A18]] to [[Grimsby]]. [[Humberside Airport]] is a short drive to the east along the M180. The town's bus station is off Fenton Street. The bus station is predominantly used by [[Stagecoach in Lincolnshire]] that operate services within and out of the town along with Hornsby Travel. [[East Yorkshire (bus company)|East Yorkshire]] operate services to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Goole]].\n\n==Religion==\nThe church of [[St John the Evangelist]], in Church Square, was completed in 1891 and consecrated on 15 April that same year.

Unlike them, he never made the move into commercially recorded hip hop in its earliest years.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:1520 Sedwick Ave., Bronx, New York1.JPG|thumb|200px|The front of [[1520 Sedgwick Avenue]], where Campbell lived with his family and threw his first parties.]]\n\nClive Campbell was the first of six children born to Keith and Nettie Campbell in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. While growing up, he saw and heard the [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] of neighborhood parties called [[dance hall]]s, and the accompanying speech of their DJs, known as [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]. He emigrated with his family at the age of 12 to [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]] in November 1967,<ref>Chang, pp. 68\u201372.</ref> where they lived at [[1520 Sedgwick Avenue]].\n\nCampbell attended the [[Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School]] in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor on the basketball court prompted the other kids to nickname him \"[[Hercules]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.artcenter.edu/~acheng1/design_workshop/01.28.03/rap_evolution.pdf|title=The Evolution of Rap Music in the United States|last=Rhodes|first=Henry A.|date=2003|page=5-6}}</ref>  After being involved in a physical altercation with school bullies, the [[Five Percenters]] came to Herc's aid, befriended him and as Herc put it, helped \"Americanize\" him with an education in New York City street culture.<ref>Hager, Steven.

Herc used the record to focus on a short, heavily percussive part in it: the \"[[Break (music)|break]]\". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record reached the end of the break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into  \"five-minute loop of fury\".<ref>Chang, p. 79</ref> This innovation had its roots in what Herc called \"The Merry-Go-Round,\" a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called \"The Merry-Go-Round\" because according to Herc, it takes  one \"back and forth with no slack.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=falkmanbeatz -break bboy / bgirl channel-|title=The Freshest Kids: The History of the B-Boy (Full Documentary)|date=January 8, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDjcHMq4p9U|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHerc stated that he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972.<ref name=hermes>Hermes, Will.

Stomp your feet!\"), then switching from that record's break into the break from a second record, \"[[Bongo Rock]]\" by [[The Incredible Bongo Band]]. From the \"Bongo Rock\"'s break, Herc used a third record to switch to the break on \"[[The Mexican (song)|The Mexican]]\" by the English rock band [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]].<ref>Ogg, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nKool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the recorded music with slang phrases, announcing: \"Rock on, my mellow!\" \"B-boys, b-girls, are you ready? keep on rock steady\" \"This is the joint!

Herc has noted that \"breaking\" was also street slang of the time meaning \"getting excited\", \"acting energetically,\" or \"causing a disturbance\".<ref>Kool Herc, in Israel (director), ''The Freshest Kids'', QD3, 2002.</ref> Herc coined the terms \"b-boy\", \"b-girl,\" and \"breaking\" which became part of the lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator [[Grandmixer DXT]] describes the early evolution as follows:\n\n<blockquote> ... [E]verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to try to come up with something better.<ref name=Hager/></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the media began to call this style \"[[breakdance]],\" which in 1991 the ''New York Times'' wrote was \"an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz.\"<ref>Dunning, Jennifer. \"Nurturing Onstage the Moves Born on the Ghettos' Streets\", ''New York Times'', November 26, 1991.</ref> Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as \"b-boys,\" a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.<ref>See for example Suggah B in Cross, p. 303: \"I'm a B-girl till I die, when they bury me they're gonna bury me with some [[Adidas Superstar|shelltoes]] on my feet and some gold around my neck because that is how I feel.\"</ref>\n\n===Move to the streets===\nWith the mystique of his graffiti name, his physical stature, and the reputation of his small parties, Herc became a folk hero in the Bronx. He began to play at nearby clubs including the Twilight Zone<ref name=LAT/> Hevalo, Executive Playhouse, the [[Police Athletic League|PAL]] on 183rd Street,<ref name=shapiro/> as well as at high schools such as Dodge and [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Taft]].<ref>Ogg, p. 14, p. 17.</ref> Rapping duties were delegated to [[Coke La Rock]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackawarenessfoundation.com/?p=3885|title=www.blackawarenessfoundation.com/?p=3885|website=www.blackawarenessfoundation.com|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> and Theodore Puccio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://breakdancedecoded.com/what-is-bboying/|title=Breaks, Bronx, Boogie, Beat: What Is Bboying?|website=breakdancedecoded.com|language=en-US|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> Herc's collective, known as The Herculoids, was augmented by Clark Kent and dancers The Nigga Twins.<ref name=shapiro/> Herc took his soundsystem (the herculords) \u2014still legendary for its sheer volume<ref>Toop, p. 18\u201319 ''et al.''</ref>\u2014to the streets and parks of the Bronx. [[Nelson George]] recalls a schoolyard party:\n\n<blockquote>The sun hadn't gone down yet, and kids were just hanging out, waiting for something to happen. Van pulls up, a bunch of guys come out with a table, crates of records. They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the electricity \u2013 Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing.<ref>Ogg, p. 17</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Influence on artists===\nIn 1975, the young [[Grandmaster Flash]], to whom Kool Herc was, in his words, \"a hero\", began DJing in Herc's style.  By 1976, Flash and his [[MC]]s [[The Furious Five]] played to a packed [[Audubon Ballroom]] in [[Manhattan]]. Venue owners were often nervous of unruly young crowds, however, and soon sent hip hop back to the clubs, community centres and high school gymnasiums of the Bronx.<ref>Toop, pp. 74\u201376.</ref>\n\n[[Afrika Bambaataa]] first heard Kool Herc in 1973. Bambaataa, at that time a general in the notorious Black Spades gang of the Bronx, obtained his own soundsystem in 1975 and began to DJ in Herc's style, converting his followers to the non-violent [[Universal Zulu Nation|Zulu Nation]] in the process. Kool Herc began using [[The Incredible Bongo Band]]'s \"[[Apache (song)|Apache]]\" as a break in 1975. It became a firm b-boy favorite\u2014\"the Bronx national anthem\"<ref name=Hager/>\u2014and is still in use in hip hop today.<ref name=\"hermes\"/> [[Steven Hager]] wrote of this period:\n\n<blockquote>For over five years the Bronx had lived in constant terror of street gangs. Suddenly, in 1975, they disappeared almost as quickly as they had arrived. This happened because something better came along to replace the gangs. That something was eventually called hip-hop.<ref name=Hager/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1979, the record company executive [[Sylvia Robinson]] assembled a group she called [[The Sugarhill Gang]] and recorded \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\". The hit song ushered in the era of commercially released hip hop. By that year's end, [[Grandmaster Flash]] was recording for [[Enjoy Records]]. In 1980, Afrika Bambaataa began recording for [[Winley Records|Winley]]. By this time, DJ Kool Herc's star had faded.\n\nGrandmaster Flash suggests that Herc may not have kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it).<ref>Toop, p. 62.</ref> Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down of one of his venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Herc on the Wheels of Steel.JPG|thumb|right|Herc spins records in the [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] section of the Bronx at a February 28, 2009 event addressing the \"[[West Indian]] Roots of Hip-Hop.\"]]Kool Herc appeared in Hollywood's motion picture take on hip hop, ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984), as himself.

Using the same two-turntable set-up of [[disco]] DJs, he used two copies of the same record to elongate the break. This [[breakbeat]] DJing, using funky drum solos, formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and exhortations to dancers helped lead to the [[Syncopation|syncopated]], rhythmically spoken accompaniment now known as [[rapping]].\n\nHe called the dancers \"break-boys\" and \"break-girls\", or simply [[b-boying|b-boys]] and [[B girl|b-girls]]. Campbell's DJ style was quickly taken up by figures such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]]. Unlike them, he never made the move into commercially recorded hip hop in its earliest years.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:1520 Sedwick Ave., Bronx, New York1.JPG|thumb|200px|The front of [[1520 Sedgwick Avenue]], where Campbell lived with his family and threw his first parties.]]\n\nClive Campbell was the first of six children born to Keith and Nettie Campbell in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. While growing up, he saw and heard the [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] of neighborhood parties called [[dance hall]]s, and the accompanying speech of their DJs, known as [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]. He emigrated with his family at the age of 12 to [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]] in November 1967,<ref>Chang, pp. 68\u201372.</ref> where they lived at [[1520 Sedgwick Avenue]].\n\nCampbell attended the [[Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School]] in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor on the basketball court prompted the other kids to nickname him \"[[Hercules]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.artcenter.edu/~acheng1/design_workshop/01.28.03/rap_evolution.pdf|title=The Evolution of Rap Music in the United States|last=Rhodes|first=Henry A.|date=2003|page=5-6}}</ref>  After being involved in a physical altercation with school bullies, the [[Five Percenters]] came to Herc's aid, befriended him and as Herc put it, helped \"Americanize\" him with an education in New York City street culture.<ref>Hager, Steven.

Herc used the record to focus on a short, heavily percussive part in it: the \"[[Break (music)|break]]\". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated the break and prolonged it by changing between two record players. As one record reached the end of the break, he cued a second record back to the beginning of the break, which allowed him to extend a relatively short section of music into  \"five-minute loop of fury\".<ref>Chang, p. 79</ref> This innovation had its roots in what Herc called \"The Merry-Go-Round,\" a technique by which the deejay switched from break to break at the height of the party. This technique is specifically called \"The Merry-Go-Round\" because according to Herc, it takes  one \"back and forth with no slack.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=falkmanbeatz -break bboy / bgirl channel-|title=The Freshest Kids: The History of the B-Boy (Full Documentary)|date=January 8, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDjcHMq4p9U|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHerc stated that he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972.<ref name=hermes>Hermes, Will.

Stomp your feet!\"), then switching from that record's break into the break from a second record, \"[[Bongo Rock]]\" by [[The Incredible Bongo Band]]. From the \"Bongo Rock\"'s break, Herc used a third record to switch to the break on \"[[The Mexican (song)|The Mexican]]\" by the English rock band [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]].<ref>Ogg, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nKool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the recorded music with slang phrases, announcing: \"Rock on, my mellow!\" \"B-boys, b-girls, are you ready? keep on rock steady\" \"This is the joint!

Herc has noted that \"breaking\" was also street slang of the time meaning \"getting excited\", \"acting energetically,\" or \"causing a disturbance\".<ref>Kool Herc, in Israel (director), ''The Freshest Kids'', QD3, 2002.</ref> Herc coined the terms \"b-boy\", \"b-girl,\" and \"breaking\" which became part of the lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator [[Grandmixer DXT]] describes the early evolution as follows:\n\n<blockquote> ... [E]verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to try to come up with something better.<ref name=Hager/></blockquote>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the media began to call this style \"[[breakdance]],\" which in 1991 the ''New York Times'' wrote was \"an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz.\"<ref>Dunning, Jennifer. \"Nurturing Onstage the Moves Born on the Ghettos' Streets\", ''New York Times'', November 26, 1991.</ref> Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as \"b-boys,\" a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.<ref>See for example Suggah B in Cross, p. 303: \"I'm a B-girl till I die, when they bury me they're gonna bury me with some [[Adidas Superstar|shelltoes]] on my feet and some gold around my neck because that is how I feel.\"</ref>\n\n===Move to the streets===\nWith the mystique of his graffiti name, his physical stature, and the reputation of his small parties, Herc became a folk hero in the Bronx. He began to play at nearby clubs including the Twilight Zone<ref name=LAT/> Hevalo, Executive Playhouse, the [[Police Athletic League|PAL]] on 183rd Street,<ref name=shapiro/> as well as at high schools such as Dodge and [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Taft]].<ref>Ogg, p. 14, p. 17.</ref> Rapping duties were delegated to [[Coke La Rock]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackawarenessfoundation.com/?p=3885|title=www.blackawarenessfoundation.com/?p=3885|website=www.blackawarenessfoundation.com|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> and Theodore Puccio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://breakdancedecoded.com/what-is-bboying/|title=Breaks, Bronx, Boogie, Beat: What Is Bboying?|website=breakdancedecoded.com|language=en-US|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> Herc's collective, known as The Herculoids, was augmented by Clark Kent and dancers The Nigga Twins.<ref name=shapiro/> Herc took his soundsystem (the herculords) \u2014still legendary for its sheer volume<ref>Toop, p. 18\u201319 ''et al.''</ref>\u2014to the streets and parks of the Bronx. [[Nelson George]] recalls a schoolyard party:\n\n<blockquote>The sun hadn't gone down yet, and kids were just hanging out, waiting for something to happen. Van pulls up, a bunch of guys come out with a table, crates of records. They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the electricity \u2013 Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing.<ref>Ogg, p. 17</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Influence on artists===\nIn 1975, the young [[Grandmaster Flash]], to whom Kool Herc was, in his words, \"a hero\", began DJing in Herc's style.  By 1976, Flash and his [[MC]]s [[The Furious Five]] played to a packed [[Audubon Ballroom]] in [[Manhattan]]. Venue owners were often nervous of unruly young crowds, however, and soon sent hip hop back to the clubs, community centres and high school gymnasiums of the Bronx.<ref>Toop, pp. 74\u201376.</ref>\n\n[[Afrika Bambaataa]] first heard Kool Herc in 1973. Bambaataa, at that time a general in the notorious Black Spades gang of the Bronx, obtained his own soundsystem in 1975 and began to DJ in Herc's style, converting his followers to the non-violent [[Universal Zulu Nation|Zulu Nation]] in the process. Kool Herc began using [[The Incredible Bongo Band]]'s \"[[Apache (song)|Apache]]\" as a break in 1975. It became a firm b-boy favorite\u2014\"the Bronx national anthem\"<ref name=Hager/>\u2014and is still in use in hip hop today.<ref name=\"hermes\"/> [[Steven Hager]] wrote of this period:\n\n<blockquote>For over five years the Bronx had lived in constant terror of street gangs. Suddenly, in 1975, they disappeared almost as quickly as they had arrived. This happened because something better came along to replace the gangs. That something was eventually called hip-hop.<ref name=Hager/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1979, the record company executive [[Sylvia Robinson]] assembled a group she called [[The Sugarhill Gang]] and recorded \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\". The hit song ushered in the era of commercially released hip hop. By that year's end, [[Grandmaster Flash]] was recording for [[Enjoy Records]]. In 1980, Afrika Bambaataa began recording for [[Winley Records|Winley]]. By this time, DJ Kool Herc's star had faded.\n\nGrandmaster Flash suggests that Herc may not have kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it).<ref>Toop, p. 62.</ref> Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down of one of his venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.\n\n===Later years===\n[[File:Herc on the Wheels of Steel.JPG|thumb|right|Herc spins records in the [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] section of the Bronx at a February 28, 2009 event addressing the \"[[West Indian]] Roots of Hip-Hop.\"]]Kool Herc appeared in Hollywood's motion picture take on hip hop, ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984), as himself.

The cathedral was created in honor to the [[Russia]]n soldiers who died during the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878]], as a result of which Bulgaria was liberated from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.\n\nThe cathedral was designed by [[Alexander Pomerantsev]], aided by Alexander Smirnov and Alexander Yakovlev, as the initial 1884-1885 project of [[Ivan Bogomolov]] was radically changed by Pomerantsev. The final design was finished in 1898, and the construction and decoration were done by a team of Bulgarian, Russian, [[Austro-Hungarian]] and other European artists, architects and workers, including the aforementioned architects, as well as [[Petko Momchilov]], [[Yordan Milanov]], [[Haralampi Tachev]], [[Ivan Mrkvi\u010dka]], [[Vasily Bolotnov]], [[Nikolay Bruni]], [[Alexander Kiselyov (painter)|Alexander Kiselyov]], [[Anton Mitov]] and many others.\n[[File:Alexander Nevsky Cathedral 36.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]\nThe marble parts and the lighting fixtures were created in [[Munich]], the metal elements for the gates in [[Berlin]], while the gates themselves were manufactured in Karl Bamberg's factory in [[Vienna]], and the mosaics were shipped from [[Venice]].\n\n==Name changes==\nThe name of the cathedral was briefly changed<ref name=MD/> to the Sts.
