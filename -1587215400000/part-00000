The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816.\n\nDavid Ochterlony and British political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as [[Irregular military|irregular forces]]. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George\u2019s Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\". \n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony\u2019s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lt. Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion\u2014the Kumaon\u2014was also raised, eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\nGurkhas served as troops under contract to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in the [[Pindaree War]] of 1817, in [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] in 1826 and the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10782099 |title= Who are the Gurkhas?|date=27 July 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the [[British Indian Army]] on its formation. The [[2nd Gurkha Rifles|8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion]] made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 [[Indian Order of Merit]] awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=58}} \n\nThree days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=57}} Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended [[Raja Hindu Rao|Hindu Rao]]'s house, losing 327 out of 490 men.

They discouraged the Brahminical influence in the military as they considered the Hindu castes more susceptible to Brahminical values.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} As a result, they discouraged the inclusion of [[Thakuri]] and [[Khas]] groups in the Gorkha units{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} and refused to recruit tribes other than [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]] in the Gorkha units.{{sfn|Singh|1997|pp=220\u2013221}} They also pressurized Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] to include at least of 75% of the forces of [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]].{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}}\n\nBetween 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=79}}\n\n[[File:5thRoyalGurkhaRiflesNorth-WestFrontier1923.JPG|thumb|left|2nd/5th [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], North-West Frontier 1923.]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions.\n\nA large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=9}} They served on the battlefields of [[France]] in the battles of [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]]; in [[Belgium]] at the battle of [[Ypres]]; in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Suez Canal]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] against Turkish advance, [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=99}} One detachment served with [[Lawrence of Arabia]]. During the Battle of Loos (June\u2013December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defences, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, \"found its Valhalla\".<ref>Sengupta 2007.</ref> \n\nDuring the ultimately unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as \"Gurkha Bluff\".{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=121}} The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of [[Baghdad]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=150}} \n\nAs such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the [[Third Afghan War]] in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in [[Waziristan]], where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile [[Pashtun people|Pathan tribesmen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} \n\nDuring this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna saw an extensive amount of action.<ref>For more detail see {{harvnb|Barthorp|2002|p=}}.{{page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghurkas in action with a 6-pdr anti-tank gun in Tunisia, 16 March 1943.

After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King's (later Queen's) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King's/Queen's Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.\n* [[Jemadar]]s and [[subedar]]s normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer's advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.\n* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King's Indian Commissions, and later full King's or Queen's Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers. This was rare until after the Second World War.\n* Gurkha officers commissioned from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and Short Service Officers regularly fill appointments up to the rank of major. At least two Gurkhas have been promoted to lieutenant colonel and there is theoretically now no bar to further progression.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* After 1948, the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] (part of the British Army) was formed and adopted standard British Army rank structure and nomenclature, except for the three Viceroy Commission ranks between Warrant Officer 1 and Second Lieutenant (jemadar, subedar and subedar major) which remained, albeit with different rank titles Lieutenant (Queens Gurkha Officer), Captain (QGO) and Major (QGO). The QGO commission was abolished in 2007; Gurkha soldiers are currently commissioned as Late Entry Officers (as above).<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n\n=== Regiments of the Gurkha Rifles (c.&nbsp;1815\u20131947) ===\n[[File:Gurkha Memorial, Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial of [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]], [[Winchester Cathedral]], [[Hampshire]]]]\n[[File:Princess Mary's Own.JPG|thumb|Princess Mary's Own|300px]]\n\n* [[1GR|1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]] (raised 1815, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[3GR|3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[4 Gorkha Rifles|4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1857, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[5GR|5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] (raised 1858, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[6th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1817, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[7th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1902, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[8th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[9th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1890, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[11th Gurkha Rifles]] (1918\u20131922; raised again by India{{snd}}[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]{{snd}}following independence in 1947)\n* [[25th Gurkha Rifles]] (1942\u20131946)\n* [[26th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[29th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[42nd Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817 as the [[Cuttack Legion]], renamed 6th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n* [[44th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824 as the [[16th (Sylhet) Local Battalion]], renamed 8th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n\n=== Second World War training battalions ===\n* 14th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 29th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion\n* 38th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 56th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 710th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\">{{cite web|accessdate=19 October 2009 | publisher = Order of Battle|title=115 Infantry Brigade Subordanates|url = http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=63267&Tab=Sub}}</ref>\n\n== Post-independence (1947\u2013present) ==\n[[File:Gurkha inscription.JPG|thumb|\n<center>\nTHE GURKHA<br />\nSOLDIER<br />\n''Bravest of the brave,''<br />\n''most generous of the generous,''<br />\n''never had country''<br />\n''more faithful friends''<br />\n''than you.''<br />\n<small>Professor Sir [[Ralph Turner]] MC<ref>The inscription on a monument to Gurkha soldiers which was unveiled in 1997 in [[Whitehall]], [[London]] (Staff.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1997/gurkhas/36397.stm The Gurkhas&nbsp;\u2013 Britain's oldest allies] BBC, 4 December 1997).</ref></small>\n</center>]]\n\nAfter [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], and the [[partition of India]], in 1947 and under the [[Britain-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tripartite Agreement]], the original ten Gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the British Army and the newly independent [[Indian Army]].<ref name=\"Cross32\" /> Six Gurkha regiments (12 battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=224}}\n\nTo the disappointment of their British officers, the majority of Gurkhas given a choice between British or Indian Army service opted for the latter. The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=226}} The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]; a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}}\n\nThe principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=322\u2013323}} This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=323}}\n\nWith the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the [[Demographics of Nepal|Nepalese people]] and would be banned.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=344}} However, as of 2018, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.\n\n===British Army Gurkhas===\n{{Main article|Brigade of Gurkhas}}\n[[File:Gurkhas on Patrol in Helmand MOD 45151723.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles on patrol in [[Helmand Province]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2010.]]\nFour Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]]\n* [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]]\n\nThey formed the '''Brigade of Gurkhas''' and were initially stationed in [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]].

On 8 March 2007 the [[British Government]] announced that all Gurkhas who signed up after 1 July 1997 would receive a pension equivalent to that of their British counterparts. In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join, although not in first-line units, conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in the UK for retired Gurkhas and their families.\n\nDespite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement.

The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816.\n\nDavid Ochterlony and British political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as [[Irregular military|irregular forces]]. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George\u2019s Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\". \n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony\u2019s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lt. Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion\u2014the Kumaon\u2014was also raised, eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\nGurkhas served as troops under contract to the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] in the [[Pindaree War]] of 1817, in [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] in 1826 and the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|Second]] Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10782099 |title= Who are the Gurkhas?|date=27 July 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the [[British Indian Army]] on its formation. The [[2nd Gurkha Rifles|8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion]] made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 [[Indian Order of Merit]] awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=58}} \n\nThree days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=57}} Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended [[Raja Hindu Rao|Hindu Rao]]'s house, losing 327 out of 490 men.

They discouraged the Brahminical influence in the military as they considered the Hindu castes more susceptible to Brahminical values.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} As a result, they discouraged the inclusion of [[Thakuri]] and [[Khas]] groups in the Gorkha units{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}} and refused to recruit tribes other than [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]] in the Gorkha units.{{sfn|Singh|1997|pp=220\u2013221}} They also pressurized Prime Minister [[Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] to include at least of 75% of the forces of [[Gurung]]s and [[Magars]].{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=221}}\n\nBetween 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=79}}\n\n[[File:5thRoyalGurkhaRiflesNorth-WestFrontier1923.JPG|thumb|left|2nd/5th [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], North-West Frontier 1923.]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=xvii}} The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions.\n\nA large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Chappell|1993|p=9}} They served on the battlefields of [[France]] in the battles of [[Battle of Loos|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]]; in [[Belgium]] at the battle of [[Ypres]]; in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Suez Canal]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] against Turkish advance, [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and [[Salonika]].{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=99}} One detachment served with [[Lawrence of Arabia]]. During the Battle of Loos (June\u2013December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defences, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, \"found its Valhalla\".<ref>Sengupta 2007.</ref> \n\nDuring the ultimately unsuccessful [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as \"Gurkha Bluff\".{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=117\u2013118}} At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=121}} The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of [[Baghdad]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=150}} \n\nAs such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the [[Third Afghan War]] in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in [[Waziristan]], where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile [[Pashtun people|Pathan tribesmen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} \n\nDuring this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna saw an extensive amount of action.<ref>For more detail see {{harvnb|Barthorp|2002|p=}}.{{page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ghurkas in action with a 6-pdr anti-tank gun in Tunisia, 16 March 1943.

After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King's (later Queen's) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King's/Queen's Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.\n* [[Jemadar]]s and [[subedar]]s normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer's advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.\n* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King's Indian Commissions, and later full King's or Queen's Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers. This was rare until after the Second World War.\n* Gurkha officers commissioned from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and Short Service Officers regularly fill appointments up to the rank of major. At least two Gurkhas have been promoted to lieutenant colonel and there is theoretically now no bar to further progression.<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n* After 1948, the [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] (part of the British Army) was formed and adopted standard British Army rank structure and nomenclature, except for the three Viceroy Commission ranks between Warrant Officer 1 and Second Lieutenant (jemadar, subedar and subedar major) which remained, albeit with different rank titles Lieutenant (Queens Gurkha Officer), Captain (QGO) and Major (QGO). The QGO commission was abolished in 2007; Gurkha soldiers are currently commissioned as Late Entry Officers (as above).<ref name=\"Cross34\" />\n\n=== Regiments of the Gurkha Rifles (c.&nbsp;1815\u20131947) ===\n[[File:Gurkha Memorial, Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial of [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]], [[Winchester Cathedral]], [[Hampshire]]]]\n[[File:Princess Mary's Own.JPG|thumb|Princess Mary's Own|300px]]\n\n* [[1GR|1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)]] (raised 1815, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[3GR|3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[4 Gorkha Rifles|4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1857, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[5GR|5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]] (raised 1858, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[6th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1817, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[7th Gurkha Rifles]], renamed [[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]] in 1959 (raised 1902, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[8th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[9th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)\n* [[10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1890, allocated to British Army in 1948)\n* [[11th Gurkha Rifles]] (1918\u20131922; raised again by India{{snd}}[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]{{snd}}following independence in 1947)\n* [[25th Gurkha Rifles]] (1942\u20131946)\n* [[26th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[29th Gurkha Rifles]] (1943\u20131946)\n* [[42nd Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1817 as the [[Cuttack Legion]], renamed 6th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n* [[44th Gurkha Rifles]] (raised 1824 as the [[16th (Sylhet) Local Battalion]], renamed 8th Gurkha Rifles in 1903)\n\n=== Second World War training battalions ===\n* 14th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 29th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion\n* 38th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 56th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\" />\n* 710th Gurkha Rifles Training Battalion<ref name=\"oob115\">{{cite web|accessdate=19 October 2009 | publisher = Order of Battle|title=115 Infantry Brigade Subordanates|url = http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=63267&Tab=Sub}}</ref>\n\n== Post-independence (1947\u2013present) ==\n[[File:Gurkha inscription.JPG|thumb|\n<center>\nTHE GURKHA<br />\nSOLDIER<br />\n''Bravest of the brave,''<br />\n''most generous of the generous,''<br />\n''never had country''<br />\n''more faithful friends''<br />\n''than you.''<br />\n<small>Professor Sir [[Ralph Turner]] MC<ref>The inscription on a monument to Gurkha soldiers which was unveiled in 1997 in [[Whitehall]], [[London]] (Staff.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1997/gurkhas/36397.stm The Gurkhas&nbsp;\u2013 Britain's oldest allies] BBC, 4 December 1997).</ref></small>\n</center>]]\n\nAfter [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], and the [[partition of India]], in 1947 and under the [[Britain-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tripartite Agreement]], the original ten Gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the British Army and the newly independent [[Indian Army]].<ref name=\"Cross32\" /> Six Gurkha regiments (12 battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=224}}\n\nTo the disappointment of their British officers, the majority of Gurkhas given a choice between British or Indian Army service opted for the latter. The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=226}} The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]; a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=229}}\n\nThe principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army.{{sfn|Parker|2005|pp=322\u2013323}} This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=323}}\n\nWith the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt.

In times of crisis it can be deployed as a reaction force.

On 8 March 2007 the [[British Government]] announced that all Gurkhas who signed up after 1 July 1997 would receive a pension equivalent to that of their British counterparts. In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join, although not in first-line units, conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in the UK for retired Gurkhas and their families.\n\nDespite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement.

He is England's fourth highest international goalscorer (44 goals), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer in the history of English [[English football league system|top-flight]] football (357 goals), and has also scored more [[hat-trick]]s (six) for England than anyone else. He finished as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]'s top scorer in six seasons. He is a member of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nGreaves began his professional career at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1957, and played in the following year's [[FA Youth Cup]] final. He scored 124 First Division goals in just four seasons before being sold on to Italian club [[A.C. Milan]] for \u00a380,000 in April 1961. His stay in Italy was not a happy one and he returned to England with Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a399,999 in December 1961. Whilst with Spurs he won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1962 FA Cup Final|1961\u201362]] and [[1967 FA Cup Final|1966\u201367]], the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] in [[1962 FA Charity Shield|1962]] and [[1967 FA Charity Shield|1967]], and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1962\u201363]]; he never won a league title but did help Spurs to a second-place finish in 1962\u201363. He moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a player-exchange in March 1970 and retired the following year. After a four-year absence he returned to football at the non-league level, despite suffering from alcoholism. In a five-year spell he played for [[Brentwood Town F.C.|Brentwood]], [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], and [[Woodford Town F.C. (1937)|Woodford Town]] before retiring for good in 1980. \n\nGreaves scored 13 goals in 12 [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] internationals and scored 44 goals in 57 full England internationals between 1959 and 1967. He played in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but was injured in the group stage of the 1966 World Cup and lost his first team place to [[Geoff Hurst]], who kept Greaves out of the first team in [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]]. England won the World Cup, but Greaves was not given his medal until a change of FIFA rules in 2009.\n\nAfter retiring as a player Greaves went on to enjoy a successful career in broadcasting, most notably working alongside [[Ian St John]] on ''[[Saint and Greavsie]]'' from 1985 to 1992. During this period, he also made regular appearances on [[TV-am]]. He worked on a number of other sport programmes on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] during this period, including ''[[Sporting Triangles]]'' (1987-1990).\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nGreaves was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]] and raised in [[Hainault, London|Hainault]].<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=29}}</ref> He was scouted playing football while a schoolboy by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[James Thompson (footballer)|Jimmy Thompson]], and in 1955 was signed on as an apprentice to become one of \"Drake's Ducklings\" (Drake's Ducklings were named after manager [[Ted Drake]] in response to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s \"[[Busby Babes]]\").<ref name=\"page 29\"/> He soon made an impression at youth level, scoring 51 goals in the 1955\u201356 season and 122 goals in the 1956\u201357 season under the tutelage of youth team coach [[Dick Foss]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=34}}</ref> Greaves scored in the 1958 [[FA Youth Cup]] final, but Chelsea lost the [[two-legged tie]] 7\u20136 on aggregate after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] turned round a four-goal deficit with a 6\u20131 win in the second leg.<ref name=\"yc58\">{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=35}}</ref> He turned professional in the summer of 1957, though spent eight weeks working at a steel company to supplement his income during the summer break.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=42}}</ref>\n\nAged 17, Greaves scored on his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut on 24 August 1957 against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 1\u20131 draw at [[White Hart Lane]].<ref name=cfc>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Greaves|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html|publisher=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=11 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812202321/http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html |archivedate=12 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"sdp\">{{cite web|last1=Lanigan |first1=Adam |title=Sporting memories - Jimmy Greaves breaks the British transfer record |url=http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |publisher=The Sunday Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813120704/http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |archive-date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |date=27 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was an instant success, as the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' reported that he \"showed the ball control, confidence and positional strength of a seasoned campaigner\" and compared his debut to the instant impact the young [[Duncan Edwards]] had as a teenager.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=60}}</ref> The \"Blues\" played attacking football during the [[1957\u201358 Football League|1957\u201358]] campaign, resulting in high-scoring matches, and Greaves ended the season as the club's top scorer with 22 goals in 37 appearances.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=62}}</ref> Drake rested him for six weeks from mid-November as he did not wish the praise Greaves was receiving to go to his head; Greaves marked his return to the first team at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] with four goals in a 7\u20134 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on Christmas Day.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=71}}</ref>\n\nGreaves scored five goals in a 6\u20132 win against league champions Wolverhampton Wanderers in the third match of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359]] season.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=102}}</ref> Chelsea remained inconsistent, though despite his team finishing in 14th place Greaves managed to finish as the division's top scorer with 32 goals in 44 league games.<ref name=\"sdp\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=107}}</ref> Greaves scored 29 goals in 40 league matches in the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] campaign, five of which came in a 5\u20134 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=155}}</ref> Despite his goalscoring exploits, the club could manage only an 18th-place finish, three places and three points above the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 1959-60|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1959-60.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1960\u201361 Chelsea F.C. season|1960\u201361]] season, Greaves scored [[hat-trick]]s against Wolves, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]; he scored four goals against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]; and hit five goals in a 7\u20131 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

He is England's fourth highest international goalscorer (44 goals), [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer in the history of English [[English football league system|top-flight]] football (357 goals), and has also scored more [[hat-trick]]s (six) for England than anyone else. He finished as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]'s top scorer in six seasons. He is a member of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nGreaves began his professional career at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1957, and played in the following year's [[FA Youth Cup]] final. He scored 124 First Division goals in just four seasons before being sold on to Italian club [[A.C. Milan]] for \u00a380,000 in April 1961. His stay in Italy was not a happy one and he returned to England with Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a399,999 in December 1961. Whilst with Spurs he won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1962 FA Cup Final|1961\u201362]] and [[1967 FA Cup Final|1966\u201367]], the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] in [[1962 FA Charity Shield|1962]] and [[1967 FA Charity Shield|1967]], and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1962\u201363]]; he never won a league title but did help Spurs to a second-place finish in 1962\u201363. He moved to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in a player-exchange in March 1970 and retired the following year. After a four-year absence he returned to football at the non-league level, despite suffering from alcoholism. In a five-year spell he played for [[Brentwood Town F.C.|Brentwood]], [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], and [[Woodford Town F.C.|Woodford Town]] before retiring for good in 1980. \n\nGreaves scored 13 goals in 12 [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] internationals and scored 44 goals in 57 full England internationals between 1959 and 1967. He played in the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but was injured in the group stage of the 1966 World Cup and lost his first team place to [[Geoff Hurst]], who kept Greaves out of the first team in [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]]. England won the World Cup, but Greaves was not given his medal until a change of FIFA rules in 2009.\n\nAfter retiring as a player Greaves went on to enjoy a successful career in broadcasting, most notably working alongside [[Ian St John]] on ''[[Saint and Greavsie]]'' from 1985 to 1992. During this period, he also made regular appearances on [[TV-am]]. He worked on a number of other sport programmes on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] during this period, including ''[[Sporting Triangles]]'' (1987-1990).\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nGreaves was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]] and raised in [[Hainault, London|Hainault]].<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=29}}</ref> He was scouted playing football while a schoolboy by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[James Thompson (footballer)|Jimmy Thompson]], and in 1955 was signed on as an apprentice to become one of \"Drake's Ducklings\" (Drake's Ducklings were named after manager [[Ted Drake]] in response to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s \"[[Busby Babes]]\").<ref name=\"page 29\"/> He soon made an impression at youth level, scoring 51 goals in the 1955\u201356 season and 122 goals in the 1956\u201357 season under the tutelage of youth team coach [[Dick Foss]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=34}}</ref> Greaves scored in the 1958 [[FA Youth Cup]] final, but Chelsea lost the [[two-legged tie]] 7\u20136 on aggregate after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] turned round a four-goal deficit with a 6\u20131 win in the second leg.<ref name=\"yc58\">{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=35}}</ref> He turned professional in the summer of 1957, though spent eight weeks working at a steel company to supplement his income during the summer break.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=42}}</ref>\n\nAged 17, Greaves scored on his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut on 24 August 1957 against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 1\u20131 draw at [[White Hart Lane]].<ref name=cfc>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Greaves|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html|publisher=www.chelseafc.com|accessdate=11 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812202321/http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/former-players/boilerplate/jimmy-greaves.html |archivedate=12 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"sdp\">{{cite web|last1=Lanigan |first1=Adam |title=Sporting memories - Jimmy Greaves breaks the British transfer record |url=http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |publisher=The Sunday Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813120704/http://www.sundaypost.com/sport/sporting-memories-2.1062/sporting-memories-jimmy-greaves-breaks-the-british-transfer-record-1.135853 |archive-date=13 August 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |date=27 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was an instant success, as the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' reported that he \"showed the ball control, confidence and positional strength of a seasoned campaigner\" and compared his debut to the instant impact the young [[Duncan Edwards]] had as a teenager.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=60}}</ref> The \"Blues\" played attacking football during the [[1957\u201358 Football League|1957\u201358]] campaign, resulting in high-scoring matches, and Greaves ended the season as the club's top scorer with 22 goals in 37 appearances.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=62}}</ref> Drake rested him for six weeks from mid-November as he did not wish the praise Greaves was receiving to go to his head; Greaves marked his return to the first team at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] with four goals in a 7\u20134 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on Christmas Day.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=71}}</ref>\n\nGreaves scored five goals in a 6\u20132 win against league champions Wolverhampton Wanderers in the third match of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359]] season.<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=102}}</ref> Chelsea remained inconsistent, though despite his team finishing in 14th place Greaves managed to finish as the division's top scorer with 32 goals in 44 league games.<ref name=\"sdp\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=107}}</ref> Greaves scored 29 goals in 40 league matches in the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] campaign, five of which came in a 5\u20134 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greaves|Scott|2004|p=155}}</ref> Despite his goalscoring exploits, the club could manage only an 18th-place finish, three places and three points above the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 1959-60|url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1959-60.html|publisher=rsssf.com|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1960\u201361 Chelsea F.C. season|1960\u201361]] season, Greaves scored [[hat-trick]]s against Wolves, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]; he scored four goals against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]; and hit five goals in a 7\u20131 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

{"title_page": "Spike maul", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=May 2015}}\n{{no footnotes|date=August 2014}}\n}}\n\nA '''spike maul''' is a type of [[hand tool]] used to drive [[Rail spike|railroad spike]]s in railroad track work.  It is also known as a '''spiking hammer'''.\n\n==Description==\nSpike mauls are akin to [[sledge hammer]]s, typically weighing from {{convert|8|to|12|lb|0}} with {{convert|30|to|36|in|cm|-1|adj=on}}-long handles.\nThey have elongated double faced [[hardened steel]] heads. The head is typically over {{convert|12|in|cm}} long to allow the user to drive spikes on the opposite side of the [[Rail tracks|rail]] without breaking the handle.\n\nSome spike mauls have [[symmetrical]] heads, but most have a slightly longer thinner side and a shorter larger diameter side of equal weight. The long side allows a user to spike over abnormally tall rails, and to drive spikes down next to highway crossing planks. The shorter side provides more surface area which requires less accuracy for normal spiking.\n\n[[File:Ray Lyman Wilbur with first spike from Boulder Dam cph.3b21644.jpg|thumb|Ray Lyman Wilbur with first spike from [[Boulder Dam]]]]\n\nThere are two typical patterns of spike mauls:\n* Bell: This is the more common variety. Bell spike mauls are mostly [[cylindrical]] in shape.\n* Standard: These have a square [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]], and a squared tapered end opposite the normal driving face.\n\nHandles are often [[Fraxinus|ash]] or [[hickory]], but lesser species of woods find their way into economy handles. Some mauls come with [[fiberglass]] handles as well. Specialized mauls exist with nonconductive handles for work on electrified track.\n\nAlmost all spike mauls take a standard {{convert|36|in|cm|-1|adj=on}} oval eye sledge hammer handle, which is frequently replaced through the course of heavy use. It is common practice in many locales to cut down the long handle to about {{convert|28|in|cm|-1}}. This makes the maul more convenient when used only to \"set\" spikes for a powered spiker. It also makes the \"windmill\" spiking technique more comfortable. Windmilling is when a user takes the maul handle with both hands locked and strikes the spike with repeated fast blows by swinging in a circular motion over the shoulder. The standard \"wood chopping\" motion is more comfortable and natural for most people.\n\n==Use==\nRegardless of the technique employed it is important to strike railroad spikes with the handle of the maul as close to horizontal as possible. This requires the user to bend over at the waist with every swing. If the user attempts to drive spikes while standing erect the spike will often bend and the maul head will begin to sit crooked on the handle. Shortly thereafter the maul handle will break.\n\nBecause there are usually five (but sometimes six to eight) spikes driven per plate, and two plates applied per tie for each rail and because ties are placed so close together (usually, with ties on 16\" centers)\u2014thousands of spikes must be driven for each mile of track.  When this was done manually, before the advent of pneumatic spiking machines, it was important that spikes be driven in rapidly.  The standard, for a powerful and experienced spiker, was to drive the spike in with only three blows.  It required great strength, and considerable stamina, to maintain that pace.\n\nSpike mauls are hardened tools. Occasionally the head may become upset or chipped. Heads are often reground on a [[bench grinder]] to remove nicks and metal flow. This practice is becoming less common as grinding can hide cracks and other defects. It is also possible to overheat the steel while grinding and remove some of the temper from the tool.\n\n==Brands==\nBrands of spike mauls include Slug-Devil, Tamco and Warwood.\n\n== References ==\n* Tartman, E.E.

Specialized mauls exist with nonconductive handles for work on electrified track.\n\nAlmost all spike mauls take a standard {{convert|36|in|cm|adj=on}} oval eye sledge hammer handle, which is frequently replaced through the course of heavy use. It is common practice in many locales to cut down the long handle to about {{convert|28|in|cm}}. This makes the maul more convenient when used only to \"set\" spikes for a powered spiker. It also makes the \"windmill\" spiking technique more comfortable. Windmilling is when a user takes the maul handle with both hands locked and strikes the spike with repeated fast blows by swinging in a circular motion over the shoulder. The standard \"wood chopping\" motion is more comfortable and natural for most people.\n\n==Use==\nRegardless of the technique employed it is important to strike railroad spikes with the handle of the maul as close to horizontal as possible. This requires the user to bend over at the waist with every swing. If the user attempts to drive spikes while standing erect the spike will often bend and the maul head will begin to sit crooked on the handle. Shortly thereafter the maul handle will break.\n\nBecause there are usually five (but sometimes six to eight) spikes driven per plate, and two plates applied per tie for each rail and because ties are placed so close together (usually, with ties on 16\" centers)\u2014thousands of spikes must be driven for each mile of track.  When this was done manually, before the advent of pneumatic spiking machines, it was important that spikes be driven in rapidly.  The standard, for a powerful and experienced spiker, was to drive the spike in with only three blows.  It required great strength, and considerable stamina, to maintain that pace.\n\nSpike mauls are hardened tools. Occasionally the head may become upset or chipped. Heads are often reground on a [[bench grinder]] to remove nicks and metal flow. This practice is becoming less common as grinding can hide cracks and other defects. It is also possible to overheat the steel while grinding and remove some of the temper from the tool.\n\n==Brands==\nBrands of spike mauls include Slug-Devil, Tamco and Warwood.\n\n== References ==\n* Tartman, E.E.
