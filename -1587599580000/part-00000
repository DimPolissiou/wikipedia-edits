Rosie is in the process of recovering from a near-fatal brain tumor. Their health insurance has reached its limit, and Jim finds that he is unable to afford her treatment. He decides to cash in the [[pension]] he earned from serving in the military, but learns that much of it is lost as a result of bad investments on the part of his financial adviser. In addition, he finds himself in a $60,000 lawsuit as a result of bad real-estate investments conducted by his rogue financial adviser.\n\nJim frequently lunches with a colleague in the armored car business, and two NYPD friends. He borrows $10,000 from the colleague to pay for an attorney to sue his financial adviser, and arranges a meeting with an assistant district attorney to discuss wrongdoings on the part of his financial advisers. However, the attorney he hired claims that he is unable to do anything and the assistant district attorney is unwilling to meet with him. Jim becomes frustrated at the loss of his money and his inability to pay for his wife's treatment and their mortgage. Because of his financial situation, his employer reluctantly fires him, as the company is not willing to trust him with large sums of money.\n\nRosie feels guilty for the financial strain that her illness has put on Jim and, unable to cope, commits suicide. Jim blames [[Wall Street]] financiers for ruining his life. Seeking vengeance, he purchases various firearms and grenades from an arms dealer, and begins a one-man army shooting spree on the Wall Street bosses that lost his money and contributed to the death of his wife. One by one, he kills those that have wronged him. Meeting with his friends at lunch, Jim casually admits to them that he is the Wall Street murderer. The three laugh it off, convinced he's joking.\n\nThe climax of the film has Jim staging a one-man assault and infiltration of a high-rise office building to confront and kill Jeremy Stancroft, a ruthless and greedy portfolio manager who is indirectly responsible for Jim's financial situation. Sitting at Jeremy's desk, Jim tells Jeremy why he is targeting him, of his corruption and asks why he should let Jeremy live. Jeremy defends his actions, saying that the famous rich people of history didn't get rich by honest work and that [[capitalism]] is a [[survival of the fittest]] society, where the \"strong survive and the weak die off\". Jim shows him a picture of his wife and tells Jeremy he's the reason his wife is dead. Shortly as [[SWAT]] begins to approach the office, Jim puts the gun on the table and counts to three. Jeremy grabs the gun when Jim gets to two, bragging about how he \"won\". Jim accuses him of cheating. Not caring, Jeremy pulls the trigger, only to realize that the gun is empty, for Jim cheated too. Just then, SWAT smashes the window and shoots Jeremy dead. Jim pretends to be an innocent wounded victim, having been shot in the arm by a security guard earlier, and is escorted away by SWAT, who is convinced Stancroft was the perpetrator.\n\nA few minutes later, Jim stands in the lobby of the office building. He watches emergency personnel come and go, having just been treated for the gunshot wound to his arm. He is recognized there by his NYPD lunchmates, who had been called to the scene. Without a word, Jim is led out of the building by his friend to the street, to freedom. The film ends with Jim walking away, voicing over that he intends to continue his killing spree of white-collar businessmen elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film730455.html |title=Assault on Wall Street (2013) |publisher=FilmAffinity |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n\n* [[Dominic Purcell]] as Jim Baxford\n* [[Erin Karpluk]] as Rosie Baxford\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Sean\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Jeremy Stancroft\n* [[Keith David]] as Freddy\n* [[Michael Par\u00e9]] as Frank\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Robert Canworth\n* [[Tyron Leitso]] as Spalding Smith\n* [[Mike Dopud]] as Tom Allgard\n* [[Barclay Hope]] as Ian Marwood\n* Heather Feeney as Mary Jean\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Louis Patterson\n* [[Hiro Kanagawa]] as TV Host\n* Michaela Mann as Myra\n* [[Carrie Genzel]] as Debbie\n* [[Jerry Trimble]] as Andy\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Chuck Neehey\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as MacKay\n* [[Natassia Malthe]] as Molly\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\nDirector Uwe Boll was inspired by a song by Distant 2nd called \"Murder on Wall Street\" and wrote scenes in the movie to incorporate ideas from the song.

It stars [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Kevin James]] as the title characters Chuck and Larry, respectively, two [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighters]] who pretend to be a gay couple in order to ensure one of their children can receive healthcare. The film was released in the United States on July 20, 2007, and was Sandler's first role in a [[Universal Pictures]] film since ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' in 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nChuck Levine, a womanizing bachelor, and Larry Valentine, a widower struggling to raise his two children, are two veteran [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighters]]. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses on Chuck, but Larry saves his life. Chuck vows to repay Larry in any way possible. Experiencing an epiphany from the incident, Larry tries to increase his life insurance policy. He finds out that a lapse in the paperwork after his wife's death keeps him from naming his children as primary beneficiaries. The representative from the insurance company suggests that Larry find a new spouse so he can name that person as his beneficiary. However, there is no woman in Larry's life that he loves or trusts.\n\nInspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a [[civil union]] with him. Although Chuck declines at first, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees, entering a domestic partnership and becoming Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. To their dismay, however, investigators arrive to inquire about their abrupt partnership, suspecting fraud. Chuck and Larry decide to enlist the help of lawyer Alex McDonough, who suggests they have a formal wedding ceremony to prove they are committed. The pair travel to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], [[Canada]] for a quick [[same-sex marriage]] at a [[wedding chapel]], and Chuck moves in with Larry and his children.\n\nAlex invites the couple to a gay benefit costume party. At the end of the evening, the partygoers are confronted by [[Homophobia|homophobic]] protesters. Chuck is provoked into punching their leader, and the incident is picked up by the local news. With their apparent homosexuality and marriage revealed, Chuck and Larry are heckled, and their fellow FDNY firefighters refuse to work with them. Their only ally is Fred G. Duncan, an angry, intimidating firefighter who reveals to Chuck that he is gay, and has not felt comfortable telling anyone.\n\nChuck becomes romantically interested in Alex after the two spend time together, but finds himself unable to get close to her because she thinks he is gay. During a heart-to-heart talk about relationships, the two spontaneously kiss, but Alex, still believing Chuck is gay and married, is shocked and immediately distances herself from Chuck. Meanwhile, city agent Clinton Fitzer arrives to investigate the couple, and the strain on both Larry and Chuck causes them to fight. Larry asserts that Chuck's constant absence to spend time with Alex is jeopardizing their ability to maintain the ruse of their relationship. Chuck tells Larry that he should stop refusing to move on from the death of his wife. Later that evening, a petition circulates to have Chuck and Larry thrown out of the firehouse. Upon discovering it, Larry confronts the crew about personal embarrassments on the job that Chuck and Larry helped them overcome. Afterwards, Chuck and Larry apologize to each other and reconcile their differences.\n\nEventually, numerous women publicly testify to having slept with Chuck in the recent past, and the couple is called into court to defend their marriage against charges of fraud. They are defended by Alex, and their fellow firefighters arrive in support, having realized all that Chuck and Larry have done for them over the years. Fitzer interrogates both men, and eventually demands the pair to kiss to prove that their relationship is physical. Before they do so, Chuck and Larry are interrupted by FDNY Captain Phineas J. Tucker, who reveals their marriage to be a sham and that they are both [[Heterosexuality|straight]]. He emphasizes that the situation reminded people not to be judgmental, and then offers to be arrested as well, since he knew about the false relationship but failed to report it. This prompts each of the other firefighters to claim a role in the wedding in a show of solidarity. Chuck, Larry, and the other firefighters are sent to jail, but they are quickly released after negotiating a deal to provide photos for an [[AIDS]] research benefit calendar, and Chuck and Larry keep their benefits.\n\nTwo months later, Fred and Alex's brother, Kevin, are married in Niagara Falls at the same chapel as Chuck and Larry. At the wedding party (which features musical guest [[Lance Bass]]), Larry moves on from the death of his wife and talks to a new woman, while Alex agrees to a dance with Chuck.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Charles Todd \"Chuck\" Levine\n* [[Kevin James]] as Lawrence Arthur \"Larry\" Valentine\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Alex McDonough\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Captain Phineas J.

Pronounce You Chuck & Larry''''' (also simply known as ''Chuck & Larry'') is a 2007 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Dennis Dugan]]. It stars [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Kevin James]] as the title characters Chuck and Larry, respectively, two [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighters]] who pretend to be a gay couple in order to ensure one of their children can receive healthcare. The film was released in the United States on July 20, 2007, and was Sandler's first role in a [[Universal Pictures]] film since ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' in 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nChuck Levine, a womanizing bachelor, and Larry Valentine, a widower struggling to raise his two children, are two veteran [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighters]]. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses on Chuck, but Larry saves his life. Chuck vows to repay Larry in any way possible. Experiencing an epiphany from the incident, Larry tries to increase his life insurance policy. He finds out that a lapse in the paperwork after his wife's death keeps him from naming his children as primary beneficiaries. The representative from the insurance company suggests that Larry find a new spouse so he can name that person as his beneficiary. However, there is no woman in Larry's life that he loves or trusts.\n\nInspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a [[civil union]] with him. Although Chuck declines at first, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees, entering a domestic partnership and becoming Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. To their dismay, however, investigators arrive to inquire about their abrupt partnership, suspecting fraud. Chuck and Larry decide to enlist the help of lawyer Alex McDonough, who suggests they have a formal wedding ceremony to prove they are committed. The pair travel to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], [[Canada]] for a quick [[same-sex marriage]] at a [[wedding chapel]], and Chuck moves in with Larry and his children.\n\nAlex invites the couple to a gay benefit costume party. At the end of the evening, the partygoers are confronted by [[Homophobia|homophobic]] protesters. Chuck is provoked into punching their leader, and the incident is picked up by the local news. With their apparent homosexuality and marriage revealed, Chuck and Larry are heckled, and their fellow FDNY firefighters refuse to work with them. Their only ally is Fred G. Duncan, an angry, intimidating firefighter who reveals to Chuck that he is gay, and has not felt comfortable telling anyone.\n\nChuck becomes romantically interested in Alex after the two spend time together, but finds himself unable to get close to her because she thinks he is gay. During a heart-to-heart talk about relationships, the two spontaneously kiss, but Alex, still believing Chuck is gay and married, is shocked and immediately distances herself from Chuck. Meanwhile, city agent Clinton Fitzer arrives to investigate the couple, and the strain on both Larry and Chuck causes them to fight. Larry asserts that Chuck's constant absence to spend time with Alex is jeopardizing their ability to maintain the ruse of their relationship. Chuck tells Larry that he should stop refusing to move on from the death of his wife. Later that evening, a petition circulates to have Chuck and Larry thrown out of the firehouse. Upon discovering it, Larry confronts the crew about personal embarrassments on the job that Chuck and Larry helped them overcome. Afterwards, Chuck and Larry apologize to each other and reconcile their differences.\n\nEventually, numerous women publicly testify to having slept with Chuck in the recent past, and the couple is called into court to defend their marriage against charges of fraud. They are defended by Alex, and their fellow firefighters arrive in support, having realized all that Chuck and Larry have done for them over the years. Fitzer interrogates both men, and eventually demands the pair to kiss to prove that their relationship is physical. Before they do so, Chuck and Larry are interrupted by FDNY Captain Phineas J. Tucker, who reveals their marriage to be a sham and that they are both [[Heterosexuality|straight]]. He emphasizes that the situation reminded people not to be judgmental, and then offers to be arrested as well, since he knew about the false relationship but failed to report it. This prompts each of the other firefighters to claim a role in the wedding in a show of solidarity. Chuck, Larry, and the other firefighters are sent to jail, but they are quickly released after negotiating a deal to provide photos for an [[AIDS]] research benefit calendar, and Chuck and Larry keep their benefits.\n\nTwo months later, Fred and Alex's brother, Kevin, are married in Niagara Falls at the same chapel as Chuck and Larry. At the wedding party (which features musical guest [[Lance Bass]]), Larry moves on from the death of his wife and talks to a new woman, while Alex agrees to a dance with Chuck.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Charles Todd \"Chuck\" Levine\n* [[Kevin James]] as Lawrence Arthur \"Larry\" Valentine\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Alex McDonough\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Captain Phineas J.

Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) is made lead detective on the case. Evidence in the form of a green pocket knife is found connecting this case to a previous series of abductions which resulted in the conviction of another man many years prior. Harper's family is shown to be going through its own troubles based on an affair his wife, Jackie ([[Helen Hunt]]), had been in engaged in. Their son, Connor (Judah Lewis), is very resentful toward his mother because of the affair.\n\nMysterious events begin plaguing the house; all the silverware and Jackie's favorite coffee mug go missing, and a window repairman is let in by someone inside the house while the family is away. Jackie's former lover, Todd (Sam Trammel), arrives at the house, and is injured when Jackie's coffee mug falls from the roof and hits him on the head. Jackie hides him in the basement so she can take Connor to school. While looking around the basement, Todd is hit over the head by an unknown assailant and Jackie comes home to find him dead. She panics and assumes that Connor has killed Todd. She and Greg take the body to a wooded area and bury his body, hoping to give Connor an alibi.\n\nConnor is shown footage of \"phrogging\", a practice in which people hide in a house unbeknownst to the owners and move around freely when alone in the house, and is attacked by a figure in a frog mask. Greg and Jackie find Connor tied up in the bathtub with a green pocket knife nearby. Jackie drives Connor to the hospital while Greg searches the house and is attacked with an axe by the frog-masked figure.\n\nThe film then jumps back in time and reveals that the mysterious happenings in the house are caused by two people, Mindy (Libe Barer) and Alec (Owen Teague), who have been \"phrogging\" in the Harper home. Mindy, an experienced phrogger, tries to keep a very low profile so that she never gets caught, while novice phrogger Alec decides he wants to make the family believe they are going insane. Every mysterious occurrence in the film is shown to have been caused by Alec, including the missing silverware and Todd's incapacitation. However, while Todd is in the basement, Mindy witnesses Greg killing him and goes to alert Alec, only to see him incapacitating Connor in the bathtub. She argues with Alec, who mistakenly pushes her down the stairs and knocks her out. Alec hides her in Greg's car. Greg and Jackie find Connor in the bathtub and Jackie takes him to the hospital. After Jackie leaves, Greg takes his own car, taking Mindy with him without realizing it.\n\nMindy awakens in the car and finds a bag of green pocket knives and Justin Whitter's shirt, realizing that Greg is the kidnapper. Greg parks in the forest, where Mindy finds an old trailer with all the abducted children trapped in make-shift closets. As Mindy tries to free them, Greg ambushes her and returns to the house with her. He forces her to stand up before shooting her dead, then doctors the scene to make it appear that she attacked him and he killed her in self-defense. Alec gets Greg's attention and attacks him with an axe. Greg knocks Alec out, but he stirs and takes Greg's gun. Revealing that he knows Greg's identity as the kidnapper, Alec reveals his face to Greg, who appears to recognize him. Greg attempts to explain himself, but Alec makes it clear that he does not care before shooting and killing Greg. Greg's partner Spitzky arrives and shoots Alec, but Alec survives and the two recognize each other. \n\nThe boys are rescued from the trailer and Greg's bags containing the police evidence are found. Jackie and Connor arrive to find their home has become swarmed with police cars and ambulances. Flashbacks are shown of a younger Alec and a friend encountering Greg, who hands Alec a green pocket knife, as in the present day Alec - a previous victim of Greg's - is carried into an ambulance.  This explains why, earlier in the film, that Alec picked that particular house to phrog and begged Mindy to come with him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Helen Hunt]] as Jackie Harper\n*[[Jon Tenney]] as Greg Harper\n*[[Judah Lewis]] as Connor Harper\n*[[Owen Teague]] as Alec\n*[[Libe Barer]] as Mindy\n*[[Gregory Alan Williams]] as Spitzky\n*[[Erika Alexander]] as Lieutenant Moriah Davis\n*Allison King as Officer Grace Caleb\n*Adam Kern as Window Repairman\n*[[Sam Trammell]] as Todd\n*Jeremy Gladen as Tommy Braun\n*Teri Clark as Mrs. Braun\n*[[Nicole Forester]] as Mrs. Whitter\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nPrincipal photography took place in May 2018 in [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Lakewood, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldfarb|first=Rebecca|title=Helen Hunt Has a Rockin' Start to Her Time Filming in Cleveland|date=22 May 2018|newspaper=[[Cleveland Scene]]|url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2018/05/22/helen-hunt-has-a-rockin-start-to-her-time-filming-in-cleveland|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Matt|title=On the set of \"I See You,\" Helen Hunt movie filming in Northeast Ohio|date=22 May 2018|publisher=[[WJW (TV)]]|url=https://fox8.com/2018/05/22/on-the-set-of-i-see-you-helen-hunt-movie-filming-in-northeast-ohio/|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Extras wanted for Helen Hunt horror movie being filmed in Cleveland area|date=22 May 2018|publisher=[[WJW (TV)]]|url=https://fox8.com/2018/05/22/extras-wanted-for-helen-hunt-horror-movie-being-filmed-in-cleveland-area/|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Grater|first=Tom|title=First look: Helen Hunt horror 'I See You' completes cast, shoot underway (exclusive)|date=14 May 2018|work=[[Screen Daily]]|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/first-look-helen-hunt-horror-i-see-you-completes-cast-shoot-underway-exclusive/5129283.article|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''I See You'' holds an approval rating of 70%, based on 30 reviews, and an average rating of 5.92/10.

Their son, Connor (Judah Lewis), is very resentful toward his mother because of the affair.\n\nMysterious events begin plaguing the house; all the silverware and Jackie's favorite coffee mug go missing, and a window repairman is let in by someone inside the house while the family is away. Jackie's former lover, Todd (Sam Trammel), arrives at the house, and is injured when Jackie's coffee mug falls from the roof and hits him on the head. Jackie hides him in the basement so she can take Connor to school. While looking around the basement, Todd is hit over the head by an unknown assailant and Jackie comes home to find him dead. She panics and assumes that Connor has killed Todd. She and Greg take the body to a wooded area and bury his body, hoping to give Connor an alibi.\n\nConnor is shown footage of \"phrogging\", a practice in which people hide in a house unbeknownst to the owners and move around freely when alone in the house, and is attacked by a figure in a frog mask. Greg and Jackie find Connor tied up in the bathtub with a green pocket knife nearby. Jackie drives Connor to the hospital while Greg searches the house and is attacked with an axe by the frog-masked figure.\n\nThe film then jumps back in time and reveals that the mysterious happenings in the house are caused by two people, Mindy (Libe Barer) and Alec (Owen Teague), who have been \"phrogging\" in the Harper home. Mindy, an experienced phrogger, tries to keep a very low profile so that she never gets caught, while novice phrogger Alec decides he wants to make the family believe they are going insane. Every mysterious occurrence in the film is shown to have been caused by Alec, including the missing silverware and Todd's incapacitation. However, while Todd is in the basement, Mindy witnesses Greg killing him and goes to alert Alec, only to see him incapacitating Connor in the bathtub. She argues with Alec, who mistakenly pushes her down the stairs and knocks her out. Alec hides her in Greg's car. Greg and Jackie find Connor in the bathtub and Jackie takes him to the hospital. After Jackie leaves, Greg takes his own car, taking Mindy with him without realizing it.\n\nMindy awakens in the car and finds a bag of green pocket knives and Justin Whitter's shirt, realizing that Greg is the kidnapper. Greg parks in the forest, where Mindy finds an old trailer with all the abducted children trapped in make-shift closets. As Mindy tries to free them, Greg ambushes her and returns to the house with her. He forces her to stand up before shooting her dead, then doctors the scene to make it appear that she attacked him and he killed her in self-defense. Alec gets Greg's attention and attacks him with an axe. Greg knocks Alec out, but he stirs and takes Greg's gun. Revealing that he knows Greg's identity as the kidnapper, Alec reveals his face to Greg, who appears to recognize him. Greg attempts to explain himself, but Alec makes it clear that he does not care before shooting and killing Greg. Greg's partner Spitzky arrives and shoots Alec, but Alec survives and the two recognize each other. \n\nThe boys are rescued from the trailer and Greg's bags containing the police evidence are found. Jackie and Connor arrive to find their home has become swarmed with police cars and ambulances. Flashbacks are shown of a younger Alec and a friend encountering Greg, who hands Alec a green pocket knife, as in the present day Alec - a previous victim of Greg's - is carried into an ambulance.  This explains why, earlier in the film, that Alec picked that particular house to phrog and begged Mindy to come with him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Helen Hunt]] as Jackie Harper\n*[[Jon Tenney]] as Greg Harper\n*[[Judah Lewis]] as Connor Harper\n*[[Owen Teague]] as Alec\n*[[Libe Barer]] as Mindy\n*[[Gregory Alan Williams]] as Spitzky\n*[[Erika Alexander]] as Lieutenant Moriah Davis\n*Allison King as Officer Grace Caleb\n*Adam Kern as Window Repairman\n*[[Sam Trammell]] as Todd\n*Jeremy Gladen as Tommy Braun\n*Teri Clark as Mrs. Braun\n*[[Nicole Forester]] as Mrs. Whitter\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nPrincipal photography took place in May 2018 in [[Chagrin Falls]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Lakewood, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldfarb|first=Rebecca|title=Helen Hunt Has a Rockin' Start to Her Time Filming in Cleveland|date=22 May 2018|newspaper=[[Cleveland Scene]]|url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2018/05/22/helen-hunt-has-a-rockin-start-to-her-time-filming-in-cleveland|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Matt|title=On the set of \"I See You,\" Helen Hunt movie filming in Northeast Ohio|date=22 May 2018|publisher=[[WJW (TV)]]|url=https://fox8.com/2018/05/22/on-the-set-of-i-see-you-helen-hunt-movie-filming-in-northeast-ohio/|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Extras wanted for Helen Hunt horror movie being filmed in Cleveland area|date=22 May 2018|publisher=[[WJW (TV)]]|url=https://fox8.com/2018/05/22/extras-wanted-for-helen-hunt-horror-movie-being-filmed-in-cleveland-area/|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Grater|first=Tom|title=First look: Helen Hunt horror 'I See You' completes cast, shoot underway (exclusive)|date=14 May 2018|work=[[Screen Daily]]|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/first-look-helen-hunt-horror-i-see-you-completes-cast-shoot-underway-exclusive/5129283.article|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''I See You'' holds an approval rating of 70%, based on 30 reviews, and an average rating of 5.92/10.

Now detesting Chakor, she joins hands with Kamal; they stab and throw Chakor in a river with help from goons.\n\n===1 month later===\n\nAs the river reaches [[Varanasi]], Chakor is shown to be saved by a priest, living with him in his house. A doctor reveals that Chakor is pregnant. Brainwashed by Imli, Suraj believes Chakor left him. Chakor contacts Imli who tells her Suraj wants to kill her so she do not return to Azadganj.\n\nLater, Chakor is asked and shifted to live in Ranvijay Singh's house. Ranvijay is an inspector vowing to avenge his father Rajan's death from Rajan's business rival by killing the businessman's son. Suraj visits Varanasi; he and Chakor meet and sort out all things, wanting answers from Imli.\n\nChakor finds out Rajan's business rival is Kamal and Ranvijay is vowing to kill Suraj. She tells Suraj. Ranvijay sees them and realises he wants to kill Suraj. He kidnaps him and tries to forcefully marry Chakor, but they get him arrested and return to Azadganj.\n\nImli tells them that she lied to save them from Kamal, and they forgive her. Kamal kidnaps and pushes Chakor resulting her to fall and thus losing her baby. To avenge for it, Chakor kills Kamal thus also avenging Chunni and Savitri's deaths and making Azadganj independent, but is jailed for 5 years.\n\n===5 years later===\n\nChakor gets released and firstly meets Kasturi, Bhuvan and the villagers. She then visits the Rajvanshi mansion, and learns all of Imli's misdeeds. It is discovered that Imli helped Ranvijay to escape and married him, who hit Suraj on his head leading Suraj to lose his memory, and they appointed him as their servant.\n\nImli is now the head of Azadganj, mistreating the villagers just like Kamal. Tejaswini is being locked by Imli in a secret room of Rajvanshi mansion, while Vivaan is still in coma. Suraj recalls everything and unites with Chakor; they free Tejaswini and go to punish Imli, who shoots Ranvijay to death and escapes. Azadganj gets independence again.\n\n===2 years later===\n\nChakor and Suraj live happily with their family and have a daughter named Saanvi. They start a business, and become rivals with Karan Oberoi, a successful business tycoon. Imli returns to have labouring back in Azadganj and joins hands with the antagonistic Karan to destory Chakor.\n\nLater, Karan dies in an accident, whereas Imli gets exposed as Vivaan wakes up from coma. He has her arrested. Eventually, she is released. Imli's former gun dealer Colonel Yashwant Bedi tries to kill Suraj for a lie. Chakor is about to shoot him to stop him but Vivaan comes in between and dies. Yashwant is arrested. \n\nImli swears revenge for Vivaan's death and kidnaps Saanvi. Imli's goons throw a doll whose size is that of Saanvi in a river, due to which everyone presume Saanvi dead. Suraj blames Chakor for it and severes all ties with her. Chakor, Kasturi and Bhuvan leave Azadganj, while Imli makes Saanvi labourer and hands her to an Azadganj new couple.\n\n===7 years later===\n\nChakor, Kasturi and Bhuvan reside in [[Mumbai]]. Saanvi is being raised by the same couple Sugna and Kesho. She is known in Azadganj with the name of Anjor. Chakor returns to Azadganj for some work. Some goons kidnap Saanvi but Chakor rescues her by defeating them. The two begin to share a friendship, unaware of their relation.Suraj also come back azadganj and meet anjor soon Suraj and chakor find out that anjor is their daughter saanvi and anjor also accept Suraj and chakor\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Spandan Chaturvedi]] as young Chakor Singh (2014\u201316)/ young Chunni: Kasturi and Bhuvan's daughter;

In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympiad]], 688 BC. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Boxing' in ''Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, p.402, pp.415-416, 419-422</ref>\n\nBoxing was a popular spectator [[sport]] in [[Ancient Rome]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sports Spectators from Antiquity to the Renaissance|last1=Guttmann|first1=Allen|year=1981|volume=8|issue=2|journal=Journal of Sport History|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822123753/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|archive-date=22 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped [[leather]] thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a [[weapon]]. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the [[cestus]]. Fighting events were held at Roman [[Amphitheatres]]. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman [[gladiator]] period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Early London prize ring rules===\n[[File:Blow2.jpg|thumb|left|A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price's ''The Science of Defence: A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling'', 1867]]\n\nRecords of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western [[Roman Empire]] when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting [[sports]] that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in [[ancient Rus]] called [[Russian fist fighting|Kulachniy Boy]] or \"Fist Fighting\".\n\nAs the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]] sometimes referred to as '''prizefighting'''. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the ''London Protestant Mercury'', and the first English bare-knuckle champion was [[James Figg]] in 1719.<ref name=\"Roberts-1999\">{{cite web |title=James Figg |url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/pioneer/figg.html |date=1999 |publisher=[[IBHOF]] |accessdate=2018-03-22}} excerpting {{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=James B. |last2=Skutt |first2=Alexander G. |title=The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aA2LO_DGdu4C |pages= |accessdate=22 March 2018 |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=McBooks Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |isbn=978-1-59013-121-3|oclc=819715339}}</ref> This is also the time when the word \"boxing\" first came to be used. This earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when [[Christopher Monck]], 2nd [[Duke of Albemarle]] (and later [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]]) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.\n\nEarly fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham, 1713, by [[Parkyns baronets|Sir Thomas Parkyns]], a successful Wrestler from [[Bunny, Nottinghamshire]], who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, ''Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler'', described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |title=tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |publisher=Tumblr |date= |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion [[Jack Broughton]] in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm John Rennie (2006) ''East London Prize Ring Rules 1743''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218094646/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm |date=18 February 2008 }}</ref> Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.\n\n[[File:Cribb vs Molineaux 1811.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Cribb]] vs [[Tom Molineaux]] in a re-match for the heavyweight championship of England, 1811]]\nThese rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered \"unmanly\"<ref>Anonymous (\"A Celebrated Pugilist\"), The Art and Practice of Boxing, 1825</ref> and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers.<ref>Daniel Mendoza, The Modern Art of Boxing, 1790</ref> In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |title=blow-1.jpg |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=16 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024213415/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/classicpugilism/photos/album/1501552404/pic/1874370929/view?picmode=&mode=tn&order=ordinal&start=1&count=20&dir=asc |title=Yahoo!

Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned.\nThe introduction of [[boxing gloves|gloves]] of \"fair-size\" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2006).

As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\nThrough the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy.

Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent.

A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.\n\nUp to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been \"robbed\" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more \"seconds\" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round.\n\nA bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to \"go the distance\". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended \"inside the distance\". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions [[Mandatory eight count|require the referee to count to eight]] regardless of if the fighter gets up before.\n\nShould the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled \"knocked out\" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by [[knockout]] (KO). A \"technical knock-out\" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a \"three-knockdown rule\", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A \"standing eight\" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he or she feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he or she is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.\n\n[[File:Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Pattersson 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ingemar Johansson]] of Sweden KO's heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]], 26 June 1959.]]\n\nIn general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a \"rabbit-punch\") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).\n\nIf a \"clinch\" \u2013 a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause \u2013 is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to \"punch out\" of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.\n\nViolations of these rules may be ruled \"fouls\" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a \"no contest\" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.\n\nUnheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a \"newspaper decision (NWS)\" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A \"no decision\" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a \"no decision\" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.\n\n==Professional vs. amateur boxing==\n[[File:Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107 and Roberto Dur\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|left|[[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] (right) held world championships in four weight classes: lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight]]\nThroughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by [[money]], as the fighters competed for [[prize money]], promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result.\n\nThe modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|title=Headgear Protects Boxers' Brains, Mostly|last=Emspak|first=Jesse|date=February 8, 2012|work=DNews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423025636/http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|archive-date=April 23, 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an [[Automated Boxing Scoring System]], which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators.

Here with [[Mary Kom]] of India.]]\n\nAmateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the [[Olympic Games]] and [[Commonwealth Games]], and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.\n\nCompetitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end is just a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under {{convert|165|lb}}, thus allowing them to wear ten ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches \u2013 any boxer repeatedly landing low blows [[below the belt]] is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/amateurs/a/oly_rules.htm |title=Andrew Eisele (2005).

Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like [[Jack Dempsey]]. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the [[Boxing in the 1980s|early 1980s]], when the death of boxer [[Kim Duk-koo]] eventually prompted the [[World Boxing Council]] and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds.\n\nHeadgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.<ref>Bert Randolph Sugar (2001). \"Boxing\", World Book Online Americas Edition [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Owingsmillsboxingclub.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619215358/http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm |date=19 June 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Boxing styles==\n\n===Definition of style===\n\"Style\" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing: '''outside fighter''' (\"boxer\"), '''brawler''' (or \"slugger\"), and '''Inside fighter''' (\"swarmer\"). These styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. It follows the [[rock paper scissors]] scenario - boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |title=The Science of Boxing Styles |publisher=Boxing Training Fitness |accessdate=4 December 2012 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112045101/http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |archivedate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Boxer/out-fighter====\n[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] was a typical example of an out-fighter.]]\n\nA classic \"boxer\" or stylist (also known as an \"out-fighter\") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxingbeginners.com/how_to_box_styles.php|title=Learn about the different boxing styles.

This style was also used by fictional boxer [[Apollo Creed]].\n\n=====Boxer-puncher=====\nA boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/the_15_greatest_composite_punchers_of_all_time.html|title=The 15 Greatest Composite Punchers of All Time |website=Boxing.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.\n\nNotable boxer-punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Canelo \u00c1lvarez]], [[Wladimir Klitschko]], [[Vasyl Lomachenko]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Joe Louis]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.337</ref> [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Oscar De La Hoya]], [[Archie Moore]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Nonito Donaire]], [[Sam Langford]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.120</ref> [[Henry Armstrong]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, Joe Frazier, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.204</ref> [[Sugar Ray Robinson]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.403</ref> [[Tony Zale]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.353,</ref> [[Alexis Arg\u00fcello]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Terry Norris]], [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Naseem Hamed]], [[Thomas Hearns]], [[Julian Jackson (boxer)|Julian Jackson]] and [[Gennady Golovkin]].\n\n=====Counter puncher=====\n[[Counterpunch (boxing)|Counter punchers]] are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.\n\nNotable counter punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Calzaghe]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Max Schmeling]], [[Chris Byrd]], [[James J Corbett|Jim Corbett]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Laszlo Papp]], [[Jerry Quarry]], [[Anselmo Moreno]], [[James Toney]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez]], [[Humberto Soto]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Roger Mayweather]], [[Pernell Whitaker]], [[Sergio Gabriel Martinez]] and [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]]. This style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer [[Little Mac (Punch-Out!!)|Little Mac]].\n\nCounter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.\n\n====Brawler/slugger====\n[[File:George Foreman 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Famous brawler [[George Foreman]]]]\nA brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]] and [[Danny Garc\u00eda]].\n\nA brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). Examples of this style include [[George Foreman]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Sonny Liston]], [[John L Sullivan|John L. Sullivan]], [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]], [[Ray Mancini]], [[David Tua]], [[Arturo Gatti]], [[Micky Ward]], [[Brandon R\u00edos]], [[Ruslan Provodnikov]], [[Michael Katsidis]], [[James Kirkland (boxer)|James Kirkland]], [[Marcos Maidana]], [[Jake LaMotta]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], and Ireland's [[John Duddy]]. This style of boxing was also used by [[fiction]]al boxers Rocky Balboa and James \"Clubber\" Lang.\n\nBrawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch.\n\n====Swarmer/in-fighter====\n[[File:Henry Armstrong 1937.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Armstrong]] was known for his aggressive, non-stop assault style of fighting.]]\nIn-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called \"pressure fighters\") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]] and uppercuts. Mainly [[Mexican people|Mexican]], Irish, [[Irish-American]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], and [[Mexican-American]] boxers popularized this style. A successful in-fighter often needs a good \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\" because swarming usually involves being hit with many [[jab]]s before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.\n\nThe essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters use their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; [[Mike Tyson]] was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. [[Marvin Hagler]] was known for his hard \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.\n\nNotable in-fighters include [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Aaron Pryor]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Shawn Porter]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Rocky Marciano]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.75</ref> [[Wayne McCullough]], [[Gerry Penalosa]], [[Harry Greb]],<ref>James Roberts, Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.98, 99</ref><ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.339, 340</ref> [[David Tua]], [[James Toney]] and [[Ricky Hatton]]. This style was also used by the ''Street Fighter'' character [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]].\n\n===Combinations of styles===\nAll fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches.\n\nOld history of the development of boxing and its prevalence contribute to fusion of various types of martial arts and the emergence of new ones that are based on them. For example, a combination of boxing and sportive sambo techniques gave rise to a combat sambo.\n\n===Style matchups===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Louis|Louis]] vs. [[Max Schmeling|Schmeling]], 1936]]\n\nThere is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in [[rock paper scissors]]. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the clich\u00e9 amongst boxing fans and writers that \"styles make fights.\"\n\nBrawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be [[George Foreman]]'s knockout victory over [[Joe Frazier]] in their original bout \"The Sunshine Showdown\".\n\nAlthough in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in their three fights. [[Joe Louis]], after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ [[Rocky Marciano]] would have caused him style problems even in his prime.\n\nThe boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.\n\nAn example of a style matchup was the historical fight of [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], a swarmer or in-fighter, against [[Meldrick Taylor]], the boxer or out-fighter (see [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. Meldrick Taylor]]). The match was nicknamed \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to punching power of Ch\u00e1vez and blinding speed of Taylor. Ch\u00e1vez was the epitome of the \"Mexican\" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Ch\u00e1vez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Ch\u00e1vez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Ch\u00e1vez, which only gave Ch\u00e1vez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Ch\u00e1vez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Ch\u00e1vez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Ch\u00e1vez could knock him out.\nWith about a minute left in the round, Ch\u00e1vez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Ch\u00e1vez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Ch\u00e1vez back ahead of him. Suddenly Ch\u00e1vez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Ch\u00e1vez' desperate final flurry. Ch\u00e1vez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Ch\u00e1vez with only two seconds to go in the bout.\n\n==Equipment==\nSince boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent [[Boxer's fracture|damage to bones in the hand]]. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without [[wrist wraps]] and [[boxing gloves]]. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.\n\nA [[mouthguard]] is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.\n\nBoxers practice their skills on several types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped \"speed bag\" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical \"heavy bag\" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. The double-end bag is usually connected by elastic on the top and bottom and moves randomly upon getting struck and helps the fighter work on accuracy and reflexes. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also use sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, [[jump rope]], and [[medicine balls]].\n\nBoxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. In addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately.\n\nBoxing matches typically take place in a [[boxing ring]], a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\n==Technique==\n{{main|Boxing styles and technique}}\n\n===Stance===\nThe modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:attitude_droite1.jpg|''Upright stance''\nFile:attitude_semi-enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Semi-crouch''\nFile:attitude_enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Full crouch''\n</gallery>\n\nIn a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the \"textbook\" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. In order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Footwork' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref>\n\nDifferent stances allow for bodyweight to be differently positioned and emphasised; this may in turn alter how powerfully and explosively a type of punch can be delivered. For instance, a crouched stance allows for the bodyweight to be positioned further forward over the lead left leg. If a lead left hook is thrown from this position, it will produce a powerful springing action in the lead leg and produce a more explosive punch. This springing action could not be generated effectively, for this punch, if an upright stance was used or if the bodyweight was positioned predominantly over the back leg.<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Stance' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref> [[Mike Tyson]] was a keen practitioner of a crouched stance and this style of power punching. The preparatory positioning of the bodyweight over the bent lead leg is also known as an [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric preload]].\n\nLeft-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The [[southpaw stance]], conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.\n\nNorth American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.\n\n===Punches===\nThere are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:jab7.jpg|''[[Jab]]''\nFile:Drop3.jpg|''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] '' - in counter-punch with a looping\nFile:crochet1.jpg|''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''\nFile:uppercut2.jpg|''[[Uppercut]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Jab]]''' \u2013 A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab extends from the side of the torso and typically does not pass in front of it. It is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.\n** The jab is recognized as the most important punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A half-step may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or wear down their opponents to some effect include [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]].\n* '''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]]''' \u2013 A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Boxing for Fitness: Straight Right|url=http://nwfighting.com/fitnessboxing.html|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n** Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer give the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counter punch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook. The cross is also called a \"straight\" or \"right\", especially if it does not cross the opponent's outstretched jab.\n* '''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''' \u2013 A semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (palm facing down) though in modern times a wide percentage of fighters throw the hook with a vertical fist (palm facing themselves). The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target.\n** At the same time, the lead foot pivots clockwise, turning the left heel outwards. Upon contact, the hook's circular path ends abruptly and the lead hand is pulled quickly back into the guard position. A hook may also target the lower body and this technique is sometimes called the \"rip\" to distinguish it from the conventional hook to the head. The hook may also be thrown with the rear hand. Notable left hookers include [[Joe Frazier]], [[Roy Jones, Jr.|Roy Jones Jr.]] and [[Mike Tyson]].\n[[File:Boxing080905 photoshop.jpg|thumb|[[Ricardo Dominguez]] (''left'') throws an [[uppercut]] on [[Rafael Ortiz]] (''right'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Herbert G.|title=Boxing: A Worldwide Record of Bouts and Boxers|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=NC, USA|isbn=978-0-7864-6054-0|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509012702/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|archive-date=9 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n* '''[[Uppercut]]''' \u2013 A vertical, rising punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts slightly to the right, the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.\n** At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to \"lift\" the opponent's body, setting it off-balance for successive attacks. The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent's chin into a vulnerable position, then the hook to knock the opponent out.\n\nThese different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or \"combos.\" The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the \"one-two combo.\" This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.\n\nA large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a \"roundhouse,\" \"haymaker,\" \"overhand,\" or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard.\n\nWide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.\n\nAnother unconventional punch is the rarely used [[bolo punch]], in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.\n\nAn illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a [[rabbit punch]].\n\nBoth the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement.\n\n===Defense===\nThere are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:slip1.jpg|''[[Slipping]]''\nFile:slip2.jpg|''[[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]]''\nFile:blocage1.jpg|''[[Blocking (martial arts)|Blocking]] (with the arms)''\nFile:protection passive1.jpg|''[[Covering (martial arts)|Cover-Up]] (with the gloves)''\nFile:neutraliser1.jpg|''[[Clinch fighting|Clinching]]''\nFile:pas de retrait.jpg|''[[Footwork (martial arts)|Footwork]]''\nFile:retrait2.jpg|''Pulling away''\n</gallery>\n* '''Slip''' \u2013 [[Slipping]] rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to \"slip\" past. [[Muhammad Ali]] was famous for extremely fast and close slips, as was an early [[Mike Tyson]].\n* '''Sway or fade''' \u2013 To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called \"rolling with the punch\" or \" Riding The Punch\".\n* '''Duck''' or '''break''' \u2013 To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely.\n* '''Bob and weave''' \u2013 [[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]] moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer \"weaves\" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the outside\". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the inside\". Joe Frazier, Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving.\n* '''Parry/block''' \u2013 [[Parrying]] or [[Blocking (martial arts)|blocking]] uses the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A \"palm\", \"catch\", or \"cuff\" is a defence which intentionally takes the incoming punch on the palm portion of the defender's glove.\n* '''The cover-up''' \u2013 Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches \"roll\" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.\n* The '''[[grappling position#Stand-up positions|clinch]]''' \u2013 Clinching is a form of [[Trapping (martial arts)|trapping]] or a rough form of [[grappling]] and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to [[grappling hold|hold]] or \"tie up\" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or [[uppercut]]s. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. [[Clinching position|Clinching]] is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.\n\n===Unorthodox strategies===\n* '''The \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" strategy''': Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 \"[[the Rumble in the Jungle]]\" bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying back against the ropes, covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches. The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as he would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault. Recently, however, [[Octuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]] skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist [[Miguel Cotto]] in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit with a withering knockdown. [[Tyson Fury]] also attempted this against Francesco Pianeto but didn't pull it off as smoothly.\n* '''[[Bolo punch]]''': Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which owes its power to the shortening of a [[circular arc]] rather than to transference of body weight; it tends to have more of an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali shuffle]]. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former [[welterweight]] champions [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], and [[Kid Gavil\u00e1n]] as well as current British fighter [[Chris Eubank Jr.|Chris Eubank Jr]]. Middleweight champion [[Ceferino Garcia]] is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.\n<gallery>\nFile:contre_bolo1.jpg| ''[[Bolo punch]]''\nFile:drop1.jpg| ''[[overhand (boxing)|Overhand (overcut)]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand]]''': The overhand is a punch, thrown from the rear hand, not found in every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Tim Witherspoon]], as well as MMA champions [[Chuck Liddell]] and [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. The overhand has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking. [[Deontay Wilder]] heavily favours and is otherwise known for knocking many of his opponents out with one of his right overhands.\n* '''[[Check hook]]''': A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part consists of a regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] employed the use of a check hook against [[Ricky Hatton]], which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.\n\n==Ring corner==\n[[File:2017-12-02 Tina Rupprecht - Anne Sophie Da Costa - DSC2771.jpg|thumb|right|Female boxer [[Tina Rupprecht]] receiving instructions from her trainer while being treated by her cutman in the ring corner between rounds.]]\nIn boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the [[cutman]]. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous [[physician|doctor]] responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts, blood and excessive swelling. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts or swelling that threaten the boxer's eyes.\n\nIn addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase \"to throw in the towel\", meaning to give up, derives from this practice).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/throw-in-the-towel.html |title=Phrases.org |publisher=Phrases.org |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> This can be seen in the fight between [[Diego Corrales]] and [[Floyd Mayweather]]. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.\n\n==Medical concerns==\n{{see also|Dementia pugilistica|The distance (boxing)#Distance change criticisms}}\nKnocking a person unconscious or even causing a [[concussion]] may cause permanent [[brain damage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020918102719/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 September 2002|title=Boxing: The health risks|access-date=6 May 2010}}</ref> There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/4437|title=Better and Safer Boxing: Ringside and Boardroom Medical Control of Boxing Careers in the Twentieth Century|website=Dora.dmu.ac.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=June 2006|last1=Carter|first1=Neil}}</ref> From 1980 to 2007, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and [[Toughman Contest|Toughman]] fighters died due to ring or training injuries.<ref>Svinth, Joseph R.

Boxing is overseen by a [[referee (boxing)|referee]] over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds.\n\nA winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or [[Submission (combat sports)|resignation]] of an opponent.  When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the [[Professional boxing#Scoring|judges' scorecards]] determine the victor. In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a [[Tie (draw)|draw]]. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.\n\nWhile humans have fought in [[hand-to-hand combat]] since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting [[sport]]ing contests date back to the [[ancient Near East]] in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.<ref name=\"EncyclopaediaBritannicaEntry\"/> The earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to [[Ancient Greece]], where boxing was established as an [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic game]] in 688 BC.<ref name=\"EncyclopaediaBritannicaEntry\"/> Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{see also|Ancient Greek boxing}}\n[[File:Young boxers fresco, Akrotiri, Greece.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A painting of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] youths boxing, from an [[Akrotiri (prehistoric city)|Akrotiri]] fresco circa 1650 BC.

The earliest references to [[musti-yuddha]] come from [[Indian epic poetry|classical Vedic epics]] such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Rig Veda]]''. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' describes two combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04013.htm Section XIII: ''Samayapalana Parva''], Book 4: ''Virata Parva'', ''[[Mahabharata]]''.</ref> Duels (''niyuddham'') were often fought to the death.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} During the period of the [[Western Satraps]], the ruler [[Rudradaman]] - in addition to being well-versed in \"the great sciences\" which included [[Indian classical music]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit grammar]], and logic - was said to be an excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and boxer.<ref>{{cite book|title=India: A History|author=John Keay|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|isbn=978-0-00-255717-7|page=131|quote=[Rudradaman] was also a fine swordsman and boxer, and excellent horseman, charioteer and elephant-rider ... and far-famed for his knowledge of grammar, music, logic and 'other great sciences'.|author-link=John Keay}}</ref> The ''Gurbilas Shemi'', an 18th-century Sikh text, gives numerous references to musti-yuddha.\n\nIn [[Ancient Greece]] boxing was a well developed sport and enjoyed consistent popularity. In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympiad]], 688 BC. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Boxing' in ''Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, p.402, pp.415-416, 419-422</ref>\n\nBoxing was a popular spectator [[sport]] in [[Ancient Rome]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sports Spectators from Antiquity to the Renaissance|last1=Guttmann|first1=Allen|year=1981|volume=8|issue=2|journal=Journal of Sport History|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822123753/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|archive-date=22 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped [[leather]] thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a [[weapon]]. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the [[cestus]]. Fighting events were held at Roman [[Amphitheatres]]. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman [[gladiator]] period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Early London prize ring rules===\n[[File:Blow2.jpg|thumb|left|A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price's ''The Science of Defence: A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling'', 1867]]\n\nRecords of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western [[Roman Empire]] when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting [[sports]] that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in [[ancient Rus]] called [[Russian fist fighting|Kulachniy Boy]] or \"Fist Fighting\".\n\nAs the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]] sometimes referred to as '''prizefighting'''. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the ''London Protestant Mercury'', and the first English bare-knuckle champion was [[James Figg]] in 1719.<ref name=\"Roberts-1999\">{{cite web |title=James Figg |url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/pioneer/figg.html |date=1999 |publisher=[[IBHOF]] |accessdate=2018-03-22}} excerpting {{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=James B. |last2=Skutt |first2=Alexander G. |title=The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aA2LO_DGdu4C |pages= |accessdate=22 March 2018 |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=McBooks Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |isbn=978-1-59013-121-3|oclc=819715339}}</ref> This is also the time when the word \"boxing\" first came to be used. This earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when [[Christopher Monck]], 2nd [[Duke of Albemarle]] (and later [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]]) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.\n\nEarly fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham, 1713, by [[Parkyns baronets|Sir Thomas Parkyns]], a successful Wrestler from [[Bunny, Nottinghamshire]], who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, ''Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler'', described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |title=tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |publisher=Tumblr |date= |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion [[Jack Broughton]] in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm John Rennie (2006) ''East London Prize Ring Rules 1743''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218094646/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm |date=18 February 2008 }}</ref> Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.\n\n[[File:Cribb vs Molineaux 1811.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Cribb]] vs [[Tom Molineaux]] in a re-match for the heavyweight championship of England, 1811]]\nThese rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered \"unmanly\"<ref>Anonymous (\"A Celebrated Pugilist\"), The Art and Practice of Boxing, 1825</ref> and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers.<ref>Daniel Mendoza, The Modern Art of Boxing, 1790</ref> In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |title=blow-1.jpg |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=16 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024213415/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/classicpugilism/photos/album/1501552404/pic/1874370929/view?picmode=&mode=tn&order=ordinal&start=1&count=20&dir=asc |title=Yahoo!

Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned.\nThe introduction of [[boxing gloves|gloves]] of \"fair-size\" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2006). ''Queensbury Rules'', Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref>\nThe gloves can be used to block an opponent's blows. As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\nThrough the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy. Outlawed in England and much of the United States, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/11/15/unlicensed_boxing_feature.shtml|title=BBC - London - History - Unlicensed Boxing|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences. Still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics.\n[[File:Amateur Boxing Club, Porthaethwy (7005565417).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Amateur Boxing Club, Wales 1963]]\nThe English case of ''[[R v.

A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world. Places like Mexico, Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of boxing. Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent. According to Rubin, \"boxing lost its appeal with the American middle class, and most of who boxes in modern America come from the streets and are street fighters\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Louis D.|date=2000|title=The Manly art of Modified Mayhem: Dempsey and Others|jstor=27548887|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=108|issue=3|pages=412\u2013432}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n{{main|Marquess of Queensberry Rules}}\nThe ''[[Marquess of Queensberry rules]]'' have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules|title=Marquess of Queensberry rules {{!}} boxing|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref>\n\nA boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds. A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.\n\nUp to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been \"robbed\" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more \"seconds\" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round.\n\nA bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to \"go the distance\". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended \"inside the distance\". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions [[Mandatory eight count|require the referee to count to eight]] regardless of if the fighter gets up before.\n\nShould the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled \"knocked out\" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by [[knockout]] (KO). A \"technical knock-out\" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a \"three-knockdown rule\", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A \"standing eight\" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he or she feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he or she is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.\n\n[[File:Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Pattersson 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ingemar Johansson]] of Sweden KO's heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]], 26 June 1959.]]\n\nIn general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a \"rabbit-punch\") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).\n\nIf a \"clinch\" \u2013 a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause \u2013 is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to \"punch out\" of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.\n\nViolations of these rules may be ruled \"fouls\" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a \"no contest\" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.\n\nUnheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a \"newspaper decision (NWS)\" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A \"no decision\" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a \"no decision\" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.\n\n==Professional vs. amateur boxing==\n[[File:Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107 and Roberto Dur\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|left|[[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] (right) held world championships in four weight classes: lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight]]\nThroughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by [[money]], as the fighters competed for [[prize money]], promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result.\n\nThe modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|title=Headgear Protects Boxers' Brains, Mostly|last=Emspak|first=Jesse|date=February 8, 2012|work=DNews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423025636/http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|archive-date=April 23, 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an [[Automated Boxing Scoring System]], which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career. Western boxers typically participate in one Olympics and then turn pro, Cubans and other socialist countries have an opportunity to collect multiple medals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/northern-ireland/19153615|title=Barry McGuigan explains Cuban boxing success|date=18 April 2013|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In 2016, professional boxers were admitted in the [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and other tournaments sanctioned by [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|AIBA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/01/professional-boxers-allowed-compete-at-rio-olympics|title=Professional boxers will be allowed to compete at Rio Olympics|work=The Guardian}}</ref> This was done in part to level the playing field and give all of the athletes the same opportunities government-sponsored boxers from socialist countries and post-Soviet republics have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/feature-articles/46924-president-john-brown-wrecking-ball|title=Feisty USA Boxing President John Brown Sees Better Times Ahead|work=The Sweet Science}}</ref> However, [[List of boxing organisations#Professional organisations|professional organizations]] strongly opposed that decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/wbc-forbids-its-champions-and-ranked-fighters-from-going-to-olympics/|title=WBC forbids its champions and ranked fighters from going to Olympics|work=boxingnewsonline.net|access-date=21 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052210/http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/wbc-forbids-its-champions-and-ranked-fighters-from-going-to-olympics/|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/sports/olympics/pro-boxers-at-the-olympics.html|title=Pro Boxers at the Olympics: An Opportunity, or a Dangerous Power Grab?}}</ref>\n\n===Amateur boxing===\n{{Main|Amateur boxing}}\n[[File:Nicola adams crop.PNG|thumb|upright=1.45|[[Nicola Adams]] is the first female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal. Here with [[Mary Kom]] of India.]]\n\nAmateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the [[Olympic Games]] and [[Commonwealth Games]], and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.\n\nCompetitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end is just a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under {{convert|165|lb}}, thus allowing them to wear ten ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches \u2013 any boxer repeatedly landing low blows [[below the belt]] is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/amateurs/a/oly_rules.htm |title=Andrew Eisele (2005).

There are also some two-<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=329616 |title=BoxRec Boxing Records |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> and three-round professional bouts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=521719 |title=BoxRec Boxing Records |publisher=Boxrec.com |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> especially in Australia. Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like [[Jack Dempsey]]. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the [[Boxing in the 1980s|early 1980s]], when the death of boxer [[Kim Duk-koo]] eventually prompted the [[World Boxing Council]] and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds.\n\nHeadgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.<ref>Bert Randolph Sugar (2001). \"Boxing\", World Book Online Americas Edition [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Owingsmillsboxingclub.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619215358/http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm |date=19 June 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Boxing styles==\n\n===Definition of style===\n\"Style\" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing: '''outside fighter''' (\"boxer\"), '''brawler''' (or \"slugger\"), and '''Inside fighter''' (\"swarmer\"). These styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. It follows the [[rock paper scissors]] scenario - boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |title=The Science of Boxing Styles |publisher=Boxing Training Fitness |accessdate=4 December 2012 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112045101/http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |archivedate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Boxer/out-fighter====\n[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] was a typical example of an out-fighter.]]\n\nA classic \"boxer\" or stylist (also known as an \"out-fighter\") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxingbeginners.com/how_to_box_styles.php|title=Learn about the different boxing styles.

This style was also used by fictional boxer [[Apollo Creed]].\n\n=====Boxer-puncher=====\nA boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/the_15_greatest_composite_punchers_of_all_time.html|title=The 15 Greatest Composite Punchers of All Time |website=Boxing.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.\n\nNotable boxer-punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Canelo \u00c1lvarez]], [[Wladimir Klitschko]], [[Vasyl Lomachenko]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Joe Louis]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.337</ref> [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Oscar De La Hoya]], [[Archie Moore]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Nonito Donaire]], [[Sam Langford]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.120</ref> [[Henry Armstrong]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, Joe Frazier, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.204</ref> [[Sugar Ray Robinson]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.403</ref> [[Tony Zale]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.353,</ref> [[Alexis Arg\u00fcello]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Terry Norris]], [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Naseem Hamed]], [[Thomas Hearns]], [[Julian Jackson (boxer)|Julian Jackson]] and [[Gennady Golovkin]].\n\n=====Counter puncher=====\n[[Counterpunch (boxing)|Counter punchers]] are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.\n\nNotable counter punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Calzaghe]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Max Schmeling]], [[Chris Byrd]], [[James J Corbett|Jim Corbett]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Laszlo Papp]], [[Jerry Quarry]], [[Anselmo Moreno]], [[James Toney]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez]], [[Humberto Soto]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Roger Mayweather]], [[Pernell Whitaker]], [[Sergio Gabriel Martinez]] and [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]]. This style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer [[Little Mac (Punch-Out!!)|Little Mac]].\n\nCounter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.\n\n====Brawler/slugger====\n[[File:George Foreman 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Famous brawler [[George Foreman]]]]\nA brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]] and [[Danny Garc\u00eda]].\n\nA brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). Examples of this style include [[George Foreman]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Sonny Liston]], [[John L Sullivan|John L. Sullivan]], [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]], [[Ray Mancini]], [[David Tua]], [[Arturo Gatti]], [[Micky Ward]], [[Brandon R\u00edos]], [[Ruslan Provodnikov]], [[Michael Katsidis]], [[James Kirkland (boxer)|James Kirkland]], [[Marcos Maidana]], [[Jake LaMotta]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], and Ireland's [[John Duddy]]. This style of boxing was also used by [[fiction]]al boxers Rocky Balboa and James \"Clubber\" Lang.\n\nBrawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch.\n\n====Swarmer/in-fighter====\n[[File:Henry Armstrong 1937.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Armstrong]] was known for his aggressive, non-stop assault style of fighting.]]\nIn-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called \"pressure fighters\") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]] and uppercuts. Mainly [[Mexican people|Mexican]], Irish, [[Irish-American]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], and [[Mexican-American]] boxers popularized this style. A successful in-fighter often needs a good \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\" because swarming usually involves being hit with many [[jab]]s before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.\n\nThe essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters use their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; [[Mike Tyson]] was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. [[Marvin Hagler]] was known for his hard \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.\n\nNotable in-fighters include [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Aaron Pryor]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Shawn Porter]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Rocky Marciano]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.75</ref> [[Wayne McCullough]], [[Gerry Penalosa]], [[Harry Greb]],<ref>James Roberts, Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.98, 99</ref><ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.339, 340</ref> [[David Tua]], [[James Toney]] and [[Ricky Hatton]]. This style was also used by the ''Street Fighter'' character [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]].\n\n===Combinations of styles===\nAll fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches.\n\nOld history of the development of boxing and its prevalence contribute to fusion of various types of martial arts and the emergence of new ones that are based on them. For example, a combination of boxing and sportive sambo techniques gave rise to a combat sambo.\n\n===Style matchups===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Louis|Louis]] vs. [[Max Schmeling|Schmeling]], 1936]]\n\nThere is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in [[rock paper scissors]]. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the clich\u00e9 amongst boxing fans and writers that \"styles make fights.\"\n\nBrawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be [[George Foreman]]'s knockout victory over [[Joe Frazier]] in their original bout \"The Sunshine Showdown\".\n\nAlthough in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in their three fights. [[Joe Louis]], after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ [[Rocky Marciano]] would have caused him style problems even in his prime.\n\nThe boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.\n\nAn example of a style matchup was the historical fight of [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], a swarmer or in-fighter, against [[Meldrick Taylor]], the boxer or out-fighter (see [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. Meldrick Taylor]]). The match was nicknamed \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to punching power of Ch\u00e1vez and blinding speed of Taylor. Ch\u00e1vez was the epitome of the \"Mexican\" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Ch\u00e1vez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Ch\u00e1vez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Ch\u00e1vez, which only gave Ch\u00e1vez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Ch\u00e1vez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Ch\u00e1vez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Ch\u00e1vez could knock him out.\nWith about a minute left in the round, Ch\u00e1vez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Ch\u00e1vez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Ch\u00e1vez back ahead of him. Suddenly Ch\u00e1vez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Ch\u00e1vez' desperate final flurry. Ch\u00e1vez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Ch\u00e1vez with only two seconds to go in the bout.\n\n==Equipment==\nSince boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent [[Boxer's fracture|damage to bones in the hand]]. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without [[wrist wraps]] and [[boxing gloves]]. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.\n\nA [[mouthguard]] is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.\n\nBoxers practice their skills on several types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped \"speed bag\" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical \"heavy bag\" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. The double-end bag is usually connected by elastic on the top and bottom and moves randomly upon getting struck and helps the fighter work on accuracy and reflexes. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also use sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, [[jump rope]], and [[medicine balls]].\n\nBoxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. In addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately.\n\nBoxing matches typically take place in a [[boxing ring]], a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\n==Technique==\n{{main|Boxing styles and technique}}\n\n===Stance===\nThe modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:attitude_droite1.jpg|''Upright stance''\nFile:attitude_semi-enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Semi-crouch''\nFile:attitude_enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Full crouch''\n</gallery>\n\nIn a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the \"textbook\" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. In order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Footwork' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref>\n\nDifferent stances allow for bodyweight to be differently positioned and emphasised; this may in turn alter how powerfully and explosively a type of punch can be delivered. For instance, a crouched stance allows for the bodyweight to be positioned further forward over the lead left leg. If a lead left hook is thrown from this position, it will produce a powerful springing action in the lead leg and produce a more explosive punch. This springing action could not be generated effectively, for this punch, if an upright stance was used or if the bodyweight was positioned predominantly over the back leg.<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Stance' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref> [[Mike Tyson]] was a keen practitioner of a crouched stance and this style of power punching. The preparatory positioning of the bodyweight over the bent lead leg is also known as an [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric preload]].\n\nLeft-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The [[southpaw stance]], conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.\n\nNorth American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.\n\n===Punches===\nThere are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:jab7.jpg|''[[Jab]]''\nFile:Drop3.jpg|''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] '' - in counter-punch with a looping\nFile:crochet1.jpg|''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''\nFile:uppercut2.jpg|''[[Uppercut]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Jab]]''' \u2013 A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab extends from the side of the torso and typically does not pass in front of it. It is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.\n** The jab is recognized as the most important punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A half-step may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or wear down their opponents to some effect include [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]].\n* '''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]]''' \u2013 A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Boxing for Fitness: Straight Right|url=http://nwfighting.com/fitnessboxing.html|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n** Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer give the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counter punch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook. The cross is also called a \"straight\" or \"right\", especially if it does not cross the opponent's outstretched jab.\n* '''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''' \u2013 A semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (palm facing down) though in modern times a wide percentage of fighters throw the hook with a vertical fist (palm facing themselves). The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target.\n** At the same time, the lead foot pivots clockwise, turning the left heel outwards. Upon contact, the hook's circular path ends abruptly and the lead hand is pulled quickly back into the guard position. A hook may also target the lower body and this technique is sometimes called the \"rip\" to distinguish it from the conventional hook to the head. The hook may also be thrown with the rear hand. Notable left hookers include [[Joe Frazier]], [[Roy Jones, Jr.|Roy Jones Jr.]] and [[Mike Tyson]].\n[[File:Boxing080905 photoshop.jpg|thumb|[[Ricardo Dominguez]] (''left'') throws an [[uppercut]] on [[Rafael Ortiz]] (''right'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Herbert G.|title=Boxing: A Worldwide Record of Bouts and Boxers|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=NC, USA|isbn=978-0-7864-6054-0|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509012702/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|archive-date=9 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n* '''[[Uppercut]]''' \u2013 A vertical, rising punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts slightly to the right, the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.\n** At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to \"lift\" the opponent's body, setting it off-balance for successive attacks. The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent's chin into a vulnerable position, then the hook to knock the opponent out.\n\nThese different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or \"combos.\" The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the \"one-two combo.\" This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.\n\nA large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a \"roundhouse,\" \"haymaker,\" \"overhand,\" or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard.\n\nWide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.\n\nAnother unconventional punch is the rarely used [[bolo punch]], in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.\n\nAn illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a [[rabbit punch]].\n\nBoth the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement.\n\n===Defense===\nThere are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:slip1.jpg|''[[Slipping]]''\nFile:slip2.jpg|''[[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]]''\nFile:blocage1.jpg|''[[Blocking (martial arts)|Blocking]] (with the arms)''\nFile:protection passive1.jpg|''[[Covering (martial arts)|Cover-Up]] (with the gloves)''\nFile:neutraliser1.jpg|''[[Clinch fighting|Clinching]]''\nFile:pas de retrait.jpg|''[[Footwork (martial arts)|Footwork]]''\nFile:retrait2.jpg|''Pulling away''\n</gallery>\n* '''Slip''' \u2013 [[Slipping]] rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to \"slip\" past. [[Muhammad Ali]] was famous for extremely fast and close slips, as was an early [[Mike Tyson]].\n* '''Sway or fade''' \u2013 To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called \"rolling with the punch\" or \" Riding The Punch\".\n* '''Duck''' or '''break''' \u2013 To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely.\n* '''Bob and weave''' \u2013 [[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]] moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer \"weaves\" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the outside\". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the inside\". Joe Frazier, Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving.\n* '''Parry/block''' \u2013 [[Parrying]] or [[Blocking (martial arts)|blocking]] uses the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A \"palm\", \"catch\", or \"cuff\" is a defence which intentionally takes the incoming punch on the palm portion of the defender's glove.\n* '''The cover-up''' \u2013 Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches \"roll\" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.\n* The '''[[grappling position#Stand-up positions|clinch]]''' \u2013 Clinching is a form of [[Trapping (martial arts)|trapping]] or a rough form of [[grappling]] and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to [[grappling hold|hold]] or \"tie up\" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or [[uppercut]]s. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. [[Clinching position|Clinching]] is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.\n\n===Unorthodox strategies===\n* '''The \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" strategy''': Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 \"[[the Rumble in the Jungle]]\" bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying back against the ropes, covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches. The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as he would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault. Recently, however, [[Octuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]] skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist [[Miguel Cotto]] in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit with a withering knockdown. [[Tyson Fury]] also attempted this against Francesco Pianeto but didn't pull it off as smoothly.\n* '''[[Bolo punch]]''': Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which owes its power to the shortening of a [[circular arc]] rather than to transference of body weight; it tends to have more of an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali shuffle]]. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former [[welterweight]] champions [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], and [[Kid Gavil\u00e1n]] as well as current British fighter [[Chris Eubank Jr.|Chris Eubank Jr]]. Middleweight champion [[Ceferino Garcia]] is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.\n<gallery>\nFile:contre_bolo1.jpg| ''[[Bolo punch]]''\nFile:drop1.jpg| ''[[overhand (boxing)|Overhand (overcut)]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand]]''': The overhand is a punch, thrown from the rear hand, not found in every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Tim Witherspoon]], as well as MMA champions [[Chuck Liddell]] and [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. The overhand has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking. [[Deontay Wilder]] heavily favours and is otherwise known for knocking many of his opponents out with one of his right overhands.\n* '''[[Check hook]]''': A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part consists of a regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] employed the use of a check hook against [[Ricky Hatton]], which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.\n\n==Ring corner==\n[[File:2017-12-02 Tina Rupprecht - Anne Sophie Da Costa - DSC2771.jpg|thumb|right|Female boxer [[Tina Rupprecht]] receiving instructions from her trainer while being treated by her cutman in the ring corner between rounds.]]\nIn boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the [[cutman]]. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous [[physician|doctor]] responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts, blood and excessive swelling. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts or swelling that threaten the boxer's eyes.\n\nIn addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase \"to throw in the towel\", meaning to give up, derives from this practice).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/throw-in-the-towel.html |title=Phrases.org |publisher=Phrases.org |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> This can be seen in the fight between [[Diego Corrales]] and [[Floyd Mayweather]]. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.\n\n==Medical concerns==\n{{see also|Dementia pugilistica|The distance (boxing)#Distance change criticisms}}\nKnocking a person unconscious or even causing a [[concussion]] may cause permanent [[brain damage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020918102719/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 September 2002|title=Boxing: The health risks|access-date=6 May 2010}}</ref> There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/4437|title=Better and Safer Boxing: Ringside and Boardroom Medical Control of Boxing Careers in the Twentieth Century|website=Dora.dmu.ac.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=June 2006|last1=Carter|first1=Neil}}</ref> From 1980 to 2007, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and [[Toughman Contest|Toughman]] fighters died due to ring or training injuries.<ref>Svinth, Joseph R.

Among the notable names{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} in the WBHF are [[Ricardo \"Finito\" Lopez]], [[Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde]], [[Michael Carbajal]], [[Khaosai Galaxy]], [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[George Foreman]], [[Ceferino Garcia]] and [[Salvador Sanchez]]. Boxing's International Hall of Fame was inspired by a tribute an American town held for two local heroes in 1982. The town, [[Canastota, New York]], (which is about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of Syracuse, via the New York State Thruway), honored former world [[welterweight]]/[[middleweight]] champion [[Carmen Basilio]] and his nephew, former world welterweight champion [[Billy Backus]]. The people of Canastota raised money for the tribute which inspired the idea of creating an official, annual hall of fame for notable boxers.\n\nThe [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] opened in Canastota in 1989. The first inductees in 1990 included Jack Johnson, [[Benny Leonard]], Jack Dempsey, Henry Armstrong, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], [[Archie Moore]], and Muhammad Ali. Other world-class figures<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/inducteeindex.html|title=Inductee Index|website=ibhof.com|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref> include Salvador Sanchez, [[Jose Napoles]], Roberto \"Manos de Piedra\" Dur\u00e1n, [[Ricardo Lopez (boxer)|Ricardo Lopez]], [[Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde]], [[Vicente Saldivar]], Ismael Laguna, Eusebio Pedroza, Carlos Monz\u00f3n, Azumah Nelson, [[Rocky Marciano]], Pipino Cuevas and [[Ken Buchanan]]. The Hall of Fame's induction ceremony is held every June as part of a four-day event. The fans who come to Canastota for the Induction Weekend are treated to a number of events, including scheduled autograph sessions, boxing exhibitions, a parade featuring past and present inductees, and the induction ceremony itself.\n\nThe Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas features the $75 million ESPN Classic Sports fight film and tape library and radio broadcast collection. The collection includes the fights of all the great champions including: [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[George Foreman]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Joe Louis]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]]. It is this exclusive fight film library that will separate the Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas from the other halls of fame which do not have rights to any video of their sports. The inaugural inductees included [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Tony Canzoneri]], [[Ezzard Charles]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez|Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Sr.]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Joe Louis]], and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/box/blog/box_experts/post/boxing-hall-of-fame-las-vegas-announces-first-class-of-inductees-gives-sport-its-third-hall |title=Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas announces first class of inductees, gives sport its third hall - Boxing Experts Blog - Boxing Blog - Yahoo!
