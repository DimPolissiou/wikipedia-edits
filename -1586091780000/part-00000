By observing multiple modes, one can therefore partially infer a star's internal structure.]]\n'''Asteroseismology''' or '''astroseismology''' is the study of oscillations in stars.  Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature.  Asteroseismology is closely related to [[helioseismology]], the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the [[Sun]].  Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.\n\n== Theoretical background ==\n\n[[File:Propagation diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A propagation diagram for a standard solar model<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Dappen | first2 = W. | last3 = Ajukov | first3 = S.

The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]\n\nBy linearly perturbing the equations defining the mechanical equilibrium of a star (i.e. mass conservation and [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four [[differential equations]] whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation.  The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by [[spherical harmonics]], indexed by an angular degree <math>\\ell</math> and azimuthal order <math>m</math>.  In non-rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must all have the same frequency because there is no preferred axis.  The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of <math>\\ell</math>, the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an angular degree of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity.\n\nBy additionally assuming that the perturbation to the gravitational potential is negligible (the ''Cowling'' approximation) and that the star's structure varies more slowly with radius than the oscillation mode, the equations can be reduced approximately to one second-order equation for the radial component of the displacement eigenfunction <math>\\xi_r</math>,\n\n<math>\\frac{d^2\\xi_r}{dr^2}=\\frac{\\omega^2}{c_s^2}\\left(1-\\frac{N^2}{\\omega^2}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{S_\\ell^2}{\\omega^2}-1\\right)\\xi_r</math>\n\nwhere\n<math>r</math> is the radial co-ordinate in the star,\n<math>\\omega</math> is the angular frequency of the oscillation mode,\n<math>c_s</math> is the sound speed inside the star,\n<math>N</math> is the [[Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency|Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4]] or buoyancy frequency and\n<math>S_\\ell</math> is the Lamb frequency.\nThe last two are defined by\n\n<math>N^2=g\\left(\\frac{1}{\\Gamma_1P}\\frac{dp}{dr}-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n<math>S_\\ell^2=\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)c_s^2}{r^2}</math>\n\nrespectively.  By analogy with the behaviour of simple harmonic oscillators,\nthis implies that oscillating solutions exist when the frequency is either\ngreater or less than both <math>S_\\ell</math> and <math>N</math>.  We identify the former case\nas high-frequency pressure modes (p-modes) and the latter as low-frequency\ngravity modes (g-modes).\n\nThis basic separation allows us to determine (to reasonable accuracy)\nwhere we expect what kind of mode to resonate in a star.  By plotting the\ncurves <math>\\omega=N</math> and <math>\\omega=S_\\ell</math> (for given\n<math>\\ell</math>), we expect p-modes to resonate at frequencies below both\ncurves or frequencies above both curves.\n\n== Excitation mechanisms ==\n\n=== <math>\\kappa</math>-mechanism ===\n\n{{main|Kappa mechanism}}\n\nUnder fairly specific conditions, some stars have regions where heat is transported by radiation and the opacity is a sharply decreasing function of temperature.  This opacity ''bump'' can drive oscillations through the <math>\\kappa</math>-mechanism (or ''Eddington valve''). Suppose that, at the beginning of an oscillation cycle, the stellar envelope has contracted. By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star's envelope.\n\nPulsations driven by the <math>\\kappa</math>-mechanism are coherent and have relatively large amplitudes.  It drives the pulsations in many of the longest-known variable stars, including the [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid]] and [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae variables]].\n\n=== Surface convection ===\n\nIn stars with surface convection zones, turbulent fluids motions near the surface simultaneously excite and damp oscillations across a broad range of frequency.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Goldreich | first1 = Peter | authorlink1 = Peter Goldreich | last2 = Keeley | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Solar seismology.

However, solar-like oscillations also occur in evolved stars (subgiants and red giants), which have convective envelopes, even though the stars are not ''Sun-like''.\n\n=== Cepheid variables ===\n\n{{main|Cepheid variable}}\n\nCepheid variables are one of the most important classes of pulsating star.  They are core-helium burning stars with masses above about 5 solar masses.  They principally oscillate at their fundamental modes, with typical periods ranging from days to months.  Their pulsation periods are closely related to their luminosities, so it is possible to determine the distance to a Cepheid by measuring its oscillation period, computing its luminosity, and comparing this to its observed brightness.\n\nCepheid pulsations are excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization zone of helium.\n\n=== RR Lyrae variables ===\n\n{{main|RR Lyrae variable}}\n\nRR Lyraes are similar to Cepheid variables but of lower metallicity (i.e. [[Population II]]) and much lower masses (about 0.6 to 0.8 time solar).  They are core helium-burning giants that oscillate in one or both of their fundamental mode or first overtone.  The oscillation are also driven by the kappa mechanism acting through the second ionization of helium.  Many RR Lyraes, including RR Lyrae itself, show long period amplitude modulations, known as the [[Blazhko effect]].\n\n=== Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars ===\n\n{{main|Delta Scuti variable|Gamma Doradus variable}}\n\nDelta Scuti variables are found roughly where the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence.  They are typically A- to early F-type dwarfs and subgiants and the oscillation modes are low-order radial and non-radial pressure modes, with periods ranging from 0.25 to 8 hours and magnitude variations anywhere between. Like Cepheid variables, the oscillations are driven by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization of helium.\n\nSX Phoenicis variables are regarded as metal-poor relatives of Delta Scuti variables.\n\nGamma Doradus variables occur in similar stars to the red end of the Delta Scuti variables, usually of early F-type.  The stars show multiple oscillation frequencies between about 0.5 and 3 days, which is much slower than the low-order pressure modes.  Gamma Doradus oscillations are generally thought to be high-order gravity modes, excited by convective blocking.\n\nFollowing results from ''Kepler'', it appears that nearly all Delta Scuti stars also show Gamma Doradus oscillations and are therefore hybrids.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Grigahc\\`ene | first1 = A. | last2 = Antoci | first2 = V. | last3 = Balona | first3 = L. | last4 = Catanzaro | first4 = G. and | title = Hybrid $\\gamma$ Doradus-$\\delta$ Scuti Pulsators: New Insights into the Physics of the Oscillations from Kepler Observations | year = 2010 | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume = 713 | issue = 2 | pages = L192\u2013L197| bibcode = 2010ApJ...713L.192G|arxiv = 1001.0747 |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L192 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last1 = Balona | first1 = L.

Their dense mode spectra are understood in terms of the ''oblique pulsator model'': the modes frequencies are modulated by the magnetic field, which is not necessarily aligned with the star's rotation (as is the case in the Earth).

Beta Cephei variables are slightly hotter (and thus more massive), also have modes excited by the kappa mechanism and additionally oscillate in low-order gravity modes with periods of several hours.  Both classes of oscillators contain only slowly-rotating stars.\n\n=== Variable subdwarf B stars ===\n\n{{main|Subdwarf B star}}\n\nSubdwarf B (sdB) stars are in essence the cores of core-helium burning giants who have somehow lost most of their hydrogen envelopes, to the extent that there is no hydrogen burning shell.  They have multiple oscillation periods that range between about 1 and 10 minutes and amplitudes anywhere between 0.001 and 0.3 mag in visible light.  The oscillations are low-order pressure modes, excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the iron opacity bump.\n\n=== White dwarfs ===\n\n{{main|Pulsating white dwarf}}\n\nWhite dwarfs are characterized by spectral type, much like ordinary stars, except that the relationship between spectral type and effective temperature does not correspond in the same way.  Thus, white dwarfs are known by types DO, DA and DB.  Cooler types are physically possible but the Universe is too young for them to have cooled enough.  White dwarfs of all three types are found to pulsate.  The pulsators are known as GW Virginis stars (DO variables, sometimes also known as PG 1159 stars), V777 Herculis stars (DB variables) and ZZ Ceti stars (DA variables).  All pulsate in low-degree, high-order g-modes.  The oscillation periods broadly decrease with effective temperature, ranging from about 30 min down to about 1 minute.  GW Virginis and ZZ Ceti stars are thought to be  excited by the kappa mechanism; V777 Herculis stars by convective blocking.\n\n==Space missions==\n\nA number of past, present and future spacecraft have asteroseismology studies as a significant part of their missions (order chronological). \n\n*[[Wide Field Infrared Explorer|WIRE]] \u2013 A [[NASA]] satellite launched in 1999.

By observing multiple modes, one can therefore partially infer a star's internal structure.]]\n'''Asteroseismology''' or '''astroseismology''' is the study of oscillations in stars.  Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature.  Asteroseismology is closely related to [[helioseismology]], the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the [[Sun]].  Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.\n\n== Theoretical background ==\n\n[[File:Propagation diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A propagation diagram for a standard solar model<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Christensen-Dalsgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Dappen | first2 = W. | last3 = Ajukov | first3 = S.

The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]\n\nBy linearly perturbing the equations defining the mechanical equilibrium of a star (i.e. mass conservation and [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four [[differential equations]] whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation.  The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by [[spherical harmonics]], indexed by an angular degree <math>\\ell</math> and azimuthal order <math>m</math>.  In non-rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must all have the same frequency because there is no preferred axis.  The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of <math>\\ell</math>, the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an angular degree of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity.\n\nBy additionally assuming that the perturbation to the gravitational potential is negligible (the ''Cowling'' approximation) and that the star's structure varies more slowly with radius than the oscillation mode, the equations can be reduced approximately to one second-order equation for the radial component of the displacement eigenfunction <math>\\xi_r</math>,\n\n<math>\\frac{d^2\\xi_r}{dr^2}=\\frac{\\omega^2}{c_s^2}\\left(1-\\frac{N^2}{\\omega^2}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{S_\\ell^2}{\\omega^2}-1\\right)\\xi_r</math>\n\nwhere\n<math>r</math> is the radial co-ordinate in the star,\n<math>\\omega</math> is the angular frequency of the oscillation mode,\n<math>c_s</math> is the sound speed inside the star,\n<math>N</math> is the Brunt-Vaisala or buoyancy frequency and\n<math>S_\\ell</math> is the Lamb frequency.\nThe last two are defined by\n\n<math>N^2=g\\left(\\frac{1}{\\Gamma_1P}\\frac{dp}{dr}-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n<math>S_\\ell^2=\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)c_s^2}{r^2}</math>\n\nrespectively.  By analogy with the behaviour of simple harmonic oscillators,\nthis implies that oscillating solutions exist when the frequency is either\ngreater or less than both <math>S_\\ell</math> and <math>N</math>.  We identify the former case\nas high-frequency pressure modes (p-modes) and the latter as low-frequency\ngravity modes (g-modes).\n\nThis basic separation allows us to determine (to reasonable accuracy)\nwhere we expect what kind of mode to resonate in a star.  By plotting the\ncurves <math>\\omega=N</math> and <math>\\omega=S_\\ell</math> (for given\n<math>\\ell</math>), we expect p-modes to resonate at frequencies below both\ncurves or frequencies above both curves.\n\n== Excitation mechanisms ==\n\n=== <math>\\kappa</math>-mechanism ===\n\n{{main|Kappa mechanism}}\n\nUnder fairly specific conditions, some stars have regions where heat is transported by radiation and the opacity is a sharply decreasing function of temperature.  This opacity ''bump'' can drive oscillations through the <math>\\kappa</math>-mechanism (or ''Eddington valve''). Suppose that, at the beginning of an oscillation cycle, the stellar envelope has contracted. By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star's envelope.\n\nPulsations driven by the <math>\\kappa</math>-mechanism are coherent and have relatively large amplitudes.  It drives the pulsations in many of the longest-known variable stars, including the [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid]] and [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae variables]].\n\n=== Surface convection ===\n\nIn stars with surface convection zones, turbulent fluids motions near the surface simultaneously excite and damp oscillations across a broad range of frequency.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Goldreich | first1 = Peter | authorlink1 = Peter Goldreich | last2 = Keeley | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Solar seismology.

However, solar-like oscillations also occur in evolved stars (subgiants and red giants), which have convective envelopes, even though the stars are not ''Sun-like''.\n\n=== Cepheid variables ===\n\n{{main|Cepheid variable}}\n\nCepheid variables are one of the most important classes of pulsating star.  They are core-helium burning stars with masses above about 5 solar masses.  They principally oscillate at their fundamental modes, with typical periods ranging from days to months.  Their pulsation periods are closely related to their luminosities, so it is possible to determine the distance to a Cepheid by measuring its oscillation period, computing its luminosity, and comparing this to its observed brightness.\n\nCepheid pulsations are excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization zone of helium.\n\n=== RR Lyrae variables ===\n\n{{main|RR Lyrae variable}}\n\nRR Lyraes are similar to Cepheid variables but of lower metallicity (i.e. [[Population II]]) and much lower masses (about 0.6 to 0.8 time solar).  They are core helium-burning giants that oscillate in one or both of their fundamental mode or first overtone.  The oscillation are also driven by the kappa mechanism acting through the second ionization of helium.  Many RR Lyraes, including RR Lyrae itself, show long period amplitude modulations, known as the [[Blazhko effect]].\n\n=== Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars ===\n\n{{main|Delta Scuti variable|Gamma Doradus variable}}\n\nDelta Scuti variables are found roughly where the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence.  They are typically A- to early F-type dwarfs and subgiants and the oscillation modes are low-order radial and non-radial pressure modes, with periods ranging from 0.25 to 8 hours and magnitude variations anywhere between. Like Cepheid variables, the oscillations are driven by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization of helium.\n\nSX Phoenicis variables are regarded as metal-poor relatives of Delta Scuti variables.\n\nGamma Doradus variables occur in similar stars to the red end of the Delta Scuti variables, usually of early F-type.  The stars show multiple oscillation frequencies between about 0.5 and 3 days, which is much slower than the low-order pressure modes.  Gamma Doradus oscillations are generally thought to be high-order gravity modes, excited by convective blocking.\n\nFollowing results from ''Kepler'', it appears that nearly all Delta Scuti stars also show Gamma Doradus oscillations and are therefore hybrids.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Grigahc\\`ene | first1 = A. | last2 = Antoci | first2 = V. | last3 = Balona | first3 = L. | last4 = Catanzaro | first4 = G. and | title = Hybrid $\\gamma$ Doradus-$\\delta$ Scuti Pulsators: New Insights into the Physics of the Oscillations from Kepler Observations | year = 2010 | journal = The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume = 713 | issue = 2 | pages = L192\u2013L197| bibcode = 2010ApJ...713L.192G|arxiv = 1001.0747 |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L192 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last1 = Balona | first1 = L.

Their dense mode spectra are understood in terms of the ''oblique pulsator model'': the modes frequencies are modulated by the magnetic field, which is not necessarily aligned with the star's rotation (as is the case in the Earth).  The oscillation modes have frequencies around 1500 \u03bcHz and amplitudes of a few mmag.\n\n=== Slowly-pulsating B stars and Beta Cephei variables ===\n\n{{main|Slowly pulsating B-type star|Beta Cephei variable}}\n\nSlowly-pulsating B (SPB) stars are B-type stars with oscillation periods of a few days, understood to be high-order gravity modes excited by the kappa mechanism.

[[Christian Bale]] stars as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], alongside [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Eight years after the events of ''The Dark Knight'', merciless revolutionary [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save [[Gotham City]] from nuclear destruction.\n\nChristopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\" storyline, the 1986 series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the 1999 storyline \"[[Batman: No Man's Land|No Man's Land]]\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including [[Jodhpur]], London, [[Nottingham]], Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Pittsburgh]]. Nolan used [[IMAX]] 70&nbsp;mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the [[Batplane]] and [[Batcopter]] termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new [[Batcave]] set were created specifically for the film. As with ''The Dark Knight'', [[viral marketing]] campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.\n\n''The Dark Knight Rises'' premiered in [[New York City]] on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances, action sequences, screenplay, direction, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The consensus at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"ambitious, thoughtful, and potent\". The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the ''Batman'' film series to earn $1 billion. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved, not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->seventh-highest-grossing film of all time]], as well as the [[2012 in film|third-highest-grossing film of 2012]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary; if you do, remove something else. -->\nIn [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], a mysterious terrorist and former member of the [[League of Shadows]], abducts nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel from a CIA aircraft.\n\nEight years after the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent, [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Batman]] has disappeared. Organized crime has been eradicated in [[Gotham City]] thanks to the Dent Act giving expanded powers to the police. Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] has kept Dent's murderous rampage as the vigilante [[Two-Face]] a secret and allowed blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. He has prepared a speech to read revealing the truth, but decides not to read it. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, and [[Wayne Enterprises]] is losing money after Wayne discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that it could be weaponized.\n\nBane sets up his base in the city sewers, and prompts Wayne's corporate rival John Daggett to buy Wayne's fingerprints. Cat burglar [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] obtains Wayne's prints from [[Wayne Manor]] for Daggett, but she is double-crossed at the exchange and alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Kyle flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]]. Blake, a fellow orphan who deduced Wayne's secret identity, confronts him and convinces him to return as Batman.\n\nBane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Wayne's fingerprints in a series of transactions that leaves Wayne bankrupt. Batman resurfaces for the first time in eight years while intercepting Bane and his subordinates. Wayne's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], is convinced that Wayne is not strong enough to fight Bane, and resigns in an attempt to save him. Wayne finds comfort in new Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate, and the two become lovers. Using the stolen transactions, Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett.\n \nKyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill [[Ra's al Ghul|Ra's al Ghul's]] mission to destroy Gotham. Batman fights Bane in a lengthy brawl but Bane defeats him, dealing a crippling blow to his back before taking him abroad to an underground prison where escape is virtually impossible. The inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before escaping \u2014 the only prisoner to have done so.\n\nBane lures Gotham's police into the sewers and uses explosives, trapping them and destroying bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia during a football game and forces Pavel to convert the reactor core into a decaying [[neutron bomb]]. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the crowd, and releases the prisoners of [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], causing anarchy in the city while exiling and killing Gotham's elite in [[kangaroo court]]s presided over by [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]].\n\nMonths later, Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham. Batman frees the police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself as [[Talia al Ghul]], Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses his aerial craft, the [[Batplane|Bat]], to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman indirectly reveals his identity to Gordon.\n\n'''Click Here For Watch full Movie Online  Url''':- https://www.freemovies.today/2020/04/the-dark-night-joker-full-movie-hd-watch-download-cast.html\n\nIn the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and Wayne's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the [[Bat Signal]] repaired, while [[Lucius Fox]] discovers that Wayne fixed the malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Bat. While vacationing in [[Florence]], Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Kyle.

Nolan, feeling that the use of [[film stock]] in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of [[digital cinematography]] and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option.<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/><ref name=\"filmvsdigital\"/> Nolan explained; \"I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one.\"<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/>\n\n===Design===\n\n====Costume design====\n[[File:Bane Tom Hardy5.jpg|thumb|upright|A digitally mapped model of Tom Hardy's face and skull was used to design and construct Bane's mask.]]\n[[Costume designer]] [[Lindy Hemming]] explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design2\"/><ref name=\"Design5\"/> Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with [[shearling]].<ref name=\"Design4\"/>\n\nThe [[Batsuit]] consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a [[polyester]] mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nIn creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, with the outer layer being [[polyurethane]] coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n====Production design====\n[[Concept artist]] Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of [[cinematography]] when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for ''[[Men in Black 3]]'': \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is a war film.\" Producer [[Emma Thomas]] stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nThe film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the [[Batplane]] and the [[Batcopter]], dubbed \"the Bat\". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to \"fit into the same family\" as the Tumbler and the [[Batpod]]. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] and the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]].<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over [[computer-generated imagery]]. In order to make the Bat \"fly\", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design3\"/><ref name=\"Design6\"/>\n\nWhen designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Another set was designed at Cardington as an \"underground prison\", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a {{convert|120|foot|m}} vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the \"forbidding landscape added to the desolation\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|The Dark Knight Rises (soundtrack)}}\nIn an interview in October 2010, composer [[Hans Zimmer]] confirmed that he would be returning to score ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' [[James Newton Howard]] was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight'', but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of ''Inception'' would make him seem like a \"third wheel\".<ref name=\"Howard\" /> Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme. While the theme accompanying Selina Kyle is deliberately ambiguous, the musical thread spanning throughout the trilogy was composed exclusively for Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nThe film features a prevalent [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]] chant of the phrase ''deshi basara'' (proper transliteration: ''T\u012bj\u012b basara\u2019ah'') ([[Arabic]]: \u062a\u064a\u062c\u064a \u0628\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629), which translates to \"rise up\" (literally: \"come quickly\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |title=Hans Zimmer Speaks On The \"Deshi Basara\" Chant In \"The Dark Knight Rises\" |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150657/http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |archivedate=January 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Part-Dark-Knight-Rises-Score-By-Recording-Yourself-Chanting-27748.html |title=Be Part of the Dark Knight Rises Score By Recording Yourself Chanting |work=CinemaBlend.com |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> In November 2011, Zimmer [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score.<ref name=\"Music1\"/><ref name=\"TDKRChant\"/> When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, \"The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind.\"<ref name=\"Music2\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\nThe official website launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote ''The Dark Knight''. The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting. Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros. removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag. The website revealed the first official image of Bane.<ref name=\"Marketing1\"/>\n\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer leaked online before its official release with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.<ref name=Davis/> The studio released the teaser three days after the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote it successfully built hype,<ref name=Davis /> while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an \"announcement trailer\" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had \"hammy\" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the ''Inception'' trailer.<ref name=Outlaw/> The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer1\"/><ref name=\"Marketing3\"/><ref name=\"Marketing4\"/> Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of [[Economic inequality|income inequality]] and an \"[[Occupy movement|Occupy Gotham]]\" campaign within the world of the story.<ref name=\"Marketing5\"/><ref name=\"Marketing6\"/><ref name=\"Marketing8\"/> Receiving more than 12.5&nbsp;million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from [[iTunes]], beating the previous record held by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Marketing9\"/> However, the second trailer for ''The Avengers'' again set the record with 13.7&nbsp;million downloads.<ref name=\"NYDailyNews\" /> Warner Bros. attached a second theatrical trailer for ''The Dark Knight Rises'' to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''. An \"unnamed\" Warner Brothers executive clarified that \"We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see\u2014and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!\" The executive also commented that the trailer will \"provide the best potential exposure for TDKR.\"<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer2\"/> Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer3\"/>\n\nContinuing a method used with ''The Dark Knight'' whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' seven months before release,<ref name=TDKopening/> a six-minute prologue of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]'', again approximately seven months before release.<ref name=\"6Minutes\"/> Critical reaction to the prologue was positive,<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog2\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog3\"/> with one critic commenting that \"no one gets to make a film on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan,\" though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog4\"/> Addressing the issue in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Nolan said \"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\"<ref name=\"BaneVoice\" />\n\n[[File:Batsignal at Highmark building.jpg|thumb|The [[bat-signal]] projected against the [[Fifth Avenue Place (Pittsburgh)|Fifth Avenue Place]] during filming in [[Pittsburgh]].]]\nViral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' received \"CIA documents\" concerning a \"Dr. Leonid Pavel\", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by Georgian separatists, but with most of the conversation redacted.<ref name=\"Marketing2\"/> These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/> The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing \"Operation Early Bird\". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.<ref name=\"Earlybird\"/><ref name=\"Earlybird2\"/> Various websites received a package that included a cylinder map of \"strike zones\", and a \"fire rises\" [[T-shirt]].<ref name=\"Marketing12\"/> In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a \"dossier\" on a suspect named \"John Doe\" also known as \"the Batman\" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City \"redoubles\" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming \"Harvey Dent Day\". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where \"graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return\" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.<ref name=\"Marketing21\"/>\n\nIn January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.<ref name=\"Marketing10\" />\n\n[[File:2012 British GP - Lotus.jpg|thumb|Formula One team [[Lotus F1]] carried a special livery to promote ''The Dark Knight Rises'' at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].]]\nAt the [[American International Toy Fair]], [[Mattel]] unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, and Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat. The Mattel figures were also released in the \"Movie Masters\" line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature interchangeable accessories. [[Lego]] released building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, [[Funko]] released a series of [[plush]] toys, [[Mezco Toyz]] released vinyl figures, and [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] released the Batman Tumbler car.<ref name=\"Marketing11\" /> Other partners include [[Jakks Pacific]], who created novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys,<ref name=\"Marketing13\"/> and PPW Toys, who created a Batman themed [[Mr. Potato Head]].<ref name=\"Marketing14\"/> Various clothing items including shoes, T-shirts, hats and wallets were also produced.<ref name=\"Marketing15\"/>\n\nA video game of the same name was released on the same day as the release of the film for the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices for promoting the movie. The game features an [[open world]] with primary focus on stealth and combat. The combat system of the game is inspired from [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|Arkham Asylum]] and [[Batman: Arkham City|Arkham City]]. It takes place in Gotham City, with a somewhat similar but still significantly different plot from that of the movie. [[IGN]] gave it a mediocre score of 5.5/10.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nThe film [[novelization]], written by author [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]] and published by [[Titan Books]], was released alongside the film on July 24, 2012.<ref name=\"Marketing20\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. partnered with [[Mountain Dew]] to do a cross-promotion that included a special paint scheme on the number 88 [[Chevrolet Impala#NASCAR|Chevrolet Impala]] owned by [[Hendrick Motorsports]] and driven by [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]].<ref name=\"Marketing22\"/> On June 17, 2012, the car won the [[2012 Quicken Loans 400]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]].<ref name=\"Marketing23\"/> On July 4, 2012, the studio signed a deal with [[Formula One]] team [[Lotus F1]] to have the film's logos appear on the [[Lotus E20]]s driven by [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Romain Grosjean]] at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].<ref name=\"Lotus\"/> R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Grosjean went on to finish the race in fifth and sixth place respectively.<ref name=\"Silverstone\"/> Warner Bros. had previously followed a similar promotion at the [[2008 British Grand Prix]], when the now-defunct [[Toyota F1]] carried a livery to promote ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"Toyota\"/>\n\nTwo digital comic books entitled ''Batman Origins''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wmpoweruser.com/nokia-releases-batman-origins-comic-app-for-lumia-windows-phone-devices/ |title=Nokia Releases Batman Origins Comic App For Lumia Windows Phone Devices |work=WMPoweruser |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref> and ''The Dark Knight: Prologue''<ref>{{cite web|author=polofaby |url=http://www.wpcentral.com/nokia-releases-dark-knight-prologue-app-lumia-phones |title=Nokia releases The Dark Knight Rises: Prologue app for Lumia phones &#124; Windows Phone News, Forums, and Reviews |work=wpcentral |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref> were released exclusively for [[Nokia Lumia 900|Nokia Lumia]] devices.

[[Christian Bale]] stars as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], alongside [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Eight years after the events of ''The Dark Knight'', merciless revolutionary [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] forces Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save [[Gotham City]] from nuclear destruction.\n\nChristopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]\" storyline, the 1986 series ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the 1999 storyline \"[[Batman: No Man's Land|No Man's Land]]\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including [[Jodhpur]], London, [[Nottingham]], Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], and [[Pittsburgh]]. Nolan used [[IMAX]] 70&nbsp;mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the [[Batplane]] and [[Batcopter]] termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new [[Batcave]] set were created specifically for the film. As with ''The Dark Knight'', [[viral marketing]] campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.\n\n''The Dark Knight Rises'' premiered in [[New York City]] on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews, with praise being directed toward the performances, action sequences, screenplay, direction, musical score, and emotional depth, with many critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The consensus at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"ambitious, thoughtful, and potent\". The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the ''Batman'' film series to earn $1 billion. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved, not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->seventh-highest-grossing film of all time]], as well as the [[2012 in film|third-highest-grossing film of 2012]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary; if you do, remove something else. -->\nIn [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], a mysterious terrorist and former member of the [[League of Shadows]], abducts nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel from a CIA aircraft.\n\nEight years after the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent, [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Batman]] has disappeared. Organized crime has been eradicated in [[Gotham City]] thanks to the Dent Act giving expanded powers to the police. Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] has kept Dent's murderous rampage as the vigilante [[Two-Face]] a secret and allowed blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. He has prepared a speech to read revealing the truth, but decides not to read it. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, and [[Wayne Enterprises]] is losing money after Wayne discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that it could be weaponized.\n\nBane sets up his base in the city sewers, and prompts Wayne's corporate rival John Daggett to buy Wayne's fingerprints. Cat burglar [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] obtains Wayne's prints from [[Wayne Manor]] for Daggett, but she is double-crossed at the exchange and alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Kyle flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]]. Blake, a fellow orphan who deduced Wayne's secret identity, confronts him and convinces him to return as Batman.\n\nBane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Wayne's fingerprints in a series of transactions that leaves Wayne bankrupt. Batman resurfaces for the first time in eight years while intercepting Bane and his subordinates. Wayne's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], is convinced that Wayne is not strong enough to fight Bane, and resigns in an attempt to save him. Wayne finds comfort in new Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate, and the two become lovers. Using the stolen transactions, Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett.\n \nKyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill [[Ra's al Ghul|Ra's al Ghul's]] mission to destroy Gotham. Batman fights Bane in a lengthy brawl but Bane defeats him, dealing a crippling blow to his back before taking him abroad to an underground prison where escape is virtually impossible. The inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before escaping \u2014 the only prisoner to have done so.\n\nBane lures Gotham's police into the sewers and uses explosives, trapping them and destroying bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia during a football game and forces Pavel to convert the reactor core into a decaying [[neutron bomb]]. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the crowd, and releases the prisoners of [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], causing anarchy in the city while exiling and killing Gotham's elite in [[kangaroo court]]s presided over by [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]].\n\nMonths later, Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham. Batman frees the police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself as [[Talia al Ghul]], Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses his aerial craft, the [[Batplane|Bat]], to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman indirectly reveals his identity to Gordon.\n\nIn the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and Wayne's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the [[Bat Signal]] repaired, while [[Lucius Fox]] discovers that Wayne fixed the malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Bat. While vacationing in [[Florence]], Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Kyle. Blake resigns from the [[GCPD]] and receives a parcel from Wayne leading him to the [[Batcave]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Please re-arrange the cast according to how the film's poster does, e.g.: Bale, Caine, Oldman, Hathaway, Hardy-->\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Bruce Wayne (The Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<br>A billionaire socialite who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld, as a feared vigilante.

Daley Center]] as the location for the headquarters of [[Wayne Enterprises]].<ref name=\"TrumpTower\"/> In November 2011, shooting shifted to [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"Filming11\"/><ref name=\"Filming12\"/> [[Newark City Hall]] and [[Military Park (Newark)|Military Park]] were among the locations used for filming.<ref name=\"Filming15\"/> Other shooting locations include London and [[Glasgow]], the latter of which was used for \"additional exterior filming\".<ref name=\"Filming16\"/> Principal photography concluded on November 14, 2011.<ref name=\"Filming17\"/> The external waterfall scene at the end of the film was shot at [[Sgwd Henrhyd]] falls, on the edge of the [[Brecon Beacons]] National Park in [[Wales]].<ref name=\"Visit\"/>\n\nProduction photos from filming in Pittsburgh showed a second [[Batmobile#Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises|Tumbler]] chassis after the first was destroyed, indicating that a new Batmobile would be in the film, following the destruction of the first in ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"Filming18\"/> Further set photos revealed a \"new vehicle\" being transported to [[Wabash Tunnel]], prompting speculation as to its nature.<ref name=\"Filming19\"/> In June 2011, Autoblog confirmed the presence of the new [[Lamborghini Aventador]] on the film set.<ref name=\"Filming20\"/>\n\n[[File:Wollaton Park MMB 07.jpg|thumb|[[Wollaton Hall]] in Nottingham was used as [[Wayne Manor]], Bruce Wayne's residence.]]\nSeveral accidents occurred during the production of the film. While filming at [[Wollaton Hall]], [[Nottingham]], a [[Semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailer]] crashed into the main entrance, though no one was injured.<ref name=\"Filming21\"/> A stuntman [[Parachuting|parachutist]] later crashed through the roof of a home in Cairngorm Gliding Club, Feshiebridge in Scotland, and became wedged there after a failed landing during a skydiving stunt; he was not seriously injured.<ref name=\"Filming22\"/> While filming scenes in Pittsburgh, Hathaway's stunt double crashed into an IMAX camera while filming a sequence that required her to ride a [[Batcycle#The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises|Batpod]] down a flight of stairs during a riot. There were no injuries, but the camera was destroyed.<ref name=\"BatpodCrash\" /> A second accident took place in Pittsburgh when the truck carrying the then-unidentified vehicle later termed \"the Bat\" went off-course and crashed into a lighting array, damaging the model of the aircraft. Production was delayed while the model was repaired.<ref name=\"Filming25\"/>\n\nShortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several prominent directors, including [[Edgar Wright]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Bryan Singer]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Duncan Jones]] and [[Stephen Daldry]], to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre for a private screening of the first six minutes of ''The Dark Knight Rises'', which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the [[original camera negative]]. Nolan, feeling that the use of [[film stock]] in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of [[digital cinematography]] and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option.<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/><ref name=\"filmvsdigital\"/> Nolan explained; \"I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one.\"<ref name=\"Traditionalist\"/>\n\n===Design===\n\n====Costume design====\n[[File:Bane Tom Hardy5.jpg|thumb|upright|A digitally mapped model of Tom Hardy's face and skull was used to design and construct Bane's mask.]]\n[[Costume designer]] [[Lindy Hemming]] explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design2\"/><ref name=\"Design5\"/> Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with [[shearling]].<ref name=\"Design4\"/>\n\nThe [[Batsuit]] consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a [[polyester]] mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nIn creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, with the outer layer being [[polyurethane]] coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n====Production design====\n[[Concept artist]] Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of [[cinematography]] when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for ''[[Men in Black 3]]'': \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. ''The Dark Knight Rises'' is a war film.\" Producer [[Emma Thomas]] stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nThe film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the [[Batplane]] and the [[Batcopter]], dubbed \"the Bat\". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to \"fit into the same family\" as the Tumbler and the [[Batpod]]. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey]] and the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache]].<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over [[computer-generated imagery]]. In order to make the Bat \"fly\", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/><ref name=\"Design3\"/><ref name=\"Design6\"/>\n\nWhen designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/> Another set was designed at Cardington as an \"underground prison\", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a {{convert|120|foot|m}} vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the \"forbidding landscape added to the desolation\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|The Dark Knight Rises (soundtrack)}}\nIn an interview in October 2010, composer [[Hans Zimmer]] confirmed that he would be returning to score ''The Dark Knight Rises.'' [[James Newton Howard]] was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight'', but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of ''Inception'' would make him seem like a \"third wheel\".<ref name=\"Howard\" /> Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores, but explains that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme. While the theme accompanying Selina Kyle is deliberately ambiguous, the musical thread spanning throughout the trilogy was composed exclusively for Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\"/>\n\nThe film features a prevalent [[Moroccan Arabic|Moroccan]] chant of the phrase ''deshi basara'' (proper transliteration: ''T\u012bj\u012b basara\u2019ah'') ([[Arabic]]: \u062a\u064a\u062c\u064a \u0628\u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629), which translates to \"rise up\" (literally: \"come quickly\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |title=Hans Zimmer Speaks On The \"Deshi Basara\" Chant In \"The Dark Knight Rises\" |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150657/http://www.flicksandbits.com/2012/07/25/hans-zimmer-speaks-on-the-deshi-basara-chant-in-the-dark-knight-rises/28983/ |archivedate=January 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Part-Dark-Knight-Rises-Score-By-Recording-Yourself-Chanting-27748.html |title=Be Part of the Dark Knight Rises Score By Recording Yourself Chanting |work=CinemaBlend.com |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> In November 2011, Zimmer [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score.<ref name=\"Music1\"/><ref name=\"TDKRChant\"/> When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, \"The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind.\"<ref name=\"Music2\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\nThe official website launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote ''The Dark Knight''. The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting. Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros. removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag. The website revealed the first official image of Bane.<ref name=\"Marketing1\"/>\n\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer leaked online before its official release with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.<ref name=Davis/> The studio released the teaser three days after the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote it successfully built hype,<ref name=Davis /> while Kofi Outlaw of ScreenRant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an \"announcement trailer\" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had \"hammy\" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the ''Inception'' trailer.<ref name=Outlaw/> The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer1\"/><ref name=\"Marketing3\"/><ref name=\"Marketing4\"/> Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of [[Economic inequality|income inequality]] and an \"[[Occupy movement|Occupy Gotham]]\" campaign within the world of the story.<ref name=\"Marketing5\"/><ref name=\"Marketing6\"/><ref name=\"Marketing8\"/> Receiving more than 12.5&nbsp;million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from [[iTunes]], beating the previous record held by ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Marketing9\"/> However, the second trailer for ''The Avengers'' again set the record with 13.7&nbsp;million downloads.<ref name=\"NYDailyNews\" /> Warner Bros. attached a second theatrical trailer for ''The Dark Knight Rises'' to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''. An \"unnamed\" Warner Brothers executive clarified that \"We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see\u2014and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!\" The executive also commented that the trailer will \"provide the best potential exposure for TDKR.\"<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer2\"/> Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TDKRtrailer3\"/>\n\nContinuing a method used with ''The Dark Knight'' whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' seven months before release,<ref name=TDKopening/> a six-minute prologue of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]'', again approximately seven months before release.<ref name=\"6Minutes\"/> Critical reaction to the prologue was positive,<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog2\"/><ref name=\"MarketingProlog3\"/> with one critic commenting that \"no one gets to make a film on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan,\" though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog4\"/> Addressing the issue in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Nolan said \"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\"<ref name=\"BaneVoice\" />\n\n[[File:Batsignal at Highmark building.jpg|thumb|The [[bat-signal]] projected against the [[Fifth Avenue Place (Pittsburgh)|Fifth Avenue Place]] during filming in [[Pittsburgh]].]]\nViral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' received \"CIA documents\" concerning a \"Dr. Leonid Pavel\", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by Georgian separatists, but with most of the conversation redacted.<ref name=\"Marketing2\"/> These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue.<ref name=\"MarketingProlog1\"/> The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing \"Operation Early Bird\". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.<ref name=\"Earlybird\"/><ref name=\"Earlybird2\"/> Various websites received a package that included a cylinder map of \"strike zones\", and a \"fire rises\" [[T-shirt]].<ref name=\"Marketing12\"/> In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a \"dossier\" on a suspect named \"John Doe\" also known as \"the Batman\" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City \"redoubles\" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming \"Harvey Dent Day\". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where \"graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return\" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.<ref name=\"Marketing21\"/>\n\nIn January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.<ref name=\"Marketing10\" />\n\n[[File:2012 British GP - Lotus.jpg|thumb|Formula One team [[Lotus F1]] carried a special livery to promote ''The Dark Knight Rises'' at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].]]\nAt the [[American International Toy Fair]], [[Mattel]] unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, and Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat. The Mattel figures were also released in the \"Movie Masters\" line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature interchangeable accessories. [[Lego]] released building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, [[Funko]] released a series of [[plush]] toys, [[Mezco Toyz]] released vinyl figures, and [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]] released the Batman Tumbler car.<ref name=\"Marketing11\" /> Other partners include [[Jakks Pacific]], who created novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys,<ref name=\"Marketing13\"/> and PPW Toys, who created a Batman themed [[Mr. Potato Head]].<ref name=\"Marketing14\"/> Various clothing items including shoes, T-shirts, hats and wallets were also produced.<ref name=\"Marketing15\"/>\n\nA video game of the same name was released on the same day as the release of the film for the [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices for promoting the movie. The game features an [[open world]] with primary focus on stealth and combat. The combat system of the game is inspired from [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|Arkham Asylum]] and [[Batman: Arkham City|Arkham City]]. It takes place in Gotham City, with a somewhat similar but still significantly different plot from that of the movie. [[IGN]] gave it a mediocre score of 5.5/10.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\nThe film [[novelization]], written by author [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]] and published by [[Titan Books]], was released alongside the film on July 24, 2012.<ref name=\"Marketing20\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. partnered with [[Mountain Dew]] to do a cross-promotion that included a special paint scheme on the number 88 [[Chevrolet Impala#NASCAR|Chevrolet Impala]] owned by [[Hendrick Motorsports]] and driven by [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]].<ref name=\"Marketing22\"/> On June 17, 2012, the car won the [[2012 Quicken Loans 400]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]].<ref name=\"Marketing23\"/> On July 4, 2012, the studio signed a deal with [[Formula One]] team [[Lotus F1]] to have the film's logos appear on the [[Lotus E20]]s driven by [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]] and [[Romain Grosjean]] at the [[2012 British Grand Prix]].<ref name=\"Lotus\"/> R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Grosjean went on to finish the race in fifth and sixth place respectively.<ref name=\"Silverstone\"/> Warner Bros. had previously followed a similar promotion at the [[2008 British Grand Prix]], when the now-defunct [[Toyota F1]] carried a livery to promote ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=\"Toyota\"/>\n\nTwo digital comic books entitled ''Batman Origins''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wmpoweruser.com/nokia-releases-batman-origins-comic-app-for-lumia-windows-phone-devices/ |title=Nokia Releases Batman Origins Comic App For Lumia Windows Phone Devices |work=WMPoweruser |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref> and ''The Dark Knight: Prologue''<ref>{{cite web|author=polofaby |url=http://www.wpcentral.com/nokia-releases-dark-knight-prologue-app-lumia-phones |title=Nokia releases The Dark Knight Rises: Prologue app for Lumia phones &#124; Windows Phone News, Forums, and Reviews |work=wpcentral |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref> were released exclusively for [[Nokia Lumia 900|Nokia Lumia]] devices.

Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], and [[Sanaa Lathan]]. The plot concerns the spread of a virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html|title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]]}}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by pandemics such as the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]]. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant|Lawrence \"Larry\" Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film received renewed popularity during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5811774/contagion-stars-psa-coronavirus/|title=Stars of 'Contagion' Reunite to Offer Coronavirus Advice |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 27, 2020 |last=Kennedy |first=Mark |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from a business trip in Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago and meets a former lover for sex. Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede is an investigate reporter in San Francisco who has studied previous outbreaks. He posts videos about the virus on his blog and reveals that the CDC is hiding information regarding the treatment for epidemic. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined, which is accurate. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, is investigated for having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]]. However, the test to determine his condition is extracted by testing for antibodies for the virus in his blood and not a genetic test. If he had been cured by forsynthia, as he claimed in the video, the antibodies will no longer be present although he would still retain the virus in a genetic test. Krumwiede is released and no charges are made against him. \n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth. It is assumed that the disease had been spread to Beth through close contact with the chef who had handled the slaughtered pig. \n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen. Cotillard, a fan of Soderbergh's work, first met with the director in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=dc/> The French actress was enthralled with the script because she was \"very concerned about germs.

Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Beth was \"lucky\" as she thought the disease's survivors were being left to deal with the newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water.<ref name=filming/> When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs to be used in the film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. \"I was just another tourist taking pictures\", she said, and added, \"I did feel a little pressure.

Soderbergh later contacted Burns to cancel the project, as he thought that a film about Riefenstahl would struggle to attract an audience.<ref name=burnztrans/> Intrigued with the field of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]], Burns suggested that they instead create a film that centered on a [[pandemic]] situation\u2014\"an interesting thriller version of a pandemic movie\".

Two days later, in her family home in suburban Minneapolis, she collapses with seizures. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that his stepson Clark has also died. Mitch is put in isolation but is later found to be immune; he returns home to his teenage daughter Jory.\n\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and express fears that the disease is a [[bioweapon]] intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to investigate. Mears traces the outbreak back to Beth. She negotiates with local bureaucrats, who are reluctant to commit resources for a public health response. Mears later becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under [[quarantine]], and [[looting]] and violence break out.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig- and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. [[University of California, San Francisco|University of California]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from Cheever to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to begin work on a [[vaccine]]. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomite]]s, with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% mortality rate.\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede is an investigate reporter in San Francisco who has studied previous outbreaks. He posts videos about the virus on his blog and reveals that the CDC is hiding information regarding the treatment for disease. In one video, he claims he has cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly informed friends and family to leave Chicago before it was quarantined, which is accurate. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, is investigated for having faked his illness to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]]. However, the test to determine his condition is extracted by testing for antibodies for the virus in his blood and not a genetic test. If he had been cured by forsynthia, as he claimed in the video, the antibodies will no longer be present although he would still retain the virus in a genetic test. \n\nUsing an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated virus]], Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy time it would take to obtain [[informed consent]] from infected patients, Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdate. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n\nEarlier, in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization]] epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, where she remains for months. WHO officials provide them with vaccines and she is released. When Orantes learns the vaccines given to the village were [[placebo]]s, she runs to warn them.\n\nIn a flashback, a bulldozer knocks down a banana tree in a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops a piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who shakes hands with Beth. It is assumed that the disease had been spread to Beth through close contact with the chef who had handled the slaughtered pig. \n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Marion Cotillard Cabourg 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marion Cotillard]] in 2017]]\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the [[World Health Organization]]\n\n:Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen.
