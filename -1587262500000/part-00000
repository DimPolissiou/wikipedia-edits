As their channels grew, the group began producing a wider variety of videos and other projects and, since 2018, has published primarily on their combined channels, Sidemen and MoreSidemen. {{As of|2020|3}}, their eponymous YouTube channel has over 7.6 million subscribers.<ref name=\"SidemenStats\">{{Cite web |url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |title=Sidemen's YouTube Stats |website=[[Social Blade]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830020618/https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCDogdKl7t7NHzQ95aEwkdMw |archive-date=30 August 2019 |access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the members knew each other before the group was formed: Josh Bradley and Tobi Brown both attended [[Bexley Grammar School]] in London, and [[KSI (entertainer)|JJ Olatunji]] and Simon Minter both attended [[Berkhamsted School]] in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"SidemenBook\">{{Cite book |last=The Sidemen |title=Sidemen: The Book |date=18 October 2016 |publisher=[[Coronet Books]] |isbn=978-1473648166 |pages=52\u201357}}</ref>\n\nThe group was informally created on 19 October 2013, when Olatunji, Minter, Bradley, Brown, and Ethan Payne formed a [[Rockstar Games Social Club]] group called '''The Ultimate Sidemen''' in the then-recently released ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]''; Vik Barn joined the group soon afterwards.

The word ''[[wali]]'' is Arabic for \"trusted one\" (\"guardian\" in other contexts in Indonesia) or \"friend of God\" (\"saint\" in this context), while the word ''sanga'' is Javanese for group of monks or the number nine. Thus, the term is often translated as \"Sangha of saints\".\n\nAlthough referred to as a group, there is good evidence that fewer than nine were alive at any given time. Also, there are sources that use the term \"Wali Sanga\" to refer to saintly mystic(s) other than the most well-known nine individuals.\n\nEach man is often attributed the title ''[[Sunan (Indonesian title)|sunan]]'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]], which may derive from ''suhun'', in this context meaning \"honoured\".<ref>{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | pages =9\u201310  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6}}</ref>\n\nMost of the wali were also called ''raden'' during their lifetimes, because they were members of royal houses. (See \"Style and Title\" section of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] for an explanation of Javanese nobility terms.)\n\nThe graves of Wali Sanga are venerated as locations of ziarah ([[ziyarat]]) or local [[pilgrimage]] in Java.<ref>Schoppert, P., Damais, S., ''Java Style'', 1997, Didier Millet, Paris, pp.&nbsp;50, {{ISBN|962-593-232-1}}</ref> The graves are also known as ''pundhen'' in Javanese.\n\n==Origins==\nThe earliest Wali Sanga was [[Maulana Malik Ibrahim]]. He is thought to have been in the first half of the 14th century.{{sfn|Akbar|2009|p=10}} According to \"[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]\" and other texts.

This list differs somewhat from the names suggested in the ''[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]'' manuscripts.\n\nOne theory about the variation of composition is: \"The most probable explanation is that there was a loose council of nine religious leaders, and that as older members retired or died, new members were brought into this council.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gimonca.com/sejarah/walisongo.shtml |title=Sejarah Indonesia: Wali Songo |publisher=Gimonca.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> However, it should be borne in mind that the term \"wali sanga\" was created retroactively by historians, and so there was no official \"group of nine\" that had membership.

The following list is widely accepted, but its authenticity relies much on repeated citations of a handful of early sources, reinforced as \"facts\" in school textbooks and other modern accounts. This list differs somewhat from the names suggested in the ''[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]'' manuscripts.\n\nOne theory about the variation of composition is: \"The most probable explanation is that there was a loose council of nine religious leaders, and that as older members retired or died, new members were brought into this council.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gimonca.com/sejarah/walisongo.shtml |title=Sejarah Indonesia: Wali Songo |publisher=Gimonca.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> However, it should be borne in mind that the term \"wali sanga\" was created retroactively by historians, and so there was no official \"group of nine\" that had membership.
