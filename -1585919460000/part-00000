He was [[Secretary of State for War]] between 1905 and 1912 during which time the \"[[Haldane Reforms]]\" of the British Army were implemented. Raised to the peerage as [[Viscount Haldane]] in 1911, he was [[Lord Chancellor]] between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of false allegations of German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and once again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 in the first ever Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was also an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1914.\n\n==Background and education==\nHaldane was born at 17 [[Charlotte Square]], Edinburgh, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist [[James Alexander Haldane]], the brother of respiratory [[physiologist]] [[John Scott Haldane]], [[William Haldane|Sir William Haldane]] and author [[Elizabeth Haldane]], and the uncle of [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Naomi Mitchison]].\n\nHe received his first education at the [[Edinburgh Academy]], and then at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He gained a first and MA at [[University of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\" /> where he received first-class honours in Philosophy and as Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar in philosophy of the four Scottish Universities.\n\nAfter studying law in London, he was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]], in 1879,<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/> and became a successful lawyer. He was taken on at 5 New Square Chambers by [[Horace Davey, Baron Davey|Lord Davey]] in 1882 as the junior.  Haldane's practice was a specialism in [[conveyancing]]; a particular skill for pleadings at appeal and tribunal cases, bringing cases to the privy council and house of Lords.  By 1890 he had become a [[Queen's Counsel]].<ref name=\"LG26018\" /> By 1905 he was earning [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000 per annum at the Bar{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} ({{Inflation|index=UK|currsign=\u00a3|value=20000|start_year=1905|fmt=eq|r=-5}}). He became a [[bencher]] at Lincoln's Inn in 1893.  Amongst his early friends was [[Edmund Gosse]], the scholarly librarian at the inn's law library, whose help made Haldane well known for being fully prepared in court and parliamentary briefs.\n\nHaldane was a deep thinker, an unusual breed: a philosopher-politician.  During his stay at G\u00f6ttingen he expanded an interest in the German philosophers, Schopenauer and Hegel.  He had refused a place at Balliol, but in nodding respect for the Master and philosopher, [[Thomas Hill Green|T H Green]], he dedicated his Schopenauer translation ''The World as Will and Idea'' which he carried through with a friend, [[Peter Hume Brown]], the Scottish historian.\n\n==Early political career==\nA cousin, the Whig politician [[Robert Adam Philips Haldane Haldane-Duncan, 3rd Earl of Camperdown|Lord Camperdown]] encouraged the young barrister into standing as a Liberal at the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|General Election of 1880]]. Although not elected that year Haldane joined the [[Eighty Club]], a political dining and discussion club formed in 1879. Membership was restricted to Liberals under the age of forty. In 1881 Haldane met [[H. H. Asquith]], and they soon became firm friends often meeting the Blue Post Public house on Cork Street. They were founders of the Albert Grey committee, named after Earl Grey, regularly discussing burning social issues, such as education.\n\nIn November 1885 Haldane was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Haddingtonshire]], a seat he held until 1911.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/><ref name=\"leighrayment.com\" /> The philosopher-politician wrote several articles for the advanced and progressive ''Contemporary Review''.  In October 1888, \"The Liberal Creed\" was published summarising his belief in the direction of New Liberalism.  In the 1890 article  \"The Eight Hours Question\" Haldane rejected the idea of the eight-hour day.  In 1888, he courted Emma Valentine Ferguson, sister of his Liberal party friend, [[Ronald Munro-Ferguson]]; she broke off the engagement and subsequently lampooned him in her novel ''Betsy'' in 1892.  Haldane became firmly ensconced in the Imperialist wing of Liberalism, led by Sir Edward Grey.  At the 1892 General Election, he received a shock when nearly defeated by the Liberal Unionist Master of Polwarth. [[Beatrice Webb]], the socialist who was a close intimate, remarked on how alone Haldane was in the world.{{sfn|Webb|1948|p=98}} Haldane added the preface to [[L T Hobhouse]]'s ''The Labour Movement'' in 1893.  Sadly Emma Ferguson died insane in 1897.  ''He had pathos in his personality'', remarked Webb, ''a successful lawyer tinged with socialism''.{{sfn|Webb|1986|p=345}}\n\n===Liberal Imperialist===\nFocusing on his writings, Haldane was passed over for political office, being the only one of his group left out in the wilderness.  Haldane remained an ally of Asquith and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in the [[Liberal Imperialist]] wing of the party, followers of Lord Rosebery rather than of Sir William Harcourt. Rosebery admired Haldane's intellect, and the Scotsman urged upon his friend, whom he had known since 1886, an assault on Tory power in the Lords in 1894.<ref name=\"Rosebery\" />  Haldane joined friends at the Articles Club, including Asquith and Grey. Haldane was disappointed having failed to secure the post of Solicitor-General in October 1894. At the time, Asquith wryly remarked, ''A very wrong decision come to upon inadequate grounds.''{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 335}} Haldane was sounded out of the Speakership by Rosebery, but refused it, declaring it to be a political death. The post went eventually to W Gully in 1895.\n\nAt a meeting with [[Beatrice Webb]], the Fabian socialist, Haldane told her he was disconsolate at the condition of the Liberal Party: \"Rot has set in there is no hope now but to be beaten and then reconstruct a new party\".{{efn|Diary of Beatrice Webb, 20 January 1895,<ref name=\"Passfield Papers\" /> cited in {{harvnb|McKinstry|2005|pp= 338-339}} }} The leaders of the party were exasperated and believed Rosebery to lack planning and direction. \"Although Asquith, Grey and I\", wrote Haldane, \"stuck by him... we never knew when he would retire and leave us in the lurch\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Note to his letters}} When Rosebery offered the Speakership, he refused it that March.{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc= Mss NLS 5951}} However, on 11 October 1896, he wrote to Rosebery that he \"was the leader of a revolution in our party\".{{sfn|Matthew|2011}}\n\nOn 11 August 1902, Haldane was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]],<ref name=\"LG27464\" /> following an announcement of the King\u2032s intention to make the appointment in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list, published in June that year.<ref name=\"TheTimes1902\" /> The King used his influence and charm to cultivate allies, bringing cross-party groups like [[The Souls]] together in consensual amity.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|p=}} Balfour's administration leant on Haldane's philosophy for educational reforms.\n\nAfter the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Arthur Balfour]] fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Asquith and his allies Haldane and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] would refuse to serve unless Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. Haldane had suggested involving the King at Balmoral to 'kick CB upstairs'.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=397-398}}However, the plot (called \"[[The Relugas Compact]]\" after Grey's Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Campbell-Bannerman.{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|pp=467-468}}\n\nHaldane wrote, \"One longs for Rosebery had he been coming in to his right place at the head of affairs, we could have gone anywhere with confidence. But it seems now as if this were not to be and we have to do the only thing we can do, which is to resolutely follow a plan of concerted action\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Letter from Lord Haldane to Sir Francis Knollys, Private Secretary to Edward VII on 12 September 1905}}\n\nOn 13 December 1905, Haldane was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], but he may have been offered the jobs of Attorney-General and Home Secretary.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} (Grey became Foreign Secretary).<ref name=\"LG27862\" /> Unity in the Liberals helped them obtain the largest electoral majority in the party's history in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 476}}\n\n==Secretary of State for War==\nAs early as January 1906 Haldane was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist Edward Grey to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans.{{efn|He invited Colonel Huguet, the French Military Attache to Plan at War Office from Jan 1906.{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} }} However, Haldane's first estimates reduced the Army by 16,600 men and reduced expenditure by \u00a32.6m to \u00a328&nbsp;million, as the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment.{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}} By 1914 Britain spent 3.4% of national income on defence, little more in absolute terms than Austria-Hungary's 6.1%.  Army expenditure was determined according to a formula devised by the Esher Committee. In 1900, during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], army expenditure was \u00a386.8m, by 1910 (a low point, after four years of cuts under the Liberals) it had dropped to \u00a327.6m and by 1914 it had risen back to \u00a329.4m.  In March 1914 effective expenditure on the Army, after allowing for increased pensions and \u00a31m set aside for military aviation, was still less than in 1907-8, and \u00a32m less than in 1905-6 (despite a 20% rise in prices since then).{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}}\n\nIn October 1907 Haldane was intimately involved with the negotiations at Windsor with Kaiser Wilhelm. The Germanophile and linguist was thrilled to be summoned at 1&nbsp;am to talk with the Emperor on arms reduction principles over whisky. But the import was the Baghdad-Berlin railway which Germany was hoping to construct with British approval.  A fluent German-speaker, Haldane was lulled into a false sense of security believing 'like a bear with a sore head' that he had won a great deal.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|p=}}{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=414-415}}{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=}} Another such conference took place at Balmoral in September 1909.  The Kaiser arrogantly insisted that only the King was of equal rank.\n\nDespite the budgetary constraints, Haldane implemented a wide-ranging set of reforms of the Army, aimed at preparing the [[British Army|army]] for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later wrote that \"in every respect the Expeditionary Force of 1914 was incomparably the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army ever to leave these shores\"{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=140}}\n\n[[Image:Haldane a West Point.jpg|thumb|left|Haldane at [[West Point]] sometime before the Great War.]]\n\n==Army reforms==\n{{main|Haldane Reforms}}\nHaldane set up the [[Imperial General Staff]]. Before Haldane, there was only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which met only in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] had recommended the setting up of an Army Council and the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=138}} Haldane's reforms also created the [[Territorial Force]] of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home,{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} the [[Officer Training Corps]] and the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]].\n\nIn all the reforms, Haldane worked closely at the War Office with [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Major-General Haig]]. By coincidence, both men had been born in Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh. [[John Alfred Spender|J. A. Spender]] later wrote of how Haldane got the best work out of an able but verbally-incoherent soldier (thought to refer to Haig) by not scoring verbal points off him, as many politicians would have done.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nUsually critical, Rosebery remarked on Haldane's interest in philosophy, declaring: \"I have read his Secret Memorandum, and that was enough\". In 1907 and 1908, Haldane passed far-reaching reforms to Army management. He was accredited as an efficient bureaucratic leader, notably founding the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in a Second Memorandum. His reforms re-oriented British military policy, revamped army organization along the lines of the German General Staff, upgraded the training of the auxiliary forces, and created an efficient and economically run service. Those reforms enabled Britain to send some 120,000 men to France in fifteen days in August 1914.{{sfn|Bond|1963|pp=33-43}}\n\nHaldane was also instrumental in the creation the [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979).\n\n==Philosopher-politician==\nThroughout his long career and association with the modernisers or 'Limps' Haldane used his considerable intellect to great advantage against economy.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=51-52}} A radical liberal,{{sfn|Tanner|2003|p=45}} Haldane was also, according to historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], one of the \"best supporters\" of David Lloyd George's \"[[People's Budget]].\"{{sfn|Pugh|2014|p=46}} During the constitutional and budget crisis of 1909\u201311, Haldane advised his friend and Prime Minister, Asquith on the legal niceties of his stance towards the monarch, who was outraged at the firebrand speeches from Churchill and Lloyd George. Stumbling from illness to illness, Haldane's own bad health was similar to King Edward's declining fortunes.\n\n[[File:Viscount Haldane LC by Vandyk.jpg|thumb|The Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, 1912]]\nTwo elections ensued, one in January and another in December 1910, before in 1911 he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Haldane''', of Cloan in the [[County of Perth]].<ref name=\"LG28480\" /> He became Leader in the Lords, responsible for the passage of the Parliament Act. On [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl of Loreburn|Lord Loreburn's]] retirement in June 1912, Haldane succeeded him as [[Lord Chancellor]],{{sfn|Heuston|1987|pp=166-}} making a self-deprecating speech as to his abilities as a legal expert.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=253}}\n\n==Haldane Mission==\n1912 saw the unsuccessful attempt of the '''Haldane Mission''', an effort to quell the friction between Britain and Germany arising because of [[Anglo-German naval arms race|their naval arms race]].{{sfn|Scott|1918|pp=589\u2013596}} The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \"naval holiday\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\" Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure. .{{sfn|Maurer|1992|pp=284\u2013308}}{{sfn|Langhorne|1971|pp= 359\u2013370}} On 19 May 1913 he was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]].\n\n==First World War==\nIn March 1914 Haldane's successor at the War Office, [[Jack Seely]], resigned following the [[Curragh incident]]. Rather than appoint a successor, Asquith decided to take over responsibility for the War Office directly himself. Asquith relied heavily on Haldane as the previous War Secretary and empowered him to carry out tasks at the War Office on his behalf. As the situation in Europe worsened, Asquith kept Haldane abreast of developments with Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office. Haldane was one of the first members of the Cabinet to recognise that war with Germany was inevitable and persuaded Asquith to mobilise by assembly of the Army Council on 3 August.{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}} With war imminent, Asquith was happy for Haldane to continue at the War Office formally as Secretary of State for War, but Haldane persuaded him to appoint [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Kitchener]].{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}}\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War One Haldane was falsely accused of pro-German sympathies, in July 1914, for hosting [[Albert Ballin]], a German shipping magnate and unofficial mediator between Germany and Britain. The accusations were widely believed, even being echoed in a popular music hall song (\"All dressed up and nowhere to go\") in the revue \"Mr Manhattan\". He was harried in particular by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'', which gave great publicity to the claim by Professor Onkel of Heidelberg that he had said that \"Germany was his spiritual home\". He had in fact said that about Professor [[Hermann Lotze]]'s classroom at G\u00f6ttingen, at a dinner party given by [[Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] in April 1913 to enable him to meet some German professors during his mission.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nIn 1915, Asquith ranked his Cabinet, putting Haldane only sixth of the inner cabinet members.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=}} He also inveigled Kitchener and Haldane to sign the King's Pledge, a vow to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war, which Haldane resented and which Churchill and Asquith himself completely ignored.\n\n==Dismissal from office==\n\nHaldane's dismissal from office in May 1915 is widely regarded by historians as unfair.  Following the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shell crisis]] and the resignation of [[Lord Fisher]] the Liberals were obliged to form a coalition government with the Conservatives who, under the leadership of [[Bonar Law]], insisted on the removal of [[Winston Churchill]] as First Lord of the Admiralty and the dismissal of Haldane.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=188}}{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=360}} Haldane's removal was on account of the popularity of the press's campaign relating to Haldane's alleged pro-German sympathies.{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} Neither the former prime minister [[Arthur Balfour]],  Haldane's closest friend amongst the Conservatives, nor Asquith, the Liberal prime minister of the day and Haldane's closest political ally and friend for over 30 years, did anything to resist Bonar Law's demands.{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp=361-362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} [[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Asquith describes the charges as \"absolute nonsense\u201d and [[Max Egremont]] describes Balfour as \"knowing the injustice behind the charges,\u201d and, \u201cbeing privately indignant.\"{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}}\n\nTo the permanent detriment of his previously close relationship with Haldane, Asquith compounded his mistake by not expressing directly to Haldane his feelings on the latter's dismissal and the value of his previous service to the government and country.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|pp=324-328}} Jenkins describes this omission as \u201cthe most uncharacteristic fault of Asquiths whole career\u201d attributing it to Asquith suffering the \"indescribable blow\" of the surprise announcement of the engagement of the woman he loved, [[Venetia Stanley (1887\u20131948)|Venetia Stanley]], to one of his government ministers, [[Edwin Montagu]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp= 362-366}}{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=186}}\n\nFollowing his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General [[Aylmer Haldane]]; but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=268}} Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a Memorandum of Events, 1906\u201315, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George's new government, formed in December 1916, \"very low class\". Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, \"Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want\".{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=226}}\n\nAs the war progressed Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party, but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. When the [[Irish War of Independence]] broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force.\n\n== Contribution to Canadian constitutional law ==\n<!-- Please fix redirects to this section (i.e. (the) wicked stepfather of the Canadian Constitution) if you rename this section. Thanks! -->\nAs Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor.  He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the [[Canadian Constitution]], particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the [[British North America Act 1867]]. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government.  For instance, in the case of [[Canada v. Alberta|''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'']],<ref>''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'', 1919 [1922] 1 A.C. 191</ref> he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy, challenging the legality of the Canadian legislature.{{efn|In 1912 Haldane visited the Canadian Bar in Montreal, Quebec Province, described in {{harvnb|Haldane|1914|p=}} }} In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the \"[[peace, order and good government]]\" power of the federal government, as well as the federal [[criminal law power]].  Similarly, in ''[[Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider]]'',<ref>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] AC 396.</ref> Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right.  The effects of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers.\n\nHaldane's approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as [[F. R. Scott]]<ref>F. R. Scott, ''Some Privy Counsel'' (1950), 28 Can. Bar. Rev. 780.</ref> and [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice Bora Laskin]], as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving it of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues.  More recently, one major study has characterised him as \"the wicked stepfather\" of the Canadian Constitution.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}\n\n==Influence on education==\nIn 1895, Haldane helped the Webbs found the [[London School of Economics]].  A fundamental believer in the power of improving education, he prepared the London University Act 1898.  The philosophy of 'national efficiency' was central feature of the Hegelian complex, and the ideas of Schopenauer, he had learnt on the continent, that accentuated freedom and decentralisation from an historicist's perspective.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}  His moral centrism sought to unify ''The New Liberalism'', as he published it in Contemporary Review.<ref>Contemporary Review, (London 1892),</ref>  From a pan-European perspective he analysed the German character and economic advances towards militarism.  He was largely responsible for the cross-party support for Balfour's Education Act 1902.  He told Rosebery \"a sense of nation is working towards ...a great centre party.\"{{sfn|Matthew|1973|p= 145|ps=: from a letter of 6 October 1902}} He was also involved in the founding of [[Imperial College]] in 1907 and in his honour the University contained the Haldane Recreational Library, now part of the [[Imperial College Central Library|Central Library]].\n\nHaldane was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].  He wrote a biography of Adam Smith, extolling the virtues of free trade.  Unlike Chamberlain, he thought there was no strong connection between fiscal and imperial unity.  He opposed any attempt to protection of British trade.{{sfn|Ashley|1904|loc=Preface}}{{sfn|Matthew|1973|pp= 166\u2013168}}\n\nIn 1904, he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club's annual dinner, addressing \"The dedicated life\" to a group of students on 10 January 1907.  He also served as second [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Bristol]] where he made an important address titled \"The Civic University\" outlining his educational philosophy in 1911.  At the end of his life Lord Haldane was elected Chancellor of the [[University of St Andrews]] in June 1928.  Perhaps his greatest speech on education was made in House of Lords on 12 July 1916, at the height of the terrible slaughter on the Western Front.{{sfn|Ashby|Anderson|1970|p=135}}\n\n==Writings==\nHaldane co-translated the first English edition of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is ''The Reign of Relativity'' (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]]. Haldane published \"The Pathway to Reality\", based on the [[Gifford Lectures]] which he had delivered at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=136}} Some of his public addresses have also been published, including ''[[s:The future of democracy|The future of democracy]]'' (1918).\n\n* {{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality|date=1903|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/pathwaytorealit03haldgoog}}\n\n*{{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality: Stage the Second|date=1904|publisher=E.

He suffered from bad rheumatism, a stigmata in the eye and in 1909, he had to take bed rest when going blind from iritis. A lifelong walker and cigar smoker, he was diagnosed diabetic. \"The latter is a large, fat man\" was [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s initial impression of a dignified but portly demeanour.  Yet, added Haig, \"One seems to like the man at once.\" Having worked on the Army Regulations of 1909, Haig applauded \"a most clear headed and practical man\u2013\u2013very ready to listen and weigh carefully all that is said to him.\" [[Osbert Sitwell]] described him as \"entering a room with the air of a whole procession\". [[Leo Amery]] said he looked like \"the old-fashioned family butler\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} Another Imperialist, Winston Churchill also respected Haldane, although they were from differing social backgrounds. On promoting Churchill to First Lord of the Admiralty, Asquith advised him to seek Haldane's advice at a meeting held at Archerfield, North Berwick.{{efn|Haldane was impressed by the younger man's public speech at Bradford on 15 July 1898 during his early radicalism.}} From 1907 to 1908, he was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]].\n\nHaldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in [[Auchterarder]], Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72.<ref name=\"nytimes19280820\" /> The viscountcy became extinct on his death.\n\n==Later years==\nIn December 1918, Lloyd George appointed Haldane chairman of 'The Machinery of Government' committee.<ref name=\"civilservant.org.uk\" /> However, the Armistice had taken all impetus out of the reform agenda.\n\nAt the time of the [[1920 Paisley by-election|Paisley by-election of January 1920]] Haldane was in the process of shifting his sympathies from Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]], whom Haldane thought \"tiresome because she is ignorant\", to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith's election on a personal level.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=246-247}}\n\nBeing a fluent German speaker, ascetic philosopher and atheist, he played host to [[Albert Einstein]], when he visited London in 1921.  As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading intellectual on the philosophy of governance. \"The Reign of Relativity\" combined Haldane's love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|loc=A Hegelian Army|pp=183-185.}} Haldane admired the fact that Germans were \"trained to obey\".{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} Hegel's aristocratic desire for law and order and defence of property against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart  The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel's philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.{{sfn|Haldane|1922|p=}}{{sfn|Haldane|1926|p=}}\n\nHaldane refused to join the platform for Asquith's speech at [[Westminster Central Hall]] in January 1922. He stated that his main interest in public life was now education reform and that the cause was not best served by endorsing the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=253-255}} It was not until the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1923]] that Haldane formally sided with Labour, and made several speeches on behalf of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When the [[First Labour Government (UK)|Labour government]] was formed by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in early 1924, Haldane was recruited to serve once again as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref name=\"LG32901\" /> He was also joint Leader of the Labour Peers with [[Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor|Lord Parmoor]]. Haldane was a vital member of the [[Labour Government 1924|Cabinet]] as he was one of only three members who had sat in a cabinet before.<ref name=\"eswsc.com\" />\n\nHaldane was responsible for drafting the London University Act 1926, purchasing properties in Euston.

In speech fluent and even infinite he yielded to no living idealist in the easy coinage of sentimental phraseology. Here, indeed, he was a match for those who distributed the chloroform of Berlin. Do we not remember, for instance, that Germany was his spiritual home? But he none the less prepared himself, and the Empire, to talk when the time came with his spiritual friends in language not in the least spiritual. He devised the Territorial Army, which was capable of becoming the easy nucleus of national conscription, and which unquestionably ought to have been used for that purpose at the outbreak of war. He created the Imperial General Staff. He founded the Officers' Training Corps.\n|source={{citation|author=Lord Birkenhead|author-link=F. E.

powerful, subtle and encyclopaedic intellects ever devoted to the public service of his country\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nThe military historian [[Correlli Barnett]] claimed that Haldane had \"all-round personal talents far exceeding those of his predecessors\" as [[Secretary of State for War]] and that he was \"a man of first-class intellect and wide

He was [[Secretary of State for War]] between 1905 and 1912 during which time the \"[[Haldane Reforms]]\" of the British Army were implemented. Raised to the peerage as [[Viscount Haldane]] in 1911, he was [[Lord Chancellor]] between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of false allegations of German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and once again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 in the first ever Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was also an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1914.\n\n==Background and education==\nHaldane was born at 17 [[Charlotte Square]], Edinburgh, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist [[James Alexander Haldane]], the brother of respiratory [[physiologist]] [[John Scott Haldane]], [[William Haldane|Sir William Haldane]] and author [[Elizabeth Haldane]], and the uncle of [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Naomi Mitchison]].\n\nHe received his first education at the [[Edinburgh Academy]], and then at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He gained a first and MA at [[University of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\" /> where he received first-class honours in Philosophy and as Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar in philosophy of the four Scottish Universities.\n\nAfter studying law in London, he was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]], in 1879,<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/> and became a successful lawyer. He was taken on at 5 New Square Chambers by [[Horace Davey, Baron Davey|Lord Davey]] in 1882 as the junior.  Haldane's practice was a specialism in [[conveyancing]]; a particular skill for pleadings at appeal and tribunal cases, bringing cases to the privy council and house of Lords.  By 1890 he had become a [[Queen's Counsel]].<ref name=\"LG26018\" /> By 1905 he was earning [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000 per annum at the Bar{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} ({{Inflation|index=UK|currsign=\u00a3|value=20000|start_year=1905|fmt=eq|r=-5}}). He became a [[bencher]] at Lincoln's Inn in 1893.  Amongst his early friends was [[Edmund Gosse]], the scholarly librarian at the inn's law library, whose help made Haldane well known for being fully prepared in court and parliamentary briefs.\n\nHaldane was a deep thinker, an unusual breed: a philosopher-politician.  During his stay at G\u00f6ttingen he expanded an interest in the German philosophers, Schopenauer and Hegel.  He had refused a place at Balliol, but in nodding respect for the Master and philosopher, [[Thomas Hill Green|T H Green]], he dedicated his Schopenauer translation ''The World as Will and Idea'' which he carried through with a friend, [[Peter Hume Brown]], the Scottish historian.\n\n==Early political career==\nA cousin, the Whig politician [[Robert Adam Philips Haldane Haldane-Duncan, 3rd Earl of Camperdown|Lord Camperdown]] encouraged the young barrister into standing as a Liberal at the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|General Election of 1880]]. Although not elected that year Haldane joined the [[Eighty Club]], a political dining and discussion club formed in 1879. Membership was restricted to Liberals under the age of forty. In 1881 Haldane met [[H. H. Asquith]], and they soon became firm friends often meeting the Blue Post Public house on Cork Street. They were founders of the Albert Grey committee, named after Earl Grey, regularly discussing burning social issues, such as education.\n\nIn November 1885 Haldane was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Haddingtonshire]], a seat he held until 1911.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/><ref name=\"leighrayment.com\" /> The philosopher-politician wrote several articles for the advanced and progressive ''Contemporary Review''.  In October 1888, \"The Liberal Creed\" was published summarising his belief in the direction of New Liberalism.  In the 1890 article  \"The Eight Hours Question\" Haldane rejected the idea of the eight-hour day.  In 1888, he courted Emma Valentine Ferguson, sister of his Liberal party friend, [[Ronald Munro-Ferguson]]; she broke off the engagement and subsequently lampooned him in her novel ''Betsy'' in 1892.  Haldane became firmly ensconced in the Imperialist wing of Liberalism, led by Sir Edward Grey.  At the 1892 General Election, he received a shock when nearly defeated by the Liberal Unionist Master of Polwarth. [[Beatrice Webb]], the socialist who was a close intimate, remarked on how alone Haldane was in the world.{{sfn|Webb|1948|p=98}} Haldane added the preface to [[L T Hobhouse]]'s ''The Labour Movement'' in 1893.  Sadly Emma Ferguson died insane in 1897.  ''He had pathos in his personality'', remarked Webb, ''a successful lawyer tinged with socialism''.{{sfn|Webb|1986|p=345}}\n\n===Liberal Imperialist===\nFocusing on his writings, Haldane was passed over for political office, being the only one of his group left out in the wilderness.  Haldane remained an ally of Asquith and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in the [[Liberal Imperialist]] wing of the party, followers of Lord Rosebery rather than of Sir William Harcourt. Rosebery admired Haldane's intellect, and the Scotsman urged upon his friend, whom he had known since 1886, an assault on Tory power in the Lords in 1894.<ref name=\"Rosebery\" />  Haldane joined friends at the Articles Club, including Asquith and Grey. Haldane was disappointed having failed to secure the post of Solicitor-General in October 1894. At the time, Asquith wryly remarked, ''A very wrong decision come to upon inadequate grounds.''{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 335}} Haldane was sounded out of the Speakership by Rosebery, but refused it, declaring it to be a political death. The post went eventually to W Gully in 1895.\n\nAt a meeting with [[Beatrice Webb]], the Fabian socialist, Haldane told her he was disconsolate at the condition of the Liberal Party: \"Rot has set in there is no hope now but to be beaten and then reconstruct a new party\".{{efn|Diary of Beatrice Webb, 20 January 1895,<ref name=\"Passfield Papers\" /> cited in {{harvnb|McKinstry|2005|pp= 338-339}} }} The leaders of the party were exasperated and believed Rosebery to lack planning and direction. \"Although Asquith, Grey and I\", wrote Haldane, \"stuck by him... we never knew when he would retire and leave us in the lurch\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Note to his letters}} When Rosebery offered the Speakership, he refused it that March.{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc= Mss NLS 5951}} However, on 11 October 1896, he wrote to Rosebery that he \"was the leader of a revolution in our party\".{{sfn|Matthew|2011}}\n\nOn 11 August 1902, Haldane was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]],<ref name=\"LG27464\" /> following an announcement of the King\u2032s intention to make the appointment in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list, published in June that year.<ref name=\"TheTimes1902\" /> The King used his influence and charm to cultivate allies, bringing cross-party groups like [[The Souls]] together in consensual amity.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|p=}} Balfour's administration leant on Haldane's philosophy for educational reforms.\n\nAfter the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Arthur Balfour]] fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Asquith and his allies Haldane and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] would refuse to serve unless Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. Haldane had suggested involving the King at Balmoral to 'kick CB upstairs'.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=397-398}}However, the plot (called \"[[The Relugas Compact]]\" after Grey's Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Campbell-Bannerman.{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|pp=467-468}}\n\nHaldane wrote, \"One longs for Rosebery had he been coming in to his right place at the head of affairs, we could have gone anywhere with confidence. But it seems now as if this were not to be and we have to do the only thing we can do, which is to resolutely follow a plan of concerted action\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Letter from Lord Haldane to Sir Francis Knollys, Private Secretary to Edward VII on 12 September 1905}}\n\nOn 13 December 1905, Haldane was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], but he may have been offered the jobs of Attorney-General and Home Secretary.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} (Grey became Foreign Secretary).<ref name=\"LG27862\" /> Unity in the Liberals helped them obtain the largest electoral majority in the party's history in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 476}}\n\n==Secretary of State for War==\nAs early as January 1906 Haldane was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist Edward Grey to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans.{{efn|He invited Colonel Huguet, the French Military Attache to Plan at War Office from Jan 1906.{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} }} However, Haldane's first estimates reduced the Army by 16,600 men and reduced expenditure by \u00a32.6m to \u00a328&nbsp;million, as the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment.{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}} By 1914 Britain spent 3.4% of national income on defence, little more in absolute terms than Austria-Hungary's 6.1%.  Army expenditure was determined according to a formula devised by the Esher Committee. In 1900, during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], army expenditure was \u00a386.8m, by 1910 (a low point, after four years of cuts under the Liberals) it had dropped to \u00a327.6m and by 1914 it had risen back to \u00a329.4m.  In March 1914 effective expenditure on the Army, after allowing for increased pensions and \u00a31m set aside for military aviation, was still less than in 1907-8, and \u00a32m less than in 1905-6 (despite a 20% rise in prices since then).{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}}\n\nIn October 1907 Haldane was intimately involved with the negotiations at Windsor with Kaiser Wilhelm. The Germanophile and linguist was thrilled to be summoned at 1&nbsp;am to talk with the Emperor on arms reduction principles over whisky. But the import was the Baghdad-Berlin railway which Germany was hoping to construct with British approval.  A fluent German-speaker, Haldane was lulled into a false sense of security believing 'like a bear with a sore head' that he had won a great deal.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|p=}}{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=414-415}}{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=}} Another such conference took place at Balmoral in September 1909.  The Kaiser arrogantly insisted that only the King was of equal rank.\n\nDespite the budgetary constraints, Haldane implemented a wide-ranging set of reforms of the Army, aimed at preparing the [[British Army|army]] for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later wrote that \"in every respect the Expeditionary Force of 1914 was incomparably the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army ever to leave these shores\"{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=140}}\n\n[[Image:Haldane a West Point.jpg|thumb|left|Haldane at [[West Point]] sometime before the Great War.]]\n\n==Army reforms==\n{{main|Haldane Reforms}}\nHaldane set up the [[Imperial General Staff]]. Before Haldane, there was only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which met only in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] had recommended the setting up of an Army Council and the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=138}} Haldane's reforms also created the [[Territorial Force]] of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home,{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} the [[Officer Training Corps]] and the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]].\n\nIn all the reforms, Haldane worked closely at the War Office with [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Major-General Haig]]. By coincidence, both men had been born in Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh. [[John Alfred Spender|J. A. Spender]] later wrote of how Haldane got the best work out of an able but verbally-incoherent soldier (thought to refer to Haig) by not scoring verbal points off him, as many politicians would have done.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nUsually critical, Rosebery remarked on Haldane's interest in philosophy, declaring: \"I have read his Secret Memorandum, and that was enough\". In 1907 and 1908, Haldane passed far-reaching reforms to Army management. He was accredited as an efficient bureaucratic leader, notably founding the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in a Second Memorandum. His reforms re-oriented British military policy, revamped army organization along the lines of the German General Staff, upgraded the training of the auxiliary forces, and created an efficient and economically run service. Those reforms enabled Britain to send some 120,000 men to France in fifteen days in August 1914.{{sfn|Bond|1963|pp=33-43}}\n\nHaldane was also instrumental in the creation the [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979).\n\n==Philosopher-politician==\nThroughout his long career and association with the modernisers or 'Limps' Haldane used his considerable intellect to great advantage against economy.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=51-52}} A radical liberal,{{sfn|Tanner|2003|p=45}} Haldane was also, according to historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], one of the \"best supporters\" of David Lloyd George's \"[[People's Budget]].\"{{sfn|Pugh|2014|p=46}} During the constitutional and budget crisis of 1909\u201311, Haldane advised his friend and Prime Minister, Asquith on the legal niceties of his stance towards the monarch, who was outraged at the firebrand speeches from Churchill and Lloyd George. Stumbling from illness to illness, Haldane's own bad health was similar to King Edward's declining fortunes.\n\n[[File:Viscount Haldane LC by Vandyk.jpg|thumb|The Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, 1912]]\nTwo elections ensued, one in January and another in December 1910, before in 1911 he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Haldane''', of Cloan in the [[County of Perth]].<ref name=\"LG28480\" /> He became Leader in the Lords, responsible for the passage of the Parliament Act. On [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl of Loreburn|Lord Loreburn's]] retirement in June 1912, Haldane succeeded him as [[Lord Chancellor]],{{sfn|Heuston|1987|pp=166-}} making a self-deprecating speech as to his abilities as a legal expert.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=253}}\n\n==Haldane Mission==\n1912 saw the unsuccessful attempt of the '''Haldane Mission''', an effort to quell the friction between Britain and Germany arising because of [[Anglo-German naval arms race|their naval arms race]].{{sfn|Scott|1918|pp=589\u2013596}} The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \"naval holiday\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\" Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure. .{{sfn|Maurer|1992|pp=284\u2013308}}{{sfn|Langhorne|1971|pp= 359\u2013370}} On 19 May 1913 he was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]].\n\n==First World War==\nIn March 1914 Haldane's successor at the War Office, [[Jack Seely]], resigned following the [[Curragh incident]]. Rather than appoint a successor, Asquith decided to take over responsibility for the War Office directly himself. Asquith relied heavily on Haldane as the previous War Secretary and empowered him to carry out tasks at the War Office on his behalf. As the situation in Europe worsened, Asquith kept Haldane abreast of developments with Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office. Haldane was one of the first members of the Cabinet to recognise that war with Germany was inevitable and persuaded Asquith to mobilise by assembly of the Army Council on 3 August.{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}} With war imminent, Asquith was happy for Haldane to continue at the War Office formally as Secretary of State for War, but Haldane persuaded him to appoint [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Kitchener]].{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}}\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War One Haldane was falsely accused of pro-German sympathies, in July 1914, for hosting [[Albert Ballin]], a German shipping magnate and unofficial mediator between Germany and Britain. The accusations were widely believed, even being echoed in a popular music hall song (\"All dressed up and nowhere to go\") in the revue \"Mr Manhattan\". He was harried in particular by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'', which gave great publicity to the claim by Professor Onkel of Heidelberg that he had said that \"Germany was his spiritual home\". He had in fact said that about Professor [[Hermann Lotze]]'s classroom at G\u00f6ttingen, at a dinner party given by [[Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] in April 1913 to enable him to meet some German professors during his mission.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nIn 1915, Asquith ranked his Cabinet, putting Haldane only sixth of the inner cabinet members.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=}} He also inveigled Kitchener and Haldane to sign the King's Pledge, a vow to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war, which Haldane resented and which Churchill and Asquith himself completely ignored.\n\n==Dismissal from office==\n\nHaldane's dismissal from office in May 1915 is widely regarded by historians as unfair.  Following the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shell crisis]] and the resignation of [[Lord Fisher]] the Liberals were obliged to form a coalition government with the Conservatives who, under the leadership of [[Bonar Law]], insisted on the removal of [[Winston Churchill]] as First Lord of the Admiralty and the dismissal of Haldane.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=188}}{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=360}} Haldane's removal was on account of the popularity of the press's campaign relating to Haldane's alleged pro-German sympathies.{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} Neither the former prime minister [[Arthur Balfour]],  Haldane's closest friend amongst the Conservatives, nor Asquith, the Liberal prime minister of the day and Haldane's closest political ally and friend for over 30 years, did anything to resist Bonar Law's demands.{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp=361-362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} [[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Asquith describes the charges as \"absolute nonsense\u201d and [[Max Egremont]] describes Balfour as \"knowing the injustice behind the charges,\u201d and, \u201cbeing privately indignant.\"{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}}\n\nTo the permanent detriment of his previously close relationship with Haldane, Asquith compounded his mistake by not expressing directly to Haldane his feelings on the latter's dismissal and the value of his previous service to the government and country.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|pp=324-328}} Jenkins describes this omission as \u201cthe most uncharacteristic fault of Asquiths whole career\u201d attributing it to Asquith suffering the \"indescribable blow\" of the surprise announcement of the engagement of the woman he loved, [[Venetia Stanley (1887\u20131948)|Venetia Stanley]], to one of his government ministers, [[Edwin Montagu]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp= 362-366}}{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=186}}\n\nFollowing his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General [[Aylmer Haldane]]; but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=268}} Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a Memorandum of Events, 1906\u201315, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George's new government, formed in December 1916, \"very low class\". Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, \"Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want\".{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=226}}\n\nAs the war progressed Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party, but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. When the [[Irish War of Independence]] broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force.\n\n== Contribution to Canadian constitutional law ==\n<!-- Please fix redirects to this section (i.e. (the) wicked stepfather of the Canadian Constitution) if you rename this section. Thanks! -->\nAs Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor.  He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the [[Canadian Constitution]], particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the [[British North America Act 1867]]. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government.  For instance, in the case of [[Canada v. Alberta|''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'']],<ref>''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'', 1919 [1922] 1 A.C. 191</ref> he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy, challenging the legality of the Canadian legislature.{{efn|In 1912 Haldane visited the Canadian Bar in Montreal, Quebec Province, described in {{harvnb|Haldane|1914|p=}} }} In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the \"[[peace, order and good government]]\" power of the federal government, as well as the federal [[criminal law power]].  Similarly, in ''[[Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider]]'',<ref>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] AC 396.</ref> Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right.  The effects of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers.\n\nHaldane's approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as [[F. R. Scott]]<ref>F. R. Scott, ''Some Privy Counsel'' (1950), 28 Can. Bar. Rev. 780.</ref> and [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice Bora Laskin]], as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving it of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues.  More recently, one major study has characterised him as \"the wicked stepfather\" of the Canadian Constitution.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}\n\n==Influence on education==\nIn 1895, Haldane helped the Webbs found the [[London School of Economics]].  A fundamental believer in the power of improving education, he prepared the London University Act 1898.  The philosophy of 'national efficiency' was central feature of the Hegelian complex, and the ideas of Schopenauer, he had learnt on the continent, that accentuated freedom and decentralisation from an historicist's perspective.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}  His moral centrism sought to unify ''The New Liberalism'', as he published it in Contemporary Review.<ref>Contemporary Review, (London 1892),</ref>  From a pan-European perspective he analysed the German character and economic advances towards militarism.  He was largely responsible for the cross-party support for Balfour's Education Act 1902.  He told Rosebery \"a sense of nation is working towards ...a great centre party.\"{{sfn|Matthew|1973|p= 145|ps=: from a letter of 6 October 1902}} He was also involved in the founding of [[Imperial College]] in 1907 and in his honour the University contained the Haldane Recreational Library, now part of the [[Imperial College Central Library|Central Library]].\n\nHaldane was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].  He wrote a biography of Adam Smith, extolling the virtues of free trade.  Unlike Chamberlain, he thought there was no strong connection between fiscal and imperial unity.  He opposed any attempt to protection of British trade.{{sfn|Ashley|1904|loc=Preface}}{{sfn|Matthew|1973|pp= 166\u2013168}}\n\nIn 1904, he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club's annual dinner, addressing \"The dedicated life\" to a group of students on 10 January 1907.  He also served as second [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Bristol]] where he made an important address titled \"The Civic University\" outlining his educational philosophy in 1911.  At the end of his life Lord Haldane was elected Chancellor of the [[University of St Andrews]] in June 1928.  Perhaps his greatest speech on education was made in House of Lords on 12 July 1916, at the height of the terrible slaughter on the Western Front.{{sfn|Ashby|Anderson|1970|p=135}}\n\n==Writings==\nHaldane co-translated the first English edition of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is ''The Reign of Relativity'' (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]]. Haldane published \"The Pathway to Reality\", based on the [[Gifford Lectures]] which he had delivered at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=136}} Some of his public addresses have also been published, including ''[[s:The future of democracy|The future of democracy]]'' (1918).\n\n* {{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality|date=1903|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/pathwaytorealit03haldgoog}}\n\n*{{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality: Stage the Second|date=1904|publisher=E.

He suffered from bad rheumatism, a stigmata in the eye and in 1909, he had to take bed rest when going blind from iritis. A lifelong walker and cigar smoker, he was diagnosed diabetic. \"The latter is a large, fat man\" was [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s initial impression of a dignified but portly demeanour.  Yet, added Haig, \"One seems to like the man at once.\" Having worked on the Army Regulations of 1909, Haig applauded \"a most clear headed and practical man\u2013\u2013very ready to listen and weigh carefully all that is said to him.\" [[Osbert Sitwell]] described him as \"entering a room with the air of a whole procession\". [[Leo Amery]] said he looked like \"the old-fashioned family butler\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} Another Imperialist, Winston Churchill also respected Haldane, although they were from differing social backgrounds. On promoting Churchill to First Lord of the Admiralty, Asquith advised him to seek Haldane's advice at a meeting held at Archerfield, North Berwick.{{efn|Haldane was impressed by the younger man's public speech at Bradford on 15 July 1898 during his early radicalism.}} From 1907 to 1908, he was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]].\n\nHaldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in [[Auchterarder]], Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72.<ref name=\"nytimes19280820\" /> The viscountcy became extinct on his death.\n\n==Later years==\nIn December 1918, Lloyd George appointed Haldane chairman of 'The Machinery of Government' committee.<ref name=\"civilservant.org.uk\" /> However, the Armistice had taken all impetus out of the reform agenda.\n\nAt the time of the [[1920 Paisley by-election|Paisley by-election of January 1920]] Haldane was in the process of shifting his sympathies from Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]], whom Haldane thought \"tiresome because she is ignorant\", to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith's election on a personal level.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=246-247}}\n\nBeing a fluent German speaker, ascetic philosopher and atheist, he played host to [[Albert Einstein]], when he visited London in 1921.  As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading intellectual on the philosophy of governance. \"The Reign of Relativity\" combined Haldane's love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|loc=A Hegelian Army|pp=183-185.}} Haldane admired the fact that Germans were \"trained to obey\".{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} Hegel's aristocratic desire for law and order and defence of property against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart  The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel's philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.{{sfn|Haldane|1922|p=}}{{sfn|Haldane|1926|p=}}\n\nHaldane refused to join the platform for Asquith's speech at [[Westminster Central Hall]] in January 1922. He stated that his main interest in public life was now education reform and that the cause was not best served by endorsing the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=253-255}} It was not until the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1923]] that Haldane formally sided with Labour, and made several speeches on behalf of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When the [[First Labour Government (UK)|Labour government]] was formed by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in early 1924, Haldane was recruited to serve once again as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref name=\"LG32901\" /> He was also joint Leader of the Labour Peers with [[Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor|Lord Parmoor]]. Haldane was a vital member of the [[Labour Government 1924|Cabinet]] as he was one of only three members who had sat in a cabinet before.<ref name=\"eswsc.com\" />\n\nHaldane was responsible for drafting the London University Act 1926, purchasing properties in Euston.

Do we not remember, for instance, that Germany was his spiritual home? But he none the less prepared himself, and the Empire, to talk when the time came with his spiritual friends in language not in the least spiritual.

It is located between the districts of [[Kolonaki]] and [[Pangrati]], directly behind the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament building]] (The Old Palace) and continues to the South to the area where the [[Zappeion]] is located, across from the [[Panathinaiko Stadium|Panathenaiko]] or Kalimarmaro [[Olympic Stadium]] of the [[1896 Olympic Games]]. The Garden also encloses some ancient ruins, tambourines and [[Corinthian Order|Corinthian]] capitals of columns, [[mosaic]]s, and other features. On the Southeast side are the busts of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the first [[governor]] of Greece, and of the [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]] [[Jean-Gabriel Eynard]]. On the South side are the busts of the celebrated Greek poets [[Dionysios Solomos]], author of the Greek National Hymn, and [[Aristotelis Valaoritis]].\n\n==History==\nThe Royal Garden was commissioned by [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Queen Amalia]] in 1838 and completed by 1840. It was designed by the German agronomist Friedrich Schmidt who imported over 500 species of plants and a variety of animals including peacocks, ducks, and turtles. Unfortunately for many of the plants, the dry Mediterranean climate proved too harsh and they did not survive. Other botanists planning and managing the garden include [[Karl Nikolas Fraas]], [[Theodor von Heldreich]] and [[Spyridon Miliarakis]].\n\nA part of the upper garden, behind the Old Palace, was fenced off and was the    private refuge of the King and Queen. The garden was open to the public in the afternoons.\n\nClose to the garden in 1878 the neo-classical [[Zappeion]] Hall was built. It was donated by [[Evangelis Zappas]] and designed by [[Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]]. Zappas had started the Zappian Olympic Games, a precursor to the modern [[Olympic Games]]. The Zappeion was the Olympic village for the 1896 [[Summer Olympics]] in Athens and also as a venue for the fencing events. Starting in the 1920s, the area in front of the Zappeion was also a major transportation hub for [[Athens Tram|trams]] and buses. Today it is used for public exhibitions. \n\n===The Royal Garden===\nThe Royal Garden was the scene of an unusual turning point in Greek history. In 1920, at the end of [[World War I]], Greece under [[Alexander of Greece|King Alexander]] and the government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] remained committed to the [[Megali Idea]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for The Great Idea) that Greece should gain control of portions of [[Asia Minor]]. In 1919, they began the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] with the support of their former allies [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]]. While walking in the Garden on September 30, 1920, King Alexander was bitten by a pet monkey (whose pet it is not revealed) and he died of [[sepsis]] three weeks later. His death ushered the return of his deposed father, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] who had been deposed for his pro-[[Germany|German]] sympathies during the First World War. Upon his return to power, King Constantine assisted in the defeat of his political nemesis, Venizelos in the November 1920 General Election. The new Prime Minister, [[Dimitrios Gounaris]], a monarchist, began replacing the Venezelist military staff with officers more loyal to the new King. As a result of this change in political environment and it is argued, the reduction in military experience by the Army's General Staff, the Allied Powers withdrew their support. The result was the 1922 [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], the defeat of Greek troops in Turkey with exodus of Greek refugees and the 1923 [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey]] known collectively by the Greeks as the Asia Minor \"Catastrophe. [[Winston Churchill]] wrote, \"it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this      monkey's bite.\"<ref>Churchill, p. 409, quoted (for example) in Pentzopoulos, p. 39.</ref>\n\n===The National Garden===\n[[File:A sundial at the National Gardens of Athens.JPG|thumb|200px|A child and woman looking at a [[sundial]] installed at the National Gardens of Athens in 2013]]\n\nIn the 1920s the park was opened to the public and renamed \"National Garden\". In honour of Amalia of Greece, the entrance was moved to the 12 palms she planted and the street in front was renamed Queen Amalia Avenue. Since then the National Garden, is open to the public from sunrise to sunset. \n\n[[Henry Miller]] wrote in 1939:\n<blockquote>\n\"It remains in my memory like no other park I have known. It is the quintessence of a park, the thing one feels sometimes in looking at a canvas or dreaming of a place one would like to be in and never finds.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greece-athens.com/place.php?place_id=109 |title=National Gardens |publisher= Travel to Athens, Greece |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004 the Greek state gave the garden for 90 years to the city of Athens.\n\n==Services==\nThe National Garden, is open to the public from sunrise to sunset. The main entrance is on Leoforos Amalias, the street named after the Queen who envisioned this park. You can also enter the garden from one of three other gates: the central one, on Vasilissis Sophias Avenue, another on [[Herodou Attikou Street]] and the third gate connects the National Garden with the Zappeion park area. In the National Garden there are a duck pond, a Botanical Museum, a small cafe and a Children's Library and playground.\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Gardens 1905.png|The Royal Garden c.1905\nFile:20100411 athina100.JPG|View of the entrance\nFile:\"\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0392\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\", \u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u038c\u03bb\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 - panoramio (1).jpg|Monument to [[Lord Byron]]\nFile:Athens - National Gardens - monument 02.jpg|Statue of [[Ioannis Varvakis]]\nFile:National park of Athens5.JPG|Antiquities within the National Garden\nFile:Palm trees in the Athens' National Garden - panoramio.jpg|Palm trees\nFile:Attica 06-13 Athens 13 National Garden.jpg|Ponds in National Garden\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Greece}}\n*[[Greek gardens]]\n*[[:Category:Landscape design history|Landscape design history]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.greece-athens.com/place.php?place_id=109 Athens City Guide.]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|National Garden of Athens}}\n\n{{Landmarks in Athens}}\n\n[[Category:1840 establishments in Greece]]\n[[Category:Areas of Athens]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Athens]]\n[[Category:Parks in Greece]]\n[[Category:Gardens in Greece]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Athens]]\n[[Category:Geography of Athens]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}\n{{Infobox park\n| name = \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u039a\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2<br /> National Gardens\n| alt_name = \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u039a\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2<br /> Royal Gardens\n| photo = National Gardens.jpg\n| photo_width = 300\n| photo_caption = Interior view\n| type = Public park\n| location = [[Athens]], [[Greece]]\n| coords = {{coord|37|58|27|N|23|44|18|E|region:GR|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| area = {{convert|15.5|ha}}\n| created = 1838\n| operator = \n| visitation_num = \n| status = Open year round\n| map = Greece Athens central\n| map_width = 272px\n| map_alt = \n| map_caption = Location within central Athens\n|publictransit = {{OASA icons|M|15}} {{OASA icons|M2}}{{OASA icons|M3}} [[Syntagma metro station|Syntagma station]]\n}}\n\n[[File:National park of Athens1.JPG|thumb|220px|The National Garden in central Athens, commissioned by [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Amalia]], the first Queen of modern Greece.]]\n\nThe '''National Garden'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.athensinfoguide.com/wtsgarden.htm |title=The National Garden |publisher=Athens Info Guide , 2004-2009 |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.athensguide.com/gardens.html |title=The National Garden, Zappion, Panathenaic Stadium and the Temple of Olympian Zeus |publisher=Athens Survival Guide |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref> (formerly the '''Royal Garden''') ({{lang-el|\u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u039a\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}}) is a public park of {{convert|15.5|ha}} in the center of the [[Greece|Greek]] capital, [[Athens]].

On the South side are the busts of the celebrated Greek poets [[Dionysios Solomos]], author of the Greek National Hymn, and [[Aristotelis Valaoritis]].\n\n==History==\nThe Royal Garden was commissioned by [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Queen Amalia]] in 1838 and completed by 1840. It was designed by the German agronomist Friedrich Schmidt who imported over 500 species of plants and a variety of animals including peacocks, ducks, and turtles. Unfortunately for many of the plants, the dry Mediterranean climate proved too harsh and they did not survive. Other botanists planning and managing the garden include [[Karl Nikolas Fraas]], [[Theodor von Heldreich]] and [[Spyridon Miliarakis]].\n\nA part of the upper garden, behind the Old Palace, was fenced off and was the private refuge of the King and Queen. The garden was open to the public in the afternoons.\n\nClose to the garden in 1878 the neo-classical [[Zappeion]] Hall was built. It was donated by [[Evangelis Zappas]] and designed by [[Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]]. Zappas had started the Zappian Olympic Games, a precursor to the modern [[Olympic Games]]. The Zappeion was the Olympic village for the 1896 [[Summer Olympics]] in Athens and also as a venue for the fencing events. Starting in the 1920s, the area in front of the Zappeion was also a major transportation hub for [[Athens Tram|trams]] and buses. Today it is used for public exhibitions. \n\n===The Royal Garden===\nThe Royal Garden was the scene of an unusual turning point in Greek history. In 1920, at the end of [[World War I]], Greece under [[Alexander of Greece|King Alexander]] and the government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] remained committed to the [[Megali Idea]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for The Great Idea) that Greece should gain control of portions of [[Asia Minor]]. In 1919, they began the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] with the support of their former allies [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]]. While walking in the Garden on September 30, 1920, King Alexander was bitten by a pet monkey (whose pet it is not revealed) and he died of [[sepsis]] three weeks later. His death ushered the return of his deposed father, [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] who had been deposed for his pro-[[Germany|German]] sympathies during the First World War. Upon his return to power, King Constantine assisted in the defeat of his political nemesis, Venizelos in the November 1920 General Election. The new Prime Minister, [[Dimitrios Gounaris]], a monarchist, began replacing the Venezelist military staff with officers more loyal to the new King. As a result of this change in political environment and it is argued, the reduction in military experience by the Army's General Staff, the Allied Powers withdrew their support. The result was the 1922 [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], the defeat of Greek troops in Turkey with exodus of Greek refugees and the 1923 [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey]] known collectively by the Greeks as the Asia Minor \"Catastrophe. [[Winston Churchill]] wrote, \"it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey's bite.\"<ref>Churchill, p. 409, quoted (for example) in Pentzopoulos, p. 39.</ref>\n\n===The National Garden===\n[[File:A sundial at the National Gardens of Athens.JPG|thumb|200px|A child and woman looking at a [[sundial]] installed at the National Gardens of Athens in 2013]]\n\nIn the 1920s the park was opened to the public and renamed \"National Garden\". In honour of Amalia of Greece, the entrance was moved to the 12 palms she planted and the street in front was renamed Queen Amalia Avenue. Since then the National Garden, is open to the public from sunrise to sunset. \n\n[[Henry Miller]] wrote in 1939:\n<blockquote>\n\"It remains in my memory like no other park I have known. It is the quintessence of a park, the thing one feels sometimes in looking at a canvas or dreaming of a place one would like to be in and never finds.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greece-athens.com/place.php?place_id=109 |title=National Gardens |publisher= Travel to Athens, Greece |accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004 the Greek state gave the garden for 90 years to the city of Athens.\n\n==Services==\nThe National Garden, is open to the public from sunrise to sunset. The main entrance is on Leoforos Amalias, the street named after the Queen who envisioned this park. You can also enter the garden from one of three other gates: the central one, on Vasilissis Sophias Avenue, another on [[Herodou Attikou Street]] and the third gate connects the National Garden with the Zappeion park area. In the National Garden there are a duck pond, a Botanical Museum, a small cafe and a Children's Library and playground.\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Gardens 1905.png|The Royal Garden c.1905\nFile:20100411 athina100.JPG|View of the entrance\nFile:\"\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0392\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\", \u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u038c\u03bb\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 - panoramio (1).jpg|Monument to [[Lord Byron]]\nFile:Athens - National Gardens - monument 02.jpg|Statue of [[Ioannis Varvakis]]\nFile:National park of Athens5.JPG|Antiquities within the National Garden\nFile:Palm trees in the Athens' National Garden - panoramio.jpg|Palm trees\nFile:Attica 06-13 Athens 13 National Garden.jpg|Ponds in National Garden\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Greece}}\n*[[Greek gardens]]\n*[[:Category:Landscape design history|Landscape design history]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.greece-athens.com/place.php?place_id=109 Athens City Guide.]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|National Garden of Athens}}\n\n{{Landmarks in Athens}}\n\n[[Category:1840 establishments in Greece]]\n[[Category:Areas of Athens]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Athens]]\n[[Category:Parks in Greece]]\n[[Category:Gardens in Greece]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Athens]]\n[[Category:Geography of Athens]]\n", "name_user": "109.151.193.82", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eThe Royal Garden)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Garden,_Athens"}

{"title_page": "Valuation (geometry)", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], a '''valuation''' is a finitely additive function on a collection of admissible subsets of a fixed set <math>X</math> with values in an abelian [[semigroup]]. \nFor example, the [[Lebesgue measure]] is a valuation on finite unions of convex bodies (i.e. non-empty compact convex sets) of Euclidean space <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>. Other examples of valuations  on finite unions of convex bodies are the surface area, the mean width, and the [[Euler characteristic]]. \n\nIn the geometric setting, often continuity (or smoothness) conditions are imposed on valuations, but there are also purely discrete facets of the theory. In fact, the concept of valuation has its origin in the dissection theory of [[polytope]]s and in particular [[Hilbert's third problem|Hilbert's third problem]], which has grown into a rich theory, heavily reliant on advanced tools from abstract algebra.\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>X</math>  be a set and <math>\\mathcal S</math> be a collection of admissible subsets of <math>X</math>. A function <math>\\phi</math> on  <math>\\mathcal S</math> with values in an abelian semigroup <math>R</math> is called a '''valuation''' if it satisfies \n<math display=\"block\"> \\phi(A\\cup B)+  \\phi(A\\cap B) = \\phi(A)+ \\phi(B)</math>\nwhenever <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>A\\cup B</math>, and  <math>A\\cap B</math> are elements of <math>\\mathcal S</math>. \nIf <math>\\emptyset\\in \\mathcal S</math>, then one  always assumes <math>\\phi(\\emptyset)=0</math>. \n\n===Examples===\nSome common examples for the admissible sets <math>\\mathcal S</math> are   non-empty compact convex sets in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> (convex bodies), compact convex polytopes in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>, convex cones, and smooth compact polyhedra in a smooth manifold <math>X</math>.\n  \nLet <math>V</math> be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let <math>\\mathcal K(V)</math> denote the set of convex bodies in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>. \n\n* The [[Euler characteristic]] <math>\\chi(K)=1</math> is a valuation on <math>\\mathcal K(V)</math>,  and it extends as a valuation to the collection of finite unions of convex bodies.\n* The [[Lebesgue measure]] on <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>, restricted to convex bodies, is a valuation on <math>\\mathcal K(\\mathbb R^n)</math>.\n* Among the valuations derived from volume are the [[Mixed_volume#Quermassintegrals|intrinsic volumes]],\n<math display=\"block\"> V_i(K)= c_{n,i} \\left.\\frac{d^i}{dt^i}\\right|_{t=0} \\operatorname{vol}_n(K+tB^n),\\qquad i=0,1,\\ldots,n,</math>\nwhere <math>c_{n,i}</math> is a normalizing constant and <math>B^n\\subset \\mathbb R^n</math> is the Euclidean unit ball, and more generally the [[mixed volume]]s (with some entries fixed arbitrarily). \n* The lattice point enumerator <math>G(P)= |\\mathbb Z^n\\cap P|</math>, where <math>\\mathbb Z^n\\subset \\mathbb R^n</math>  is the integer lattice, is a valuation on lattice polytopes.\n* The map <math>K\\mapsto h_K</math>, where \n<math display=\"block\">h_K(\\xi) = \\sup_{x\\in K} \\xi(x) \\qquad \\text{for } \\xi\\in V^*,</math> \nis the [[support function]] of <math>K</math>, is a valuation on <math>\\mathcal K(V)</math>.\n\n==Valuations on convex bodies==\nA valuation on <math>\\mathcal K(V)</math> is called ''translation-invariant'' if <math>\\phi(K+x)=\\phi(K)</math> for all <math>x\\in V</math> and all convex bodies <math>K</math>. \n\nLet <math>K,L</math> be two nonempty convex  bodies in <math>V</math>. After a choice of Euclidean inner product, their [[Hausdorff distance]] <math>d_H(K,L)</math> is defined by\n<math display=\"block\"> d_H(K,L)= \\inf\\{\\varepsilon >0\\colon  K\\subset L_\\varepsilon \\text{ and } L\\subset K_\\varepsilon \\},</math>\nwhere <math>K_\\varepsilon</math> denotes the <math>\\varepsilon</math>-neighborhood of <math>K</math>. Equipped with this metric, <math>\\mathcal K(V)</math> is a locally compact space.  \n\nThe space of continuous, translation-invariant valuations on <math>\\mathcal K(V)</math> taking values in the complex numbers <math>\\mathbb C</math>, is denoted by <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. \n\nThe topology on <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> is the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of <math>\\mathcal K (V)</math>.

In other words, <math>\\phi</math> is smooth if and only if <math>\\phi</math> is a smooth vector of the natural representation of <math>GL(V)</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. The space of smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)</math> is dense in <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>; it comes equipped with a natural Fr\u00e9chet space topology, which is finer than the one induced from <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. \n\nFor every smooth function <math>f</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)</math>,\n<math  display=\"block\" >\\phi(K)=\\int_{\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)} \\operatorname{vol}_i(P_E K) f(E) dE,</math>\nwhere <math>P_E\\colon \\mathbb R^n\\to E</math> denotes the orthogonal projection and <math>dE</math> is the Haar measure, defines a smooth even valuation of degree <math>i</math>. It follows from the Irreducibility Theorem, in combination with the Casselman-Wallach theorem, that any smooth even valuation can be represented in this way. Such a representation is sometimes called a ''Crofton formula''. \n\nFor any smooth [[differential form]] <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb R^n\\times S^{n-1})</math> that is invariant under all the  translations <math>(x,u)\\mapsto (x+t,u)</math> and every number <math>c\\in \\mathbb C</math>,  integration over the ''normal cycle'' defines a smooth valuation:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math  display=\"block\">  \\phi(K)= c\\operatorname{vol}_n(K) + \\int_{N(K)} \\omega, \\qquad K\\in \\mathcal K(\\mathbb R^n). </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nAs a set, the normal cycle <math>N(K)</math> consists of the outward unit normals to <math>K</math>. The Irreducibility Theorem implies that every smooth valuation  is of this form.\n\n==Operations on translation-invariant valuations==\nThere are several natural operations defined on the subspace of  smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\subset \\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. The most important one is the product of two smooth valuations. Together with pullback and pushforward, this operation extends to valuations on manifolds.\n\n===Exterior product===\nLet <math>V,W</math> be finite-dimensional real vector spaces. \nThere exists a bilinear map, called the exterior product, \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\boxtimes \\colon \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(W)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V\\times W) </math>\nwhich is uniquely characterized by the following two properties: \n*it is continuous with respect to the usual topologies on <math>\\operatorname{Val}</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty</math>.\n* if <math>\\phi=\\operatorname{vol}_V(\\bullet + A)</math> and <math>\\psi= \\operatorname{vol}_W(\\bullet + B)</math> where <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(V)</math> and <math>B\\in \\mathcal K(W)</math> are convex bodies with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature, and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_V</math> and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_W</math> are densities on <math>V</math> and <math>W</math>, then \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\phi\\boxtimes \\psi = (\\operatorname{vol}_V\\boxtimes \\operatorname{vol}_W) (\\bullet + A\\times B).</math>\n\n===Product===\nThe product of two smooth valuations <math>\\phi,\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)</math> is defined by \n<math display=\"block\"> (\\phi\\cdot \\psi)(K)= (\\phi\\boxtimes \\psi)(\\Delta(K)),</math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta \\colon V\\to V\\times V</math> is the diagonal embedding. The product is a continuous map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) .</math>\nEquipped with this product, <math> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) </math> becomes a commutative associative graded algebra with the Euler characteristic as the multiplicative identity.\n\n===Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality===\nBy a theorem of Alesker, the restriction of the product \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}_{n-k}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}_n^\\infty(V)=\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math> is a non-degenerate pairing. This motivates the definition of the <math>k</math>-homogeneous ''generalized valuation'', denoted <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>, as <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V)^*\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, topologized with the weak topology. By the Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality, there is a natural dense inclusion <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\hookrightarrow\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>.\n\n===Convolution===\nConvolution is a natural product on <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V^*)</math>. For simplicity, we fix a density <math>\\operatorname{vol}</math> on <math>V</math> to trivialize the second factor. Define for fixed <math>A,B\\in\\mathcal K(V)</math> with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)\\ast\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+B)=\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A+B).</math> There is then a unique extension by continuity to a map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V),</math> called the convolution.\nUnlike the product, convolution respects the co-grading, namely if <math>\\phi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i}(V)</math>, <math>\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-j}(V)</math>, then <math>\\phi\\ast\\psi\\in \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i-j}(V)</math>.\n\nFor instance, let <math>V(K_1,\\ldots, K_n)</math> denote the mixed volume of the convex bodies <math>K_1,\\ldots, K_n\\subset \\mathbb R^n</math>. If convex bodies <math>A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i}</math> in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> with  with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature   are fixed, then \n<math> \\phi(K) = V(K[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})</math>\ndefines a smooth valuation of degree <math>i</math>. The convolution two such valuations is\n<math display=\"block\">V(\\bullet[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})\\ast V(\\bullet[j],B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j})=c_{i,j}V(\\bullet[n-j-i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i},B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j}),</math>\nwhere <math>c_{i,j}</math> is a constant depending only on <math>i,j,n</math>.\n\n===Fourier transform===\nThe Alesker-Fourier transform is a natural, <math>GL(V)</math>-equivariant isomorphism of complex-valued valuations \n<math  display=\"block\">\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V),</math> discovered by Alesker and enjoying many properties resembling the classical Fourier transform, which explains its name.\n\nIt reverses the grading, namely  <math>\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, and maps product to convolution: <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F(\\phi\\cdot \\psi)=\\mathbb F\\phi\\ast\\mathbb F\\psi.</math> \n\nFixing for simplicity a Euclidean structure to identify <math>V=V^*</math>, <math>\\operatorname{Dens}(V)=\\mathbb C</math>, we have the identity <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F^2\\phi(K)=\\phi(-K).</math> On even valuations, there is a simple description of the Fourier transform in terms of the Klain embedding: <math>\\operatorname{Kl}_{\\mathbb F\\phi}(E)=\\operatorname{Kl}_\\phi(E^\\perp)</math>. In particular, even real-valued valuations remain real-valued after the Fourier transform. \n\nFor odd valuations, the description of the Fourier transform is substantially more involved. Unlike the even case, it is no longer of purely geometric nature. For instance, the space of real-valued odd valuations is not preserved.\n\n===Pullback and pushforward===\nGiven a linear map <math>f:U\\to V</math>, there are induced operations of pullback <math>f^*:\\operatorname{Val}(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(U)</math> and pushforward <math>f_*:\\operatorname{Val}(U)\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)^*</math>. The pullback is the simpler of the two, given by <math>f^*\\phi(K)=\\phi(f(K))</math>. It evidently preserves the parity and degree of homogeneity of a valuation.  \nNote that the pullback does not preserve smoothness when <math>f</math> is not injective.\n\nThe pushforward is harder to define formally. For simplicity, fix Lebesgue measures on <math>U</math> and <math>V</math>. The pushforward can be uniquely characterized by describing its action on valuations of the form <math>\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)</math>, for all <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(U)</math>, and then extended by continuity to all valuations using the Irreducibility Theorem. For a surjective map <math>f</math>, \n<math display=\"block\">f_*\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)=\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+f(A)).</math> For an inclusion <math>f:U\\hookrightarrow V</math>, choose a splitting <math>V=U\\oplus W</math>. Then \n<math display=\"block\"> f_*\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet + A) (K)= \\int_{W}\\operatorname{vol}(K\\cap (U+w) + A) dw.</math>\nInformally, the pushforward is dual to the pullback with respect to the Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 pairing: for <math>\\phi\\in \\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> and <math>\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}(U)\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*</math>, \n<math display=\"block\">\\langle f^*\\phi,\\psi\\rangle =\\langle \\phi, f_*\\psi\\rangle.</math>\nHowever, this identity has to be carefully interpreted since the pairing is only well-defined for smooth valuations.

'''181''' (2011), 189\u2013294</ref>.\n\n==Valuations on manifolds==\nIn a series of papers beginning in 2006, Alesker laid down the foundations for a theory of valuations on manifolds that extends the theory of valuations on convex bodies.  The key observation leading to this extension is that  via integration over the normal cycle ({{EquationNote|1}}), a smooth translation-invariant valuation may be evaluated on  sets  much more general than convex ones. Also ({{EquationNote|1}}) suggests to define  smooth valuations in general by dropping the requirement that the form <math>\\omega</math> be translation-invariant and by replacing the translation-invariant Lebesgue measure with an arbitrary smooth measure.\n\nLet <math>X</math> be an n-dimensional smooth manifold and let <math>\\mathbb P_X= \\mathbb P_+(T^* X)</math> be the co-sphere bundle of <math>X</math>, i.e., the oriented projectivization of the cotangent bundle. \nLet  <math>\\mathcal P(X)</math> denote the collection of compact differentiable polyhedra in <math>X</math>.  The normal cycle of <math>A\\in \\mathcal P(X)</math> is <math>N(A)\\subset \\mathbb P_X</math>, which consists of the outward co-normals to <math>A</math> and is naturally a Lipschitz submanifold of dimension <math>n-1</math>. \n\nFor ease of presentation we henceforth assume that <math>X</math> is oriented, even though the concept of smooth valuations in fact does not depend on orientability.  The space of smooth valuations <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> on <math>X</math> consists of functions  <math>\\phi\\colon \\mathcal  P(X)\\to \\mathbb C</math> of the form\n<math display=\"block\"> \\phi(A)= \\int_A\\mu + \\int_{N(A)}\\omega,\\qquad A\\in \\mathcal P(X),</math>\nwhere  <math>\\mu\\in\\Omega^n(X)</math> and <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb P_X)</math>  can be arbitrary. \nIt was shown by Alesker that the smooth valuations on open subsets of <math>X</math> form a soft sheaf over <math>X</math>.\n\n===Examples=== \nThe following are examples of smooth valuations on a smooth manifold <math>X</math>:\n* Smooth measures on <math>X</math>.\n* The [[Euler characteristic]]; this follows from the work of [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]]<ref>S.-S.

Other examples of valuations  on finite unions of convex bodies are the surface area, the mean width, and the [[Euler characteristic]]. \n\nIn the geometric setting, often continuity (or smoothness) conditions are imposed on valuations, but there are also purely discrete facets of the theory. In fact, the concept of valuation has its origin in the dissection theory of [[polytope]]s and in particular [[Hilbert's third problem|Hilbert's third problem]], which has grown into a rich theory, heavily reliant on advanced tools from abstract algebra.\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>X</math>  be a set and <math>\\mathcal S</math> be a collection of admissible subsets of <math>X</math>.

[[Rolf Schneider|Schneider]]<ref name=\"Schneider:Simple>R.

In particular, any simple valuation is the sum of an <math>n</math>- and an <math>(n-1)</math>-homogeneous valuation. This in turn implies that an <math>i</math>-homogeneous valuation is uniquely determined by its restrictions to all <math>(i+1)</math>-dimensional subspaces.\n\n===Embedding theorems===\nThe Klain embedding is a linear injection of <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^+(V)</math>, the space of even <math>i</math>-homogeneous valuations, into the space of continuous sections of a canonical complex line bundle over the Grassmannian <math>\\operatorname{Gr}_i(V)</math> of <math>i</math>-dimensional linear subspaces of <math>V</math>.

It is based on Schneider's description of simple valuations<ref name=\"Schneider:Simple\"></ref>. It is a linear injection of <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^-(V)</math>, the space of odd <math>i</math>-homogeneous valuations, into a certain quotient of the space of continuous sections of a line bundle over the partial flag manifold of cooriented pairs <math>(F^i\\subset E^{i+1})</math>.

It is nothing but the [[Schwartz kernel theorem|Schwartz kernel]] of a natural polarization that any <math>\\phi\\in\\operatorname{Val}_k(V)</math> admits, namely as a functional on the <math>k</math>-fold product of <math>C^2(S^{n-1})</math>, the latter space of functions having the geometric meaning of differences of support functions of smooth convex bodies. For details, see <ref name=\"Alesker:Book\"></ref>.\n\n===Irreducibility Theorem===\nThe classical theorems of Hadwiger, Schneider and McMullen give fairly explicit descriptions of valuations that are homogeneous of degree  <math>1</math>, <math>n-1</math>, and <math>n=\\operatorname{dim} V</math>. But for degrees <math>1<i<n-1</math> very little was known before the turn of the 21st century. McMullen's conjecture is the statement that the valuations \n<math display=\"block\">\\phi_A(K)=\\operatorname{vol}_n(K+A), \\qquad A\\in\\mathcal K(V),</math>\nspan a dense subspace of <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. McMullen's conjecture was confirmed by [[Semyon Alesker|Alesker]] in a much stronger form, which became known as the Irreducibility Theorem:\n\n'''Theorem''' (Alesker<ref name=\"Alesker:Irred\">S. Alesker, ''Description of translation invariant valuations on convex sets with solution of P. McMullen's conjecture''. Geom. Funct. Anal. '''11''' (2001), no. 2, 244\u2013272.</ref>). For every  <math>0<i<n</math>,  the natural action of <math>GL(V)</math> on the spaces <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^+(V)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^-(V)</math> is irreducible.\n\nHere the action of the [[general linear group]] <math>GL(V)</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> is given by \n<math display=\"block\"> (g\\cdot \\phi)(K)= \\phi(g^{-1} K).</math>\nThe proof of the Irreducibility Theorem is based on the embedding theorems of the previous section and [[Beilinson-Bernstein localization]].\n\n===Smooth valuations===\nA valuation <math>\\phi\\in\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> is called ''smooth'' if the map <math>g\\mapsto g\\cdot \\phi</math> from <math>GL(V)</math> to <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> is smooth. In other words, <math>\\phi</math> is smooth if and only if <math>\\phi</math> is a smooth vector of the natural representation of <math>GL(V)</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. The space of smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)</math> is dense in <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>; it comes equipped with a natural Fr\u00e9chet space topology, which is finer than the one induced from <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. \n\nFor every smooth function <math>f</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)</math>,\n<math  display=\"block\" >\\phi(K)=\\int_{\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)} \\operatorname{vol}_i(P_E K) f(E) dE,</math>\nwhere <math>P_E\\colon \\mathbb R^n\\to E</math> denotes the orthogonal projection and <math>dE</math> is the Haar measure, defines a smooth even valuation of degree <math>i</math>. It follows from the Irreducibility Theorem, in combination with the Casselman-Wallach theorem, that any smooth even valuation can be represented in this way. Such a representation is sometimes called a ''Crofton formula''. \n\nFor any smooth [[differential form]] <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb R^n\\times S^{n-1})</math> that is invariant under all the  translations <math>(x,u)\\mapsto (x+t,u)</math> and every number <math>c\\in \\mathbb C</math>,  integration over the ''normal cycle'' defines a smooth valuation:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math  display=\"block\">  \\phi(K)= c\\operatorname{vol}_n(K) + \\int_{N(K)} \\omega, \\qquad K\\in \\mathcal K(\\mathbb R^n). </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nAs a set, the normal cycle <math>N(K)</math> consists of the outward unit normals to <math>K</math>. The Irreducibility Theorem implies that every smooth valuation  is of this form.\n\n==Operations on translation-invariant valuations==\nThere are several natural operations defined on the subspace of  smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\subset \\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. The most important one is the product of two smooth valuations. Together with pullback and pushforward, this operation extends to valuations on manifolds.\n\n===Exterior product===\nLet <math>V,W</math> be finite-dimensional real vector spaces. \nThere exists a bilinear map, called the exterior product, \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\boxtimes \\colon \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(W)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V\\times W) </math>\nwhich is uniquely characterized by the following two properties: \n*it is continuous with respect to the usual topologies on <math>\\operatorname{Val}</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty</math>.\n* if <math>\\phi=\\operatorname{vol}_V(\\bullet + A)</math> and <math>\\psi= \\operatorname{vol}_W(\\bullet + B)</math> where <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(V)</math> and <math>B\\in \\mathcal K(W)</math> are convex bodies with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature, and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_V</math> and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_W</math> are densities on <math>V</math> and <math>W</math>, then \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\phi\\boxtimes \\psi = (\\operatorname{vol}_V\\boxtimes \\operatorname{vol}_W) (\\bullet + A\\times B).</math>\n\n===Product===\nThe product of two smooth valuations <math>\\phi,\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)</math> is defined by \n<math display=\"block\"> (\\phi\\cdot \\psi)(K)= (\\phi\\boxtimes \\psi)(\\Delta(K)),</math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta \\colon V\\to V\\times V</math> is the diagonal embedding. The product is a continuous map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) .</math>\nEquipped with this product, <math> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) </math> becomes a commutative associative graded algebra with the Euler characteristic as the multiplicative identity.\n\n===Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality===\nBy a theorem of Alesker, the restriction of the product \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}_{n-k}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}_n^\\infty(V)=\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math> is a non-degenerate pairing. This motivates the definition of the <math>k</math>-homogeneous ''generalized valuation'', denoted <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>, as <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V)^*\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, topologized with the weak topology. By the Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality, there is a natural dense inclusion <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\hookrightarrow\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>.\n\n===Convolution===\nConvolution is a natural product on <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V^*)</math>. For simplicity, we fix a density <math>\\operatorname{vol}</math> on <math>V</math> to trivialize the second factor. Define for fixed <math>A,B\\in\\mathcal K(V)</math> with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)\\ast\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+B)=\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A+B).</math> There is then a unique extension by continuity to a map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V),</math> called the convolution.\nUnlike the product, convolution respects the co-grading, namely if <math>\\phi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i}(V)</math>, <math>\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-j}(V)</math>, then <math>\\phi\\ast\\psi\\in \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i-j}(V)</math>.\n\nFor instance, let <math>V(K_1,\\ldots, K_n)</math> denote the mixed volume of the convex bodies <math>K_1,\\ldots, K_n\\subset \\mathbb R^n</math>. If convex bodies <math>A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i}</math> in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> with  with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature   are fixed, then \n<math> \\phi(K) = V(K[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})</math>\ndefines a smooth valuation of degree <math>i</math>. The convolution two such valuations is\n<math display=\"block\">V(\\bullet[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})\\ast V(\\bullet[j],B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j})=c_{i,j}V(\\bullet[n-j-i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i},B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j}),</math>\nwhere <math>c_{i,j}</math> is a constant depending only on <math>i,j,n</math>.\n\n===Fourier transform===\nThe Alesker-Fourier transform is a natural, <math>GL(V)</math>-equivariant isomorphism of complex-valued valuations \n<math  display=\"block\">\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V),</math> discovered by Alesker and enjoying many properties resembling the classical Fourier transform, which explains its name.\n\nIt reverses the grading, namely  <math>\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, and maps product to convolution: <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F(\\phi\\cdot \\psi)=\\mathbb F\\phi\\ast\\mathbb F\\psi.</math> \n\nFixing for simplicity a Euclidean structure to identify <math>V=V^*</math>, <math>\\operatorname{Dens}(V)=\\mathbb C</math>, we have the identity <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F^2\\phi(K)=\\phi(-K).</math> On even valuations, there is a simple description of the Fourier transform in terms of the Klain embedding: <math>\\operatorname{Kl}_{\\mathbb F\\phi}(E)=\\operatorname{Kl}_\\phi(E^\\perp)</math>. In particular, even real-valued valuations remain real-valued after the Fourier transform. \n\nFor odd valuations, the description of the Fourier transform is substantially more involved. Unlike the even case, it is no longer of purely geometric nature. For instance, the space of real-valued odd valuations is not preserved.\n\n===Pullback and pushforward===\nGiven a linear map <math>f:U\\to V</math>, there are induced operations of pullback <math>f^*:\\operatorname{Val}(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(U)</math> and pushforward <math>f_*:\\operatorname{Val}(U)\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)^*</math>. The pullback is the simpler of the two, given by <math>f^*\\phi(K)=\\phi(f(K))</math>. It evidently preserves the parity and degree of homogeneity of a valuation.  \nNote that the pullback does not preserve smoothness when <math>f</math> is not injective.\n\nThe pushforward is harder to define formally. For simplicity, fix Lebesgue measures on <math>U</math> and <math>V</math>. The pushforward can be uniquely characterized by describing its action on valuations of the form <math>\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)</math>, for all <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(U)</math>, and then extended by continuity to all valuations using the Irreducibility Theorem. For a surjective map <math>f</math>, \n<math display=\"block\">f_*\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)=\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+f(A)).</math> For an inclusion <math>f:U\\hookrightarrow V</math>, choose a splitting <math>V=U\\oplus W</math>. Then \n<math display=\"block\"> f_*\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet + A) (K)= \\int_{W}\\operatorname{vol}(K\\cap (U+w) + A) dw.</math>\nInformally, the pushforward is dual to the pullback with respect to the Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 pairing: for <math>\\phi\\in \\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> and <math>\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}(U)\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*</math>, \n<math display=\"block\">\\langle f^*\\phi,\\psi\\rangle =\\langle \\phi, f_*\\psi\\rangle.</math>\nHowever, this identity has to be carefully interpreted since the pairing is only well-defined for smooth valuations.

'''181''' (2011), 189\u2013294</ref>.\n\n==Valuations on manifolds==\nIn a series of papers beginning in 2006, Alesker laid down the foundations for a theory of valuations on manifolds that extends the theory of valuations on convex bodies.  The key observation leading to this extension is that  via integration over the normal cycle ({{EquationNote|1}}), a smooth translation-invariant valuation may be evaluated on  sets  much more general than convex ones. Also ({{EquationNote|1}}) suggests to define  smooth valuations in general by dropping the requirement that the form <math>\\omega</math> be translation-invariant and by replacing the translation-invariant Lebesgue measure with an arbitrary smooth measure.\n\nLet X be an n-dimensional smooth manifold and let <math>\\mathbb P_X= \\mathbb P_+(T^* X)</math> be the co-sphere bundle of <math>X</math>, i.e., the oriented projectivization of the cotangent bundle. \nLet  <math>\\mathcal P(X)</math> denote the collection of compact differentiable polyhedra in <math>X</math>.  The normal cycle of <math>A\\in \\mathcal P(X)</math> is <math>N(A)\\subset \\mathbb P_X</math>, which consists of the outward co-normals to <math>A</math> and is naturally a Lipschitz submanifold of dimension <math>n-1</math>. \n\nFor ease of presentation we henceforth assume that <math>X</math> is oriented, even though the concept of smooth valuations in fact does not depend on orientability.  The space of smooth valuations <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> on <math>X</math> consists of functions  <math>\\phi\\colon \\mathcal  P(X)\\to \\mathbb C</math> of the form\n<math display=\"block\"> \\phi(A)= \\int_A\\mu + \\int_{N(A)}\\omega,\\qquad A\\in \\mathcal P(X),</math>\nwhere  <math>\\mu\\in\\Omega^n(X)</math> and <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb P_X)</math>  can be arbitrary. \nIt was shown by Alesker that the smooth valuations on open subsets of <math>X</math> form a soft sheaf over <math>X</math>.\n\n===Examples=== \nThe following are examples of smooth valuations on a smooth manifold <math>X</math>.\n* smooth measures on <math>X</math>.\n* the [[Euler characteristic]]; this follows from the work of [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]]<ref>S.-S. Chern, ''On the curvatura integra in a Riemannian manifold''.\nAnn. of Math. (2) '''46''' (1945), 674\u2013684.</ref> on the [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]], where such <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\omega</math>  were constructed to represent the Euler characteristic. In particular, <math>\\mu</math> is then the [[Chern\u2013Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem|Chern-Gauss-Bonnet integrand]], which is the Pfaffian of the Riemannian curvature tensor.\n* If <math>X</math> is Riemannian, then the Lipschitz-Killing valuations or intrinsic volumes  <math>V_0^X=\\chi, V_1^X, \\ldots, V_n^X=\\mathrm{vol}_X</math>  are smooth valuations. If <math>f\\colon X\\to \\mathbb R^m</math> is any [[Embedding|isometric immersion]] into Euclidean space, then <math> V_i^X= f^* V_i^{\\mathbb R^m},</math>  where <math>V_i^{\\mathbb R^m}</math> denotes the usual intrinsic volumes on <math>\\mathbb R^m</math> (see below for the definition of the pullback).  The existence of these valuations is the essence of Weyl's tube formula<ref>H. Weyl, ''On the Volume of Tubes''. Amer. J. Math. '''61''' (1939), no. 2, 461\u2013472</ref>.\n* Let <math>\\mathbb C P^n</math> be the [[complex projective space]], and let <math>\\mathrm{Gr}_k^\\mathbb C</math> denote the Grassmannian of all complex projective subspaces of fixed dimension <math>k</math>. The function \n<math display=\"block\">\\phi(A) = \\int_{\\mathrm{Gr}_k^\\mathbb C} \\chi(A\\cap E) dE, \\qquad A\\in \\mathcal P (\\mathbb C P^n),</math> where integration is with respect to the Haar probability measure on <math>\\mathrm{Gr}_k^\\mathbb C</math>, is a smooth valuation. This follows from the work of  Fu<ref name=\"Fu:Kinematic\"> J. H. G. Fu, ''Kinematic formulas in integral geometry''. Indiana Univ. Math. J. '''39''' (1990), no. 4, 1115-1154</ref>.\n\n===Filtration===\nThe space <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> admits no natural grading in general, however it carries a canonical filtration \n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)= W_0\\supset W_1\\supset \\cdots \\supset W_n.</math> Here <math>W_n</math> consists of the smooth measures on <math>X</math>, and <math>W_j</math> is given by forms <math>\\omega</math> in the ideal generated by <math>\\pi^*\\Omega^j(X)</math>, where <math>\\pi:\\mathbb P_X\\to X</math>.\n\nThe associated graded space <math>\\bigoplus_{i=0}^n W_i/W_{i+1}</math> is canonically isomorphic to the space of smooth sections <math display=\"block\">\\bigoplus_{i=0}^n C^\\infty (X, \\operatorname{Val}_i^\\infty(TX)),</math> where <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^\\infty(TX)</math> denotes the vector bundle over <math>X</math> such that the fiber over a point <math>x\\in X</math> is <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^\\infty(T_x X)</math>, the space of smooth translation-invariant valuations on the tangent space <math>T_x X</math>.\n\n===Product===\nThe space <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> admits a natural product. This product is continuous, commutative, associative, and compatible with the filtration:\n<math display=\"block\"> W_i\\cdot W_j\\subset W_{i+j},</math>\nand has the Euler characteristic as the identity element. It commutes with the restriction to embedded submanifolds, and the diffeomorphism group of <math>X</math> acts on <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> by algebra automorphisms. \n\nFor example if <math>X</math> is Riemannian, the Lipschitz-Killing valuations satisfy \n<math display=\"block\"> V_i^X\\cdot V_j^X= V_{i+j}^X.</math>\n\nThe Alesker-Poincare duality still holds. For compact <math>X</math> it says that the pairing <math> \\mathcal V^\\infty(X)\\times \\mathcal V^\\infty(X)\\to \\mathbb C</math>, <math>(\\phi, \\psi)\\mapsto (\\phi\\cdot\\psi) (X)</math> is non-degenerate. As in the translation-invariant case, this duality can be used to define generalized valuations. Unlike the translation-invariant case, no good definition of continuous valuations exists for valuations on manifolds.\n\nThe product of valuations closely reflects the geometric operation of intersection of subsets.\nInformally, consider the generalized valuation <math>\\chi_A=\\chi(A\\cap\\bullet)</math>. The product is given by <math>\\chi_A\\cdot\\chi_B=\\chi_{A\\cap B}</math>. Now one can obtain smooth valuations by averaging generalized valuations of the form <math>\\chi_A</math>, more precisely <math>\\phi(X)=\\int_S \\chi_{s(A)}ds</math> is a smooth valuation if  <math>S</math> is a sufficiently large measured family of diffeomorphisms. Then one has \n<math display=\"block\">\\int_S \\chi_{s(A)}ds\\cdot \\int_{S'} \\chi_{s'(B)}ds'=\\int_{S\\times S'} \\chi_{s(A)\\cap s'(B)}dsds',</math>\nsee <ref> J. H. G. Fu, ''Intersection theory and the Alesker product''. Indiana Univ. Math. J. '''65''' (2016), no. 4, 1347\u20131371.\n</ref>\n\n===Pullback and pushforward===\nEvery smooth immersion <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> of smooth manifolds induces a pullback map <math>f^*\\colon \\mathcal V^\\infty(Y) \\to \\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math>. If <math>f</math> is an embedding, then \n<math display=\"block\"> (f^* \\phi)(A) = \\phi(f(A)), \\qquad A\\in\\mathcal P (X).</math>\nThe pullback is a morphism of filtered algebras.\nEvery smooth proper submersion <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> defines  a pushforward map  <math>f^*\\colon \\mathcal V^\\infty(X) \\to \\mathcal V^\\infty(Y)</math> by \n<math display=\"block\"> (f_* \\phi)(A) = \\phi(f^{-1}(A)), \\qquad A\\in\\mathcal P (Y).</math>  The pushforward is compatible with the filtration as well: <math>f_*:W_i(X)\\to W_{i-(\\dim X-\\dim Y)}(Y)</math>.\nFor general smooth maps, one can define pullback and pushforward for generalized valuations under some restrictions.\n\n==Applications in Integral Geometry==\nLet <math>M</math> be a Riemannian manifold and let <math>G</math> be a Lie group is isometries of <math>M</math> acting transitively on the sphere bundle <math>SM</math>. Under these assumptions the space   <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^G</math> of <math>G</math>-invariant smooth valuations  on <math>M</math> is finite-dimensional; let <math>\\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_m</math> be a basis.  Let <math>A,B\\in \\mathcal P(M)</math> be differentiable polyhedra in <math>M</math>. Then integrals of the form <math>\\int_G \\phi_i(A\\cap gB)dg </math> are expressible as linear combinations of <math>\\phi_k(A)\\phi_l(B)</math> with coefficients <math>c_i^{ij}</math> independent of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, {{NumBlk|:|<math display=\"block\"> \\int_G \\phi_i(A\\cap gB)dg =  \\sum_{j,k=1}^m  c_i^{jk}  \\phi_k(A)\\phi_l(B),\\qquad A,B\\in \\mathcal P(M).</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\nFormulas of this type are called ''kinematic formulas''. Their existence in this generality was proved by Fu<ref name=\"Fu:Kinematic/>. For the three simply connected real space forms, i.e., the sphere, Euclidean space and hyperbolic space, they go back to [[Wilhelm Blaschke|Blaschke]], [[Luis Santal\u00f3|Santal\u00f3]], [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]], and  [[Herbert Federer|Federer]]. \n\nDescribing the kinematic formulas explicitly  is typically a  difficult problem. In fact already in the step from real to complex space forms, considerable difficulties arise and these have  only recently been resolved  by Bernig, Fu, and  Solanes<ref>A. Bernig, J. H. G. Fu, G. Solanes, ''Integral geometry of complex space forms''. Geom. Funct. Anal. '''24''' (2014), no. 2, 403\u2013492.</ref>\n<ref>A. Bernig, J. H. G. Fu, ''Hermitian integral geometry''. Ann. of Math. (2) '''173''' (2011), no. 2, 907\u2013945.</ref>\nThe key insight responsible for this progress is that the kinematic formulas contain the same information as the algebra of invariant valuations  <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^G</math>. \nFor a precise statement, let  <math display=\"block\">k_G\\colon \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^G \\to \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^G\\otimes \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^G</math>\nbe the kinematic operator, i.e., the map determined by the kinematic formulas ({{EquationNote|2}}). Let \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{pd} \\colon \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^G \\to \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^{G*}</math>\ndenote the Aleske-Poincar\u00e9 duality, which is a linear isomorphism. Finally let <math>m_G^*</math> be the adjoint of the product map <math display=\"block\">m_G\\colon \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^{G}\\otimes \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^{G}  \\to \\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^{G}  . </math> The fundamental theorem of algebraic integral geometry relating operations on valuations to integral geometry, states that if the Poincar\u00e9 duality is used to identify <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^{G}</math> with <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^{G*}</math>, then <math>k_G=m_G^*</math>,\n\n[[File:Fundamental theorem of algebraic integral geometry.svg|350px]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mixed volume]]\n* [[Hadwiger's theorem]]\n* [[Integral geometry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | author=S.

The story is told through the [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]] of a little fish, who has stolen a hat from a big fish and how the big fish reacts to the theft. It is a thematic follow-up to ''[[I Want My Hat Back]]'' and was meant to be a more literal sequel until Klassen took a suggestion to change which animals were in the story. The book was well received by critics who praised its dark or ironic humor which could only be understood by comparing the words of the little fish's narration against the events of the illustrations. In addition to several positive reviews, Klassen won the 2013 [[Caldecott Medal]] and the 2014 [[Kate Greenaway Medal]] becoming the first book to win both awards. ''This is Not My Hat'' was also a commercial success. \n\n== Background and publication ==\n[[File:Jon Klassen 2013.jpg|alt=<nowiki>picture of Jon Klassen</nowiki>|left|thumb|Klassen in 2013.]]\nFollowing the success of ''[[I Want My Hat Back]]'', Klassen attempted unsuccessfully to tell more stories with the same characters, until the art director at his publisher, [[Candlewick Press]], suggested he try new characters instead.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://100scopenotes.com/2012/10/09/psycoanalyzing-jon-klassen/|title=Psychoanalyzing Jon Klassen \u2014 @100scopenotes 100 Scope Notes|last=Jonker|first=Travis|date=2012-10-09|website=100scopenotes.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref> Klassen then switched from mammals to fish.<ref name=\":7\" /> Klassen also felt that this story was more \"dramatic\" than his earlier work and cited the \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" as a thematic inspiration.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-xpm-2012-oct-07-la-jc-kids-book-author-jon-klassen-talks-about-this-is-not-my-hat-20121005-story.html|title=Kids' book author Jon Klassen discusses 'This is Not My Hat'|date=2012-10-07|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-03-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/jun/23/jon-klassen-this-is-not-my-hat-kate-greenaway-in-pictures|title=Jon Klassen: Kate Greenaway medal winner 2014 \u2013 in pictures|last=Drabble|first=Emily|date=2014-06-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-03-22|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> For this book he sketched the illustrations in ink before digitizing them and finishing the colors and details electronically.<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\nThe book was published on October 9, 2012, and was translated into more than 22 languages.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jon-klassen/not-my-hat/|title=This Is Not My Hat|date=29 August 2015|magazine=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|publisher=Kirkus Media LLC|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/61796-klassen-s-hat-books-hit-one-million-mark.html|title=Klassen's 'Hat' Books Hit One-Million Mark|last=Lodge|first=Sally|date=2014-08-10|magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]]|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref> Klassen toured 15 cities in the United States to promote the book.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 2014 an audiobook read by John Keating and accompanied by string instruments to represent the actions of the fish, in a way similar to the orchestration of [[Peter and the Wolf]], was released.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=L.|year=2014|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A373034874/GPS?u=wikipedia&sid=GPS&xid=8b5c429f|title= Klassen, Jon.

Except the big fish does wake up and does notice. The little fish goes to hide in some plants, and is observed by a crab who tells the big fish, who follows the little fish.

The story is told through the [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]] of a little fish, who has stolen a hat from a big fish and how the big fish reacts to the theft. It is a thematic follow-up to ''[[I Want My Hat Back]]'' and was meant to be a more literal sequel until Klassen took a suggestion to change which animals were in the story. The book was well received by critics who praised its dark or ironic humor which could only be understood by comparing the words of the little fish's narration against the events of the illustrations. In addition to several positive reviews, Klassen won the 2013 [[Caldecott Medal]] and the 2014 [[Kate Greenaway Medal]] becoming the first book to win both awards. ''This is Not My Hat'' was also a commercial success. \n\n== Background and publication ==\n[[File:Jon Klassen 2013.jpg|alt=<nowiki>picture of Jon Klassen</nowiki>|left|thumb|Klassen in 2013.]]\nFollowing the success of ''[[I Want My Hat Back]]'', Klassen attempted unsuccessfully to tell more stories with the same characters, until the art director at his publisher, [[Candlewick Press]], suggested he try new characters instead.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://100scopenotes.com/2012/10/09/psycoanalyzing-jon-klassen/|title=Psychoanalyzing Jon Klassen \u2014 @100scopenotes 100 Scope Notes|last=Jonker|first=Travis|date=2012-10-09|website=100scopenotes.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref> Klassen then switched from mammals to fish.<ref name=\":7\" /> Klassen also felt that this story was more \"dramatic\" than his earlier work and cited the \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" as a thematic inspiration.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-xpm-2012-oct-07-la-jc-kids-book-author-jon-klassen-talks-about-this-is-not-my-hat-20121005-story.html|title=Kids' book author Jon Klassen discusses 'This is Not My Hat'|date=2012-10-07|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-03-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/jun/23/jon-klassen-this-is-not-my-hat-kate-greenaway-in-pictures|title=Jon Klassen: Kate Greenaway medal winner 2014 \u2013 in pictures|last=Drabble|first=Emily|date=2014-06-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-03-22|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> For this book he sketched the illustrations in ink before digitizing them and finishing the colors and details electronically.<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\nThe book was published on October 9, 2012, and was translated into more than 22 languages.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jon-klassen/not-my-hat/|title=This Is Not My Hat|date=29 August 2015|magazine=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|publisher=Kirkus Media LLC|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/61796-klassen-s-hat-books-hit-one-million-mark.html|title=Klassen's 'Hat' Books Hit One-Million Mark|last=Lodge|first=Sally|date=2014-08-10|magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]]|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref> Klassen toured 15 cities in the United States to promote the book.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 2014 an audiobook read by John Keating and accompanied by string instruments to represent the actions of the fish, in a way similar to the orchestration of [[Peter and the Wolf]], was released.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=L.|year=2014|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A373034874/GPS?u=wikipedia&sid=GPS&xid=8b5c429f|title= Klassen, Jon.

Except the big fish does wake up and does notice. The little fish goes to hide in some plants, and is observed by a crab who tells the big fish, who follows the little fish. The little fish remains convinced that the theft will not be found out, but at the end of the story the big fish is wearing the hat.\n\n== Writing and illustrations ==\nAs Roger Sutton noted in his review of the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'', the book can only be understood by weighing the words against the actions depicted in the illustrations,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/books/review/little-tug-and-this-is-not-my-hat.html|title=\u2018Little Tug\u2019 and \u2018This Is Not My Hat\u2019|last=Sutton|first=Roger|date=2012-11-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> since what happens at the end is not explicitly stated but instead left to the reader to figure out.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbook.com/2012/09/blogs/calling-caldecott/this-is-not-my-hat/|title=This Is Not My Hat \u2014 The Horn Book|last=Robinson|first=Lolly|date=2012-09-07|website=www.hbook.com|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> The small fish, acting as the book's narrator through its monologue, is not only amoral but also \"outrageous\" in the claims that it will not get caught.<ref name=\":2\" /> The small fish can be seen as either talking to the reader or themselves.<ref>Goodwin, P.
