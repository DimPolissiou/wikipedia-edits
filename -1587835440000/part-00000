Both Japanese and North American systems have the same [[NTSC]] lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the [[N64 Passport]] or the [[Action Replay|Datel Action Replay]] can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.<ref>{{cite news|title=How to...

The last game to be published for the system was the North American-locked ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3]]'' on August 20, 2002.

This stems largely from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s proximity to the [[Sun]] which makes reaching it with spacecraft technically challenging and Earth-based observations difficult.\n\nMercury's surface is dominated by [[impact craters]], basaltic rock and smooth plains, many of them a result of [[Flood basalt|flood volcanism]], similar in some respects to the [[lunar maria]],<ref name=nasa_mercury/><ref name=discoverynews_20111005/> and locally by pyroclastic deposits.<ref name=\"becca\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Rebecca J.|last2=Rothery|first2=David A.|last3=Conway|first3=Susan J.|last4=Anand|first4=Mahesh|title=Long-lived explosive volcanism on Mercury|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=16 September 2014|volume=41|issue=17|pages=6084\u20136092|doi=10.1002/2014GL061224|bibcode = 2014GeoRL..41.6084T |doi-access=free}}</ref> Other notable features include [[Volcanic cone|vents]] which appear to be the source of magma-carved valleys, often-grouped irregular-shaped depressions termed \"hollows\" that are believed to be the result of collapsed magma chambers,<ref name=jhuapl_20110929/> [[Fault scarp|scarps]] indicative of thrust faulting and mineral deposits (possibly ice) inside craters at the poles. Long thought to be geologically inactive, new evidence suggests there may still be some level of activity.<ref name=messenger_GRS_evolution/><ref name=jhuapl349/>\n\nMercury's density implies a solid iron-rich core that accounts for about 60% of its volume (75% of its radius).<ref name=messenger_key2evolution/> Mercury's magnetic equator is shifted nearly 20% of the planet's radius towards the north, the largest ratio of all planets.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/> This shift suggests there being one or more iron-rich molten layers surrounding the core producing a dynamo effect similar to that of Earth. Additionally, the offset magnetic [[dipole]] may result in uneven surface weathering by the [[solar wind]], knocking more surface particles up into the southern [[Atmosphere of Mercury|exosphere]] and transporting them for deposit in the north. Scientists are gathering [[telemetry]] to determine if such is the case.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/>\n\nAfter having completed the first [[Solar time|solar day]] of its mission in September 2011, more than 99% of Mercury's surface had been mapped by [[NASA]]'s ''[[MESSENGER]]'' probe in both color and monochrome with such detail that scientists' understanding of Mercury's geology has significantly surpassed the level achieved following the ''[[Mariner 10]]'' flybys of the 1970s.<ref name=jhuapl_20110929 />\n\n.....\n\n==Difficulties in exploration==\n[[File:Mariner 10.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|''Mariner 10'' probe]]\nReaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound [[spacecraft]] launched from Earth must travel 91 million kilometers into the Sun's [[gravity|gravitational]] [[potential well]]. Starting from the Earth's [[orbital speed]] of 30&nbsp;km/s, the change in [[velocity]] ([[delta-v]]) the spacecraft must make to enter into a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions. The [[potential energy]] liberated by moving down the Sun's potential well becomes [[kinetic energy]]; requiring another large delta-''v'' to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors because Mercury has negligible atmosphere. A direct trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to [[escape velocity|escape]] the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes, ''[[Mariner 10]]'' and ''[[MESSENGER]]'', both by [[NASA]], have visited Mercury so far.\n[[File:Mercury's internal structure1.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|{{bulleted list|Crust \u2013 100\u2013200&nbsp;km thick|Mantle \u2013 600&nbsp;km thick|Core \u2013 1,800&nbsp;km radius}}]]\nFurthermore, the space environment near Mercury is demanding, posing the double dangers to spacecraft of intense [[solar radiation]] and high temperatures.\n\nHistorically, a second obstacle has been that Mercury's [[Rotation period|period of rotation]] is a slow 58 [[Earth]] days, so that spacecraft flybys are restricted to viewing only a single illuminated hemisphere. In fact, unfortunately, even though [[Mariner 10]] space probe flew past Mercury three times during 1974 and 1975, it observed the same area during each pass. This was because Mariner 10's orbital period was almost exactly 3 sidereal Mercury days, and the same face of the planet was lit at each of the close approaches. As a result, less than 45% of the planet's surface was mapped.\n\nEarth-based observations are made difficult by Mercury's constant proximity to the Sun. This has several consequences:\n#Whenever the sky is dark enough for viewing through telescopes, Mercury is always already near the horizon, where viewing conditions are poor anyway due to atmospheric factors.\n#The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and other space observatories are usually prevented from pointing close to the Sun for safety reasons (Erroneously pointing such sensitive instruments at the Sun is likely to cause permanent damage).\n\n==Mercury's geological history==\n[[File:Gravity Anomalies on Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mercury \u2013 Gravity Anomalies \u2013 mass concentrations (red) suggest subsurface structure and evolution.]]\nLike the Earth, Moon and [[Mars]], Mercury's geologic history is divided up into [[Era (geology)|eras]].  From oldest to youngest, these are: the [[pre-Tolstojan]], [[Tolstojan]], [[Calorian]], [[Mansurian (geology)|Mansurian]], and [[Kuiperian]].  These ages are based on [[relative dating]] only.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAfter the formation of Mercury along with the rest of the [[Solar System]] 4.6 billion years ago, heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets ensued. The last intense bombardment phase, the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] came to an end about 3.8 billion years ago. Some regions or [[massif]]s, a prominent one being the one that formed the [[Caloris Basin]], were filled by magma eruptions from within the planet. These created smooth intercrater plains similar to the [[Lunar mare|maria]] found on the [[Moon]].\nLater, as the planet cooled and contracted, its surface began to crack and form ridges; these surface cracks and ridges can be seen on top of other features, such as the craters and smoother plains\u2014a clear indication that they are more recent.\nMercury's period of [[volcanism]] ended when the planet's mantle had contracted enough to prevent further [[lava]] from breaking through to the surface. This probably occurred at some point during its first 700 or 800 million years of history.\n\nSince then, the main surface processes have been intermittent impacts.\n\n===Timeline===\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:780 height:100\nPlotArea   = left:10 right:10 bottom:20 top:0\nAlignBars  = early\n\nPeriod      = from:-4500 till:0\nTimeAxis    = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor  = unit:year increment:500 start:-4500\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:100 start:-4500\n\nLineData=\n at:-3875 frompos:46 tillpos:55 width:0.5 color:black\n at:-3825 frompos:13 tillpos:20 width:0.5 color:black\nPlotData=\n align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(0,-5)\n\n text:Mansurian/Kuiperian from:-3000 till:0 color:limegreen \n text:Late_Calorian from:-3800 till:-3000 color:yellowgreen\n text:Calorian from:-3850 till:-3800 shift:(5,-30) color:teal\n text:Tolstojan from:-3900 till:-3850 shift:(0,25) color:brightgreen\n text:pre-Tolstojan from:start till:-3900 color:green\n</timeline>\nTime unit: millions of years\n\n==Surface features==\nMercury's surface is overall similar in appearance to that of the Moon, with extensive [[Lunar mare|mare]]-like plains and heavily cratered [[terrain]]s similar to the [[Geology of the Moon|lunar highlands]] and made locally by accumulations of pyroclastic deposits.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:600px;\"\n!

They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed-craters, to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from Lunar craters \u2013 the extent of their ejecta blankets is much smaller, which is a consequence of the 2.5 times stronger surface gravity on Mercury.<ref name=Spudis01 />\n[[File:Unmasking the Secrets of Mercury.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[MESSENGER#Scientific instruments|MASCS]] spectrum scan of Mercury's surface by ''[[MESSENGER]]'']]\n[[File:Mercury's 'Weird Terrain'.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The so-called \"Weird Terrain\" formed by the [[Caloris Basin]] impact at its antipodal point]]\nThe largest known crater is the enormous Caloris Basin, with a diameter of 1550&nbsp;km,<ref name=\"newscientist30012008\" /> A basin of comparable size, tentatively named [[Skinakas Basin]] had been postulated from low resolution Earth-based observations of the non-Mariner-imaged hemisphere, but has not been observed in ''MESSENGER'' imagery of the corresponding terrain. The impact which created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that its effects are seen on a global scale. It caused [[lava]] eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2&nbsp;km tall surrounding the [[impact crater]]. At the [[Antipodes|antipode]] of the Caloris Basin lies a large region of unusual, hilly and furrowed terrain, sometimes called \"Weird Terrain\". The favoured hypothesis for the origin of this geomorphologic unit is that shock waves generated during the impact traveled around the planet, and when they converged at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away) the high stresses were capable of fracturing the surface.<ref name=schultz_gault /> A much less favoured idea was that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode. Furthermore, the formation of the Caloris Basin appears to have produced a shallow depression concentric around the basin, which was later filled by the smooth plains (see below).\n\nOverall about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. Other notable basins include the 400&nbsp;km wide, multi-ring, [[Tolstoj Basin]] which has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500&nbsp;km from its rim, and its floor has been filled by smooth plains materials. [[Beethoven Basin]] also has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625&nbsp;km diameter rim.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAs on the [[Moon]], fresh craters on Mercury show prominent bright [[ray system]]s. These are made by ejected debris, which tend to be brighter while they remain relatively fresh because of a lesser amount of [[space weathering]] than the surrounding older terrain.\n\n====Pit-floor craters====\nSome impact craters on Mercury have non-circular, irregularly shaped depressions or pits on their floors. Such craters have been termed pit-floor craters, and ''[[MESSENGER]]'' team members have suggested that such pits formed by the collapse of subsurface [[magma chamber]]s. If this suggestion is correct, the pits are evidence of [[volcanic]] processes at work on Mercury.<ref name=jhuapl349 /> Pit craters are rimless, often irregularly shaped, and steep-sided, and they display no associated [[ejecta]] or [[lava flow]]s but are typically distinctive in color. For example, the pits of [[Praxiteles (crater)|Praxiteles]] have an orange hue.<ref name=jhuapl308/> Thought to be evidence of shallow magmatic activity, pit craters may have formed when subsurface magma drained elsewhere and left a roof area unsupported, leading to collapse and the formation of the pit.  Major craters exhibiting these features include [[Beckett (crater)|Beckett]], [[Gibran (crater)|Gibran]] and [[Lermontov (crater)|Lermontov]], among others.<ref name=jhuapl335/> It was suggested that these pits with associated brighter and redder deposits may be pyroclastic deposits caused by explosive volcanism.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n[[File:PIA19423-Mercury-AbedinCrater-20150416.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<center>Interior of Abedin crater</center>]]\n\n===Plains===\nThere are two geologically distinct plains units on Mercury:<ref name=Spudis01/><ref name=WagWolIva01 />\n* ''[[Intercrater plains on Mercury|Inter-crater plains]]'' are the oldest visible surface,<ref name=Spudis01/> predating the heavily cratered terrain. They are gently rolling or hilly and occur in the regions between larger craters. The inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> It is not clear whether they are of volcanic or impact origin.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> The inter-crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over the entire surface of the planet.\n* ''Smooth plains'' are widespread flat areas resembling the lunar maria, which fill depressions of various sizes. Notably, they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. An appreciable difference to the lunar maria is that the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older intercrater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic features, their localisation and lobate-shaped colour units strongly support a volcanic origin. All the Mercurian smooth plains formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.<ref name=Spudis01/>\nThe floor of the [[Caloris Basin]] is also filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of [[impact melt]].<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\n===Tectonic features===\n[[File:Discovery Rupes.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Discovery Rupes]].]]\nOne unusual feature of the planet's surface is the numerous compression folds which crisscross the plains. It is thought that as the planet's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that they are more recent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dzurisin |first1=D. |title=The tectonic and volcanic history of mercury as inferred from studies of scarps, ridges, troughs, and other lineaments |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |date=1978 |volume=83 |issue=B10 |pages=4883\u20134906 |doi=10.1029/JB083iB10p04883}}</ref> Mercury's surface is also flexed by significant [[tidal bulge]]s raised by the [[Sun]]\u2014the Sun's tides on Mercury are about 17% stronger than the Moon's on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Hoolst |first1=T. |title=Mercury's tides and interior structure |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |date=2003 |volume=108 |issue=E11 |doi=10.1029/2003JE002126|last2=Jacobs|first2=C.|page=5121}}</ref>\n\n===Terminology===\nNon-crater surface features are given the following names:\n* [[Albedo]] features \u2013 areas of markedly different reflectivity\n* [[Dorsum (astrogeology)|Dorsa]] \u2014 [[ridge]]s (''see [[List of ridges on Mercury]]'')\n* Montes \u2014 [[mountain]]s (''see [[List of geological features on Mercury#Mountains|List of mountains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Planitia]]e \u2014 [[plain]]s (''see [[List of plains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Rupes]] \u2014 [[escarpment|scarps]] (''see [[List of scarps on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Vallis (planetary geology)|Valles]] \u2014 [[valley]]s (''see [[List of valleys on Mercury]]'')\n{{Clear}}\n\n==High-albedo polar patches and possible presence of ice==\nThe first radar observations of Mercury were carried out by the [[radiotelescope]]s at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] ([[Puerto Rico]]) and [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] ([[California]], United States), with assistance from the U.S. [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) facility in [[New Mexico]]. The transmissions sent from the NASA [[Deep Space Network]] site at Goldstone were at a power level of 460&nbsp;kW at 8.51&nbsp;GHz; the signals received by the VLA multi-dish array detected points of radar reflectivity (radar luminosity) with depolarized waves from Mercury's north pole.\n\n[[File:Merc fig2sm.jpg|thumb|Radar image of Mercury's north pole.]]\nRadar maps of the surface of the planet were made using the Arecibo radiotelescope. The survey was conducted with 420&nbsp;kW [[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]] (2.4&nbsp;GHz) radio waves which allowed for a 15&nbsp;km resolution. This study not only confirmed the existence of the zones of high reflectivity and depolarization, but also found a number of new areas (bringing the total to 20) and was even able to survey the poles. It has been postulated that surface [[ice]] may be responsible for these high luminosity levels, as the silicate rocks that compose most of the surface of Mercury have exactly the opposite effect on luminosity.\n\nIn spite of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury may have surface ice, since temperatures near the poles are constantly below freezing point: On the polar plains, the temperature does not rise above \u2212106&nbsp;\u00b0C. And [[Impact crater|crater]]s at Mercury's higher latitudes (discovered by radar surveys from Earth as well) may be deep enough to shield the ice from direct sunlight. Inside the craters, where there is no solar light, temperatures fall to \u2212171&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=nssdc_ice/>\n\nDespite [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] into the vacuum of space, the temperature in the permanently shadowed region is so low that this sublimation is slow enough to potentially preserve deposited ice for billions of years.\n\nAt the South Pole, the location of a large zone of high reflectivity coincides with the location of the [[Chao Meng-Fu (crater)|Chao Meng-Fu crater]], and other small craters containing reflective areas have also been identified. At the North Pole, a number of craters smaller than Chao-Meng Fu have these reflective properties.\n\nThe strength of the radar reflections seen on Mercury are small compared to that which would occur with pure ice. This may be due to powder deposition that does not cover the surface of the crater completely or other causes, e.g. a thin overlying surface layer. However, the evidence for ice on Mercury is not definitive. The anomalous reflective properties could also be due to the existence of deposits of [[metal]]lic [[sulfates]] or other materials with high reflectance.\n\n===Possible origin of ice===\nMercury is not unique in having craters that stand in permanent shadow; at the south pole of Earth's [[Moon]] there is a large crater ([[Aitken (crater)|Aitken]]) where some [[lunar ice|possible signs of the presence of ice]] have been seen (although their interpretation is disputed). It is thought by astronomers that ice on both Mercury and the Moon must have originated from external sources, mostly impacting [[comet]]s. These are known to contain large amounts, or a majority, of ice. It is therefore conceivable for meteorite impacts to have deposited water in the permanently shadow craters, where it would remain unwarmed for possibly billions of years due to the lack of an atmosphere to efficiently conduct heat and stable orientation of Mercury's [[axial tilt|rotation axis]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:500px;\"\n!

Long thought to be geologically inactive, new evidence suggests there may still be some level of activity.<ref name=messenger_GRS_evolution/><ref name=jhuapl349/>\n\nMercury's density implies a solid iron-rich core that accounts for about 60% of its volume (75% of its radius).<ref name=messenger_key2evolution/> Mercury's magnetic equator is shifted nearly 20% of the planet's radius towards the north, the largest ratio of all planets.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/> This shift suggests there being one or more iron-rich molten layers surrounding the core producing a dynamo effect similar to that of Earth. Additionally, the offset magnetic [[dipole]] may result in uneven surface weathering by the [[solar wind]], knocking more surface particles up into the southern [[Atmosphere of Mercury|exosphere]] and transporting them for deposit in the north. Scientists are gathering [[telemetry]] to determine if such is the case.<ref name=messenger_offsetfield/>\n\nAfter having completed the first [[Solar time|solar day]] of its mission in September 2011, more than 99% of Mercury's surface had been mapped by [[NASA]]'s ''[[MESSENGER]]'' probe in both color and monochrome with such detail that scientists' understanding of Mercury's geology has significantly surpassed the level achieved following the ''[[Mariner 10]]'' flybys of the 1970s.<ref name=jhuapl_20110929 />\n\n==Difficulties in exploration==\n[[File:Mariner 10.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|''Mariner 10'' probe]]\nReaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because the planet orbits so much closer to the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound [[spacecraft]] launched from Earth must travel 91 million kilometers into the Sun's [[gravity|gravitational]] [[potential well]]. Starting from the Earth's [[orbital speed]] of 30&nbsp;km/s, the change in [[velocity]] ([[delta-v]]) the spacecraft must make to enter into a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions. The [[potential energy]] liberated by moving down the Sun's potential well becomes [[kinetic energy]]; requiring another large delta-''v'' to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors because Mercury has negligible atmosphere. A direct trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to [[escape velocity|escape]] the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes, ''[[Mariner 10]]'' and ''[[MESSENGER]]'', both by [[NASA]], have visited Mercury so far.\n[[File:Mercury's internal structure1.jpg|alt=|thumb|200x200px|{{bulleted list|Crust \u2013 100\u2013200&nbsp;km thick|Mantle \u2013 600&nbsp;km thick|Core \u2013 1,800&nbsp;km radius}}]]\nFurthermore, the space environment near Mercury is demanding, posing the double dangers to spacecraft of intense [[solar radiation]] and high temperatures.\n\nHistorically, a second obstacle has been that Mercury's [[Rotation period|period of rotation]] is a slow 58 [[Earth]] days, so that spacecraft flybys are restricted to viewing only a single illuminated hemisphere. In fact, unfortunately, even though [[Mariner 10]] space probe flew past Mercury three times during 1974 and 1975, it observed the same area during each pass. This was because Mariner 10's orbital period was almost exactly 3 sidereal Mercury days, and the same face of the planet was lit at each of the close approaches. As a result, less than 45% of the planet's surface was mapped.\n\nEarth-based observations are made difficult by Mercury's constant proximity to the Sun. This has several consequences:\n#Whenever the sky is dark enough for viewing through telescopes, Mercury is always already near the horizon, where viewing conditions are poor anyway due to atmospheric factors.\n#The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and other space observatories are usually prevented from pointing close to the Sun for safety reasons (Erroneously pointing such sensitive instruments at the Sun is likely to cause permanent damage).\n\n==Mercury's geological history==\n[[File:Gravity Anomalies on Mercury.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mercury \u2013 Gravity Anomalies \u2013 mass concentrations (red) suggest subsurface structure and evolution.]]\nLike the Earth, Moon and [[Mars]], Mercury's geologic history is divided up into [[Era (geology)|eras]].  From oldest to youngest, these are: the [[pre-Tolstojan]], [[Tolstojan]], [[Calorian]], [[Mansurian (geology)|Mansurian]], and [[Kuiperian]].  These ages are based on [[relative dating]] only.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAfter the formation of Mercury along with the rest of the [[Solar System]] 4.6 billion years ago, heavy bombardment by asteroids and comets ensued. The last intense bombardment phase, the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] came to an end about 3.8 billion years ago. Some regions or [[massif]]s, a prominent one being the one that formed the [[Caloris Basin]], were filled by magma eruptions from within the planet. These created smooth intercrater plains similar to the [[Lunar mare|maria]] found on the [[Moon]].\nLater, as the planet cooled and contracted, its surface began to crack and form ridges; these surface cracks and ridges can be seen on top of other features, such as the craters and smoother plains\u2014a clear indication that they are more recent.\nMercury's period of [[volcanism]] ended when the planet's mantle had contracted enough to prevent further [[lava]] from breaking through to the surface. This probably occurred at some point during its first 700 or 800 million years of history.\n\nSince then, the main surface processes have been intermittent impacts.\n\n===Timeline===\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:780 height:100\nPlotArea   = left:10 right:10 bottom:20 top:0\nAlignBars  = early\n\nPeriod      = from:-4500 till:0\nTimeAxis    = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor  = unit:year increment:500 start:-4500\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:100 start:-4500\n\nLineData=\n at:-3875 frompos:46 tillpos:55 width:0.5 color:black\n at:-3825 frompos:13 tillpos:20 width:0.5 color:black\nPlotData=\n align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:25 shift:(0,-5)\n\n text:Mansurian/Kuiperian from:-3000 till:0 color:limegreen \n text:Late_Calorian from:-3800 till:-3000 color:yellowgreen\n text:Calorian from:-3850 till:-3800 shift:(5,-30) color:teal\n text:Tolstojan from:-3900 till:-3850 shift:(0,25) color:brightgreen\n text:pre-Tolstojan from:start till:-3900 color:green\n</timeline>\nTime unit: millions of years\n\n==Surface features==\nMercury's surface is overall similar in appearance to that of the Moon, with extensive [[Lunar mare|mare]]-like plains and heavily cratered [[terrain]]s similar to the [[Geology of the Moon|lunar highlands]] and made locally by accumulations of pyroclastic deposits.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:600px;\"\n!

They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed-craters, to highly degraded crater remnants.

The impact which created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that its effects are seen on a global scale. It caused [[lava]] eruptions and left a concentric ring over 2&nbsp;km tall surrounding the [[impact crater]]. At the [[Antipodes|antipode]] of the Caloris Basin lies a large region of unusual, hilly and furrowed terrain, sometimes called \"Weird Terrain\". The favoured hypothesis for the origin of this geomorphologic unit is that shock waves generated during the impact traveled around the planet, and when they converged at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away) the high stresses were capable of fracturing the surface.<ref name=schultz_gault /> A much less favoured idea was that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode. Furthermore, the formation of the Caloris Basin appears to have produced a shallow depression concentric around the basin, which was later filled by the smooth plains (see below).\n\nOverall about 15 impact basins have been identified on the imaged part of Mercury. Other notable basins include the 400&nbsp;km wide, multi-ring, [[Tolstoj Basin]] which has an ejecta blanket extending up to 500&nbsp;km from its rim, and its floor has been filled by smooth plains materials. [[Beethoven Basin]] also has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625&nbsp;km diameter rim.<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\nAs on the [[Moon]], fresh craters on Mercury show prominent bright [[ray system]]s. These are made by ejected debris, which tend to be brighter while they remain relatively fresh because of a lesser amount of [[space weathering]] than the surrounding older terrain.\n\n====Pit-floor craters====\nSome impact craters on Mercury have non-circular, irregularly shaped depressions or pits on their floors. Such craters have been termed pit-floor craters, and ''[[MESSENGER]]'' team members have suggested that such pits formed by the collapse of subsurface [[magma chamber]]s. If this suggestion is correct, the pits are evidence of [[volcanic]] processes at work on Mercury.<ref name=jhuapl349 /> Pit craters are rimless, often irregularly shaped, and steep-sided, and they display no associated [[ejecta]] or [[lava flow]]s but are typically distinctive in color. For example, the pits of [[Praxiteles (crater)|Praxiteles]] have an orange hue.<ref name=jhuapl308/> Thought to be evidence of shallow magmatic activity, pit craters may have formed when subsurface magma drained elsewhere and left a roof area unsupported, leading to collapse and the formation of the pit.  Major craters exhibiting these features include [[Beckett (crater)|Beckett]], [[Gibran (crater)|Gibran]] and [[Lermontov (crater)|Lermontov]], among others.<ref name=jhuapl335/> It was suggested that these pits with associated brighter and redder deposits may be pyroclastic deposits caused by explosive volcanism.<ref name=\"becca\"/>\n[[File:PIA19423-Mercury-AbedinCrater-20150416.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<center>Interior of Abedin crater</center>]]\n\n===Plains===\nThere are two geologically distinct plains units on Mercury:<ref name=Spudis01/><ref name=WagWolIva01 />\n* ''[[Intercrater plains on Mercury|Inter-crater plains]]'' are the oldest visible surface,<ref name=Spudis01/> predating the heavily cratered terrain. They are gently rolling or hilly and occur in the regions between larger craters. The inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> It is not clear whether they are of volcanic or impact origin.<ref name=WagWolIva01/> The inter-crater plains are distributed roughly uniformly over the entire surface of the planet.\n* ''Smooth plains'' are widespread flat areas resembling the lunar maria, which fill depressions of various sizes. Notably, they fill a wide ring surrounding the Caloris Basin. An appreciable difference to the lunar maria is that the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older intercrater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic features, their localisation and lobate-shaped colour units strongly support a volcanic origin. All the Mercurian smooth plains formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.<ref name=Spudis01/>\nThe floor of the [[Caloris Basin]] is also filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they are volcanic lavas induced by the impact, or a large sheet of [[impact melt]].<ref name=Spudis01/>\n\n===Tectonic features===\n[[File:Discovery Rupes.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Discovery Rupes]].]]\nOne unusual feature of the planet's surface is the numerous compression folds which crisscross the plains. It is thought that as the planet's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform. The folds can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smoother plains, indicating that they are more recent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dzurisin |first1=D. |title=The tectonic and volcanic history of mercury as inferred from studies of scarps, ridges, troughs, and other lineaments |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |date=1978 |volume=83 |issue=B10 |pages=4883\u20134906 |doi=10.1029/JB083iB10p04883}}</ref> Mercury's surface is also flexed by significant [[tidal bulge]]s raised by the [[Sun]]\u2014the Sun's tides on Mercury are about 17% stronger than the Moon's on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Hoolst |first1=T. |title=Mercury's tides and interior structure |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |date=2003 |volume=108 |issue=E11 |doi=10.1029/2003JE002126|last2=Jacobs|first2=C.|page=5121}}</ref>\n\n===Terminology===\nNon-crater surface features are given the following names:\n* [[Albedo]] features \u2013 areas of markedly different reflectivity\n* [[Dorsum (astrogeology)|Dorsa]] \u2014 [[ridge]]s (''see [[List of ridges on Mercury]]'')\n* Montes \u2014 [[mountain]]s (''see [[List of geological features on Mercury#Mountains|List of mountains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Planitia]]e \u2014 [[plain]]s (''see [[List of plains on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Rupes]] \u2014 [[escarpment|scarps]] (''see [[List of scarps on Mercury]]'')\n* [[Vallis (planetary geology)|Valles]] \u2014 [[valley]]s (''see [[List of valleys on Mercury]]'')\n{{Clear}}\n\n==High-albedo polar patches and possible presence of ice==\nThe first radar observations of Mercury were carried out by the [[radiotelescope]]s at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] ([[Puerto Rico]]) and [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] ([[California]], United States), with assistance from the U.S. [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) facility in [[New Mexico]]. The transmissions sent from the NASA [[Deep Space Network]] site at Goldstone were at a power level of 460&nbsp;kW at 8.51&nbsp;GHz; the signals received by the VLA multi-dish array detected points of radar reflectivity (radar luminosity) with depolarized waves from Mercury's north pole.\n\n[[File:Merc fig2sm.jpg|thumb|Radar image of Mercury's north pole.]]\nRadar maps of the surface of the planet were made using the Arecibo radiotelescope. The survey was conducted with 420&nbsp;kW [[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]] (2.4&nbsp;GHz) radio waves which allowed for a 15&nbsp;km resolution. This study not only confirmed the existence of the zones of high reflectivity and depolarization, but also found a number of new areas (bringing the total to 20) and was even able to survey the poles. It has been postulated that surface [[ice]] may be responsible for these high luminosity levels, as the silicate rocks that compose most of the surface of Mercury have exactly the opposite effect on luminosity.\n\nIn spite of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury may have surface ice, since temperatures near the poles are constantly below freezing point: On the polar plains, the temperature does not rise above \u2212106&nbsp;\u00b0C. And [[Impact crater|crater]]s at Mercury's higher latitudes (discovered by radar surveys from Earth as well) may be deep enough to shield the ice from direct sunlight. Inside the craters, where there is no solar light, temperatures fall to \u2212171&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=nssdc_ice/>\n\nDespite [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] into the vacuum of space, the temperature in the permanently shadowed region is so low that this sublimation is slow enough to potentially preserve deposited ice for billions of years.\n\nAt the South Pole, the location of a large zone of high reflectivity coincides with the location of the [[Chao Meng-Fu (crater)|Chao Meng-Fu crater]], and other small craters containing reflective areas have also been identified. At the North Pole, a number of craters smaller than Chao-Meng Fu have these reflective properties.\n\nThe strength of the radar reflections seen on Mercury are small compared to that which would occur with pure ice. This may be due to powder deposition that does not cover the surface of the crater completely or other causes, e.g. a thin overlying surface layer. However, the evidence for ice on Mercury is not definitive. The anomalous reflective properties could also be due to the existence of deposits of [[metal]]lic [[sulfates]] or other materials with high reflectance.\n\n===Possible origin of ice===\nMercury is not unique in having craters that stand in permanent shadow; at the south pole of Earth's [[Moon]] there is a large crater ([[Aitken (crater)|Aitken]]) where some [[lunar ice|possible signs of the presence of ice]] have been seen (although their interpretation is disputed). It is thought by astronomers that ice on both Mercury and the Moon must have originated from external sources, mostly impacting [[comet]]s. These are known to contain large amounts, or a majority, of ice. It is therefore conceivable for meteorite impacts to have deposited water in the permanently shadow craters, where it would remain unwarmed for possibly billions of years due to the lack of an atmosphere to efficiently conduct heat and stable orientation of Mercury's [[axial tilt|rotation axis]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; width:500px;\"\n!

Founded in 1987 by [[Peter Molyneux]] and [[Les Edgar]], the company gained recognition in 1989 for their third release, ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', and is also well known for titles such as ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'', ''[[Magic Carpet (video game)|Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[Syndicate (video game)|Syndicate]]'' and ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]''. Bullfrog's name was derived from an ornament in the offices of Edgar's and Molyneux's other enterprise, Taurus Impact Systems, Bullfrog's precursor where Molyneux and Edgar were developing business software. Bullfrog Productions was founded as a separate entity after [[Commodore International|Commodore]] mistook Taurus for a similarly named company.\n\n[[Electronic Arts]], Bullfrog's [[video game publisher|publisher]], [[List of acquisitions by Electronic Arts|acquired]] the studio in January 1995. Molyneux had become an Electronic Arts vice-president and consultant in 1994, after EA purchased a significant share of Bullfrog. Molyneux's last project with Bullfrog was ''Dungeon Keeper'', and as a result of his dissatisfaction of the corporate aspects of his position, he left the company in July 1997 to found [[Lionhead Studios]]. Others would follow them to Lionhead, and some founded their own companies, such as [[Mucky Foot Productions]].

based in [[Guildford]], England. Founded in 1987 by [[Peter Molyneux]] and [[Les Edgar]], the company gained recognition in 1989 for their third release, ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', and is also well known for titles such as ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'', ''[[Magic Carpet (video game)|Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[Syndicate (video game)|Syndicate]]'' and ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]''. Bullfrog's name was derived from an ornament in the offices of Edgar's and Molyneux's other enterprise, Taurus Impact Systems, Bullfrog's precursor where Molyneux and Edgar were developing business software. Bullfrog Productions was founded as a separate entity after [[Commodore International|Commodore]] mistook Taurus for a similarly named company.\n\n[[Electronic Arts]], Bullfrog's [[video game publisher|publisher]], [[List of acquisitions by Electronic Arts|acquired]] the studio in January 1995. Molyneux had become an Electronic Arts vice-president and consultant in 1994, after EA purchased a significant share of Bullfrog. Molyneux's last project with Bullfrog was ''Dungeon Keeper'', and as a result of his dissatisfaction of the corporate aspects of his position, he left the company in July 1997 to found [[Lionhead Studios]]. Others would follow them to Lionhead, and some founded their own companies, such as [[Mucky Foot Productions]]. After Molyneux's departure, Electronic Arts' control over Bullfrog caused several projects to be cancelled. Bullfrog was merged into [[EA UK]] in 2001 and ceased to exist as a separate entity. Bullfrog titles have been looked upon as a standard for comparison and have spawned numerous [[spiritual sequel]]s.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins, founding and early years (1982\u20131989) ===\n{{See also|Peter Molyneux#Early career}}\n[[File:Peter Molyneux - Game Developers Conference 2010 (2).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|Peter Molyneux, co-founder of Bullfrog Productions, in 2010]]\nIn 1982, entrepreneur Peter Molyneux met Les Edgar at a computer shop called PJ Hi-Fi.<ref name=\"ChairPM\">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=Bournemouth |ISSN=1742-3155 |title=In The Chair With Peter Molyneux |pages=82\u201389 |issue=71}}</ref> When Molyneux left the company where he was working, Edgar suggested that they start a new one,<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/><ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/petermolyneux/index.html |title=GameSpot Presents Legends of Game Design: Peter Molyneux |last=Dulin |first=Ron |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=26 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830100952/http://www.gamespot.com/features/petermolyneux/index.html |archivedate=30 August 2005}}</ref> which would later develop business software for the [[Commodore 64]] as Taurus Impact Systems (also known as Taurus Software).<ref name=\"Progress\"/><ref name=\"Legend\"/> The new company was named after Molyneux and Edgar's shared [[astrological sign]], the [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]].<ref name=\"Progress\"/> At some point, Molyneux accepted a deal to export money systems to Switzerland and baked beans to the Middle East.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/>\n\nOne day, Taurus received a call from the head of [[Commodore International|Commodore]] Europe, wanting to discuss the future of the [[Amiga]],<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> and Taurus' software's suitability for the system.<ref name=\"Legend\"/> Molyneux was invited to Commodore Europe's headquarters, where he was offered several Amiga systems and a space at a show in Germany.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/><ref name=\"Legend\"/> When Molyneux was told that they were anticipating getting his network running on the Amiga, he realised that they had mistaken his company for one called Torus, a producer of networking systems.<ref name=\"Legend\"/><ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Molyneux wanted the Amiga systems, so he did not inform Commodore of their error.<ref name=\"Legend\"/> He received them and began writing a database program called Acquisition.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Commodore kept asking about the database, and Molyneux gave them excuses because they were threatening to shut Taurus down.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> When Acquisition was finished, it was shown at the exhibition in Germany, and won product of the year. 2000 copies were sold to a company in the United States, giving Molyneux and Edgar funds to sustain Taurus.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> Another program Taurus wrote was a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) package called X-CAD.<ref name=\"Progress\">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |publisher=[[Ascential|EMAP]] |title=Work In Progress Bullfrog |issue=12 |date=September 1989 |pages=24\u201328 |ISSN=0955-4084 |url=https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-12 |accessdate=12 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319081815/https://archive.org/details/theone-magazine-12 |archive-date=19 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> They knew the Amiga was becoming a gaming machine, and a friend of Molyneux's asked him to convert ''Druid II: Enlightenment'' from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga.<ref name=\"ChairPM\"/> According to Edgar, it was around this time Bullfrog was founded in preparation for the day when Acquisition was no longer important and they could focus on games.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web |title=Bullfrog Productions: A History Of The Legendary UK Developer |url=https://www.nowgamer.com/bullfrog-productions-a-history-of-the-legendary-uk-developer/ |website=NowGamer |accessdate=11 June 2017 |date=22 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706050106/https://www.nowgamer.com/bullfrog-productions-a-history-of-the-legendary-uk-developer/ |archive-date=6 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bullfrog was originally a brand of Taurus;

Bush''', '''Bush Senior''', or '''Bush 41''' to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], who served as the 43rd president from 2001 to 2009; previously he was usually referred to simply as George Bush.</ref> (June 12, 1924{{spaced ndash}}November 30, 2018) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 41st [[president of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Bush also served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]], as [[Director of Central Intelligence]], and as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\nBush was raised in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and attended [[Phillips Academy]] before serving in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he graduated from [[Yale University]] and moved to [[West Texas]], where he established a successful oil company. After an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate]], he won election to the [[Texas's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district of Texas]] in 1966. President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1971 and to the position of [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee|chairman]] of the [[Republican National Committee]] in 1973. In 1974, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China]], and in 1976 Bush became the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in 1980, but was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican presidential primaries]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan's running mate.\n\nIn the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], Bush defeated Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president in 152 years. Foreign policy drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]], as he navigated the final years of the [[Cold War]] and played a key role in the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Bush presided over the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] and the [[Gulf War]], ending the [[Iraq]]i occupation of [[Kuwait]] in the latter conflict. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush reneged on [[Read my lips: no new taxes|a 1988 campaign promise]] by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit. He also signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] and appointed [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Bush lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] following an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post\u2013Cold War political climate.\n\nAfter leaving office in 1993, Bush was active in humanitarian activities, often working alongside Clinton, his former opponent. With George W. Bush's victory in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], Bush and his son became the second father\u2013son pair to serve as the nation's president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Another son, [[Jeb Bush]], unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican primaries]]. After a long battle with vascular [[Parkinson's disease]], Bush died at his home on November 30, 2018.

In May 1989, Noriega annulled the results of a democratic presidential election in which [[Guillermo Endara]] had been elected.

The invasion was the first large-scale American military operation in more than 40 years that was not related to the Cold War. American forces quickly took control of the Panama Canal Zone and [[Panama City]]. Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was quickly transported to a prison in the United States. Twenty-three Americans died in the operation, while another 394 were wounded. Noriega was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in April 1992.<ref name=\"patterson226227\"/> Historian Stewart Brewer argues that the invasion \"represented a new era in American foreign policy\" because Bush did not justify the invasion under the [[Monroe Doctrine]] or the threat of Communism, but rather on the grounds that it was in the best interests of the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stewart Brewer|title=Borders and Bridges: A History of U.S.-Latin American Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPod9HcYUJ4C&pg=PA146|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood |page=146|isbn=9780275982041}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\n{{Main|Gulf War}}\n[[File:Iraq Kuwait Locator.svg|thumb|Iraq (green) invaded Kuwait (orange) in 1990]]\n\nFaced with massive debts and low oil prices in the aftermath of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], [[Iraq]]i leader [[Saddam Hussein]] decided to conquer the country of [[Kuwait]], a small, oil-rich country situated on Iraq's southern border.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 139\u2013141</ref> After Iraq [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] Kuwait in August 1990, Bush imposed [[Sanctions against Iraq|economic sanctions]] on Iraq and assembled a [[Coalition of the Gulf War|multi-national coalition]] opposed to the invasion.<ref name=\"patterson230232\">Patterson (2005), pp. 230\u2013232</ref> The administration feared that a failure to respond to the invasion would embolden Hussein to attack [[Saudi Arabia]] or Israel, and wanted to discourage other countries from similar aggression.<ref>Herring (2008), pp. 908\u2013909</ref> Bush also wanted to ensure continued access to oil, as Iraq and Kuwait collectively accounted for 20 percent of the world's oil production, and Saudi Arabia produced another 26 percent of the world's oil supply.<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 233</ref>\n\nAt Bush's insistence, in November 1990, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdrawal from Kuwait by January 15, 1991.<ref>Patterson (2005), p. 232</ref> Gorbachev's support, as well as China's abstention, helped ensure passage of the UN resolution.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 146\u2013147, 159</ref> Bush convinced Britain, France, and other nations to commit soldiers to an operation against Iraq, and he won important financial backing from Germany, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 149\u2013151</ref> In January 1991, Bush asked Congress to approve a joint resolution authorizing a war against Iraq.<ref name=\"patterson232233\">Patterson (2005), pp. 232\u2013233</ref> Bush believed that the UN resolution had already provided him with the necessary authorization to launch a military operation against Iraq, but he wanted to show that the nation was united behind a military action.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 160\u2013161</ref> Despite the opposition of a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate, Congress approved the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]].<ref name=\"patterson232233\"/>\n\n[[File:President Bush meets with General Colin Powell, General Scowcroft, Secretary James Baker, Vice President Quayle... - NARA - 186429.tif|thumb|Bush meets with [[Robert Gates]], General [[Colin Powell]], Secretary [[Dick Cheney]] and others about the situation in the Persian Gulf]]\n\nAfter the January 15 deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, U.S. and coalition forces began a conducted a bombing campaign that devastated Iraq's power grid and communications network, and resulted in the desertion of about 100,000 Iraqi soldiers. In retaliation, Iraq launched [[Scud]] missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia, but most of the missiles did little damage.

The compromise additionally included a [[PAYGO|\"pay as you go\"]] provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation.<ref name=\"greene100104\">Greene (2015), pp. 100\u2013104</ref> House Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]] led the conservative opposition to the bill, strongly opposing any form of tax increase.<ref>Meacham (2015), pp. 446\u2013447</ref> Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise, and in October, the House rejected the deal, resulting in a brief government shutdown. Without the strong backing of the Republican Party, Bush agreed to another compromise bill, this one more favorable to Democrats. The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] (OBRA-90), enacted on October 27, 1990, dropped much of the gasoline tax increase in favor of higher income taxes on top earners. It included cuts to domestic spending, but the cuts were not as deep as those that had been proposed in the original compromise. Bush's decision to sign the bill damaged his standing with conservatives and the general public, but it also laid the groundwork for the budget surpluses of the late 1990s.<ref>Greene (2015), pp. 104\u2013106</ref>\n\n====Civil rights====\n{{Quote box\n|title =\n|quote    =  \"Even the strongest person couldn't scale the [[Berlin Wall]] to gain the elusive promise of independence that lay just beyond.

Bush''', '''Bush Senior''', or '''Bush 41''' to distinguish him from his eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], who served as the 43rd president from 2001 to 2009; previously he was usually referred to simply as George Bush.</ref> (June 12, 1924{{spaced ndash}}November 30, 2018) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 41st [[president of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Bush also served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], as [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]], as [[Director of Central Intelligence]], and as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\nBush was raised in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] and attended [[Phillips Academy]] before serving in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. After the war, he graduated from [[Yale University]] and moved to [[West Texas]], where he established a successful oil company. After an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate]], he won election to the [[Texas's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district of Texas]] in 1966. President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1971 and to the position of [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee|chairman]] of the [[Republican National Committee]] in 1973. In 1974, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him as the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office to the People's Republic of China]], and in 1976 Bush became the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in 1980, but was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican presidential primaries]] by [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was then elected vice president in 1980 and 1984 as Reagan's running mate.\n\nIn the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential election]], Bush defeated Democrat [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president in 152 years. Foreign policy drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]], as he navigated the final years of the [[Cold War]] and played a key role in the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Bush presided over the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] and the [[Gulf War]], ending the [[Iraq]]i occupation of [[Kuwait]] in the latter conflict. Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush negotiated and signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush reneged on [[Read my lips: no new taxes|a 1988 campaign promise]] by signing a bill that increased taxes and helped reduce the federal budget deficit. He also signed the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] and appointed [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Bush lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] following an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the decreased emphasis of foreign policy in a post\u2013Cold War political climate.\n\nAfter leaving office in 1993, Bush was active in humanitarian activities, often working alongside Clinton, his former opponent. With George W. Bush's victory in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], Bush and his son became the second father\u2013son pair to serve as the nation's president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Another son, [[Jeb Bush]], unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican primaries]]. After a long battle with vascular [[Parkinson's disease]], Bush died at his home on November 30, 2018.

[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], who has built a [[time travel|time machine]] called the \"Timulator\", travels back in time and steals essential [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s from various points in [[human history]] to place on display in a [[museum]] inside his castle. Because these actions will eventually [[Temporal paradox|change history permanently]], the [[player character]] [[Mario]] takes control of the Timulator to return the artifacts to their proper areas in time. In the NES version, Bowser also kidnaps [[Yoshi]], who is freed upon completing the game. The gameplay focuses on teaching the player the historical significance of each artifact (and of the associated historical person); to progress through the game, the player must correctly answer questions relating to the learned information.\n\n''Mario's Time Machine'' uses a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspective, with a [[game engine]] that varies across all three versions. The player controls Mario using a [[point-and-click adventure|point-and-click]] interface in the MS-DOS version, while the [[video game console|console]] versions use a [[platform game|platforming]]-based control scheme adapted from ''[[Super Mario World]]'', in which Mario can move left or right and jump. Like ''[[List of Mario educational games#Mario Is Missing!|Mario Is Missing!]]'', the console versions use a [[Password (video gaming)|password system]] to order to resume play from a particular [[saved game|game state]].\n\nThe player begins ''Mario's Time Machine'' in Bowser's museum. The museum is the main [[Overworld#Platform games|hub]], where the player obtains the artifacts and directly accesses all the game's [[level (video gaming)|level]]s (which consist of locations on [[Earth]] in different time periods) using the Timulator. In the Super NES and MS-DOS versions, for each artifact, the player is given the year and place it originated from. For example, the player learns that the \"[[Isaac Newton#Apple incident|Apple]]\" artifact originated from 1687 [[Cambridge]]. The player can then time travel using this information; time traveling itself is a [[minigame]] in which Mario [[surfing|surfs]] through a wide ocean, collecting [[Mushroom (Mario)|mushroom]]s. Collecting enough mushrooms will transport Mario to the time period and location programmed into the Timulator. The player is given a short document describing the life and notability of the historical person associated (e.g. [[Isaac Newton]]), but the document itself has some of its terms missing. The player thus is required to converse with the [[non-player character]]s depicting the local denizens of the time period in order to learn various facts and be able to fill in the blanks. The player chooses the words from a list of pre-determined words; if the player incorrectly fills a blank more than twice, he is sent back to 1993 and is required to try again. When the player fills all the blanks correctly, he can then successfully return the artifact to its original owner.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/901/901621p1.html |title=The Other Mario Games, Vol. 4 - Super NES Feature at IGN |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2008-08-21 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref> In the game's ending [[cutscene]], Mario manages to confront Bowser, who then steals back the Timulator to make his escape.

Despite the presence of enemies, Mario cannot lose [[health (gaming)|lives]] or even take damage, so obtaining a [[game over]] is impossible. To obtain an artifact in Bowser's museum, the player plays a ''[[Mario Bros.]]''-inspired minigame in which he fights [[Koopa Troopa]]s. The player can then use the Timulator and travel to one of the fourteen selectable time periods. Unlike the other versions, the player is not explicitly told which time period the artifact originated from. The player is instead encouraged to explore the time periods and obtain hints, either from local denizens or from message blocks. Once the player figures out the artifact that belongs in that time period, he can then place the artifact in its original spot. After all the artifacts have been returned, the player is tasked to answer three random [[multiple choice]] questions pertaining to the historical periods visited.
