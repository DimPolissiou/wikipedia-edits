Non-natives visited the area of Kansas as early as [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] 1540 - 1542. He encountered Indians he called the Quiverans, probably ancestors of the [[Pawnee people]]. Between 1802 and 1804 [[Merriweather Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] crossed the northeastern portion of Kansas territory on their way to the Pacific meeting the [[Kaw (tribe)|Kansa]] Indians from whom the state takes its name. Adventurers and hunters later visited the area known as the [[Great American Desert]], an area, at first, considered unfit for human settlement.\n\nIn 1846 [[Francis Parkman]] toured western Kansas, hunting the [[American bison]], otherwise known as buffalo. His two-month adventure in Kansas and other western states to be would become the subject of the best selling [[The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life]]. James R. Mead, one of the founders of Wichita, explored Kansas between 1859 and 1863, and later settled in Wichita. He knew such colorful characters as Kit Carson, [[Jesse Chisholm]], [[Buffalo Bill]], and Chief Santana. His recollections became a book, ''Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains,1859-1875.'' <ref>Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains,1859-1875. By James R. Mead, edited by Schuyler Jones and introduction by Ignace Mead Jones.</ref>\n\nKansas territory was crossed by at least three major trails. These included western [[Santa Fe Trail]] and [[Oregon Trail]], and the south to north [[Chisholm Trail]]. These trails served first as routes through Kansas territory or for commercial purpose, but later served to bring settlers to the territory.\n\n===First Schools===\n====Indian Mission schools====\n[[File:Shawnee indian mission school.jpg|thumb|left|A two story brick building with one room school on the first floor, located in [[Fairway, Kansas]].]]\nThe Shawnee Indian Mission in Fairway, Kansas was the first school for children in Kansas Territory, serving Shawnee, Delaware and other Indian nations from 1839-1854.\n\nIn 1847, the Jesuits established a mission school for the Osage Indians in Neosho County at present day St. Paul, Kansas. Like the Shawnee Indian Mission School, education was available for both boys and girls. The curriculum included both academic studies and manual trades. The Jesuits who taught the children blended Native American customs with Christianity.<ref>The Mission Story, http://www.osagemission.org/missionstory2.html</ref> In 1869, following the cessation of Indian lands by the Osage tribe in Kansas, the school became St. Ann's Academy for girls and St. Francis Institution for boys, attracting students from several states.<ref>Osage Catholic Mission marker https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-markers/12884</ref>\n\n====Kansas Territory====\nOn May 30, 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, and on August 30, 1855, the first Territorial Legislature made provision by law for a school in each of the counties of the territory. By 1858 the legislature recognized the right of all children regardless of color or religious background to an education. Section 71 of Chapter 8 of the laws of 1858, declares:\n\n\"All school districts established under the authority of this act shall be free and without charge for tuition to all children between the age of five and twenty-one years, and no sectarian instruction shall be allowed therein.\" <ref>William G. Cutler's History of the State of Kansas, Part 19, http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/eraop/era-of-peace-p19.html#SCHOOLS_OF_KANSAS</ref>\n\n====Immigration====\nSettlement in Kansas territory before the Civil War was hampered by the issue of slavery. Kansas became a state in 1861, but not before experiencing a period known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. Even with statehood, questions concerning land titles continued because of Indian claims.\n\nDespite this danger and uncertainty, settlement in Kansas continued. In the Spring of 1863, [[James R. Mead]], noted plainsman and one of the original founders of Wichita, Kansas, first arrived in the Walnut Valley at the extreme western settlement. He came across the tiny community of Towanda where, in addition to the several families staking claims, he saw a \"very rough log building called a school house\".<ref>James R. Mead, ''Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains, 1859-1875'', page 133.</ref>\n\nFollowing the Civil War, immigration renewed with passage of the [[Homestead Act]] and the final removal of the Osage Indians to Oklahoma, a result of the [[Drum Creek Treaty]]. One room schools were added at a furious pace to keep up with the new communities and farms.\n\nA typical example is Lanesfield school near [[Edgerton, Kansas]], and close to Kansas City. The first school session began in 1863 at a house owned by William Gans. By 1867, eighteen pupils attended class in a log schoolhouse on the Burton Dillie farm. In May 1869, nine townsmen met and voted to issue $1,000 worth of school bonds to construct a school built of native Kansas limestone.\n\nEven in sparsely populated rural counties, the demand to build schools for the children of new settlers was intense. In the heart of the [[Flint Hills]] [[Marion County, Kansas]] for example, had a population of 60 in 1860, and by 1878, its population had increased to 8,306. This same year, the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, reported the number of students and schools for each county, including Marion.<ref>Kansas State Board of Agriculture, First Biennial Report, Marion County,1878, Mohler. http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1878/marion.html</ref>\n\n\"Schools. - Number of organized districts, 65; school population, 2,913; average salary of teachers, per month, males, $35.45; females, $29.20. School houses built during 1878, 2; frame, 1; stone, 1. Total number of school houses, 64; frame, 50; stone, 14. Value of all school property, $72,918. A few districts have planted maple and cottonwood trees in their school grounds.\"\n\nThe large ratio of children (2,913) to population (8,306) speaks to the large size of families in the early years. Just as remarkable by today's standards, but not by those of early Kansas, is the number of school districts in Marion (65) compared to the relatively small population.\n\n==Construction==\nThe materials with which schools were built varied by location and population. Most buildings were of simple frame construction, often with the school bell on a [[cupola]]. Especially, in the [[Flint Hills]], native Kansas limestone was used. [[Sod]] construction was used in early western Kansas schools, where trees were scarce.\n\nThe brick chimney was usually set at the rear of the school room, but in some cases, the chimney was placed between the front door and the class itself. A wall was then constructed to keep away the cold from the classroom, and this area would serve as a chamber room for coats and lunch pails.\n\nAn interesting feature of many schools were the two front doors which allowed for separate entrances for boys and girls.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pathway 800.jpg|275px|right|thumb|One-room school building in Arvonia, Kansas]] -->\n\n==What is the Matter with Rural Schools==\nThe conflict between rural communities and cities has always existed and still does. Rural children loved the small communities from which they sprang and enjoyed the freedom of life in the country. But education in rural communities could never hope to compete with that of the city.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1920s, the situation in rural one room schools had shown an insurmountable gap in the quality of education. A one-room school was also a one-teacher school. And, in the years 1921 and 1922, a study revealed that 76% of the teachers were new in their positions, and less than 10% had been teaching for more than a year.<ref>Twenty-Fifth Biennial Report of the State Board of Agriculture, Kansas, Volume XXX, Mohler, 1925-1926, page 24.</ref> These teachers were usually young and female. Marriage often accounted for their short tenure.\n\n==Notable Schools==\n===Acorn===\n <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AcornSchoolTree.jpg|100px|left|thumb|One-room school building in Franklin county, Kansas{{Pufc|1=AcornSchoolTree.jpg|log=2011 September 21}}]] -->\n[[File:Acorn schoolhouse in Franklin County, Kansas on John Brown Highway.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Acorn Schoolhouse, Franklin County]]The Acorn Schoolhouse is located in Franklin County on ancient John Brown Highway where it intersects with Iowa Road.

The inscription over the door reads \"Acorn School, District 74, built 1900\".<ref>http://kansasoneroomschools.blogspot.com/search/label/Acorn%20School</ref>\n<div>\n\n===Arvonia===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pathway 800.jpg|100px|left|thumb|One-room school building in Arvonia, Kansas{{Pufc|1=Pathway 800.jpg|log=2011 September 21}}]] -->\n[[File:Arvonia Schoolhouse, Arvonia, Kansas.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Arvonia, Kansas one room school]]Once upon a time it had three stores, one hotel, one blacksmith and wagon shop, a post-office, two churches and a schoolhouse.<ref>http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/osage/osage-co-p16.html</ref> Today, Arvonia is reduced to a few homes and the beautiful stone school.\n\nArvonia was settled in 1869, by a company of Welsh people who had formed a colony, with J. Mather Jones as their leader. When the town was started, it was hoped that railroad tracks would be laid along the Marais des Cygnes valley. This failed to happen and the community withered.<ref>http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/osage/osage-co-p16.html</ref>\n</div>\n<div>\n\n===Bazaar===\n[[File:BazaarSchool.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Bazaar, Chase County, Kansas]]Bazaar was first settled in 1856, three years before Chase County was organized. The town was a stopping point on the Chisholm Trail and, in 1887, became a shipping point for cattle when the Santa Fe Railroad arrived.\n\n===Bichet===\n[[File:Bichet school near Florence, Marion County, Kansas.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Bichet school from front gate]]Bichet school was built in 1896 for the children of French families who settled along the Cottonwood River near Florence, Marion County, Kansas. The first term of 1896 - 1897 included 19 children from 8 families. The names included Bichet, Goffinet, Lalouette, Louis, Martinet, Reverend, Rensen, and Featherkile.<ref>http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/nominationsNRDB/Marion_BichetSchoolDistrict34NR.pdf</ref> Listed in the Historic Register.\n\n===Cato===\nCato was founded in 1854 at the northern edge of the Cherokee Neutral Lands, now Cherokee and Crawford Counties. The first school was built in 1867. A stone school built in 1869 still stands, after serving as a schoolhouse and a meeting house until the mid 1950s. The school is maintained by the Cato Historical Preservation Association. Never a large town, Cato's population peaked in 1910 with 112 residents. <ref>http://catoschool.com/</ref>\n\n===Kellas===\n[[File:Kellas School, Newton, Harvey County, Kansas.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Kellas school front right side]]Kellas School, built in 1873, in Newton, Harvey County, Kansas, was located at southeast 12th Street & Hillside. The small wood frame building was moved to the Harvey County Historical Society in Newton, where it can be visited today.\n\n==Extinct Schools==\nOne room schools in Kansas could not hope to compete against larger, better equipped schools in the cities. Rural one room schools had their own problems, especially the inability to retain teachers from year to year because of low pay and declining student enrollment. The automobile also made transportation possible for rural students to cities. The end of an era was at hand.\n\nWith the unification of school districts, one room schools were abandoned. In many cases, the schoolhouse reverted to the property owner. Then again, the school itself might be converted into a home or auctioned off. Where the building was on farmland, farmers would burn the structure to revert the land to farm or pasture. Finally, many structures just wasted away with time and weather.\n\n==Literature==\n{{Empty section|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Preservation==\nThere are various projects to preserve the memory of Kansas one room schools.

Cutler's History of the State of Kansas, Part 19, http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/eraop/era-of-peace-p19.html#SCHOOLS_OF_KANSAS</ref>\n\n====Immigration====\nSettlement in Kansas territory before the Civil War was hampered by the issue of slavery. Kansas became a state in 1861, but not before experiencing a period known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. Even with statehood, questions concerning land titles continued because of Indian claims.\n\nDespite this danger and uncertainty, settlement in Kansas continued. In the Spring of 1863, [[James R. Mead]], noted plainsman and one of the original founders of Wichita, Kansas, first arrived in the Walnut Valley at the extreme western settlement. He came across the tiny community of Towanda where, in addition to the several families staking claims, he saw a \"very rough log building called a school house\".<ref>James R. Mead, ''Hunting and Trading on the Great Plains, 1859-1875'', page 133.</ref>\n\nFollowing the Civil War, immigration renewed with passage of the [[Homestead Act]] and the final removal of the Osage Indians to Oklahoma, a result of the [[Drum Creek Treaty]]. One room schools were added at a furious pace to keep up with the new communities and farms.\n\nA typical example is Lanesfield school near [[Edgerton, Kansas]], and close to Kansas City. The first school session began in 1863 at a house owned by William Gans. By 1867, eighteen pupils attended class in a log schoolhouse on the Burton Dillie farm. In May 1869, nine townsmen met and voted to issue $1,000 worth of school bonds to construct a school built of native Kansas limestone.\n\nEven in sparsely populated rural counties, the demand to build schools for the children of new settlers was intense. In the heart of the [[Flint Hills]] [[Marion County, Kansas]] for example, had a population of 60 in 1860, and by 1878, its population had increased to 8,306. This same year, the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, reported the number of students and schools for each county, including Marion.<ref>Kansas State Board of Agriculture, First Biennial Report, Marion County,1878, Mohler. http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1878/marion.html</ref>\n\n\"Schools. - Number of organized districts, 65; school population, 2,913; average salary of teachers, per month, males, $35.45; females, $29.20. School houses built during 1878, 2; frame, 1; stone, 1. Total number of school houses, 64; frame, 50; stone, 14. Value of all school property, $72,918. A few districts have planted maple and cottonwood trees in their school grounds.\"\n\nThe large ratio of children (2,913) to population (8,306) speaks to the large size of families in the early years. Just as remarkable by today's standards, but not by those of early Kansas, is the number of school districts in Marion (65) compared to the relatively small population.\n\n==Construction==\nThe materials with which schools were built varied by location and population. Most buildings were of simple frame construction, often with the school bell on a [[cupola]]. Especially, in the [[Flint Hills]], native Kansas limestone was used. [[Sod]] construction was used in early western Kansas schools, where trees were scarce.\n\nThe brick chimney was usually set at the rear of the school room, but in some cases, the chimney was placed between the front door and the class itself. A wall was then constructed to keep away the cold from the classroom, and this area would serve as a chamber room for coats and lunch pails.\n\nAn interesting feature of many schools were the two front doors which allowed for separate entrances for boys and girls.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pathway 800.jpg|275px|right|thumb|One-room school building in Arvonia, Kansas]] -->\n\n==What is the Matter with Rural Schools==\nThe conflict between rural communities and cities has always existed and still does. Rural children loved the small communities from which they sprang and enjoyed the freedom of life in the country. But education in rural communities could never hope to compete with that of the city.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1920s, the situation in rural one room schools had shown an insurmountable gap in the quality of education. A one-room school was also a one-teacher school. And, in the years 1921 and 1922, a study revealed that 76% of the teachers were new in their positions, and less than 10% had been teaching for more than a year.<ref>Twenty-Fifth Biennial Report of the State Board of Agriculture, Kansas, Volume XXX, Mohler, 1925-1926, page 24.</ref> These teachers were usually young and female. Marriage often accounted for their short tenure.\n\n==Notable Schools==\n===Acorn===\n <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AcornSchoolTree.jpg|100px|left|thumb|One-room school building in Franklin county, Kansas{{Pufc|1=AcornSchoolTree.jpg|log=2011 September 21}}]] -->\n[[File:Acorn schoolhouse in Franklin County, Kansas on John Brown Highway.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Acorn Schoolhouse, Franklin County]]The Acorn Schoolhouse is located in Franklin County on ancient John Brown Highway where it intersects with Iowa Road. The white wooden clapboard school was built in 1900, replacing an earlier structure built in the 1870s. The inscription over the door reads \"Acorn School, District 74, built 1900\".<ref>http://kansasoneroomschools.blogspot.com/search/label/Acorn%20School</ref>\n<div>\n\n===Arvonia===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pathway 800.jpg|100px|left|thumb|One-room school building in Arvonia, Kansas{{Pufc|1=Pathway 800.jpg|log=2011 September 21}}]] -->\n[[File:Arvonia Schoolhouse, Arvonia, Kansas.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Arvonia, Kansas one room school]]Once upon a time it had three stores, one hotel, one blacksmith and wagon shop, a post-office, two churches and a schoolhouse.<ref>http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/osage/osage-co-p16.html</ref> Today, Arvonia is reduced to a few homes and the beautiful stone school.\n\nArvonia was settled in 1869, by a company of Welsh people who had formed a colony, with J. Mather Jones as their leader. When the town was started, it was hoped that railroad tracks would be laid along the Marais des Cygnes valley. This failed to happen and the community withered.<ref>http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/osage/osage-co-p16.html</ref>\n</div>\n<div>\n\n===Bazaar===\n[[File:BazaarSchool.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Bazaar, Chase County, Kansas]]Bazaar was first settled in 1856, three years before Chase County was organized. The town was a stopping point on the Chisholm Trail and, in 1887, became a shipping point for cattle when the Santa Fe Railroad arrived.\n\n===Bichet===\n[[File:Bichet school near Florence, Marion County, Kansas.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Bichet school from front gate]]Bichet school was built in 1896 for the children of French families who settled along the Cottonwood River near Florence, Marion County, Kansas. The first term of 1896 - 1897 included 19 children from 8 families. The names included Bichet, Goffinet, Lalouette, Louis, Martinet, Reverend, Rensen, and Featherkile.<ref>http://www.kshs.org/resource/national_register/nominationsNRDB/Marion_BichetSchoolDistrict34NR.pdf</ref> Listed in the Historic Register.\n\n===Cato===\nCato was founded in 1854 at the northern edge of the Cherokee Neutral Lands, now Cherokee and Crawford Counties. The first school was built in 1867. A stone school built in 1869 still stands, after serving as a schoolhouse and a meeting house until the mid 1950s. The school is maintained by the Cato Historical Preservation Association. Never a large town, Cato's population peaked in 1910 with 112 residents. <ref>http://catoschool.com/</ref>\n\n===Kellas===\n[[File:Kellas School, Newton, Harvey County, Kansas.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Kellas school front right side]]Kellas School, built in 1873, in Newton, Harvey County, Kansas, was located at southeast 12th Street & Hillside. The small wood frame building was moved to the Harvey County Historical Society in Newton, where it can be visited today.\n\n==Extinct Schools==\nOne room schools in Kansas could not hope to compete against larger, better equipped schools in the cities. Rural one room schools had their own problems, especially the inability to retain teachers from year to year because of low pay and declining student enrollment. The automobile also made transportation possible for rural students to cities. The end of an era was at hand.\n\nWith the unification of school districts, one room schools were abandoned. In many cases, the schoolhouse reverted to the property owner. Then again, the school itself might be converted into a home or auctioned off. Where the building was on farmland, farmers would burn the structure to revert the land to farm or pasture. Finally, many structures just wasted away with time and weather.\n\n==Literature==\n{{Empty section|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Preservation==\nThere are various projects to preserve the memory of Kansas one room schools.

Constantly changing lead images were a recurring problem during the early years of this article's existence until File:Lucy Merriam.jpg became the main image in February 2012. That image remained the lead image for six years until a concern was raised at the beginning of July 2018 that the use of that image next to text about blondes being \"stereotyped as sexually attractive, but unintelligent\" had \"paedophilic undertones\".

If you would like to propose a different image, please do so on the talk page. Thank you.-->\n\n'''Blond''' or '''fair hair''' is a [[Human hair color|hair color]] characterized by low levels of the dark [[pigment]] [[eumelanin]]. The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\". ''OED Online.'' March 2012. ''Oxford University Press.'' Web. 17 May 2012.</ref> and derives from [[Old French]] ''blund, blont'', meaning \"a colour midway between golden and [[chestnut hair|light chestnut]]\".<ref>Harper, Douglas. \"Blond (Adj.).\" ''Online Etymology Dictionary.'' [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=blond Web.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801135345/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=blond |date=2014-08-01 }} 17 May 2012.</ref> It gradually eclipsed the native term \"fair\", of same meaning, from Old English ''[[wikt:f\u00e6ger|f\u00e6\u0121er]]'', causing \"fair\" later to become a general term for \"light complexioned\". This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair. However, linguists who favor a Latin origin for the word say that Medieval Latin ''blundus'' was a vulgar pronunciation of Latin ''[[wikt:flavus|flavus]]'', also meaning \"yellow\". Most authorities, especially French, attest to the Frankish origin.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE.

High ratios of black and very dark brown hair are found not in the typically Alpine country, but along the slope of the Pyrenees, in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking country, and on the Mediterranean seacoast. Blond hair is commonest along the [[English Channel|Channel]], in regions settled by [[Saxons]] and [[Normans]], in [[Burgundy]] and the country bordering [[Switzerland]], and down the course of the [[Rh\u00f4ne]].

The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\". ''OED Online.'' March 2012. ''Oxford University Press.''

This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE.
