He was the son and successor of [[Sinatruces of Parthia|Sinatruces]] ({{reign|75|69|era=BC}}).\n\nAt Phraates&nbsp;III's accession, his empire could no longer be considered the supreme power in the [[Near East]], because of the ascendancy of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] under [[Tigranes the Great]] ({{reign|95|55|era=BC}}) and [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] under his ally [[Mithridates VI Eupator]] ({{reign|120|63|era=BC}}). Phraates&nbsp;III's reign was thus marked by his efforts to restore his empire to its former position. To the west of his empire, war had engulfed the area. Tigranes and Mithridates&nbsp;VI urged him to join their war against the [[Roman Republic]], while the Romans tried in turn to convince Phraates&nbsp;III to join them. Phraates&nbsp;III seemingly made promises to both parties but remained passive. He awaited the outcome of the war to take advantage of it at the right moment for the Parthians.\n\nIn 65&nbsp;BC, Phraates&nbsp;III and his new son-in-law [[Tigranes the Younger]] (who was Tigranes the Elder's son) led an expedition into Armenia. Initially successful, their efforts were halted by a long siege at [[Artaxata]]. This led Phraates&nbsp;III to put Tigranes the Younger in charge of the expedition, and leaving him with some Parthian soldiers. Tigranes the Younger, however, was ultimately defeated by his father, leading him to join the Roman commander [[Pompey]] instead. Tigranes the Elder soon submitted to the Romans who kept him as king. They appointed Tigranes the Younger the ruler of [[Kingdom of Sophene|Sophene]]. However, he quickly fell out with Pompey and was sent as a prisoner to [[Rome]]. This was contested by Phraates&nbsp;III but to no avail.\n\nAround the same time\u2014in late 65&nbsp;BC\u2014Phraates&nbsp;III reconquered [[Adiabene]], [[Gordyene]] and northern [[Mesopotamia]] from Tigranes. However, a Roman attack under the generals [[Aulus Gabinius]] and [[Lucius Afranius (consul)|Lucius Afranius]] as far as the [[Tigris]] resulted in Phraates&nbsp;III losing Gordyene, which was restored to Tigranes by the Romans. At the start of 64&nbsp;BC, while Pompey was focusing on his expedition against Mithridates&nbsp;VI, Phraates&nbsp;III invaded Armenia, and ultimately reached an accord with Pompey and Tigranes; Mesopotamia and Adiabene were confirmed as Parthian territory, while Gordyene was confirmed as Roman. Furthermore, a peace treaty was concluded between Phraates&nbsp;III and Tigranes.\n\nIn {{circa|57 BC}} Phraates&nbsp;III was [[patricide|murdered]] by his two sons, [[Orodes II]] and [[Mithridates IV of Parthia|Mithridates IV]], with the latter ascending the throne.

Phraates&nbsp;III's reign was thus marked by his efforts to restore his empire to its former position. To the west of his empire, war had engulfed the area. Tigranes and Mithridates&nbsp;VI urged him to join their war against the [[Roman Republic]], while the Romans tried in turn to convince Phraates&nbsp;III to join them. Phraates&nbsp;III seemingly made promises to both parties but remained passive. He awaited the outcome of the war to take advantage of it at the right moment for the Parthians.\n\nIn 65&nbsp;BC, Phraates&nbsp;III and his new son-in-law [[Tigranes the Younger]] (who was Tigranes the Elder's son) led an expedition into Armenia. Initially successful, their efforts were halted by a long siege at [[Artaxata]]. This led Phraates&nbsp;III to put Tigranes the Younger in charge of the expedition, and leaving him with some Parthian soldiers. Tigranes the Younger, however, was ultimately defeated by his father, leading him to join the Roman commander [[Pompey]] instead. Tigranes the Elder soon submitted to the Romans who kept him as king. They appointed Tigranes the Younger the ruler of [[Kingdom of Sophene|Sophene]]. However, he quickly fell out with Pompey and was sent as a prisoner to [[Rome]]. This was contested by Phraates&nbsp;III but to no avail.\n\nAround the same time\u2014in late 65&nbsp;BC\u2014Phraates&nbsp;III reconquered [[Adiabene]], [[Gordyene]] and northern [[Mesopotamia]] from Tigranes. However, a Roman attack under the generals [[Aulus Gabinius]] and [[Lucius Afranius (consul)|Lucius Afranius]] as far as the [[Tigris]] resulted in Phraates&nbsp;III losing Gordyene, which was restored to Tigranes by the Romans. At the start of 64&nbsp;BC, while Pompey was focusing on his expedition against Mithridates&nbsp;VI, Phraates&nbsp;III invaded Armenia, and ultimately reached an accord with Pompey and Tigranes; Mesopotamia and Adiabene were confirmed as Parthian territory, while Gordyene was confirmed as Roman. Furthermore, a peace treaty was concluded between Phraates&nbsp;III and Tigranes.\n\nIn {{circa|57 BC}} Phraates&nbsp;III was [[patricide|murdered]] by his two sons, [[Orodes II]] and [[Mithridates IV of Parthia|Mithridates IV]], with the latter ascending the throne.
