It was developed in 2018.\nDidgori Meomari is a universal modular armored platform intended for a variety of functions and configurations. Among them is an artillery fire supporting vehicle with an 81 mm 82mm or 120mm mortar module, Reconnaissance vehicle with optical and ground surveillance radar system, tank hunter with different anti-tank guided rockets, mobile Air defense system with IR and laser guided air to surface missile, NBC (nuclear biological chemical) reconnaissance vehicle, patrol vehicle, special forces vehicle, etc. \n\n==Specifications and mobility==\nThe multifunctional platform of \u201cDidgori Meomari\u201d is composed of three main parts: - a universal suspension, armoured compartment with space for a crew of  5 and a rear modular frame, where custom features and functionalities can be installed, such as reconnaissance systems, different weapons and artillery systems . According to the different modifications of the vehicle, a troop compartment or a cargo bed can be installed on the rear frame of the vehicle.\n\nThe crew consists of five members, two of them are the commander and driver-mechanic. Depending on the car's modification, it is possible to have three troops or a heavy weapon operator. Unlike the first variations, to increase ergonomics, \"Didgori Meomari\" has four doors that provide easy and fast climbing for the crew during combat. The front and side armored windows allow for great visual control of the surrounding area. The car is equipped with a thermal camera to ensure safe movement during night, the image is displayed on the screens of both the driver and the commander.\n\nThe modernized Suspension of the vehicle was designed to adapt to various types of terrain,\nmilitary-grade tires makes it possible to move smoothly over desert, marshy, muddy and rocky terrain, which is one of the most important factors during high intensity combat operations. Because of innovative constructive solutions, the car also has the ability to stop and move on very high front and side sloped terrain.\n\n== Protection ==\nThe capsule is equipped with remarkable high standard double layered armour in compliance with the EN1063 BR7+ ballistic standard, meaning it is able to withstand a 7.62 x 51 NATO calibre projectile fired from a few meters. Double layered armour is used for protection of the vehicle, Attached to the main armor are special mounting points for detachable armor plates, which are easily interchangeable and decrease the possibility of damage of the Main armor. It is also possible to install Slat Armor or Net Armor designed to protect against anti-tank rocket attacks on the vehicle. The underbody is designed and produced to increase the level of protection at specific areas or parts to provide protection against different types of mines or improvised explosives, equivalent to a few kilograms of TNT.\n\n==Variants==\n* Didgori Meomari 120 mm mobile mortar system\n\n==Civilian use==\nIn 2019, Armored Vehicle Didgori Meomari was featured in the Fast & Furious 9 movie\n\n== Operators ==\n* {{flag|Georgia}} \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Didgori meomari stc delta (3).jpg\nFile:Didgori meomari stc delta (2).jpg\nFile:Didgori meomari stc delta (1).jpg\nFile:Didgori meomari 120 mm mobile mortar.jpg\nFile:Didgori Meomari with 120 mm mortar module.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Oshkosh L-ATV]]\n* [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]]\n* [[Otokar Cobra]]\n* [[HMMWV]]\n* [[Lazika]]\n* [[Didgori-1]]\n* [[Didgori-2]]\n* [[Didgori Medevac]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://delta.gov.ge STC DELTA]\n* [http://mod.gov.ge/?lang=1 Ministry of Defence of Georgia]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOhmEbr6rSfB1djX5Jqe0Hw STC delta channel]\n\n{{Modern IFV and APC}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Military equipment of Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Armoured personnel carriers of Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Wheeled armoured personnel carriers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|name= Didgori Meomari\n|image= Didgori_warrior_stcdelta.jpg\n|image_size = 300\n|caption= Didgori Meomari\n|origin={{GEO}}\n|type = Light tactical vehicle\n|designer= [[Scientific Technical Center Delta]]\n|manufacturer=[[Scientific Technical Center Delta]] \n|number built= first batch in 2018\n|service= 2018-Present\n|used_by=[[Didgori-2#Georgia|georgia]]\n|is_vehicle=yes\n|         crew= 3(2)+2(3)\n|       length= 5640 mm\n|        width= 2350 mm\n|       height= 2230 mm\n|       weight= 7000 kg \n|       armour= BR7+ (EN1063 standart)\n|      armament_system=\n|      primary_armament= Remote Controlled Weapon Station with 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine gun, 40 mm automatic grenade launcher or 23 mm automatic cannon. \n|    secondary_armament=\n|       engine= twin turbocharged V8 engine\n| engine_power= 356 hp\n|   suspension= wheeled 4\u00d74\n|   speed= 120 km/h maximum speed on paved roads<br>80 km/h off-road<br>50 km/h with damaged tires\n|     pw_ratio=\n|        vehicle_range= 500 km\n}}\n\nThe '''Didgori Meomari''' (Didgori warrior) ({{lang-ka|\u10d3\u10d8\u10d3\u10d2\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8 \u10db\u10d4\u10dd\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8}}) is an armoured modular multi-role and special operations vehicle produced by [[STC Delta]].

He was born in [[Budapest]] and died in [[Paris]].\n\n== Biography ==\nIsidor Philipp studied [[piano]] under [[Georges Mathias]] (a pupil of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]]) at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] and won First Prize in piano performance in 1883. Other teachers included [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Stephen Heller]] (a pupil of [[Carl Czerny]], one of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s students) and [[Th\u00e9odore Ritter]] (a pupil of [[Franz Liszt]]). At the Conservatoire, he met fellow student [[Claude Debussy]]. They remained lifelong friends, and Philipp often played his compositions. After Debussy's death, Philipp was regarded as the leading authority on his piano music. After graduating from the Conservatoire, Philipp commenced a career which took him to various European countries, and he was a regular performer at the [[Colonne]], Lamoureux and Conservatoire concerts in Paris. He was able to hear concerts, recitals or master classes by many of the leading pianists of the day, including Liszt and [[Anton Rubinstein]]. He knew [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], a close friend of Chopin's, and was a pall-bearer at Alkan's funeral in 1888; he subsequently edited many of Alkan's works for republication.<ref>Smith (2000) I, 75-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Philipp formed a trio with Loeb and Bertelier which toured for about a decade. He revived the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Instruments \u00e0 Vent from 1896 to 1901. However, he eventually curtailed his concertizing, as he found lasting satisfaction in teaching. He returned to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he was a pre-eminent professor of piano from 1893 to 1934, one of the youngest ever appointed to that institution. From 1921 to 1933, Philipp was also the head of the piano section at the American Conservatory of [[Fontainebleau]], which became famous for starting the careers of many notable American composers. His home in Paris contained many ancient and unusual instruments and other musical artifacts. When the [[Nazis]] entered Paris in World War II and Philipp fled to the United States in 1940, the Nazis confiscated the contents of his apartment.\n\nHe left for the United States in 1941 and taught in New York and L'Alliance Francais in Louiseville, Quebec, Canada. During the war, he taught piano in [[New York City]] and at the [[Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]]. While he was in New York, he gave recitals with the violinist [[John Corigliano|John Corigliano, Sr.]] (Corigliano was the longtime [[concertmaster]] of the [[New York Philharmonic]]).<ref>[http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm Isidor Philipp, pianist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220530/http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> After the war, he spent the rest of his life between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]].\n\nPhilipp married once but he obtained a [[divorce]] shortly afterwards.\n\nOn 20 March 1955, aged 91, he played the piano part in both [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' D minor Sonata and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata]] in New York, returning to Paris a year later. He gave his farewell recital at the age of 92, in Paris. He died there in 1958 after a fall on the Paris metro.<ref name=bach/> He is buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\nIn 1977, the Isidor Philipp Archives were deposited at the University of Louisville by the American Liszt Society. They gather his compositions for the piano, his exercises and studies, his editions of the works of Franz Liszt, as well as exercises, studies and works on other composers, recordings, correspondence, photographs, and other artifacts.\n\n== The Chopin tradition ==\nPhilipp began piano lessons with George Mathias at age 16. In an interview with E.H. Lampard, a columnist for the St. Catharine's Standard, Harold Bradley, who was a student and associate of Philipp's for over 30 years, stated that it was Mathias who had been the one student of Chopin who absorbed all the wisdom and value in piano pedagogy that Chopin had developed over his life. \"Chopin's fame as a composer has obscured the fact that he was the first and greatest name to adopt the career of piano teaching as a profession. He created an entirely new philosophy of musical thinking, and was the first musician of sufficient stature to be able to penetrate into the thought of the keyboard composers who preceded him to the extent of seeing the individual merits of each. Thus, he extended the dimensions of piano teaching to a point where the whole concept of music education became affected.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nAs most of Chopin's students were amateurs, or died early, Mathias was the only one who could pass on this legacy. Bradley continued, \"This is not to be confused with the mere performance of Chopin's own compositions, but an appreciation of the art of the keyboard composers up to his time and the genius to apply this knowledge. At Chopin's death, it was Mathias who was able to furnish information for the complete publication of his compositions but he also felt an obligation to preserve the contribution Chopin had made as a teacher and artist. Mathias in turn trained young pianists, but it proved to be Isidor Philipp that was best equipped to carry on the Chopin philosophy of teaching. Philipp then worked with Mathias that the latter had worked with Chopin. By the age of 30, because of his studies Mathias and other prominent teachers, Philipp was recognized as the supreme authority on the piano and its literature.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n== Teaching philosophy ==\n{{essay|date=May 2013}}\nIn interviews his students remember him with a great deal of affection and remark about his gentle and patient manner as a teacher. Students commented that he stressed suppleness, firmness, rhythmic exactitude and articulation. He insisted on practicing with the metronome, first slowly, then incrementally faster for all technical exercises and in learning any new piece. He taught that octaves should be played from the wrist, with a motionless arm, and that fingers should attain true independence of one another. Like other great teachers, he did not have a 'system', but taught what the student needed at the time. Paul Loyonnet stated his ideals were velocity, sobriety of expression and the ''jeu perle'' style. As for interpretations, he stressed that the student must know the piece intimately and thoroughly before it can be properly played, but did not force any particular interpretation.\n\nPhilipp's repertoire was wide, from the earliest keyboard masters to contemporary composers. He believed that every pianist should be conversant in all styles and eras of piano, and did not shy from playing [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] or other early composers on a modern grand. One of his teaching points was that pianists should play any piece of music the way the composer intended, and seeking out what the composer intended is often a lifelong process. Nonetheless, each pianist should have his own views on the pieces and not just copy what another has done.\n\nPhilipp wrote, \"The quality most desirable in piano playing is tone. Tone should be worked at from the first, and the pupil must listen attentively to it. To produce a beautiful tone, Thalberg said, 'one should in a way knead the keyboard with a hand of velvet, the key being rather felt than struck.' It is essential to maintain the utmost relaxation in the arms, wrists and hands.\" Fernando Laires said that Philipp insisted that the music and the tone should arise from deep within the piano, not pounded out at the keyboard, and by that he meant that he must come deep within one's soul, not at the fingertips.\n\nRubato, Philipp wrote, does not mean playing out of time, but rather, \"any ritenuto that we may be impelled to make, must be compensated by a corresponding accelerando and also the opposite, the bass keeping exactly the time.\" Although Philipp abhorred distortions in interpreting pieces, he believed that \"even when all the interpretive signs are exactly observed, there remains ample scope for self expression and liberty. You must be living and feeling the drama or the poem or the piece you play, in all its inflections and shades of emotion. What you do not feel yourself, your listeners will not get. You must be fully absorbed in the interpretation.\"<ref>Philipp, \"Some Thoughts on Piano Playing,\" Durand et fils (1928)</ref>\n\nWhen his friend [[Claude Debussy]] was composing new pieces for the piano, he would often ask Philipp for advice on notation so that pianists would be able to better understand his nuances and approach. After considerable deliberation, they both decided that almost no pedal markings should be used in any of the published pieces. Their reasoning is that every piano is different in quality, every room or hall is different in size and resonance, and each pianist has different capabilities. To lock in one form of pedaling to cover all possible circumstances would place the pedaling notation above the effects that Debussy wished to achieve. They decided that pedaling only where it is absolutely necessary, and gave discretion to the pianist to use it as needed. Although this has often been abused by some pianists who use it to cloud the harmonies, or achieve a very dry sound, it remains a point of discussion for every pianist who chooses to perform Debussy's piano works.\n\nHarold Bradley stated that Philipp didn't necessarily always take the 'best' students as his pupils. Sometimes, he would accept a student who had only a few years of instruction and was at the intermediate level, and often he would refuse to teach even top level pianists. For Philipp, the most important attribute of a student wasn't his or her particular level of accomplishment, but whether they were teachable or not. Bradley said that Philipp could often tell a pianist's personality just by listening to him play.  Bradley created an institute (Bradley Institute of Music) that embodied the educational philosophies of Isidor Philipp.<ref>\"World Famous Musicians Teach at Harold Bradley School of Music\", Lockport, N.Y. Union-Sun & Journal, July 20, 1957</ref>  The institute's staff worked closely with Philipp to create a musical education that worked from pre-school aged children on.\n\n== Association, students and friends ==\nPhilipp allowed his name to be associated with the Bradley Institute for Music Education Research, Ltd., which was founded in Paris, in 1930, but moved to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada, under the guidance of his pupil Harold Bradley.

He was born in [[Budapest]] and died in [[Paris]].\n\n== Biography ==\nIsidor Philipp studied [[piano]] under [[Georges Mathias]] (a pupil of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]]) at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] and won First Prize in piano performance in 1883. Other teachers included [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Stephen Heller]] (a pupil of [[Carl Czerny]], one of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s students) and [[Th\u00e9odore Ritter]] (a pupil of [[Franz Liszt]]). At the Conservatoire, he met fellow student [[Claude Debussy]]. They remained lifelong friends, and Philipp often played his compositions. After Debussy's death, Philipp was regarded as the leading authority on his piano music. After graduating from the Conservatoire, Philipp commenced a career which took him to various European countries, and he was a regular performer at the [[Colonne]], Lamoureux and Conservatoire concerts in Paris. He was able to hear concerts, recitals or master classes by many of the leading pianists of the day, including Liszt and [[Anton Rubinstein]]. He knew [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], a close friend of Chopin's, and was a pall-bearer at Alkan's funeral in 1888; he subsequently edited many of Alkan's works for republication.<ref>Smith (2000) I, 75-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Philipp formed a trio with Loeb and Bertelier which toured for about a decade. He revived the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Instruments \u00e0 Vent from 1896 to 1901. However, he eventually curtailed his concertizing, as he found lasting satisfaction in teaching. He returned to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he was a pre-eminent professor of piano from 1893 to 1934, one of the youngest ever appointed to that institution. From 1921 to 1933, Philipp was also the head of the piano section at the American Conservatory of [[Fontainebleau]], which became famous for starting the careers of many notable American composers. His home in Paris contained many ancient and unusual instruments and other musical artifacts. When the [[Nazis]] entered Paris in World War II and Philipp fled to the United States in 1940, the Nazis confiscated the contents of his apartment.\n\nHe left for the United States in 1941 and taught in New York and L'Alliance Francais in Louiseville, Quebec, Canada. During the war, he taught piano in [[New York City]] and at the [[Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]]. While he was in New York, he gave recitals with the violinist [[John Corigliano|John Corigliano, Sr.]] (Corigliano was the longtime [[concertmaster]] of the [[New York Philharmonic]]).<ref>[http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm Isidor Philipp, pianist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220530/http://www2.inow.com/~starr/Photos/philipp.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> After the war, he spent the rest of his life between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]].\n\nPhilipp married once but he obtained a [[divorce]] shortly afterwards.\n\nOn 20 March 1955, aged 91, he played the piano part in both [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' D minor Sonata and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata]] in New York, returning to Paris a year later. He gave his farewell recital at the age of 92, in Paris. He died there in 1958 after a fall on the Paris metro.<ref name=bach/> He is buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].\n\nIn 1977, the Isidor Philipp Archives were deposited at the University of Louisville by the American Liszt Society. They gather his compositions for the piano, his exercises and studies, his editions of the works of Franz Liszt, as well as exercises, studies and works on other composers, recordings, correspondence, photographs, and other artifacts.\n\n== The Chopin tradition ==\nPhilipp began piano lessons with George Mathias at age 16. In an interview with E.H. Lampard, a columnist for the St. Catharine's Standard, Harold Bradley, who was a student and associate of Philipp's for over 30 years, stated that it was Mathias who had been the one student of Chopin who absorbed all the wisdom and value in piano pedagogy that Chopin had developed over his life. \"Chopin's fame as a composer has obscured the fact that he was the first and greatest name to adopt the career of piano teaching as a profession. He created an entirely new philosophy of musical thinking, and was the first musician of sufficient stature to be able to penetrate into the thought of the keyboard composers who preceded him to the extent of seeing the individual merits of each. Thus, he extended the dimensions of piano teaching to a point where the whole concept of music education became affected.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nAs most of Chopin's students were amateurs, or died early, Mathias was the only one who could pass on this legacy. Bradley continued, \"This is not to be confused with the mere performance of Chopin's own compositions, but an appreciation of the art of the keyboard composers up to his time and the genius to apply this knowledge. At Chopin's death, it was Mathias who was able to furnish information for the complete publication of his compositions but he also felt an obligation to preserve the contribution Chopin had made as a teacher and artist. Mathias in turn trained young pianists, but it proved to be Isidor Philipp that was best equipped to carry on the Chopin philosophy of teaching. Philipp then worked with Mathias that the latter had worked with Chopin. By the age of 30, because of his studies Mathias and other prominent teachers, Philipp was recognized as the supreme authority on the piano and its literature.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n== Teaching philosophy ==\n{{essay|date=May 2013}}\nIn interviews his students remember him with a great deal of affection and remark about his gentle and patient manner as a teacher. Students commented that he stressed suppleness, firmness, rhythmic exactitude and articulation. He insisted on practicing with the metronome, first slowly, then incrementally faster for all technical exercises and in learning any new piece. He taught that octaves should be played from the wrist, with a motionless arm, and that fingers should attain true independence of one another. Like other great teachers, he did not have a 'system', but taught what the student needed at the time. Paul Loyonnet stated his ideals were velocity, sobriety of expression and the ''jeu perle'' style. As for interpretations, he stressed that the student must know the piece intimately and thoroughly before it can be properly played, but did not force any particular interpretation.\n\nPhilipp's repertoire was wide, from the earliest keyboard masters to contemporary composers. He believed that every pianist should be conversant in all styles and eras of piano, and did not shy from playing [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] or other early composers on a modern grand. One of his teaching points was that pianists should play any piece of music the way the composer intended, and seeking out what the composer intended is often a lifelong process. Nonetheless, each pianist should have his own views on the pieces and not just copy what another has done.\n\nPhilipp wrote, \"The quality most desirable in piano playing is tone. Tone should be worked at from the first, and the pupil must listen attentively to it. To produce a beautiful tone, Thalberg said, 'one should in a way knead the keyboard with a hand of velvet, the key being rather felt than struck.' It is essential to maintain the utmost relaxation in the arms, wrists and hands.\" Fernando Laires said that Philipp insisted that the music and the tone should arise from deep within the piano, not pounded out at the keyboard, and by that he meant that he must come deep within one's soul, not at the fingertips.\n\nRubato, Philipp wrote, does not mean playing out of time, but rather, \"any ritenuto that we may be impelled to make, must be compensated by a corresponding accelerando and also the opposite, the bass keeping exactly the time.\" Although Philipp abhorred distortions in interpreting pieces, he believed that \"even when all the interpretive signs are exactly observed, there remains ample scope for self expression and liberty. You must be living and feeling the drama or the poem or the piece you play, in all its inflections and shades of emotion. What you do not feel yourself, your listeners will not get. You must be fully absorbed in the interpretation.\"<ref>Philipp, \"Some Thoughts on Piano Playing,\" Durand et fils (1928)</ref>\n\nWhen his friend [[Claude Debussy]] was composing new pieces for the piano, he would often ask Philipp for advice on notation so that pianists would be able to better understand his nuances and approach. After considerable deliberation, they both decided that almost no pedal markings should be used in any of the published pieces. Their reasoning is that every piano is different in quality, every room or hall is different in size and resonance, and each pianist has different capabilities. To lock in one form of pedaling to cover all possible circumstances would place the pedaling notation above the effects that Debussy wished to achieve. They decided that pedaling only where it is absolutely necessary, and gave discretion to the pianist to use it as needed. Although this has often been abused by some pianists who use it to cloud the harmonies, or achieve a very dry sound, it remains a point of discussion for every pianist who chooses to perform Debussy's piano works.\n\nHarold Bradley stated that Philipp didn't necessarily always take the 'best' students as his pupils. Sometimes, he would accept a student who had only a few years of instruction and was at the intermediate level, and often he would refuse to teach even top level pianists. For Philipp, the most important attribute of a student wasn't his or her particular level of accomplishment, but whether they were teachable or not. Bradley said that Philipp could often tell a pianist's personality just by listening to him play.  Bradley created an institute (Bradley Institute of Music) that embodied the educational philosophies of Isidor Philipp.<ref>\"World Famous Musicians Teach at Harold Bradley School of Music\", Lockport, N.Y. Union-Sun & Journal, July 20, 1957</ref>  The institute's staff worked closely with Philipp to create a musical education that worked from pre-school aged children on.\n\n== Association, students and friends ==\nPhilipp allowed his name to be associated with the Bradley Institute for Music Education Research, Ltd., which was founded in Paris, in 1930, but moved to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], Canada, under the guidance of his pupil Harold Bradley. The Institute was devoted not only to teaching music, but also to documenting the vast knowledge of teaching traditions that Philipp had learned during his long life. Philipp's friend, violinist John Corigliano, Sr., was among the original Board of Directors. Pianist Grace Barnes and violinist Deryck Aird served as music teachers along with Bradley for several decades.\n\nThe list of Isidor Philipp's students who became notable pianists, composers or conductors is very long, and includes [[Stell Andersen]], Dwight Anderson, Grace Barnes, [[Emma Boynet]], [[Harold Bradley (pianist)]], John Buttrick, [[Serge Conus]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Jeanne-Marie Darr\u00e9]], [[Pierre Dervaux]], [[Ania Dorfmann]], [[Rolande Falcinelli]], [[Felix Fox]], [[Jean Fran\u00e7aix]], [[Henri Gagnon]], [[Florence Parr Gere]], [[Youra Guller]], [[Georges Hugon]], Fernando Laires, Malvina Leshock, [[Yvonne Loriod]], [[Nikita Magaloff]], [[Federico Mompou]], [[L\u00e9o-Pol Morin]], [[Guiomar Novaes]], [[Ozan Marsh]], [[Wilfrid Pelletier]], [[\u00c9mile Poillot]], [[Harrison Potter]], noted philosopher [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Phyllis Sellick]], [[Soulima Stravinsky]], [[Louise Talma]], [[Alexander Tcherepnin]], [[Beveridge Webster]], and [[Victor Young]].<ref>[http://louisville.edu/library/music/coll/philipp.html University of Louisville]</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Federico+Mompou:+Catalonian+composer+magnifico-a0156361347 The Free Library]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/Loriod.htm |title=Yvonne Loriod-Messiaen |access-date=2009-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427073326/http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/Loriod.htm |archive-date=2007-04-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/music/musyoung.xml New York Public Library]</ref><ref>[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/c.asp?c=C203 Hyperion Records]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, many prominent and well established pianists would seek out his advice, particularly on playing French composers, which included [[Claude Debussy]].

After three to five years as an FMQ, the Night Stalker may try out for flight lead qualification.\n\n==History==\n===1980s and 1990s===\nAfter the 1980 [[Operation Eagle Claw]] attempt to rescue [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages]] held in [[Tehran]], Iran, failed, President [[Jimmy Carter]] ordered former [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Adm. [[James L. Holloway III]] to figure out how the U.S. military could best mount another attempt. At the time there were no U.S. helicopter units trained in this kind of stealthy, short-notice Special Operations mission.\n\nThe Army looked to the 101st Aviation Group, the air arm of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault), which had the most diverse operating experience of the service's helicopter units, and selected elements of the 158th Aviation Battalion, 101st Aviation Battalion, 229th Aviation Battalion, and the 159th Aviation Battalion. The chosen pilots immediately entered intensive training in night flying.\n\nThis provisional unit was dubbed Task Force 158, since most of its pilots were Black Hawk aviators detached from the 158th. Their distinctive 101st \"Screaming Eagle\" patches remained on their uniforms. The Black Hawks and Chinooks continued to operate around Campbell Army Airfield at the north of post, and Saber Army Heliport at the south. The [[OH-6 Cayuse]]s, aircraft that had vanished from the division's regular inventory after Vietnam, were hidden on base in an ammunition holding area still known as the \"SHOC Pad\", for \"Special Helicopter Operations Company\".\n\nAs the first batch of pilots completed training in the fall of 1980, a second attempt to rescue the hostages was planned for early 1981. Dubbed [[Operation Honey Badger]], it was called off when the hostages were [[October Surprise|released]] on the morning of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration.\n\nTask Force 158 was the Army's only special operations aviation unit, and its members had already become recognized as the Army's premier aviation night fighters. Their capability was judged too useful to lose, and so instead of returning to the 101st, the pilots and modified aircraft became a new unit. (Original members of the Night Stalkers refer to it as \"the day the Eagles came off\".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}) The unit was officially established on 16 October 1981, when it was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion.\n\nThe 160th first saw combat during 1983's [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the U.S. invasion of [[Grenada]].\n\nIn 1986, it was renamed the 160th Aviation Group (Airborne); and in May 1990, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). As demand for highly trained special operations aviation assets bloomed, the regiment activated three battalions, a separate detachment, and incorporated one [[Army National Guard]] unit, the 1st Battalion, 245th Aviation (OK ARNG).\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, its pilots took part in [[Operation Earnest Will]], the protection of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. They flew from [[United States Navy|US Navy]] warships and leased oil barges in a secret sub-part called [[Operation Prime Chance]], and became the first helicopter pilots to use [[night vision device|night vision goggles]] and [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) devices in night combat.\n\n[[File:US Army 160th SOAR(A) CH-47 sling-load a Mi-24 out of Chad-Operation Mount Hope III.jpg|thumb|left|The Regiment's Company E fly the slingloaded [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24 Hind]] out of Chad, known as [[Operation Mount Hope III]]]]\nIn June 1988, the unit received a short-notice directive to recover a Soviet made [[Mi-24 Hind]] attack helicopter from a remote location in [[Chad]]. The Mi-24 was abandoned by the Libyans after 15 years of fighting, and was of great intelligence value to the U.S. In April 1988, two CH-47 Chinooks, a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]], and 75 maintenance personnel and crew flew to [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands AFB]], [[New Mexico]] to rehearse the mission. In late May of that year an advance team went to [[Ndjamena]], Chad, to await their aircraft. Two weeks later two Chinooks and 76 crew members and maintenance personnel arrived by C-5. At midnight on 11 June 1988, two MH-47s flew 490 miles at night without outside navigational aids to the target location, the Ouadi Doum Airfield in northern Chad. The first Chinook landed and configured the Mi-24, while the second hovered overhead and sling loaded it for return to Ndjamena. A surprise sandstorm slowed the return trip, but less than 67 hours after the arrival of the C-5 in Chad, the ground crew had the Mi-24 and Chinooks aboard and ready for return to the U.S.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/USASOAC/photos/a.251685494936578/526484250790033/?type=3&theater This date in ARSOA history: OPERATION MOUNT HOPE, U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command Facebook page, dated 11 June 2014, last accessed 9 June 2019]</ref>\n\nThe Night Stalkers spearheaded [[Operation Just Cause]], the 1989 invasion of [[Panama]], and they were also used in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n[[File:S64-Crew.gif|thumb|Super 6-4 one month before the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].

After a series of skills test qualifications, experience, leadership, and oral review boards lasting up to three years, the Night Stalker is designated Fully Mission Qualified (FMQ). After three to five years as an FMQ, the Night Stalker may try out for flight lead qualification.\n\n==History==\n===1980s and 1990s===\nAfter the 1980 [[Operation Eagle Claw]] attempt to rescue [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages]] held in [[Tehran]], Iran, failed, President [[Jimmy Carter]] ordered former [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Adm. [[James L. Holloway III]] to figure out how the U.S. military could best mount another attempt. At the time there were no U.S. helicopter units trained in this kind of stealthy, short-notice Special Operations mission.\n\nThe Army looked to the 101st Aviation Group, the air arm of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault), which had the most diverse operating experience of the service's helicopter units, and selected elements of the 158th Aviation Battalion, 101st Aviation Battalion, 229th Aviation Battalion, and the 159th Aviation Battalion. The chosen pilots immediately entered intensive training in night flying.\n\nThis provisional unit was dubbed Task Force 158, since most of its pilots were Black Hawk aviators detached from the 158th. Their distinctive 101st \"Screaming Eagle\" patches remained on their uniforms. The Black Hawks and Chinooks continued to operate around Campbell Army Airfield at the north of post, and Saber Army Heliport at the south. The [[OH-6 Cayuse]]s, aircraft that had vanished from the division's regular inventory after Vietnam, were hidden on base in an ammunition holding area still known as the \"SHOC Pad\", for \"Special Helicopter Operations Company\".\n\nAs the first batch of pilots completed training in the fall of 1980, a second attempt to rescue the hostages was planned for early 1981. Dubbed [[Operation Honey Badger]], it was called off when the hostages were [[October Surprise|released]] on the morning of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration.\n\nTask Force 158 was the Army's only special operations aviation unit, and its members had already become recognized as the Army's premier aviation night fighters. Their capability was judged too useful to lose, and so instead of returning to the 101st, the pilots and modified aircraft became a new unit. (Original members of the Night Stalkers refer to it as \"the day the Eagles came off\".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}) The unit was officially established on 16 October 1981, when it was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion.\n\nThe 160th first saw combat during 1983's [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the U.S. invasion of [[Grenada]].\n\nIn 1986, it was renamed the 160th Aviation Group (Airborne); and in May 1990, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). As demand for highly trained special operations aviation assets bloomed, the regiment activated three battalions, a separate detachment, and incorporated one [[Army National Guard]] unit, the 1st Battalion, 245th Aviation (OK ARNG).\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, its pilots took part in [[Operation Earnest Will]], the protection of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. They flew from [[United States Navy|US Navy]] warships and leased oil barges in a secret sub-part called [[Operation Prime Chance]], and became the first helicopter pilots to use [[night vision device|night vision goggles]] and [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) devices in night combat.\n\n[[File:US Army 160th SOAR(A) CH-47 sling-load a Mi-24 out of Chad-Operation Mount Hope III.jpg|thumb|left|The Regiment's Company E fly the slingloaded [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24 Hind]] out of Chad, known as [[Operation Mount Hope III]]]]\nIn June 1988, the unit received a short-notice directive to recover a Soviet made [[Mi-24 Hind]] attack helicopter from a remote location in [[Chad]]. The Mi-24 was abandoned by the Libyans after 15 years of fighting, and was of great intelligence value to the U.S. In April 1988, two CH-47 Chinooks, a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]], and 75 maintenance personnel and crew flew to [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands AFB]], [[New Mexico]] to rehearse the mission. In late May of that year an advance team went to [[Ndjamena]], Chad, to await their aircraft. Two weeks later two Chinooks and 76 crew members and maintenance personnel arrived by C-5. At midnight on 11 June 1988, two MH-47s flew 490 miles at night without outside navigational aids to the target location, the Ouadi Doum Airfield in northern Chad. The first Chinook landed and configured the Mi-24, while the second hovered overhead and sling loaded it for return to Ndjamena. A surprise sandstorm slowed the return trip, but less than 67 hours after the arrival of the C-5 in Chad, the ground crew had the Mi-24 and Chinooks aboard and ready for return to the U.S.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/USASOAC/photos/a.251685494936578/526484250790033/?type=3&theater This date in ARSOA history: OPERATION MOUNT HOPE, U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command Facebook page, dated 11 June 2014, last accessed 9 June 2019]</ref>\n\nThe Night Stalkers spearheaded [[Operation Just Cause]], the 1989 invasion of [[Panama]], and they were also used in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n[[File:S64-Crew.gif|thumb|Super 6-4 one month before the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].
