can be [[Ionization|ionized]] using [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[Alternating current|AC]] [[high voltage]] of a few tens of [[kilovolt]]s even at the standard [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]. The resultant plasma contains [[ion]]s that are accelerated by the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] using [[electrohydrodynamics]] (EHD) at low altitude and small velocity. The surface of the vehicle acts as an [[electrostatic fluid accelerator]] pumping surrounding air as [[ion wind]], radially then downward, so the lower pressure zone on the upper surface and the higher pressure zone underneath the aircraft produces [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[thrust]] for propulsion and stability.<ref name=\"Scientific American\" />. At a higher altitude and to reach greater speeds, a [[magnetic field]] is also applied to enhance collisions between electrons and heavy species in the plasma and use the more powerful [[Lorentz force#Continuous charge distribution|Lorentz body force]] to accelerate all [[charge carrier]]s in the same direction along a radial high speed [[Jet (fluid)|jet]].<ref name=\"Roy 2011\" />\nA very early version of this documented by Jean-louis Naudin used  wire originally from a hard disk drive cable (aka 80/40 wire) with alternate HV on each pair and this works but is very inefficient compared to newer approaches as discussed above.\n\n== Novel Technologies == \nTo achieve its mission, the WEAV-related research introduced a number of plasma actuator designs. This section highlights the main technologies.\n\n=== Multi-Barrier Plasma Actuators === \n[[File:MBPA schematic.png|thumb|Schematic of a tri-layer multi-barrier plasma actuator (MBPA) design. Though a tri-layer MBPA design is shown, other configurations are possible.]]\n[[File:MBPA Design Comparison.png|thumb|Comparison of force and effectiveness among various single, bi-layer, and tri-layer MBPA designs.]]\nThe conventional single [[dielectric barrier discharge]] (DBD) actuator design is composed of two electrodes separated by a single dielectric material. Much work has gone into optimizing the design and performance of the single DBD design,<ref name=\"Corke 2010\">{{cite journal\n | last1=Corke |first1=Thomas\n | last2=Enloe |first2=Cynthia\n | last3=Wilkinson |first3=Stephen\n | date=1 January 2010\n | title=Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Actuators for Flow Control\n | journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics\n | volume=42\n | issue=1\n | pages=505\u2013529\n | doi=10.1146/annurev-fluid-121108-145550\n|bibcode=2010AnRFM..42..505C\n }}</ref> however research work continues to improve the performance of these actuators. The MBPA design is an extension of the single DBD actuator design which introduces additional dielectric barriers and electrodes, and thus additional design parameters.

The night was cold because of a stiff norther blowing in. The fire started in an abandoned house at the corner of Hardy and Opelousas. Gale-force winds carried embers southward igniting dozens of wood-shingle roofs. By dawn, the fire had spread all the way to Buffalo Bayou. It had jumped the bayou where the fire was finally stopped.

At the end of the second millenium before common era and with the introduction of the horse, Proto-Berbers from Northeastern Africa started to conquer the Western part of the Sahara. When the Sahara dried up some natives moved to the Sahel for a more humid climate while others, the ancestors of the Haratin stayed around the oases across the Sahara, such as the Draa valley region, where they have lived for centuries.<ref name=\"AppiahGates2010p549\"/><ref name=\"Gast2000\" />\n\nGenetic studies have shown that the Haratin forme a ethnic group distinct from Sub-Saharan African, Arab and Tuareg populations.<ref name=\"Gast2000\" /><ref name=\"Froment\"/><ref name=\"Colin\" /> However, in countries such as Morocco, they are sometimes classified either as Berber or Arab, depending on their language and society they are found in.<ref name=shoup115/> In Mauritania, however, where there are nearly 1.5 million Haratin, they have developed a separate sense of ethnic identity.<ref name=shoup115/>\n\nDuring the Roman occupation of [[Mauretania]], the Godala Berber tribe fled to the south towards the Draa oasis and enslaved the local Haratin population.<ref name=\"Ennaji1999\">{{cite book|last=Ennaji|first=Mohammed |title=Serving the Master: Slavery and Society in Nineteenth-century Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ii5wGwAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-75477-1|page=62}}</ref><ref name=\"Ilahiane1998\">{{cite book|author=Hsain Ilahiane|title=The Power of the Dagger, the Seeds of the Koran, and the Sweat of the Ploughman: Ethnic Stratification and Agricultural Intensification in the Ziz Valley, Southeast Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfjANwAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=University of Arizona|page=107}}</ref><ref name=\"Hamel2014\">{{cite book|author=Chouki El Hamel|title=Black Morocco: A History of Slavery, Race, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwogAwAAQBAJ|date=27 February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-62004-8|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref> They have historically inherited their slave status and family occupation, have been endogamous, and socially segregated.<ref name=\"AppiahGates2010p549\"/><ref name=meyers427/> Some communities differentiated two types of slaves, one called ''`Abid'' or \"slave\" and ''Haratin'' or \"freed slave\".

A 2009 investigative report by [[Human Rights Watch]] interviewed some dark-skinned Sahrawis, who are a small minority in the camps; they stated that some \"blacks\" are \"owned\" by \"whites\" but this ownership manifested only in \"granting\" marriage rights to girls. In other words, a dark-skinned girl must have an approval from her \"white master\". Without this the marriage can not be performed by a Qadi (Islamic Judge).<ref name=HRW/>\n\nThe report notes that POLISARIO claims to oppose any such discrimination, but raises questions about possible official collusion in, or indifference to, the practice. In addition, a case of an official document that grants freedom to a group of enslaved families has been found by HRW. The document in question dates as recently as 2007. The document was signed by a local judge or an official civil servant. Slavery is still engraved in memories due to historical and traditional reasons, and such cases are not as shocking as one might think to the society of the Sahrawi refugee camps.<ref name=HRW/> The Human Rights Watch concludes its chapter on slavery as follows, \"In sum, credible sources testified to Human Rights Watch about vestiges of slavery that continue to affect the lives of a portion of the black minority in the Tindouf camps. The practices involve historical ties between families that involve certain rights and obligations that are not always clear. Being a slave does not necessarily preclude enjoying freedom of movement.\"\n\nResponding to questions about slavery, the POLISARIO has acknowledged the survival \"to a limited extent, of certain practices related to antiquated thinking\" and said it was \"determined to combat and eradicate them whenever they emerge and no matter what shape they take.\" \"We welcome this statement and urge the POLISARIO to be vigilant in pursuing this objective,\" said HRW.<ref name=HRW>{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Western Sahara and the Tindouf Refugee Camps|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/77259/section/10|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last =Ilahiane | first =Hsain | publication-date =1998 | date = | title =The Power of the Dagger, the Seeds of the Koran, and the Sweat of the Ploughman: Ethnic Stratification and Agricultural Intensification in the Ziz Valley | edition = | series =Southeast Morocco | volume =107, 7 | publication-place =unpublished dissertation, Univ. of Arizona}}\n* {{cite book | last =El Hamel | first =Chouki | publication-date =Fall 2002 | date = | title =\"Race\", Slavery and Islam in the Maghribi Mediterranean Thought: The Question of the Haratin in Morocco | periodical =Journal of North African Studies | volume =29 | issue =38 | pages = | url =}}\n* {{cite book | last =Batr\u00e1n | first =Aziz Abdalla | date = | publication-date =1985 | contribution =The 'Ulam\u00e1 of Fas, Mulay Isma'il, and the Issue of the Haratin of Fas | contribution-url = | editor-last =John Ralph | editor-first =Willis | title =Slaves and Slavery in Muslim Africa | edition = | series = | place = | publication-place =London | publisher =Frank Cass | volume =1: Islam and the Ideology of Enslavement | pages =125\u201359  | url =}}\n* {{cite book | last =Ensel | first =Remco | publication-date =1999 | date = | title =Saints and Servants in Southern Morocco | publication-place =Leiden\n | place = | publisher =Brill | pages = }}\n*{{cite book | last =Hunwick | first =J O | date = | publication-date = | contribution =Black Slaves in the Mediterranean World: introduction to a Neglected Aspect of the African Diaspora | contribution-url = | title =Journal of African History}}\n* {{cite book | last =EnNaji | first =Mohammed | author-link = | last2 =Seth | first2 =Graebner | author2-link = | publication-date =1998 | date = | title =Serving The Master: Slavery & Society in Nineteenth-Century Morocco  | publisher =St. Martin\u2019s Press | page =62}}\n* AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, 7 November 2002, MAURITANIA, A future free from slavery?

A 2009 investigative report by [[Human Rights Watch]] interviewed some dark-skinned Sahrawis, who are a small minority in the camps; they stated that some \"blacks\" are \"owned\" by \"whites\" but this ownership manifested only in \"granting\" marriage rights to girls. In other words, a dark-skinned girl must have an approval from her \"white master\". Without this the marriage can not be performed by a Qadi (Islamic Judge).<ref name=HRW/>\n\nThe report notes that POLISARIO claims to oppose any such discrimination, but raises questions about possible official collusion in, or indifference to, the practice. In addition, a case of an official document that grants freedom to a group of enslaved families has been found by HRW. The document in question dates as recently as 2007. The document was signed by a local judge or an official civil servant. Slavery is still engraved in memories due to historical and traditional reasons, and such cases are not as shocking as one might think to the society of the Sahrawi refugee camps.<ref name=HRW/> The Human Rights Watch concludes its chapter on slavery as follows, \"In sum, credible sources testified to Human Rights Watch about vestiges of slavery that continue to affect the lives of a portion of the black minority in the Tindouf camps. The practices involve historical ties between families that involve certain rights and obligations that are not always clear. Being a slave does not necessarily preclude enjoying freedom of movement.\"\n\nResponding to questions about slavery, the POLISARIO has acknowledged the survival \"to a limited extent, of certain practices related to antiquated thinking\" and said it was \"determined to combat and eradicate them whenever they emerge and no matter what shape they take.\" \"We welcome this statement and urge the POLISARIO to be vigilant in pursuing this objective,\" said HRW.<ref name=HRW>{{cite web|title=Human Rights in Western Sahara and the Tindouf Refugee Camps|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/77259/section/10|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last =Ilahiane | first =Hsain | publication-date =1998 | date = | title =The Power of the Dagger, the Seeds of the Koran, and the Sweat of the Ploughman: Ethnic Stratification and Agricultural Intensification in the Ziz Valley | edition = | series =Southeast Morocco | volume =107, 7 | publication-place =unpublished dissertation, Univ. of Arizona}}\n* {{cite book | last =El Hamel | first =Chouki | publication-date =Fall 2002 | date = | title =\"Race\", Slavery and Islam in the Maghribi Mediterranean Thought: The Question of the Haratin in Morocco | periodical =Journal of North African Studies | volume =29 | issue =38 | pages = | url =}}\n* {{cite book | last =Batr\u00e1n | first =Aziz Abdalla | date = | publication-date =1985 | contribution =The 'Ulam\u00e1 of Fas, Mulay Isma'il, and the Issue of the Haratin of Fas | contribution-url = | editor-last =John Ralph | editor-first =Willis | title =Slaves and Slavery in Muslim Africa | edition = | series = | place = | publication-place =London | publisher =Frank Cass | volume =1: Islam and the Ideology of Enslavement | pages =125\u201359  | url =}}\n* {{cite book | last =Ensel | first =Remco | publication-date =1999 | date = | title =Saints and Servants in Southern Morocco | publication-place =Leiden\n | place = | publisher =Brill | pages = }}\n*{{cite book | last =Hunwick | first =J O | date = | publication-date = | contribution =Black Slaves in the Mediterranean World: introduction to a Neglected Aspect of the African Diaspora | contribution-url = | title =Journal of African History}}\n* {{cite book | last =EnNaji | first =Mohammed | author-link = | last2 =Seth | first2 =Graebner | author2-link = | publication-date =1998 | date = | title =Serving The Master: Slavery & Society in Nineteenth-Century Morocco  | publisher =St. Martin\u2019s Press | page =62}}\n* AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, 7 November 2002, MAURITANIA, A future free from slavery?

Within this cuisine, ingredients in European dishes are replaced or complemented by Asian ingredients. Conversely, European ingredients are used in Asian dishes.\n\nFor example, cream in European recipes is replaced by coconut cream and dried Chinese sausage ([[lap cheong]]) is used instead of chorizo.

While six houses were originally established, following the construction of two new dorms, two were added effective in the fall of 2007, bringing the total to eight: Ladd, Baxter, Quinby, MacMillan, Howell, Helmreich, Reed, and Burnett. The college houses are physical buildings around campus which host parties and other events throughout the year. Those students who choose not to live in their affiliated house retain their affiliation and are considered members throughout their Bowdoin career. Before the fraternity system was abolished in the 1990s, all the Bowdoin fraternities were co-educational (except for one unrecognized sorority and two unrecognized all-male fraternities).\nBowdoin's chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] was founded in 1825.

While six houses were originally established, following the construction of two new dorms, two were added effective in the fall of 2007, bringing the total to eight: Ladd, Baxter, Quinby, MacMillan, Howell, Helmreich, Reed, and Burnett. The college houses are physical buildings around campus which host parties and other events throughout the year. Those students who choose not to live in their affiliated house retain their affiliation and are considered members throughout their Bowdoin career. Before the fraternity system was abolished in the 1990s, all the Bowdoin fraternities were co-educational (except for one unrecognized sorority and two unrecognized all-male fraternities).\nBowdoin's chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] was founded in 1825. Those who have been inducted to the Maine chapter as undergraduates include [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] (1825), [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] (1825), [[Robert E. Peary]] (1877), [[Owen Brewster]] (1909), [[Harold Hitz Burton]] (1909), [[Paul Douglas]] (1913), [[Alfred Kinsey]] (1916), [[Thomas R. Pickering]] (1953), and [[Lawrence B.
