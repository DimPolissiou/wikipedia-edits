Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is \"found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution\". The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.<ref name=\"Freeden, Michael pp. 313\u2013314\"/> Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are the following:\n# The concentration on the [[individual]] and their will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others.<ref name=\"individualism\">\"En la vida de todo \u00fanico, todo v\u00ednculo, independientemente de la forma en que \u00e9ste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condici\u00f3n de persona libre.

First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God ... it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.\" [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many \"spooks\" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself.

Thus while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened [[altruists]]. This was to be based on [[utilitarian]] principles and he said: \"Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated\".<ref name=pj/> However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual \"private judgement\".

Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881\u20131908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Americana\"/><ref name=\"Hamilton 1995 79\"/><ref name=\"Faguet 1970 147\"/> Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation\"<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism''. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217</ref> and famously declared that \"[[property is theft]]!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{socialism sidebar}}\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called \"possession\").<ref>Swartz, Clarence Lee.

He further says: \"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\" and that \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,<ref name=\"thoreau\"/> [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle<ref name=thoreau/> and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.<ref name=\"naturismo\"/>\n\nThe essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].

This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DdHseFmQiSUC Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism.

People don't voluntarily work for wages or pay rent, except in the sense that most people \"voluntarily\" pay taxes, Because one recognizes when she or he is up against superior force, and chooses to compromise in order to survive, does not make these activities voluntary; at least, not in the way I envision voluntary relations in an anarchist society.\"</ref>\n\nThere is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an [[anti-capitalist]] movement and because anarchists see it as incompatible with capitalist forms.<ref>\"The philosophy of \"anarcho-capitalism\" dreamed up by the \"libertarian\" New Right, has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.\"[[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]].

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]] as most associated with [[Max Stirner]]. The third type is \"found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution\". The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market relationships.<ref name=\"Freeden, Michael pp. 313\u2013314\"/> Individualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are the following:\n# The concentration on the [[individual]] and their will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others.<ref name=\"individualism\">\"En la vida de todo \u00fanico, todo v\u00ednculo, independientemente de la forma en que \u00e9ste se presente, supone una cadena que condiciona, y por tanto elimina la condici\u00f3n de persona libre.

First amongst these is the abstraction \"Man\", into which all unique individuals are submerged and lost. As he put it, \"liberalism is a religion because it separates my essence from me and sets it above me, because it exalts 'Man' to the same extent as any other religion does to God ... it sets me beneath Man.\" Indeed, he \"who is infatuated with Man leaves persons out of account so far as that infatuation extends, and floats in an ideal, sacred interest. Man, you see, is not a person, but an ideal, a spook.\" [p. 176 and p. 79] Among the many \"spooks\" Stirner attacks are such notable aspects of capitalist life as private property, the division of labour, the state, religion, and (at times) society itself. We will discuss Stirner's critique of capitalism before moving onto his vision of an egoist society and how it relates to social anarchism.

To better understand the nature of these associations, which will replace the state, Stirner lists the relationships between friends, lovers, and children at play as examples.

As Stirner puts it, \"intercourse is mutuality, it is the action, the commercium, of individuals.\" [p.&nbsp;218] Its aim is \"pleasure\" and \"self-enjoyment.\" Thus Stirner sought a broad egoism, one which appreciated others and their uniqueness, and so criticised the narrow egoism of people who forgot the wealth others are:\n:\"But that would be a man who does not know and cannot appreciate any of the delights emanating from an interest taken in others, from the consideration shown to others.

Thus while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened [[altruists]].

Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin Tucker]].<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., \"On Picket Duty\", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881\u20131908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online p. 1</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by [[Joseph Dejacque]] in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist,<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Americana\"/><ref name=\"Hamilton 1995 79\"/><ref name=\"Faguet 1970 147\"/> Proudhon said that \"communism ... is the very denial of society in its foundation\"<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph.

BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} p. 217</ref> and famously declared that \"[[property is theft]]!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\n==== Mutualism ====\n{{socialism sidebar}}\n{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\nMutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].<ref>[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

He further says: \"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\" and that \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on [[green anarchism]], but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later [[Anarcho-naturism|naturist]] currents,<ref name=\"thoreau\"/> [[simple living]] as a rejection of a [[Economic materialism|materialist]] lifestyle<ref name=thoreau/> and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]], this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.<ref name=\"naturismo\"/>\n\nThe essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] (''Resistance to Civil Government'') was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such [[acquiescence]] to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].

This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, ''Liberty'' championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DdHseFmQiSUC Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism.

People don't voluntarily work for wages or pay rent, except in the sense that most people \"voluntarily\" pay taxes, Because one recognizes when she or he is up against superior force, and chooses to compromise in order to survive, does not make these activities voluntary; at least, not in the way I envision voluntary relations in an anarchist society.\"</ref>\n\nThere is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an [[anti-capitalist]] movement and because anarchists see it as incompatible with capitalist forms.<ref>\"The philosophy of \"anarcho-capitalism\" dreamed up by the \"libertarian\" New Right, has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.\"[[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]].

The three sets incorporated a number of different design features for evaluation, but were converted in 1994 to bring them in line with the full-production specifications.

Based on the 209-0 series, these trains have end doors for use in emergencies inside tunnels. These sets were based at JR East's Matsudo depot. These train sets have since been withdrawn from the Joban Line in October 2018 and reallocated to the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid)]] in December 2018, being based at JR East's Toyoda Depot after the reallocation. Operations officially started on the Chuo Line Rapid Service in March 2019.\n\nWhile these sets usually operate only between Tokyo and Takao, on rare occasions (such as a shortage of train sets on the Ome Line due to an accident) they may operate on the [[Ome Line]] as far as Ome station as a substitute. Furthermore, unlike the E233 series in use, due to the lack of passenger-operated door controls, all doors open on these sets while in use on the Ome Line.\n\n===Formation===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"border-bottom:solid 5px #F15A22;\"\n|style=\"background-color:#ccc;\"|&nbsp;\n|colspan=\"10\"|<div style=\"float:left;\">\u2190 T\u014dky\u014d</div><div style=\"float:right;\">\u014ctsuki \u2192</div>\n|-\n!

Based on the 209-0 series, these trains have end doors for use in emergencies inside tunnels. These sets were based at JR East's Matsudo depot. These train sets have since been withdrawn from the Joban Line in October 2018 and reallocated to the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid)]] in December 2018, being based at JR East's Toyoda Depot after the reallocation. Operations officially started on the Chuo Line Rapid Service in March 2019.\n\nWhile these sets usually operate only between Tokyo and Takao, on rare occasions (such as a shortage of train sets on the Ome Line due to an accident) they may operate on the [[Ome Line]] as far as Ome station as a substitute. Furthermore, unlike the E233 series in use, due to the lack of passenger-operated door controls, all doors open on these sets while in use on the Ome Line.\n\n===Formation===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"border-bottom:solid 5px #F15A22;\"\n|style=\"background-color:#ccc;\"|&nbsp;\n|colspan=\"10\"|<div style=\"float:left;\">\u2190 T\u014dky\u014d</div><div style=\"float:right;\">\u014ctsuki \u2192</div>\n|-\n!

In 2010 after almost exclusively fighting on the Dutch circuit, Sahak headed to [[Paris]] to face [[Abdarhmane Coulibaly]] for the W.P.M.F. European title, losing a decision to the home fighter after five rounds. He would make up for this disappointment the next year, winning the W.F.C.A. world title by [[knockout|KO'ing]] Yassin Boudrouz in the fourth round of their match in [[Belgium]]. In May 2011, Sahak faced [[Amir Zeyada]] for the [[List of It's Showtime champions|It's Showtime 85MAX]] world title, vacated by [[Melvin Manhoef]].

Chang is the chair of the [[National Society of Film Critics]] and the secretary of the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]]. In 2014, he received the inaugural [[African-American Film Critics Association Awards 2014#Special categories|Roger Ebert Award]] from the [[African-American Film Critics Association]].<ref name=\"LATbio\"/>\n\nWhile accepting the New Generation Award for ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards ceremony in January 2016, American film director and screenwriter [[Ryan Coogler]] praised Chang for his contributions to criticism. Coogler recalled attending the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2009 as a student filmmaker scrounging tickets and spending his down time in the ''Variety'' tent, where a \"crazy typing guy\" caught his attention:\n\n<blockquote>I would see people coming in and out, working. But it was this guy, going crazy on his laptop, and he would run off, and then he'd come back and go crazy on his laptop, and he would run off. He looked different from everybody else in the room, because he was Asian. So I was thinking, 'What's this Asian dude doing in here, typing away on his laptop, crazy?' He would type like a madman. He would type with a fury that I recognized, because that's how I type \u2014 with passion, when I'm trying to get words out. One day I asked, and they said, 'That's Justin. He's our critic.' It was crazy, because I said, 'Oh wow, this is the first time I've actually seen a critic work.' I read reviews, I would see [[Gene Siskel|Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert|Ebert]] on TV, I met critics' studies majors at my school, but I'd never seen a critic do the work.... I always remembered that.\n\nWhen I'd come back home, I said you know I'm going to read that crazy typing dude Justin's reviews and I'm gonna see if there's any other good movies at the festival that I've missed, and I read his review for a film called ''[[A Prophet]]''. While I was reading it, I realized this dude is crazy talented, liked I'd never seen. This is artistry. I had a newfound respect for what it is [film critics] do and its importance to the media. Reach back out into the community and find the next Justin Chang. Find the diversity. Find all those voices that are there in the places that you might not think to look.

Coogler recalled attending the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2009 as a student filmmaker scrounging tickets and spending his down time in the ''Variety'' tent, where a \"crazy typing guy\" caught his attention:\n\n<blockquote>I would see people coming in and out, working. But it was this guy, going crazy on his laptop, and he would run off, and then he'd come back and go crazy on his laptop, and he would run off. He looked different from everybody else in the room, because he was Asian. So I was thinking, 'What's this Asian dude doing in here, typing away on his laptop, crazy?' He would type like a madman. He would type with a fury that I recognized, because that's how I type \u2014 with passion, when I'm trying to get words out. One day I asked, and they said, 'That's Justin. He's our critic.' It was crazy, because I said, 'Oh wow, this is the first time I've actually seen a critic work.' I read reviews, I would see [[Gene Siskel|Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert|Ebert]] on TV, I met critics' studies majors at my school, but I'd never seen a critic do the work.... I always remembered that.\n\nWhen I'd come back home, I said you know I'm going to read that crazy typing dude Justin's reviews and I'm gonna see if there's any other good movies at the festival that I've missed, and I read his review for a film called ''[[A Prophet]]''. While I was reading it, I realized this dude is crazy talented, liked I'd never seen. This is artistry. I had a newfound respect for what it is [film critics] do and its importance to the media. Reach back out into the community and find the next Justin Chang. Find the diversity. Find all those voices that are there in the places that you might not think to look. Because it'd be amazing to see the next generation of [critics], and to have maybe more of them look like [Sue Kroll, president of [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]]], and more of them look like me and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Michael B.
