Shakur joined the Death Row label, under which he released the single \"California Love\".\n\nOn February 13, 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, ''All Eyez on Me''.

Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. [[Dr. Dre]] left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums ''[[Still I Rise (2PAC album)|Still I Rise]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (Tupac Shakur album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'', ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' and ''[[Pac's Life]]''. He also began the process of recording an album, ''One Nation'', with the New York-based [[Boot Camp Clik]] and their label Duck Down Records.\nOn June 4, 1996, he and Outlawz released the [[diss track]] \"[[Hit 'Em Up]]\", a scathing lyrical assault on [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with [[Faith Evans]], the wife of Wallace, and attacked [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]'s street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with [[Jimmy Henchman]], in ''Vibe'' magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter towards Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of [[Suge Knight]]; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Egbert |first=Bill |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704173248/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 4, 2010 |title=Hip Hype & Rival Rap, by Bill Egbert |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=February 27, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref> In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. made comments indicating that the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |title=Tupac And Biggie Would Have Reconciled, Naughty By Nature's Treach Says |date=June 16, 2010 |first=Mawuse |last=Ziegbe |publisher=MTV |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20015/title.lil-cease-says-tupac-and-notorious-b-i-g-would-have-ultimately-reconciled |title=Lil' Cease Says Tupac And Notorious B.I.G.

Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When Shakur signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] after his release from prison, he recruited step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]] and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on ''All Eyez on Me''. They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of Shakur and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on Shakur's second Death Row release ''The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory''. It was on this album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs. The idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name ''Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz'' although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\nOn forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader and/or an enemy of America.\n* [[Yaki Kadafi]], after Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]\n* [[Hussein Fatal]], after Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]]\n* [[Big Syke|Mussolini]] (formerly [[Big Syke]]), after Italian fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]\n* [[Mopreme Shakur|Komani]] (Shakur's step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]]), after [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]] leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ruhollah \"Ayatollah\" Khomeini]]\n* [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], after Cuban communist revolutionary and leader [[Fidel Castro]]\n* [[E.D.I. Mean]], after Ugandan president and dictator [[Idi Amin]]\n* [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], after the French general and emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n\nFor himself, Shakur created the alias \"Makaveli\" from [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] Italian philosopher and political theorist [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], whose writings inspired Shakur in prison, but who also preached that a leader could eliminate his enemies by all means necessary. He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311080759/http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2005 |title=Makaveil Records |publisher=2pacworld.co.uk |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nIn addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films.

Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. [[Dr. Dre]] left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums ''[[Still I Rise (2PAC album)|Still I Rise]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (Tupac Shakur album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'', ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' and ''[[Pac's Life]]''.

In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with [[Faith Evans]], the wife of Wallace, and attacked [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]'s street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with [[Jimmy Henchman]], in ''Vibe'' magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter towards Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of [[Suge Knight]]; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Egbert |first=Bill |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704173248/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 4, 2010 |title=Hip Hype & Rival Rap, by Bill Egbert |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=February 27, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref> In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. made comments indicating that the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |title=Tupac And Biggie Would Have Reconciled, Naughty By Nature's Treach Says |date=June 16, 2010 |first=Mawuse |last=Ziegbe |publisher=MTV |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20015/title.lil-cease-says-tupac-and-notorious-b-i-g-would-have-ultimately-reconciled |title=Lil' Cease Says Tupac And Notorious B.I.G.

Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When Shakur signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] after his release from prison, he recruited step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]] and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on ''All Eyez on Me''. They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of Shakur and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on Shakur's second Death Row release ''The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory''. It was on this album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs. The idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name ''Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz'' although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\nOn forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader and/or an enemy of America.\n* [[Yaki Kadafi]], after Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]\n* [[Hussein Fatal]], after Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]]\n* [[Big Syke|Mussolini]] (formerly [[Big Syke]]), after Italian fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]\n* [[Mopreme Shakur|Komani]] (Shakur's step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]]), after [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]] leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ruhollah \"Ayatollah\" Khomeini]]\n* [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], after Cuban communist revolutionary and leader [[Fidel Castro]]\n* [[E.D.I.

He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311080759/http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2005 |title=Makaveil Records |publisher=2pacworld.co.uk |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nIn addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films.

It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier.

''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.
