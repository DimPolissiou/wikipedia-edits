No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it is likely to have resulted from a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought.<ref name=\"coe\">Coe 1999, pp. 151\u2013155.</ref> During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and [[Uxmal]] show increased activity.<ref name=\"MartinGrube00p9\"/> Major cities in the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.<ref>Becker 2004, p.134.</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that the Maya population exceeded the [[carrying capacity]] of the environment, resulting in [[Land degradation|depleted agricultural resources]], [[deforestation]], and overhunting of [[megafauna]]. A 200-year long drought appears to have occurred around the same time.<ref>Beeland 2007.</ref> Classic Maya social organisation was based upon the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, with the ruler's freedom of action being limited to [[Traditional society|traditional responses]]. The rulers reacted in their culturally-bound manner, by intensifying such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This was counterproductive and only served to exacerbate [[systemic problem]]s.<ref>Demarest 2004, p. 246.</ref>\n\nBy the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of the system of rulership based around the divine power of the ruling lord. In the northern Yucat\u00e1n, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucat\u00e1n and central Pet\u00e9n, kingdoms generally declined; in western Pet\u00e9n and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities.<ref>Demarest 2004, p. 248.</ref> Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned.<ref>Martin and Grube 2000, p. 226.</ref> Relatively rapid collapse affected portions of the southern Maya area that included the southern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, northern Chiapas and Guatemala, and the area around Cop\u00e1n in Honduras. The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites. Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years.<ref name=\"Masson 2012, p. 18237\">Masson 2012, p. 18237.</ref>\n\nBy the late 8th century, endemic warfare had engulfed the [[Petexbat\u00fan]] region of Pet\u00e9n, resulting in the abandonment of Dos Pilas and [[Aguateca]].<ref>Coe 1999, p. 152.</ref> One by one, many once-great cities stopped sculpting dated monuments and were abandoned; the last monuments at Palenque, [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] and Yaxchilan were dated to between 795 and 810, over the following decades, Calakmul, [[Naranjo]], Cop\u00e1n, [[Caracol]] and Tikal all fell into obscurity. The last Long Count date was inscribed at [[Tonin\u00e1]] in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces.

After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of [[Mayapan]] in the 12th century. New cities arose near the Caribbean and Gulf coasts, and new trade networks were formed.<ref name=\"Masson2012p18238\"/>\n\nThe Postclassic Period was marked by a series of changes that distinguished its cities from those of the preceding Classic Period.<ref name=\"Arroyo01p38\">Arroyo 2001, p.38.</ref> The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after a period of continuous occupation that spanned almost two thousand years.<ref name=\"SharerTraxler06p618\">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.618.</ref> This was symptomatic of changes that were sweeping across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, with long-occupied cities in exposed locations relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of [[Maya warfare|warfare]].

The project applied [[Lidar|Lidar technology]] on an area of 2,100 square kilometers in the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] region of Guatemala. Unlike previous assumptions, thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] inhabited in northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like [[Tikal]] were bigger than previously assumed. Houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications were unearthed because of the Lidar. According to the archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is \"one of the greatest advances in over 150 years of Maya archaeology\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Maya network discovered under Guatemala jungle|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC NEWS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/|title=This Ancient Civilization Was Twice As Big As Medieval England|date=2018-02-01|website=National Geographic News|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\nThe capital of \u00a0[[Plan de Ayutla (Maya site)|Sak Tz\u2019i\u2019]] (an Ancient Maya kingdom) now named Lacanja Tzeltal, was revealed by researchers led by associate anthropology professor Charles Golden and bioarchaeologist Andrew Scherer in the Chiapas in the backyard of a Mexican farmer in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagedaily.com/2020/03/archaeologists-discover-lost-capital-of-ancient-maya-kingdom/126361|title=Archaeologists discover lost capital of ancient Maya Kingdom|date=2020-03-12|website=HeritageDaily - Archaeology News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1254403/Archaeology-news-Ancient-Maya-kingdom-discovery-Mexico-cattle-ranch|title=Archaeology breakthrough: Ancient Maya kingdom discovered in... a rancher's backyard|last=Kettley|first=Sebastian|date=2020-03-13|website=Express.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\nMultiple domestic constructions used by the population for religious purposes. \u201cPlaza Muk\u2019ul Ton\u201d or Monuments Plaza where people used to gather for ceremonies was also unearthed by the team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2020-03-ancient-maya-kingdom-unearthed-backyard.html|title=Ancient Maya kingdom unearthed in a backyard in Mexico|website=phys.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/maya-kingdom-0013407|title=Long Lost Maya Kingdom Unearthed On Mexican Cattle Ranch|last=ancient-origins|website=www.ancient-origins.net|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n:{{Cite book |author1=Acemoglu, Daron |author2=James A.

A 200-year long drought appears to have occurred around the same time.<ref>Beeland 2007.</ref> Classic Maya social organisation was based upon the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, with the ruler's freedom of action being limited to [[Traditional society|traditional responses]]. The rulers reacted in their culturally-bound manner, by intensifying such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This was counterproductive and only served to exacerbate [[systemic problem]]s.<ref>Demarest 2004, p. 246.</ref>\n\nBy the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of the system of rulership based around the divine power of the ruling lord. In the northern Yucat\u00e1n, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucat\u00e1n and central Pet\u00e9n, kingdoms generally declined; in western Pet\u00e9n and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities.<ref>Demarest 2004, p. 248.</ref> Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned.<ref>Martin and Grube 2000, p. 226.</ref> Relatively rapid collapse affected portions of the southern Maya area that included the southern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, northern Chiapas and Guatemala, and the area around Cop\u00e1n in Honduras.

To find unidentified ruins, researchers have turned to [[satellite imagery]], in order to look at the visible and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared spectra]]. Due to their limestone construction, the monuments affected the chemical makeup of the soil as they deteriorated; some moisture-loving plants are entirely absent, while others were killed off or discoloured.<ref>NASA Earth Observatory.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, the distinguished Mayanist [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] promoted the ideas that Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests.<ref name=\"Demarest 2004, p. 44\">Demarest 2004, p. 44.</ref> These ideas arose from the limited understanding of Maya script at the time;<ref name=\"Demarest 2004, p. 44\"/> they began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by [[Heinrich Berlin]], [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], and [[Yuri Knorozov]].<ref>Demarest 2004, p. 45.</ref> As breakthroughs in the understanding of Maya script were made from the 1950s onwards, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and the view of the Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported.<ref>Foster 2002, p. 8.</ref> Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations, putting an end to the vacant ceremonial centre model.<ref>Demarest 2004, pp. 49\u201351.</ref>\n\nIn 2018, 60.000 uncharted structures were revealed by archaeologists with the help of the revolutionary technology lasers called '[[lidar]]' in northern [[Guatemala]]. The project applied [[Lidar|Lidar technology]] on an area of 2,100 square kilometers in the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] region of Guatemala. Unlike previous assumptions, thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] inhabited in northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D. Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities like [[Tikal]] were bigger than previously assumed. Houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications were unearthed because of the Lidar. According to the archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is \"one of the greatest advances in over 150 years of Maya archaeology\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Maya network discovered under Guatemala jungle|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC NEWS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/|title=This Ancient Civilization Was Twice As Big As Medieval England|date=2018-02-01|website=National Geographic News|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\nThe capital of \u00a0[[Plan de Ayutla (Maya site)|Sak Tz\u2019i\u2019]] (an Ancient Maya kingdom) now named Lacanja Tzeltal, was revealed by researchers led by associate anthropology professor Charles Golden and bioarchaeologist Andrew Scherer in the Chiapas in the backyard of a Mexican farmer in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagedaily.com/2020/03/archaeologists-discover-lost-capital-of-ancient-maya-kingdom/126361|title=Archaeologists discover lost capital of ancient Maya Kingdom|date=2020-03-12|website=HeritageDaily - Archaeology News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1254403/Archaeology-news-Ancient-Maya-kingdom-discovery-Mexico-cattle-ranch|title=Archaeology breakthrough: Ancient Maya kingdom discovered in... a rancher's backyard|last=Kettley|first=Sebastian|date=2020-03-13|website=Express.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\nMultiple domestic constructions used by the population for religious purposes. \u201cPlaza Muk\u2019ul Ton\u201d or Monuments Plaza where people used to gather for ceremonies was also unearthed by the team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2020-03-ancient-maya-kingdom-unearthed-backyard.html|title=Ancient Maya kingdom unearthed in a backyard in Mexico|website=phys.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/maya-kingdom-0013407|title=Long Lost Maya Kingdom Unearthed On Mexican Cattle Ranch|last=ancient-origins|website=www.ancient-origins.net|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}\n:{{Cite book |author1=Acemoglu, Daron |author2=James A.

Work started on the line in April 1843 and the line and its stations were opened on 1 May 1844. Reedham station opened with the line and was, as it is now, situated east of Cantley station and west of Berney Arms station. The Y&NR was the first public railway line in Norfolk.\nOn 30 June 1845 a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Y&NR with the [[Norwich & Brandon Railway]] came into effect and Reedham station became a Norfolk Railway asset.<ref name=Butt /><ref>C.J. Allen {{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845 an Act incorporated the Lowestoft Railway & Harbour Company (LR&HC). In 1846 the LR&HC was leased to the Norfolk Railway (NR) and work started on building a line from Lowestoft, in Suffolk to join the Yarmouth & Norwich line South-East of Reedham. On 1 July 1847 the NR opens the Lowestoft to Reedham line. The station south-east of Reedham on the line to Lowestoft was Haddiscoe.\n\nA couple of months after the Lowestoft line opened, the next station west, {{rws|Cantley}}, was closed by the Norfolk Railway.\n\nThe [[Eastern Counties Railway]] (ECR) and its rival the [[Eastern Union Railway]] (EUR) were both sizing up the NR to acquire and expand their railway empire. The ECR trumped the EUR by taking over the NR, including Reedham Station on 8 May 1848.\n\nThe ECR reopened Cantley in 1851, once again making it the next station west.\n\nBy the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway, which wished to amalgamate formally but could not obtain government agreement for this until an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862, when the [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER) was formed by the amalgamation. Actually, Reedham became a GER station on 1 July 1862 when the GER took over the ECR and the EUR before the Bill received the Royal Assent.<ref>CJ Allen - Great Eastern - page46</ref>\n\nBy the first decade of the last Century the GER started building new stations at Reedham and at Haddiscoe. On 9 May 1904 Haddiscoe Station was closed and replaced by Haddiscoe Low Level on a new site. On 1 June 1904 the GER opened today's Reedham Station and closed the Y&NR station which was 300 metres East of the new station.\n\nThe system settled down for the next 17 years, apart from the disruption of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The difficult economic circumstances that existed after the war led the Government to pass the [[Railways Act 1921]], which led to the creation of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|Big Four]]. The GER amalgamated with several other companies to form the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER). Reedham became a LNER station on 1 January 1923.\n\nIn 1928 the LNER renamed Reedham as ''Reedham (Norfolk)'' to distinguish it from the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway)]] station of [[Reedham (Surrey) railway station|Reedham-Surrey]].\n\nAt [[Transport Act 1947|nationalisation]] in 1948, the station and its services were transferred to the [[Eastern Region of British Railways]].\n\nFollowing the [[privatisation of British Rail]], [[Railtrack]] became responsible for infrastructure maintenance in 1994. Following Railtrack's financial problems [[Network Rail]] took over operation of the infrastructure in 2002.\n\nThe station and its operations came under the [[Anglia Railways]] franchise in 1997. Subsequently, [[National Express East Anglia]], then known as ''One'', took over management in 2004.\n\nThe station, along with its services, were transferred to [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Abellio Greater Anglia]] in 2012.\n\nIn October 2018, Network Rail remodelled the Reedham Junction layout and begun the resignalling process, temporarily closing the Berney Arms line to Great Yarmouth.
