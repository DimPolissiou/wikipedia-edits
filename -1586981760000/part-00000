Prominent members of this group were [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], and [[Thomas Nashe]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and [[John Lyly]], [[Thomas Lodge]], and [[George Peele]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. [[Thomas Kyd]] is also sometimes included in the group, though he is not believed to have studied at university.\n\nThis diverse and talented loose association of London writers and dramatists set the stage for the theatrical Renaissance of Elizabethan England. They are identified as among the earliest professional writers in English, and prepared the way for the writings of [[William Shakespeare]], who was born just two months after [[Christopher Marlowe]].\n\n==Term==\n[[File:George Saintsbury Lafayette.jpg|thumb|George Saintsbury, who coined the term \"university wits\"]]\nThe term \"University Wits\" was not used in their lifetime, but was coined by [[George Saintsbury]], a 19th-century journalist and author.<ref name = \"jen\">Sager, Jenny \"Melnikoff, Ed., Robert Greene\", ''Early Modern Literary Studies''. Volume: 16. Issue: 1</ref> Saintsbury argues that the \"rising sap\" of dramatic creativity in the 1580s showed itself in two separate \"branches of the national tree\":\n\n<blockquote>In the first place, we have the group of university wits, the strenuous if not always wise band of professed men of letters, at the head of whom are Lyly, Marlowe, Greene, Peele, Lodge, Nash, and probably (for his connection with the universities is not certainly known) Kyd. In the second, we have the irregular band of outsiders, players and others, who felt themselves forced into literary and principally dramatic composition, who boast Shakespeare as their chief, and who can claim as seconds to him not merely the imperfect talents of Chettle, Munday, and others whom we may mention in this chapter, but many of the perfected ornaments of a later time.<ref name = \"geo\">George Saintsbury, ''History of Elizabethan Literature'', MacMillan, London, 1887, pp.60-64</ref> </blockquote>\n\nSaintsbury argues that the Wits drew on the ploddingly academic verse-drama of [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]], and the crude but lively popular entertainments of \"miscellaneous farce-and-interlude-writers\", to create the first truly powerful dramas in English. The University Wits, \"with Marlowe at their head, made the blank verse line for dramatic purposes, dismissed, cultivated as they were, the cultivation of classical models, and gave English tragedy its Magna Charta of freedom and submission to the restrictions of actual life only\". However, they failed \"to achieve perfect life-likeness\".<ref name = \"geo\"/> It was left to \"the actor-playwrights who, rising from very humble beginnings, but possessing in their fellow Shakespeare a champion unparalleled in ancient and modern times, borrowed the improvements of the university wits, added their own stage knowledge, and with Shakespeare's aid achieved the master drama of the world.\"<ref name = \"geo\"/>\n\nThe term \"University Wits\" was taken up by many writers in the 20th century to refer to the group of authors listed by Saintsbury, often using his basic model of dramatic development. [[Adolphus William Ward]] in ''The Cambridge History of English Literature'' (1932) has a chapter on \"The Plays of the University Wits\", in which he argues that a \"pride in university training which amounted to arrogance\" was combined with \"really valuable ideas and literary methods\".<ref>''The Cambridge History of English Literature'': General index, Volume 15, p.9</ref> In 1931, [[Allardyce Nicoll]] wrote that \"it was left to the so-called University Wits to make the classical tragedy popular and the popular tragedy unified in construction and conscious of its aim.\"<ref>Allardyce Nicoll, ''The Theory of Drama'', Thomas Y. Crowell, 1931, p.165</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Dido1594titlepage.jpg|thumb|title page of ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'', co-written by Marlowe and Nashe]]\nEdward Albert in his ''History of English Literature'' (1979) argues that the plays of the University Wits had several features in common:\n\n<blockquote>(a) There was a fondness for heroic themes, such as the lives of great figures like Mohammed and Tamburlaine.\n\n(b) Heroic themes needed heroic treatment: great fullness and variety; splendid descriptions, long swelling speeches, the handling of violent incidents and emotions. These qualities, excellent when held in restraint, only too often led to loudness and disorder.\n\n(c) The style was also \u2018heroic\u2019. The chief aim was to achieve strong and sounding lines, magnificent epithets, and powerful declamation. This again led to abuse and to mere bombast, mouthing, and in the worst cases to nonsense. In the best examples, such as in Marlowe, the result is quite impressive. In this connexion it is to be noted that the best medium for such expression was blank verse, which was sufficiently elastic to bear the strong pressure of these expansive methods.\n\n(d) The themes were usually tragic in nature, for the dramatists were as a rule too much in earnest to give heed to what was considered to be the lower species of comedy. The general lack of real humour in the early drama is one of its most prominent features. Humour, when it is brought in at all, is coarse and immature. Almost the only representative of the writers of real comedies is Lyly.<ref>Edward Albert, ''History of English Literature'', Oxford University Press, 1979, p.89.</ref></blockquote>\n\nG. K.

K. Hunter, ''English Drama 1586-1642: The Age of Shakespeare'', Clarendon, 1997, p.24.</ref>\n\nWhile Marlowe is the most famous dramatist among them, Robert Greene and Thomas Nashe were better known for their controversial, risqu\u00e9 and argumentative pamphlets, creating an early form of journalism.

However, many scholars believe that the pamphlet was in fact written by [[Henry Chettle]], a writer listed by Saintsbury as one of the \"irregular band of outsiders\" supposedly resented by the Wits.<ref>Schoone-Jongen, Terence G., ''Shakespeare\u2019s Companies'', Ashgate Publishing, 2008, p. 28.</ref> In the pamphlet \"Greene\" tells fellow-writers \u2014 generally assumed to be Peele, Marlowe and Nashe \u2014 to watch out for an upstart who is \"beautified with our feathers\".\n\nJenny Sager argues that \"From its conception the term 'University Wits' has provided generations of critics with a sounding board from which to articulate their attitudes towards modern academia\", often setting the supposedly snobbish Wits against Shakespeare and others as representatives of unlettered talent.<ref name = \"jen\"/> Jeffrey Knapp argues that some authors have imagined an \"all out war\" between authors and actors, initiated by the Wits.

The [[parish church]], [[St Cadoc's Church, Caerleon|St Cadoc's]] was founded on the site of the legionary headquarters building probably sometime in the 6th century. A [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-style [[motte and bailey]] [[castle]] was built outside the eastern corner of the old Roman fort, possibly by the Welsh Lord of Caerleon, [[Caradog ap Gruffydd]]. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 recorded that a small colony of eight [[carucates]] of land (about 1.5 square miles) in the jurisdiction of Caerleon, seemingly just within the Welsh Lordship of [[Gwynllwg]], was held by [[Turstin FitzRolf]], standard bearer to William the Conqueror at Hastings, subject to [[William d'Ecouis]], a magnate of unknown antecedents with lands in Hereford, Norfolk and other counties.<ref name=domesday>{{Cite web|url=http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/|title=The Domesday Book Online - Home|website=www.domesdaybook.co.uk}}</ref> Also listed on the manor were three Welshmen with as many ploughs and carucates, who continued their Welsh customs (''leges Walensi viventes'').<ref name=domesday/> Caerleon itself may have remained in Welsh hands, or may have changed hands frequently.<ref name=\"caerbaer\">Jermyn, Anthony. \"[http://www.acanterthroughcaerleon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=58 4: Caerleon Through the Centuries to the Year 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620143235/http://www.acanterthroughcaerleon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=58 |date=20 June 2013}}\". 2010 Accessed 13 Feb 2013.</ref>\n\nFrom the apparent banishment of Turstin by William II, Turstin's lands were transferred in 1088 by [[Wynebald de Ballon]], brother of [[Hamelin de Ballon]] who held [[Abergavenny]] further up the River Usk.

Caerleon was an important market and port and possibly became a [[borough]] by 1171, although no independent charters exist. In 1171 Iorwerth ab Owain and his two sons destroyed the town of Caerleon and burned the Castle. Both castle and borough were seized by [[William Marshal]] from [[Morgan ap Hywel]] in 1217 and Caerleon castle was rebuilt in stone. The remains of many of the old Roman buildings stood to some height until this time and were probably demolished for their building materials.\n\n===Welsh Revolt===\n[[File:Caerleon-Round Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Round Tower at The Hanbury Arms in 2010]]\n\nDuring the [[Glynd\u0175r Rising|Welsh Revolt]] in 1402 [[Rhys Gethin]], General for [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], took Caerleon Castle together with those of Newport, Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly and Usk by force.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = The Bull Inn, Caerleon, June 2007 | url = http://www.thebellatcaerleon.co.uk/info/glyndwr.htm | title = Owain Glyndwr, The Bell at Caerleon | accessdate = 9 October 2008}}</ref> This was probably the last time Caerleon castle was ruined, though the walls were still standing in 1537 and the castle ruins only finally collapsed in 1739 - their most obvious remnant is the Round Tower at the Hanbury Arms public house.

Until the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] development of the downstream docks at [[Newport Docks]], Caerleon acted as the major port on the River Usk. The wharf was located on the right bank, to the west of today's river bridge which marked the limit of navigability for masted ships.

The jaw of the skull could be made to move, with the aid of rods. Hando's informant, Gus Sergeant of Bulmoor, reported that the Mari Lwyd had not been seen in the town for at least 20 years, but he was still able to describe it:\n<blockquote>\n\"We filled the eye-holes with wadding and '[[Marble (toy)|pop alleys]]' and fixed great ears made of wadding stiffened with cardboard; then we stuck rosettes on the sides of the skull and strung long coloured ribbons as reins.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nOne man acted as leader of the Mari, holding the ribbons, and then came the Mari itself draped in a white sheet. It was followed by three singers, who sang in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] although \"they didn't understand the words\". On occasion, the procession of the Mari Lwyd would start as far north as [[Newbridge-on-Usk]] and proceed through the town, ending as far south as [[Goldcliff]]. The party would be invited into houses along the way and given \"money and home-made cakes and gallons of beer\". Another of Hando's informants provides a description, dated 1841, of the Yuletide tradition:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The custom of chaunting at their neighbours' doors on the [[twelfth night]] ... on which occasion they are fantastically dressed with ribbons of various colours. One of the party carries a horse's head decorated in the same manner. Representations of trees, to which are appended apples and oranges, are also carried about, and on one of the branches an artificial bird, called \"Aderyn Pica Llwyd\" (the grey hobgoblin bird) is placed.\"<ref>[[Fred Hando|Hando, F.J.]], (1951) \"Journeys in Gwent\", R.

The jaw of the skull could be made to move, with the aid of rods. Hando's informant, Gus Sergeant of Bulmoor, reported that the Mari Lwyd had not been seen in the town for at least 20 years, but he was still able to describe it:\n<blockquote>\n\"We filled the eye-holes with wadding and '[[Marble (toy)|pop alleys]]' and fixed great ears made of wadding stiffened with cardboard; then we stuck rosettes on the sides of the skull and strung long coloured ribbons as reins.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nOne man acted as leader of the Mari, holding the ribbons, and then came the Mari itself draped in a white sheet. It was followed by three singers, who sang in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] although \"they didn't understand the words\". On occasion, the procession of the Mari Lwyd would start as far north as [[Newbridge-on-Usk]] and proceed through the town, ending as far south as [[Goldcliff]]. The party would be invited into houses along the way and given \"money and home-made cakes and gallons of beer\". Another of Hando's informants provides a description, dated 1841, of the Yuletide tradition:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The custom of chaunting at their neighbours' doors on the [[twelfth night]] ... on which occasion they are fantastically dressed with ribbons of various colours. One of the party carries a horse's head decorated in the same manner. Representations of trees, to which are appended apples and oranges, are also carried about, and on one of the branches an artificial bird, called \"Aderyn Pica Llwyd\" (the grey hobgoblin bird) is placed.\"<ref>[[Fred Hando|Hando, F.J.]], (1951) \"Journeys in Gwent\", R.

In addition to the manufacture of textiles there were several large factories making textile machinery. These included [[Dean, Smith & Grace]], [[Geo. Hattersley|George Hattersley & Son]] and Prince, Smith & Stell. The first of these operated as a manufacturer of CNC machine tools, particularly precision [[lathe]]s, until 2008.\n\nThe 1842 [[Leeds]] Directory description of Keighley reads \"Its parish had no dependent townships though it is about {{convert|6|mi|spell=in}} long and {{convert|4|mi|spell=in}} broad, and comprises {{convert|10160|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land (including a peaty moor of about {{convert|2000|acres|sigfig=1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and a population which amounted, in the year 1801, to 5,745.\"\n\nThe town was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] on 28 July 1882 under the provisions of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].    In 1938 the boundaries of the borough and civil parish of Keighley were expanded to include the former urban districts and civil parishes of [[Haworth]], [[Oakworth]] and [[Oxenhope]] along with the parish of [[East Morton|Morton]] from the abolished [[Keighley Rural District]] and a small part of the [[Bingley]] urban district.\n\nOn 1 April 1974 Keighley borough became part of the [[City of Bradford|City of Bradford Metropolitan District]] in accordance with the [[Local Government Act 1972]] in the newly formed county of [[West Yorkshire]]. The merger caused a lot of bitterness among Keighley people who resented being 'taken over' by Bradford and accused the city's council of neglecting the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.keighleynews.co.uk/news/8040095.Keighley_grappling_to_find_Voice_for_the_future/|title=Keighley grappling to find Voice for the future|work=[[Keighley News]]|date=9 July 2001|access-date=7 December 2017}}</ref> Civil parish status was restored to Keighley in 2002,<ref name=makeshistory>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8027817.Town_council_makes_history/|title=Town council makes history|work=[[Telegraph & Argus]]|date=24 May 2002|access-date=7 December 2017}}</ref> providing it with its own [[Town Council#United Kingdom|town council]].

Its northern boundary is with [[Bradley, North Yorkshire|Bradley]] and its southern limit is the edge of [[Oxenhope]]. To the west, the town advances up the hill to the suburb of Black Hill and in the east it terminates at the residential neighbourhoods of [[Long Lee]] and Thwaites Brow. The outlying northeastern suburb of [[Riddlesden]] is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a separate village but is part of the town.\n\nPast Black Hill and via Braithwaite Edge Road lies Braithwaite village which leads to [[Laycock, West Yorkshire|Laycock]], which was mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]''. Laycock is a conservation area which overlooks the hamlet of Goose Eye.\n\nThe [[River Aire]] passes through north eastern Keighley, dividing the neighbourhood of Stockbridge and running roughly parallel to the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The Worth links up with the Aire in Stockbridge and runs south-westerly, dividing eastern Keighley from central and western districts of the town. The Worth is lined with abandoned, semi-derelict industrial sites and tracts of waste ground dating from the period when Keighley thrived as a major textile centre.\n\nParts of Keighley are prone to flooding and the town was particularly badly hit by floods in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8049696.Flood__Hundreds_homeless_as_floods_hit/|title=Flood: Hundreds Homeless as Floods Hit|work=[[Telegraph & Argus]]|date=3 November 2000|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.keighleynews.co.uk/news/8049840.Floods_could_cost_millions/|title=Floods Could Cost Millions|work=[[Keighley News]]|date=1 November 2000|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref> Since then, millions have been spent on strengthening flood defences.\n\nOther outlying villages around the town are [[Oakworth]], [[Cross Roads, West Yorkshire|Cross Roads]], [[Haworth]], [[Stanbury]] and [[Oxenhope]]. The two main settlements to the north are [[Silsden]] and [[Steeton, West Yorkshire|Steeton]]. Although these villages are often referred to as separate places they are part of the wider Keighley area.

The Airedale shopping centre, is a large indoor [[Shopping mall|shopping precinct]] which houses most of the town's high street retail chains. There are several budget supermarkets situated in small retail parks around the town. Keighley benefits from an [[Railway electrification system|electrified railway]] service with connections to Leeds, Bradford, Shipley, Bingley, Skipton, Carlisle and Morecambe. The [[Keighley and Worth Valley railway]] is a [[Heritage railway|heritage steam railway]], which links the town with Haworth, Oakworth, Oxenhope and the Bronte Country.

It has churches and places of worship for [[Anglicans]], [[Methodists]], [[United Reformed Church|United Reformed]], [[Mormons]], [[Quakers]], [[Salvation Army]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Keighley has a significant [[Roman Catholic]] minority re-established following the repeal of the penal laws. The Catholic population was boosted in the mid-19th century with the arrival of Irish immigrants escaping the 1840s [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]] who came to work in the textile and weaving industries. Keighley has two Roman Catholic churches (St Anne's \u2013 1840 and St Joseph's \u2013 1934) and four [[Roman Catholic]] schools (St Anne's \u2013 1857, St Joseph's \u2013 1922, Our Lady of Victories \u2013 1960 and Holy Family \u2013 1964).\n\nThe first [[Spiritualists' National Union|spiritualist]] church in Britain was founded at Keighley in 1853 by David Richmond,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snu.org.uk/Spiritualism/history.htm |title=History of Modern Spiritualism |accessdate=24 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217001645/http://snu.org.uk/Spiritualism/history.htm |archivedate=17 February 2009  }}</ref> who although not originally from the town, stayed for many years and helped to establish the movement throughout the country. Spiritualism was at its height during Victorian times and Keighley Spiritualist church remains open.\n[[File:Emily Street Mosque - geograph.org.uk - 1401593.jpg|thumb|right|Emily Street Mosque]]\n[[Muslim]]s make up the second largest religious group in the town. According to the 2011 census there were more than 12,400 Muslims in Keighley in March of that year. Most had started coming to Britain in the 1960s from the [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]] region of [[Azad Kashmir]], in [[Pakistan]], and the [[Sylhet]] region of [[Bangladesh]]. As of 2013 there were eight mosques in Keighley, including the purpose-built Markazi Jamia Masjid ('Central Community Mosque') in Emily Street and the purpose-built Jamia Masjid Ghosiyah (Ghosiyah Community Mosque - named after the saint [[Abdul Qadir Gilani|Abdul Qadir Jilani]]), on Skipton Road. The rest are buildings which have been converted into Mosques with the oldest being the Shahjalal Jami Masjid and Jamiah Quraniah (ShahJalal Community Mosque and Quran Teaching School - named after the saint [[Shah Jalal]]), on Temple Row, which was previously the [[Wesleyan theology|Wesleyan]] Methodist Church, 1845-46.\n\nThere is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] centre on Lawkholme Crescent, in the town centre. The Keighley Kadampa Buddhist Centre is used by lay and ordained Buddhist practitioners and also runs day and evening classes for newcomers to the faith.\n\n== Architecture ==\nLike many other British towns and cities, Keighley was extensively remodelled in the 1960s and lost many historic buildings.

Keighley has three large supermarkets, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Asda. The Airedale shopping centre, is a large indoor [[Shopping mall|shopping precinct]] which houses most of the town's high street retail chains. There are several budget supermarkets situated in small retail parks around the town. Keighley benefits from an [[Railway electrification system|electrified railway]] service with connections to Leeds, Bradford, Shipley, Bingley, Skipton, Carlisle and Morecambe. The [[Keighley and Worth Valley railway]] is a [[Heritage railway|heritage steam railway]], which links the town with Haworth, Oakworth, Oxenhope and the Bronte Country. Keighley has one cinema, [[Keighley Picture House|The Picture House]] on North Street which was restored from derelict condition in 1996 by Northern Morris Associated Cinemas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keighley.nm-cinemas.co.uk |title=Northern Morris Associated Cinemas}}\n</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:All Saints Church - Highfield Lane - geograph.org.uk - 1008149.jpg|thumb|right|All Saints Church]]\nKeighley has a [[parish church]] Keighley Shared Church<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keighleysharedchurch.org.uk |title=Keighley Shared Church}}</ref> and is home to many [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations.

Keighley has a significant [[Roman Catholic]] minority re-established following the repeal of the penal laws. The Catholic population was boosted in the mid-19th century with the arrival of Irish immigrants escaping the 1840s [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]] who came to work in the textile and weaving industries. Keighley has two Roman Catholic churches (St Anne's \u2013 1840 and St Joseph's \u2013 1934) and four [[Roman Catholic]] schools (St Anne's \u2013 1857, St Joseph's \u2013 1922, Our Lady of Victories \u2013 1960 and Holy Family \u2013 1964).\n\nThe first [[Spiritualists' National Union|spiritualist]] church in Britain was founded at Keighley in 1853 by David Richmond,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snu.org.uk/Spiritualism/history.htm |title=History of Modern Spiritualism |accessdate=24 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217001645/http://snu.org.uk/Spiritualism/history.htm |archivedate=17 February 2009  }}</ref> who although not originally from the town, stayed for many years and helped to establish the movement throughout the country.

According to the 2011 census there were more than 12,400 Muslims in Keighley in March of that year. Most had started coming to Britain in the 1960s from the [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]] region of [[Azad Kashmir]], in [[Pakistan]], and the [[Sylhet]] region of [[Bangladesh]]. As of 2013 there were eight mosques in Keighley, including the purpose-built Markazi Jamia Masjid ('Central Community Mosque') in Emily Street and the purpose-built Jamia Masjid Ghosiyah (Ghosiyah Community Mosque - named after the saint [[Abdul Qadir Gilani|Abdul Qadir Jilani]]), on Skipton Road. The rest are buildings which have been converted into Mosques with the oldest being the Shahjalal Jami Masjid and Jamiah Quraniah (ShahJalal Community Mosque and Quran Teaching School - named after the saint [[Shah Jalal]]), on Temple Row, which was previously the [[Wesleyan theology|Wesleyan]] Methodist Church, 1845-46.\n\n\nThere is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] centre on Lawkholme Crescent, in the town centre. The Keighley Kadampa Buddhist Centre is used by lay and ordained Buddhist practitioners and also runs day and evening classes for newcomers to the faith.\n\n== Architecture ==\nLike many other British towns and cities, Keighley was extensively remodelled in the 1960s and lost many historic buildings. However, the town managed to retain some of its heritage and has many [[Victorian era|Victorian]] buildings. The local [[gritstone|millstone grit]] gives many of the buildings a distinctive look.\n\n[[East Riddlesden Hall]], [[Cliffe Castle Museum]] and Whinburn Mansion are fine, [[country house]]s. There are large town houses along [[Skipton]] Road which contrast with the cramped rows of terraces in the streets behind them.\n\nThe town's central library was the first [[Carnegie library]] in England opened in 1904 with a grant of \u00a310,000 from [[Andrew Carnegie]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bradlibs.com/k100/about/index.htm |title=Keighley Public Library |accessdate=24 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106145841/http://www.bradlibs.com/k100/about/index.htm |archive-date=6 January 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The library has undergone refurbishment which was completed in 2007.
