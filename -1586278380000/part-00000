They are the two best-known faces of the band.  The band is popular in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, and has toured in the U.S. with [[The Verve Pipe]], [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]], [[Alanis Morissette]] and the [[Indigo Girls]], as well as on their own.\n\n===Solo===\n\nBettens' first solo effort was a mini-album called ''[[Go (Sam Bettens EP)|Go]]''. His first full-length solo album, ''[[Scream (Sam Bettens album)|Scream]]'', was released in Europe on 14 March 2005, and in the USA on 23 August 2005.\n\nIn March 2007, Bettens released an EP through online music label [[Fuzz (music company)|Fuzz]]. His second full-length album, ''Shine'', including new mixes of the tracks from the Fuzz EP, was released in 2007. It was produced by [[Brad Wood]]. The full CD was distributed for free with 13 October edition of the Flemish newspaper [[De Morgen]] in [[Belgium]], which sold 180,000 copies. (Normally the paper sells 95,000 copies.)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014200357/http://www2.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/cultuurmedia/media/071013DeMorgenShine |title=vrtnieuws.net - De Morgen erg vlot verkocht met cd |website=web.archive.org |language=nl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014200357/http://www2.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/cultuurmedia/media/071013DeMorgenShine |archive-date=2007-10-14 |url-status=dead |access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Bettens won an [[EBBA Awards|EBBA]] Award. Every year, the European Border Breakers Awards ([http://www.europeanborderbreakersawards.eu/ EBBA]) recognize the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.\n\nIn late 2008, Bettens released the album ''[[Never Say Goodbye (Sam Bettens album)|Never Say Goodbye]]'', consisting of recordings of live performances of K's Choice and solo songs, covers, and new songs which had been played during previous tours.

His first full-length solo album, ''[[Scream (Sam Bettens album)|Scream]]'', was released in Europe on 14 March 2005, and in the USA on 23 August 2005.\n\nIn March 2007, Bettens released an EP through online music label [[Fuzz (music company)|Fuzz]]. His second full-length album, ''Shine'', including new mixes of the tracks from the Fuzz EP, was released in 2007. It was produced by [[Brad Wood]].

Huntington]], Huntington Park was incorporated in 1906 as a [[streetcar suburb]] on the [[Los Angeles Railway]] for workers in the rapidly expanding industries to the southeast of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. To this day, about 30% of its residents work at factories in nearby [[Vernon, California|Vernon]] and [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov https://www.census.gov]  ''Factfinder.census.gov''</ref>  The stretch of [[Pacific Boulevard]] in downtown Huntington Park was a major commercial district serving the city's largely working-class residents, as well as those of neighboring cities such as [[Bell, California|Bell]], [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]], [[South Gate, California|South Gate]], and [[Downey, California|Downey]]. As with most of the other cities along the corridor stretching along the [[Los Angeles River]] to the south and southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Huntington Park was an almost exclusively white community during most of its history; Alameda Street and [[Slauson Avenue]], which were fiercely defended segregation lines in the 1950s, separated it from black areas.\n\nThe changes that shaped Los Angeles from the late 1970s onward\u2014the decline of American manufacturing that began in the 1970s; the rapid growth of newer suburbs in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], the eastern [[San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel]], western [[San Fernando Valley|San Fernando]] and [[Conejo Valley|Conejo]] valleys; the collapse of the aerospace and defense industry at the end of the [[Cold War]]; and the implosion of the Southern California real estate boom in the early 1990s\u2014resulted in the wholesale departure of virtually all of the white population of Huntington Park by the mid-1990s.  The vacuum was filled almost entirely by two groups of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]s: upwardly mobile families eager to leave the barrios of [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], and recent [[Mexico|Mexican]] immigrants.  Today, Pacific Boulevard is once again a thriving commercial strip, serving as a major retail center for working-class residents of southeastern Los Angeles County\u2014but unlike its previous heyday of the 1930s, the signs along the avenue's storefronts are now primarily in Spanish.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\nBefore California abolished judicial townships (some time after 1960), Huntington Park was located in San Antonio Township.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.0|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\nCities surrounding Huntington Park include [[Bell, California|Bell]], [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Maywood, California|Maywood]], [[South Gate, California|South Gate]], and [[Vernon, California|Vernon]].

Huntington]], Huntington Park was incorporated in 1906 as a [[streetcar suburb]] on the [[Los Angeles Railway]] for workers in the rapidly expanding industries to the southeast of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. To this day, about 30% of its residents work at factories in nearby [[Vernon, California|Vernon]] and [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov https://www.census.gov]  ''Factfinder.census.gov''</ref>  The stretch of [[Pacific Boulevard]] in downtown Huntington Park was a major commercial district serving the city's largely working-class residents, as well as those of neighboring cities such as [[Bell, California|Bell]], [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]], [[South Gate, California|South Gate]], and [[Downey, California|Downey]]. As with most of the other cities along the corridor stretching along the [[Los Angeles River]] to the south and southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Huntington Park was an almost exclusively white community during most of its history; Alameda Street and [[Slauson Avenue]], which were fiercely defended segregation lines in the 1950s, separated it from black areas.\n\nThe changes that shaped Los Angeles from the late 1970s onward\u2014the decline of American manufacturing that began in the 1970s; the rapid growth of newer suburbs in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], the eastern [[San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel]], western [[San Fernando Valley|San Fernando]] and [[Conejo Valley|Conejo]] valleys; the collapse of the aerospace and defense industry at the end of the [[Cold War]]; and the implosion of the Southern California real estate boom in the early 1990s\u2014resulted in the wholesale departure of virtually all of the white population of Huntington Park by the mid-1990s.  The vacuum was filled almost entirely by two groups of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]s: upwardly mobile families eager to leave the barrios of [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], and recent [[Mexico|Mexican]] immigrants.  Today, Pacific Boulevard is once again a thriving commercial strip, serving as a major retail center for working-class residents of southeastern Los Angeles County\u2014but unlike its previous heyday of the 1930s, the signs along the avenue's storefronts are now primarily in Spanish.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\nBefore California abolished judicial townships (some time after 1960), Huntington Park was located in San Antonio Township.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.0|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\nCities surrounding Huntington Park include [[Bell, California|Bell]], [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Maywood, California|Maywood]], [[South Gate, California|South Gate]], and [[Vernon, California|Vernon]].
