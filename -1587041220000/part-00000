The battle determined the result of the [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] after the Italian invasion and the larger [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of the [[Second World War]].\n\nItalian invasion forces were advancing northwards on a north-south road toward the colonial capital of [[Berbera]] through the Tug Argan gap (named after the dry riverbed ''tug'' running across it) in the Assa hills, when they encountered British units lying in fortified positions on a number of widely distributed hills across its breadth. Italian infantry, after an intense four-day encounter, overran the undermanned British positions and were able to seize the gap, compelling the defenders to withdraw to Berbera.\n\nThe Italian victory made the position of British forces in Somaliland untenable; the British colonial authorities evacuated the garrison by sea from Berbera. Italy was able to quickly secure the territory, an achievement whose propaganda value to a bellicose [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime would ultimately outweigh its relatively minute strategic importance.\n\n== Background ==\nAs [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] entered the war at the conclusion of the [[Battle of France]], its [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] looked to Africa for easy conquests to justify his entrance into the conflict and to glorify Italy's role. The remote colony of [[British Somaliland]], a tract of modern Somalia poor in both resources and defenders, appeared vulnerable. Though Italy lacked the supply structure for a long war in the region, an expedition to Somaliland was authorised, set for late 1940. Italian forces in East Africa were relatively strong in numbers, if not in quality, with 29 colonial brigades, each comprising several infantry battalions and some light artillery, concentrated around the recently conquered [[Ethiopia]]n capital, [[Addis Ababa]]. The Italians also possessed at least 60 light and medium tanks as well as 183 fighter aircraft, light and medium bombers.<ref>Playfair 1954, pp. 165\u2013166.</ref>\n\nThe British were outnumbered and their exiguous colonial forces were dispersed in North and East Africa. With [[Cyrenaica]] and the [[Sudan]] under threat as well as Somaliland, only token units were available to control what was considered a relatively unimportant possession, devoid of infrastructure, productive capacity or natural resources. Until December 1939 British policy had been to abandon Somaliland if there was an invasion. General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the new commander of British armies in Africa, persuaded the [[Chiefs of Staff Committee|British Chiefs of Staff]] that Somaliland should be defended, for much the same motives as Italy drew upon in the attempt to seize it. A multiracial congregation of five battalions, the minimum force adjudged capable of defending the region, was assembled by the beginning of August.<ref>Playfair 1954, pp. 171\u2013173.</ref><ref>Mackenzie 1951, p. 22.</ref> The defence force included two Sikh battalions and the 2nd [[King's African Rifles]], which arrived by sea in from Aden. The Indian units, contrary to expectations, were composed of well-equipped and professional soldiers, a much-needed complement to the inexperienced Rhodesian troops already present.<ref name=\":2\">Mockler 2003, p. 243.</ref>\n\nBerbera, the capital of British Somaliland and its only major city and port, was the obvious destination of any invasion. As plans took shape for the blocking of Italian passage to the city, it became apparent that the border with Ethiopia was too long and open to be defended. The rugged Somali countryside (as is pictured below) was impassable by vehicles, meaning that the British could defend bottlenecks on the two roads to Berbera, which wound through the desert via the towns of [[Hargeisa]] and [[Burao]], respectively. The Hargeisa road, the most direct route to the capital, was most easily blocked at the Tug Argan gap in the Assa hills. The pass was flat and open; a small force could not hold out for long against superior numbers but despite this topographical disadvantage, three battalions of the five originally allocated and a light artillery battery were committed to the defence of Tug Argan. Another battalion was held in reserve.<ref>Playfair 1954, p. 173.</ref>\n\nThe strategic position of the British was undermined by the [[Battle of France]] and the French surrender on 22 June. British planners had anticipated fighting with the French, who controlled the western quarter of the Somali coast and had relinquished military control of the border regions adjoining the two protectorates. France had a larger garrison in Somaliland than Britain and could obtain reinforcements from Madagascar. Though the armistice had been signed at [[Compi\u00e8gne Wagon|Compi\u00e8gne]], General [[Paul Legentilhomme|Paul Le Gentilhomme]], Commander-in-Chief of French East African forces, announced that he would not join [[Vichy France]] in neutrality, proposing instead to continue the struggle from [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]]. Le Gentilehomme was relieved of command by his superiors on 22 July and he fled to Allied territory. His successor soon achieved d\u00e9tente with the Italians, leaving British Somaliland isolated.<ref>Moyse-Bartlett, p. 494.</ref>\n\nOn 3 August, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]] led 35,000 Italian troops, the vast majority of them African conscripts, across the border from their staging point at Harar into British Somaliland. The invaders were organised into three columns: one on the left, which would advance north to the coast at [[Zeila]]\u2014a route recently vacated by the Vichy French before turning east to Berbera; one on the right, which would make the opposite motion on the Burao road and a main central column, led by [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], containing the bulk of his forces. Simone was to capture the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, ending the campaign with a decisive battle.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Italians captured Hargeisa on 6 August, forcing British camel soldiers to withdraw completely. A few days of rest and rearmament ensued before the march was resumed on 8 August. The delay was extended by administrative inertia, as Italian officers complained of heavy rains and impassable roads. Following two days of probing, de Simone and his contingent reached the head of the Tug Argan gap and an initial assault was scheduled for 11 August. General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Alfred Godwin-Austen]] arrived to take command of the British garrison from [[Arthur Reginald Chater|Arthur Chater]], who would remain in local control of the Tug Argan front.<ref>Playfair 1954, p. 174.</ref><ref name=\"Mockler 2003, p. 245\">Mockler 2003, p. 245.</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|The Tug Argan Gap]]\nHaving realised that holding Tug Argan was essential to halting any invasion, British command poured all available resources\u2014though diminished by French duplicity\u2014into its defence. A unit of the [[Black Watch]] was rushed to the village of [[Laferug]] (to the rear of the gap) late on 10 August by truck, and a brigade headquarters was established at nearby [[Barkasan]]. Meanwhile, those battalions already present entrenched themselves across the broad arc of the gap.<ref name=\"Mockler 2003, p. 245\"/> On the British right were positioned three companies of the 3/15 [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] Regiment, holding a group of southwest-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness beside the road. The British left was covered by another group of Indian troops, facing directly southward from atop the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge.'<ref name=\":0\" /> The gap itself was manned by the more numerous [[Southern Rhodesia in World War II|Rhodesian]] line infantry. They sat upon a line of rocky knolls, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills, positioned in a ragged diagonal echelon with 2,000\u20132,500 yard gaps between them across the mouth of the gap. Each was a miniature fortress, housing machine-gun nests surrounded by concentric rings of barbed wire. These strongpoints were keystones in the British arch; fall, and the line would crumble. Given that the front was far too wide for the troops available and the gaps between the hills too large, maintaining this balance in the face of enemy numbers was shaping up to be a difficult task. Worse, the linear arrangement of the mounds denied the British position meaningful depth, thereby increasing its vulnerability to individual Italian breakthroughs.<ref>Playfair 1954, p. 175.</ref>\n\nLate on 10 August, the first signs of Italian preparations became apparent to the defenders of Tug Argan. Through the day, the headlights of advancing Axis supply convoys were clearly visible, and Somali refugees, fleeing before De Simone's column, swarmed across the Mirgo Pass on the British left. A K.A.R. patrol skirmished briefly with a quartet of Italian armoured cars, but the exchanged gunfire terrified the British camels and forced their riders to flee.<ref>Moysse-Bartlett 2012, pp. 497-8.</ref> After receiving word from other scouts that the Italian tanks and infantry were easily avoiding the crude minefields laid before the creek, all Allied forces still holding the forward trenches were withdrawn to the prepared battle line. As this manoeuvre was nearing completion, Italian artillery and aircraft initiated a preliminary bombardment of the hills, and parties of second-rate Ethiopian and [[Blackshirts|Blackshirt]] troops made a series of futile sallies through the early evening.<ref>Stewart 2016, p. 78.</ref> In the meantime, De Simone deployed his main forces opposite the British positions a move that presaged a traditional set battle. On the Italian left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the centre, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armoured vehicles.<ref name=\":0\">Stone 1998.</ref>\n\nThe attack on the gap began at 7:30&nbsp;am on 11 August, as a flight of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] medium bombers attacked British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault was followed by a long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">Playfair 1954, p. 176.</ref> The Italian attack on the hills was renewed the next day (12 August). Black, Knobbly, and Mill Hills endured repeated assaults by XIV Brigade, and the weakest of them, Mill Hill, began to reel under the sustained pressure. By 4:00&nbsp;pm, the British defences were being overrun, and after nightfall the British retreated from the hill, spiking their guns as they left.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|right|thumb|<p style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Kenyan troops of the King's African Rifles, who played a prominent role on the British side at Tug Argan</p>]]\n13 August saw little change in the overall situation. XIV Brigade's attacks on the Rhodesian hilltop positions failed yet again after some intense fighting, while II Brigade continued their trek through the wilderness toward the northern hills. XV Brigade began to infiltrate behind British lines, finding a supply convoy, which was attacked and dispersed.<ref name=\":0\" /> On 14 August, the embattled XIV Brigade was relieved of their role in the battle after suffering heavy casualties in their continuous offensives, and was replaced by XIII Brigade. The fresh troops attacked Observation Hill but failed again, even after continuous artillery bombardment throughout the day. II Brigade, meanwhile, had still failed to engage the Indians, and XV Brigade made little progress before fending off a counterattack from two companies of the 2nd King's African Rifles.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy 14 August, Godwin-Austen had realised his peril. XV Brigade was encircling him from the rear, his troops were exhausted, and his artillery units\u2014some already abandoned to the advancing Italians\u2014were running low on ammunition. He informed General [[Henry Maitland Wilson]], in command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he would be forced either to fight to the death or to surrender his men and munitions. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August.<ref>Playfair 1954, pp. 176\u2013177.</ref> During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to continue the attack in the gap in lieu of completing the flanking manoeuvre, and this final push proved successful. By 7:00&nbsp;pm, XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, from which the British retreated in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their deserted positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians seized control of the Tug Argan Gap.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the British withdrawal from Tug Argan, the Italians swiftly completed the investment of Berbera. To permit the main body of the colonial garrison to reach the coast, units of the Black Watch, 2nd Battalion King's African Rifles and the 1/2 Punjab Regiment formed a small rearguard at Barakasan, which fought into the night of 17 August.<ref>Wavell 1946, p. 2,724.</ref> The [[Royal Navy]] had already begun to evacuate military personnel from Berbera on 16 August, operations that few Italian aircraft flew against, possibly due to uncertainty about whether a peace treaty might be signed. By 19 August, all remaining British military forces, including the rearguard, the last of which had embarked late the previous day, had been evacuated by sea.<ref>Stewart 2016, p. 87.</ref> An estimated 5,300\u20135,700 troops reached Aden.<ref>Tucker 2005, p. 1179.</ref> Italian forces, which had been held up by naval bombardment by {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} on 17 August, arrived in a deserted Berbera on 19 August.

Irritated by Mussolini's boasting, Churchill excoriated Wavell via cable, labelling the low casualty numbers on the British side a mark of blatant cowardice and demanding that Godwin-Austen be subjected to a [[Board of Inquiry|board of inquiry]]. Wavell replied with \"a big butcher's bill is not necessarily evidence of good tactics\"\u2014further enraged Churchill, under whose influence the general's promising career stuttered.<ref>Pitt 2004, pp. 48\u201349.</ref> Despite the emotional attachments professed by Allied and Axis leaders to the rule of Somaliland, few spoils changed hands as a result of Italian victory. Defeat was a blow to British prestige and pride but the territory had little significance to imperial strategy. Britain gained finacially after being relieved of the burden of providing a garrison. The impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, removing any chance of a strategic victory.<ref>Stewart 2016, pp. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe British suffered 38 dead, 102 wounded, and 120 missing; ten artillery pieces were left behind.

A K.A.R. patrol skirmished briefly with a quartet of Italian armoured cars, but the exchanged gunfire terrified the British camels and forced their riders to flee.<ref>Moysse-Bartlett 2012, pp. 497-8.</ref> After receiving word from other scouts that the Italian tanks and infantry were easily avoiding the crude minefields laid before the creek, all Allied forces still holding the forward trenches were withdrawn to the prepared battle line. As this manoeuvre was nearing completion, Italian artillery and aircraft initiated a preliminary bombardment of the hills, and parties of second-rate Ethiopian and [[Blackshirts|Blackshirt]] troops made a series of futile sallies through the early evening.<ref>Stewart 2016, p. 78.</ref> In the meantime, De Simone deployed his main forces opposite the British positions a move that presaged a traditional set battle. On the Italian left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the centre, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armoured vehicles.<ref name=\":0\">Stone 1998.</ref>\n\nThe attack on the gap began at 7:30&nbsp;am on 11 August, as a flight of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] medium bombers attacked British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault was followed by a long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, Knobbly, and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">Playfair 1954, p. 176.</ref> The Italian attack on the hills was renewed the next day (12 August). Black, Knobbly, and Mill Hills endured repeated assaults by XIV Brigade, and the weakest of them, Mill Hill, began to reel under the sustained pressure. By 4:00&nbsp;pm, the British defences were being overrun, and after nightfall the British retreated from the hill, spiking their guns as they left.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|right|thumb|<p style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Kenyan troops of the King's African Rifles, who played a prominent role on the British side at Tug Argan</p>]]\n13 August saw little change in the overall situation. XIV Brigade's attacks on the Rhodesian hilltop positions failed yet again after some intense fighting, while II Brigade continued their trek through the wilderness toward the northern hills. XV Brigade began to infiltrate behind British lines, finding a supply convoy, which was attacked and dispersed.<ref name=\":0\" /> On 14 August, the embattled XIV Brigade was relieved of their role in the battle after suffering heavy casualties in their continuous offensives, and was replaced by XIII Brigade. The fresh troops attacked Observation Hill but failed again, even after continuous artillery bombardment throughout the day. II Brigade, meanwhile, had still failed to engage the Indians, and XV Brigade made little progress before fending off a counterattack from two companies of the 2nd King's African Rifles.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy 14 August, Godwin-Austen had realised his peril. XV Brigade was encircling him from the rear, his troops were exhausted, and his artillery units\u2014some already abandoned to the advancing Italians\u2014were running low on ammunition. He informed General [[Henry Maitland Wilson]], in command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he would be forced either to fight to the death or to surrender his men and munitions. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August.<ref>Playfair 1954, pp. 176\u2013177.</ref> During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to continue the attack in the gap in lieu of completing the flanking manoeuvre, and this final push proved successful. By 7:00&nbsp;pm, XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, from which the British retreated in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their deserted positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians seized control of the Tug Argan Gap.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the British withdrawal from Tug Argan, the Italians swiftly completed the investment of Berbera. To permit the main body of the colonial garrison to reach the coast, units of the Black Watch, 2nd Battalion King's African Rifles and the 1/2 Punjab Regiment formed a small rearguard at Barakasan, which fought into the night of 17 August.<ref>Wavell 1946, p. 2,724.</ref> The [[Royal Navy]] had already begun to evacuate military personnel from Berbera on 16 August, operations that few Italian aircraft flew against, possibly due to uncertainty about whether a peace treaty might be signed. By 19 August, all remaining British military forces, including the rearguard, the last of which had embarked late the previous day, had been evacuated by sea.<ref>Stewart 2016, p. 87.</ref> An estimated 5,300\u20135,700 troops reached Aden.<ref>Tucker 2005, p. 1179.</ref> Italian forces, which had been held up by naval bombardment by {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} on 17 August, arrived in a deserted Berbera on 19 August.

Irritated by Mussolini's boasting, Churchill excoriated Wavell via cable, labelling the low casualty numbers on the British side a mark of blatant cowardice and demanding that Godwin-Austen be subjected to a [[Board of Inquiry|board of inquiry]]. Wavell replied with \"a big butcher's bill is not necessarily evidence of good tactics\"\u2014further enraged Churchill, under whose influence the general's promising career stuttered.<ref>Pitt 2004, pp. 48\u201349.</ref> Despite the emotional attachments professed by Allied and Axis leaders to the rule of Somaliland, few spoils changed hands as a result of Italian victory. Defeat was a blow to British prestige and pride but the territory had little significance to imperial strategy. Britain gained finacially after being relieved of the burden of providing a garrison. The impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, removing any chance of a strategic victory.<ref>Stewart 2016, pp. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe British suffered 38 dead, 102 wounded, and 120 missing; ten artillery pieces were left behind.

HIGINIO MOR\u00cdNIGO,\"] by Augusto Ocampos Caballero. Retrieved October 29, 2014.</ref>) was a general and [[political figure]] in [[Paraguay]]. He was the [[President of Paraguay|President]] and military dictator of Paraguay from September 7, 1940 to June 3, 1948. Opposition to his rule led to the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1947)|Paraguayan civil war of 1947]]. The Paraguayan city [[General Higinio Mor\u00ednigo]] is named in his honor.\n\n==Early life and military career==\nMor\u00ednigo was born in 1897 in [[Paraguar\u00ed]], Paraguay, to a merchant family of mixed European and [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guarani]] descent. He was fluent in the Spanish and [[Guaran\u00ed language]]s. Little else is known of his early life.\n\nHe attended military college and entered the [[Military of Paraguay|Paraguayan Army]] in 1922. He participated in the [[Chaco War]] and was appointed the Army's Chief of Staff in 1936. Mor\u00ednigo gained fame in Paraguay during the [[February Revolution (Paraguay)|February Revolution of 1936]] by heading an expedition to the site of the [[Battle of Cerro Cor\u00e1]] to retrieve the remains of [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]]. President [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Estigarribia]], himself a Chaco War hero and supporter of the [[Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Liberal Party]], promoted Mor\u00ednigo to general and appointed him as Minister of War on May 2, 1940.\n\nAfter Estigarribia's unexpected death in an airplane crash on September 7, Mor\u00ednigo was chosen by the army and Liberal ministers as interim President for the two-month period leading to new Presidential elections.<ref>''Current Biography 1941'', pp608-10</ref>\n\n==Dictatorship==\nOn September 30, 1940, after growing disagreements with the President, the Liberal ministers resigned from the government. On October 16 Mor\u00ednigo announced that the Presidential elections would be postponed for two years. Soon afterward he announced a policy of \"discipline, hierarchy and order\" ''(disciplina, jerarquia, y orden)'' and stated that persons who spread subversive ideas would be \"subject to confinement\".<ref>Id. at 609</ref>\n\nOn November 30, Mor\u00ednigo banned all political parties and assumed dictatorial powers under a state of siege. In a midday radio address announcing these measures, Mor\u00ednigo declared, \"The people and the Army from this moment will be under a single command.\" In his [[self-coup]] and subsequent rule, he was greatly assisted by the 1940 Constitution, a severely authoritarian document written by the Liberals and Estigarribia that gave the president sweeping executive powers.\n\nTo strengthen his authority, on February 4, 1941 Mor\u00ednigo removed the influential Colonel Peredes from the post of [[Interior Minister]]. On April 17, 1941 he suppressed a [[Revolutionary Febrerista Party|''febrerista'']] uprising by supporters of the [[February Revolution (Paraguay)|February Revolution]].<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=e2F7c0wW7g4C&pg=PA211&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=true A Reference Guide to Latin American History]</ref>\n\nOn April 25, 1942 he banned the Liberal Party, accusing them of conspiring with the [[Bolivia]]ns and exiled Party's leaders.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=cbhOISlOv3MC&pg=PA243&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgzMAQ#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false The Cambridge History of Latin America, Volume 6]</ref> Mor\u00ednigo's only remaining supporters were radicals from the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] and the Army. During his dictatorship he faced widespread resistance, including [[general strike]]s and military revolts, but he survived by maintaining the loyalty of the Paraguayan Army, which received 45% of the country's budget.\n\nMor\u00ednigo relied on the right-wing Colorado faction ''Guion Rojo'' (the \"Red Banner\"), led by [[Juan Natalico Gonzalez]], as a paramilitary police force to intimidate ''febreristas'' and Liberals. Opposition newspapers were shut down and publishers exiled.<ref>Richard B. Baldauf and Robert B. Kaplan, ''Language Planning and Policy in Latin America,'' p.249 (Multilingual Matters, 2007)</ref>\n\nMor\u00ednigo finally held presidential elections on February 15, 1943; he was the sole candidate.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=RwfKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1927&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7796WmrHLAhWEB5oKHVz_AMAQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false Paraguayan Civil War (1947)]</ref>\n\n===Pro-fascist sympathies===\nJust as in other South American countries, pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] and pro-[[Fascism|fascist]] sympathies at this time were quite strong in the society and among military officers. After it entered [[World War II]] in 1941, the United States tried to exert some pressure on Mor\u00ednigo to limit the influence of [[Axis powers|Axis]] supporters. He kept Paraguay neutral for most of the war. He only officially declared war against the Axis in February 1945, without actually sending any soldiers to fight.\n\nA surge of German influence in the region and Argentina's pro-Axis leanings alarmed the United States, which sought to wean Paraguay away from German and Argentine influence. At the same time, the United States sought to enhance its presence in the region and pursued close cooperation with Brazil, Argentina's traditional rival. To this end, the United States provided to Paraguay sizable amounts of funds and supplies under the [[Lend-Lease]] Agreement, provided loans for public works, and gave technical assistance in agriculture and health care. The [[United States Department of State]] approved of closer ties between Brazil and Paraguay and especially supported Brazil's offer to finance a road project designed to reduce Paraguay's dependence on Argentina.\n\nUnited States protests over German and Argentine activities in Paraguay fell on deaf ears. While the United States defined its interests in terms of resisting the fascist threat, Paraguayan officials believed their best interests lay in economic expediency and were reluctant to antagonize Germany until the outcome of the war was no longer in doubt. Many Paraguayans believed Germany was no more of a threat to Paraguay's [[sovereignty]] than the United States.\n\nMuch to the displeasure of the United States and Britain, Mor\u00ednigo refused to act against German economic and diplomatic interests until the very end of the war. German agents had successfully converted many Paraguayans to the Axis cause. South America's first [[Nazi Party]] branch had been founded in Paraguay in 1931. [[German diaspora#Latin America|German immigrant]] schools, churches, hospitals, farmers' cooperatives, youth groups, and charitable societies became active Axis backers. All of those organizations prominently displayed [[swastika]]s and portraits of [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Mor\u00ednigo's regime was pro-Axis. Large numbers of Paraguayan military officers and government officials were openly sympathetic to the Axis. Among these officials was the national police chief, who named his son Adolfo Hirohito after the best-known Axis leaders. By 1941, the official newspaper ''El Pa\u00eds'' had adopted an overtly pro-German stance. At the same time, the government strictly controlled pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] labor unions. Police cadets wore swastikas and Italian insignia on their uniforms.\n\nThe December 1941 Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and Germany's declaration of war against the United States gave the United States the leverage it needed, however, to force Mor\u00ednigo to commit himself publicly to the Allied cause. Mor\u00ednigo officially severed diplomatic relations with the Axis countries in 1942, although he did not declare war against Germany until February 1945. Nonetheless, Mor\u00ednigo continued to maintain close relations with the heavily German-influenced Argentine military throughout the war and provided a haven for Axis spies and agents.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II eased Mor\u00ednigo's task of ruling Paraguay while keeping the army happy, because it stimulated demand for Paraguayan export products, such as meat, hides, and cotton, and boosted the country's export earnings. More important, United States policy toward Latin America at this time made Paraguay eligible for major economic assistance. Paraguay received American financial help which was used for improving roads and other infrastructure projects.\n\n===Postwar liberalization===\nPressure from the US for democratization swept South America after the war. On June 9, 1946 Mor\u00ednigo dismissed Colonel Benitez Vera, the right-wing head of the army, and crushed a short uprising by Vera's supporters. He then created a civilian coalition government formed by Colorado Party members and leftist ''febreristas'', followers of former dictator [[Rafael Franco]] and allowed some political freedoms, going so far as legalizing the [[Paraguayan Communist Party]].<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=-Ji-CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7796WmrHLAhWEB5oKHVz_AMAQ6AEITDAJ#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=true Historical Dictionary of Paraguay]</ref> Despite all this, in September 1946 he ordered suppression of opposition groups and used the Red Banner paramilitary group to attack the office of the Liberal newspaper ''El Pa\u00eds''.\n\n==Civil war of 1947==\nFeeling that Mor\u00ednigo was favouring the right-wing Colorados, the ''febreristas'' made common cause with the Liberal Party and the Communist Party in the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1947)|Civil War of 1947]].\n\nThe relaxation of the dictatorship was used by political parties to assert their influence in state institutions. In January 1947 officers loyal to the Colorado Party gained control of the army, and on January 11 ''febreristas'' quit the government and called on the army to overthrow Mor\u00ednigo, who responded by declaring a state of siege and arresting ''febreristas'', Liberals and Communists.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=cbhOISlOv3MC&pg=PA243&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgzMAQ#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false The Cambridge History of Latin America, Volume 6]</ref>\n\nOn March 7 a bloody civil war started. Despite the fact that 80% of soldiers and 90% of officers were against him, Mor\u00ednigo had the backing of Colorado party militias and Argentinian President [[Juan Peron]]; he managed to win a conflict that caused many thousand deaths and up to 300,000 people to flee as refugees.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=tMG2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA242&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false The South America Handbook]</ref> The future dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]] was one of the few officers who remained loyal to Mor\u00ednigo during the civil war. For the next 15 years, the Colorados were the only legal party in Paraguay.\n\n==Removal from power==\nOn February 15, 1948 Mor\u00ednigo organized Presidential elections which were won by the only candidate allowed to run, Juan Natalico Gonzalez\u2014leader of the Colorado Party's Red Banner faction\u2014with whom he had reached agreement that in return for his support of Gonzalez for President, he could continue as army's commander-in-chief.

HIGINIO MOR\u00cdNIGO,\"] by Augusto Ocampos Caballero. Retrieved October 29, 2014.</ref>) was a general and [[political figure]] in [[Paraguay]]. He was the [[President of Paraguay|President]] and military dictator of Paraguay from September 7, 1940 to June 3, 1948. Opposition to his rule led to the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1947)|Paraguayan civil war of 1947]]. The Paraguayan city [[General Higinio Mor\u00ednigo]] is named in his honor.\n\n==Early life and military career==\nMor\u00ednigo was born in 1897 in [[Paraguar\u00ed]], Paraguay, to a merchant family of mixed European and [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guarani]] descent. He was fluent in the Spanish and [[Guaran\u00ed language]]s. Little else is known of his early life.\n\nHe attended military college and entered the [[Military of Paraguay|Paraguayan Army]] in 1922. He participated in the [[Chaco War]] and was appointed the Army's Chief of Staff in 1936. Mor\u00ednigo gained fame in Paraguay during the [[February Revolution (Paraguay)|February Revolution of 1936]] by heading an expedition to the site of the [[Battle of Cerro Cor\u00e1]] to retrieve the remains of [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]]. President [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Estigarribia]], himself a Chaco War hero and supporter of the [[Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Liberal Party]], promoted Mor\u00ednigo to general and appointed him as Minister of War on May 2, 1940.\n\nAfter Estigarribia's unexpected death in an airplane crash on September 7, Mor\u00ednigo was chosen by the army and Liberal ministers as interim President for the two-month period leading to new Presidential elections.<ref>''Current Biography 1941'', pp608-10</ref>\n\n==Dictatorship==\nOn September 30, 1940, after growing disagreements with the President, the Liberal ministers resigned from the government. On October 16 Mor\u00ednigo announced that the Presidential elections would be postponed for two years. Soon afterward he announced a policy of \"discipline, hierarchy and order\" ''(disciplina, jerarquia, y orden)'' and stated that persons who spread subversive ideas would be \"subject to confinement\".<ref>Id. at 609</ref>\n\nOn November 30, Mor\u00ednigo banned all political parties and assumed dictatorial powers under a state of siege. In a midday radio address announcing these measures, Mor\u00ednigo declared, \"The people and the Army from this moment will be under a single command.\" In his [[self-coup]] and subsequent rule, he was greatly assisted by the 1940 Constitution, a severely authoritarian document written by the Liberals and Estigarribia that gave the president sweeping executive powers.\n\nTo strengthen his authority, on February 4, 1941 Mor\u00ednigo removed the influential Colonel Peredes from the post of [[Interior Minister]]. On April 17, 1941 he suppressed a [[Revolutionary Febrerista Party|''febrerista'']] uprising by supporters of the [[February Revolution (Paraguay)|February Revolution]].<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=e2F7c0wW7g4C&pg=PA211&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=true A Reference Guide to Latin American History]</ref>\n\nOn April 25, 1942 he banned the Liberal Party, accusing them of conspiring with the [[Bolivia]]ns and exiled Party's leaders.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=cbhOISlOv3MC&pg=PA243&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgzMAQ#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false The Cambridge History of Latin America, Volume 6]</ref> Mor\u00ednigo's only remaining supporters were radicals from the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] and the Army. During his dictatorship he faced widespread resistance, including [[general strike]]s and military revolts, but he survived by maintaining the loyalty of the Paraguayan Army, which received 45% of the country's budget.\n\nMor\u00ednigo relied on the right-wing Colorado faction ''Guion Rojo'' (the \"Red Banner\"), led by [[Juan Natalico Gonzalez]], as a paramilitary police force to intimidate ''febreristas'' and Liberals. Opposition newspapers were shut down and publishers exiled.<ref>Richard B. Baldauf and Robert B. Kaplan, ''Language Planning and Policy in Latin America,'' p.249 (Multilingual Matters, 2007)</ref>\n\nMor\u00ednigo finally held presidential elections on February 15, 1943; he was the sole candidate.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=RwfKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1927&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7796WmrHLAhWEB5oKHVz_AMAQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false Paraguayan Civil War (1947)]</ref>\n\n===Pro-fascist sympathies===\nJust as in other South American countries, pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] and pro-[[Fascism|fascist]] sympathies at this time were quite strong in the society and among military officers. After it entered [[World War II]] in 1941, the United States tried to exert some pressure on Mor\u00ednigo to limit the influence of [[Axis powers|Axis]] supporters. He kept Paraguay neutral for most of the war. He only officially declared war against the Axis in February 1945, without actually sending any soldiers to fight.\n\nA surge of German influence in the region and Argentina's pro-Axis leanings alarmed the United States, which sought to wean Paraguay away from German and Argentine influence. At the same time, the United States sought to enhance its presence in the region and pursued close cooperation with Brazil, Argentina's traditional rival. To this end, the United States provided to Paraguay sizable amounts of funds and supplies under the [[Lend-Lease]] Agreement, provided loans for public works, and gave technical assistance in agriculture and health care. The [[United States Department of State]] approved of closer ties between Brazil and Paraguay and especially supported Brazil's offer to finance a road project designed to reduce Paraguay's dependence on Argentina.\n\nUnited States protests over German and Argentine activities in Paraguay fell on deaf ears. While the United States defined its interests in terms of resisting the fascist threat, Paraguayan officials believed their best interests lay in economic expediency and were reluctant to antagonize Germany until the outcome of the war was no longer in doubt. Many Paraguayans believed Germany was no more of a threat to Paraguay's [[sovereignty]] than the United States.\n\nMuch to the displeasure of the United States and Britain, Mor\u00ednigo refused to act against German economic and diplomatic interests until the very end of the war. German agents had successfully converted many Paraguayans to the Axis cause. South America's first [[Nazi Party]] branch had been founded in Paraguay in 1931. [[German diaspora#Latin America|German immigrant]] schools, churches, hospitals, farmers' cooperatives, youth groups, and charitable societies became active Axis backers. All of those organizations prominently displayed [[swastika]]s and portraits of [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Mor\u00ednigo's regime was pro-Axis. Large numbers of Paraguayan military officers and government officials were openly sympathetic to the Axis. Among these officials was the national police chief, who named his son Adolfo Hirohito after the best-known Axis leaders. By 1941, the official newspaper ''El Pa\u00eds'' had adopted an overtly pro-German stance. At the same time, the government strictly controlled pro-[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] labor unions. Police cadets wore swastikas and Italian insignia on their uniforms.\n\nThe December 1941 Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and Germany's declaration of war against the United States gave the United States the leverage it needed, however, to force Mor\u00ednigo to commit himself publicly to the Allied cause. Mor\u00ednigo officially severed diplomatic relations with the Axis countries in 1942, although he did not declare war against Germany until February 1945. Nonetheless, Mor\u00ednigo continued to maintain close relations with the heavily German-influenced Argentine military throughout the war and provided a haven for Axis spies and agents.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II eased Mor\u00ednigo's task of ruling Paraguay while keeping the army happy, because it stimulated demand for Paraguayan export products, such as meat, hides, and cotton, and boosted the country's export earnings. More important, United States policy toward Latin America at this time made Paraguay eligible for major economic assistance. Paraguay received American financial help which was used for improving roads and other infrastructure projects.\n\n===Postwar liberalization===\nPressure from the US for democratization swept South America after the war. On June 9, 1946 Mor\u00ednigo dismissed Colonel Benitez Vera, the right-wing head of the army, and crushed a short uprising by Vera's supporters. He then created a civilian coalition government formed by Colorado Party members and leftist ''febreristas'', followers of former dictator [[Rafael Franco]] and allowed some political freedoms, going so far as legalizing the [[Paraguayan Communist Party]].<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=-Ji-CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7796WmrHLAhWEB5oKHVz_AMAQ6AEITDAJ#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=true Historical Dictionary of Paraguay]</ref> Despite all this, in September 1946 he ordered suppression of opposition groups and used the Red Banner paramilitary group to attack the office of the Liberal newspaper ''El Pa\u00eds''.\n\n==Civil war of 1947==\nFeeling that Mor\u00ednigo was favouring the right-wing Colorados, the ''febreristas'' made common cause with the Liberal Party and the Communist Party in the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1947)|Civil War of 1947]].\n\nThe relaxation of the dictatorship was used by political parties to assert their influence in state institutions. In January 1947 officers loyal to the Colorado Party gained control of the army, and on January 11 ''febreristas'' quit the government and called on the army to overthrow Mor\u00ednigo, who responded by declaring a state of siege and arresting ''febreristas'', Liberals and Communists.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=cbhOISlOv3MC&pg=PA243&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgzMAQ#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false The Cambridge History of Latin America, Volume 6]</ref>\n\nOn March 7 a bloody civil war started. Despite the fact that 80% of soldiers and 90% of officers were against him, Mor\u00ednigo had the backing of Colorado party militias and Argentinian President [[Juan Peron]]; he managed to win a conflict that caused many thousand deaths and up to 300,000 people to flee as refugees.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=tMG2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA242&dq=Higinio+Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSnr-nmrHLAhUMLZoKHTgQA8Y4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&q=Higinio%20Mor%C3%AD%C3%B1igo&f=false The South America Handbook]</ref> The future dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]] was one of the few officers who remained loyal to Mor\u00ednigo during the civil war. For the next 15 years, the Colorados were the only legal party in Paraguay.\n\n==Removal from power==\nOn February 15, 1948 Mor\u00ednigo organized Presidential elections which were won by the only candidate allowed to run, Juan Natalico Gonzalez\u2014leader of the Colorado Party's Red Banner faction\u2014with whom he had reached agreement that in return for his support of Gonzalez for President, he could continue as army's commander-in-chief. To prevent this, on June 3 some Colorado Party loyalists under [[Felipe Molas L\u00f3pez]] revolted and sent him into exile in Argentina. Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Juan Manuel Frutos]] was sworn in as interim President, serving the last two months of Mor\u00ednigo's term until Gonz\u00e1lez was officially inaugurated on August 15, 1948.<ref>\"Paraguay President Deposed by Army,\" ''El Paso Herald-Post'', June 3, 1948, p1</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box|\n before=[[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Estigarribia]]|\n title=[[President of Paraguay]]|\n after=[[Juan Manuel Frutos]]|\n years=1940\u20131948\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Paraguay Presidents}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morinigo, Higinio}}\n[[Category:1897 births]]\n[[Category:1983 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Paraguar\u00ed]]\n[[Category:People of the Chaco War]]\n[[Category:Leaders ousted by a coup]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan anti-communists]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan soldiers]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Paraguay]]\n[[Category:World War II political leaders]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan people of Guarani descent]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan people of Spanish descent]]\n", "name_user": "Fernandokaiserbr", "label": "safe", "comment": "New image of the president added.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higinio_Mor%C3%ADnigo"}

One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\" Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]]. The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties.<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

Suicide bomber capture ====\nIntelligence gathering operations constantly scanned for \"chatter\" on plans for suicide bombings by the Taliban. To interdict these operations, Hastie was required to work with local forces, however by May the Wakunish were now working independently, so Australia's forces need to work with the Provincial Response Company<ref name=\":2\" /> with whom they had few shared values. One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\" Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]]. The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties.<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission. We were protecting the base from attack. We just thought of Aussie diggers, aid workers, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] and everyone else supporting us behind the wire.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

Benioff added, \"a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That means no sex, no blood, no profanity.

Benioff added, \"a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That means no sex, no blood, no profanity.

His experiments with plant [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] led to his establishing [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of inheritance]]. Genetics stimulated research to improve crop production through plant breeding.\n\nModern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[entomology]], [[chemistry]], and [[statistics]] ([[biometrics]]). It has also developed its own technology.\n\n== Classical plant breeding ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}\n{{For|the role of crossing and plant breeding in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}\n\n[[File:Wild Mustard Plant Selective Breeding.svg|thumb|Selective breeding enlarged desired traits of the wild cabbage plant (''[[Brassica oleracea]]'') over hundreds of years, resulting in dozens of today's agricultural crops. [[Cabbage]], [[kale]], [[broccoli]], and [[cauliflower]] are all [[cultivars]] of this plant.]]\n\nOne major technique of plant breeding is selection, the process of selectively propagating plants with desirable characteristics and eliminating or \"culling\" those with less desirable characteristics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Deppe |first=Carol |date=2000 |title=Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing}} |page=237-244</ref>\n\nAnother technique is the deliberate interbreeding ('''crossing''') of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties. Plants are crossbred to introduce [[Trait (biological)|traits]]/[[gene]]s from one variety or line into a new genetic background. For example, a [[mildew]]-resistant [[pea]] may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, ('''[[backcrossing]]'''). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield (selection, as described above) and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce '''inbred''' varieties for breeding. Pollinators may be [[Pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]] through the use of [[pollination bags]].\n\nClassical breeding relies largely on [[genetic recombination|homologous recombination]] between chromosomes to generate [[genetic diversity]]. The classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of ''in vitro'' techniques such as [[somatic fusion|protoplast fusion]], [[embryo rescue]] or [[mutagenesis]] (see below) to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in [[nature]].\n\nTraits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include:\n# Improved [[Quality (business)|quality]], such as increased nutrition, improved flavor, or greater beauty\n# Increased [[Crop yield|yield]] of the crop\n# Increased [[Physiological tolerance|tolerance]] of environmental pressures ([[salinity]], extreme [[temperature]], [[drought]])\n# Resistance to [[virus]]es, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]\n# Increased tolerance to [[insect]] pests\n# Increased tolerance of [[herbicide]]s\n# Longer storage period for the harvested crop\n\n=== Before World War II ===\n[[File:Gartons-1902-Catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|Garton's catalogue from 1902]]\n\nSuccessful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late 19th century.{{clarify|and a citation that there were none before that time|date=October 2013}} [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through cross-pollination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|title=Plant breeding|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021184545/http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|archivedate=2013-10-21}}</ref> The firm's first introduction was Abundance [[Oat]], one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.<ref>Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=140|isbn=9780226437057}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, plant breeders realized that [[gregor mendel|Mendel's]]  findings on the non-random nature of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] could be applied to [[seedling]] populations produced through deliberate [[pollination]]s to predict the frequencies of different types. Wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of [[Italy]] during the so-called \"[[Battle for Grain]]\" (1925\u20131940). [[Heterosis]] was explained by [[George Harrison Shull]]. It describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. [[Maize]] was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids.\n\n[[statistics|Statistical]] methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] (CMS), developed in maize, was described by [[Marcus Morton Rhoades]]. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile [[pollen]]. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive [[detasseling]].\n\nThese early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after [[World War II]], the [[Green Revolution]] increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]\nFollowing [[World War II]] a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species, and artificially induce genetic diversity.\n\nWhen distantly related species are crossed, plant breeders make use of a number of [[plant tissue culture]] techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating. Interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally [[reproduction|sexually reproduce]] with each other. These crosses are referred to as ''Wide crosses''. For example, the [[cereal]] [[triticale]] is a [[wheat]] and [[rye]] hybrid. The cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as result was sterile. The [[cell division]] inhibitor [[colchicine]] was used to double the number of [[chromosome]]s in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and thus allow the production of a fertile line.\n\nFailure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre- or post-[[fertilization]] incompatibility. If fertilization is possible between two species or genera, the hybrid [[embryo]] may abort before maturation. If this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant. Such a method is referred to as [[Embryo Rescue]]. This technique has been used to produce [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]], an interspecific cross of Asian rice ''(Oryza sativa)'' and [[African rice]] ''(Oryza glaberrima)''.\n\nHybrids may also be produced by a technique called [[protoplast]] fusion. In this case protoplasts are fused, usually in an electric field. Viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture.\n\nChemical [[mutagen]]s like [[ethyl methanesulfonate|EMS]] and [[dimethyl sulfate|DMS]], [[radiation]] and [[transposon]]s are used to generate [[mutant]]s with desirable traits to be bred with other [[cultivar]]s \u2013 a process known as ''Mutation Breeding''. Classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called [[somaclonal variation]], which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture, particularly plants derived from [[plant tissue culture|callus]]. Induced [[polyploidy]], and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called [[chromosome engineering]] may also be used.\n[[File:\u041e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438-\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044f.jpg|left|thumb|Agricultural research on potato plants]]\n\nWhen a desirable trait has been bred into a species, a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible. Returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the high-yielding parent, the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations (See [[backcrossing]] ). This process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent. Classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process.\n\nWith classical breeding techniques, the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars. Some [[scientist]]s therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] plants. There have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption, for example the [[poison]] [[solanine]] was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of [[potato]] through plant breeding. New potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace.\n\n== Modern plant breeding ==\nModern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select, or in the case of genetic modification, to insert, desirable traits into plants. Application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as [[molecular breeding]].\n\n[[File:Adelport 270.jpg|350px|thumb|Modern facilities in molecular biology are now used in plant breeding.]]\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n*\n\n=== Marker assisted selection ===\n{{Main|Marker assisted selection}}\nSometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding. The use of tools such as [[molecular marker]]s or [[DNA fingerprinting]] can map thousands of genes. This allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest. The screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures, rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant. The purpose of marker assisted selection, or plant genomes analysis, is to identify the location and function ([[phenotype]]) of various genes within the genome. If all of the genes are identified it leads to [[Genome sequence]]. All plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins, but many are also the same. If a gene's location and function is identified in one plant species, a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another species genome.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\">{{cite journal|title=Biotechnology and world food supply|journal = Genome|volume = 42|issue = 4|last1=Kasha|first1=Ken|pages=642\u2013645|doi=10.1139/g99-043|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Reverse breeding and doubled haploids (DH) ===\n{{Main|Doubled haploidy}}\n{{clarify|reason=some explanation of reverse breeding is still missing here|date=March 2017}}[[Homozygous]] plants with desirable traits can be produced from [[heterozygous]] starting plants, if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced, and then used to make a [[Doubled haploidy|doubled haploid]]. The doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits. Furthermore, two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of [[F1 hybrid]] plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits. Thus, an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety (F1 hybrid) without the necessity of [[vegetative reproduction]] but as the result of the cross of two homozygous/doubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2003017753|title=Reverse Breeding|website=wipo.int}}</ref> Using plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations. This minimizes the amount of genetic diversity among that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals. Using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homologous for the desired traits, therefore save much time in the process. There are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve the haploid plants, but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\" />\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Transgenic plants}}\n[[Genetic modification]] of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with [[RNAi]], to produce a desirable [[phenotype]]. The plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as [[transgenic plants]]. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called [[cisgenesis|cisgenic plants]]. Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered.\n\nTo genetically modify a plant, a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant. To do this, a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] to drive [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene, and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant. A marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included. In the [[laboratory]], [[antibiotic resistance]] is a commonly used marker: Plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics; plants that have not been transformed will die. In some instances markers for selection are removed by [[backcrossing]] with the parent plant prior to commercial release.\n\nThe construct can be inserted in the plant genome by [[genetic recombination]] using the bacteria ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|A. rhizogenes]]'', or by direct methods like the [[gene gun]] or [[microinjection]]. Using plant [[virus]]es to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility, but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus. For example, [[Cauliflower mosaic virus]] (CaMV) only infects [[cauliflower]] and related species. Another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on the progeny, so every plant has to be inoculated.\n\nThe majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to [[insect]] [[pest (animal)|pests]] and [[herbicide]]s. Insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) that encodes a [[protein]] that is toxic to some insects. For example, the [[Helicoverpa zea|cotton bollworm]], a common cotton pest, feeds on [[Bt cotton]] it will ingest the toxin and die. Herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moreland|first=D E|title=Mechanisms of Action of Herbicides|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=597\u2013638|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121|year=1980}}</ref> The enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides ''target site''.  Herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of ''target site'' protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide. This is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant crop plants (See [[Glyphosate#Glyphosate resistance|Glyphosate]])\n\nGenetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment. Stresses such as temperature variation, are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a [[Transcription factor]] to regulate [[Gene expression]]. Overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to become more resistant to freezing, which is one common cause of yield loss<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Wang, Wangxia |author2=Vinocur, Basia |author3=Altmann, Arie |title=Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures: towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance|journal=Planta|volume=218|issue=1 |pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5|year=2003 |pmid=14513379}}</ref>\n\nGenetic modification of plants that can produce [[pharmaceutical]]s (and industrial chemicals), sometimes called ''[[pharming (genetics)|pharming]]'', is a rather radical new area of plant breeding.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Genetically modified plants and human health | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | date=1 June 2008 |author1=Suzie Key |author2=Julian K-C Ma |author3=Pascal MW Drake  |last-author-amp=yes | pages=290\u2013298 | pmc=2408621 | pmid=18515776 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.070372 | volume=101| issue=6 }}</ref>\n\n== Issues and concerns ==\nModern plant breeding, whether classical or through genetic engineering, comes with issues of concern, particularly with regard to food crops. The question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on [[nutrition]]al value is central in this respect. Although relatively little direct research in this area has been done, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded. A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American College of Nutrition]]'' in 2004, entitled ''Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999'', compared nutritional analysis of [[vegetable]]s done in 1950 and in 1999, and found substantial decreases in six of 13 [[nutrient]]s measured, including 6% of [[protein]] and 38% of [[riboflavin]]. Reductions in [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[iron]] and [[ascorbic acid]] were also found. The study, conducted at the Biochemical Institute, [[University of Texas at Austin]], concluded in summary: ''\"We suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between 1950 and 1999, in which there may be trade-offs between [[Crop yield|yield]] and nutrient content.\"''<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Epp | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Riordan | first3 = H.D. | year = 2004 | title =  Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999| url = | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 669\u2013682 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2004.10719409| pmid = 15637215 }}</ref>\n\nThe debate surrounding genetically modified food during the 1990s peaked in 1999 in terms of media coverage and risk perception,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Costa-Font | first1 = J. | last2 = Mossialos | first2 = E. | year = 2007 | title =  Are perceptions of 'risks' and 'benefits' of genetically modified food (in)dependent?| url = | journal = Food Quality and Preference | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173\u2013182 | doi=10.1016/j.foodqual.2005.09.013}}</ref> and continues today \u2013 for example, \"''Germany has thrown its weight behind a growing European mutiny over [[genetically modified crops]] by banning the planting of a widely grown pest-resistant corn variety.''\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/14/germany-gm-crops|title=Germany deals blow to GM crops|last=Connoly|first=Kate|date=2009-04-14|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> The debate encompasses the [[Ecological impact of transgenic plants|ecological impact of genetically modified plants]], the safety of [[genetically modified food]] and concepts used for safety evaluation like [[substantial equivalence]]. Such concerns are not new to plant breeding. Most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers' needs. Examples include variety registration, seed schemes, regulatory authorizations for GM plants, etc.\n\n[[Plant breeders' rights]] is also a major and controversial issue. Today, production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders, who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in [[intellectual property rights]]. The range of related issues is complex. In the simplest terms, critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that, through a combination of technical and economic pressures, commercial breeders are reducing [[biodiversity]] and significantly constraining individuals (such as farmers) from developing and trading seed on a regional level.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luby|first=C.

Some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds. Seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results. Isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting. Isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops, plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages (most commonly used when producing F1 hybrids.)\n\n== Role of plant breeding in organic agriculture ==\nCritics of [[organic agriculture]] claim it is too low-yielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture.  However, part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Kevin M. |author2=K.G. Campbell |author3=S.R.

Breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential.  This requires selection for traits such as:<ref name=\"Lammerts 1\" />\n* Water use efficiency\n* Nutrient use efficiency (particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]])\n* Weed competitiveness\n* Tolerance of [[mechanical weed control]]\n* Pest/disease resistance\n* Early maturity (as a mechanism for avoidance of particular stresses)\n* Abiotic stress tolerance (i.e. drought, salinity, etc...)\n\nCurrently, few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection (i.e. selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture).  However, because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large, a given [[genotype]] may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment (see [[gene-environment interaction]]).  If this interaction is severe enough, an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment, which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals.<ref name=\"Murphy\" />  To ensure the most adapted varieties are identified, advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection (i.e. selection in the target environment) for many agronomic traits.\n\nThere are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on [[genetically modified organisms]].  For instance, controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes.  [[Marker assisted selection]] can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired trait(s), greatly speeding up the breeding process.<ref name=\"Lammerts 2\">{{cite journal|last=Lammerts van Bueren|first=E.

Unfortunately, [[molecular markers]] are not currently available for many important traits, especially complex ones controlled by many genes.\n\n== Breeding and food security ==\nFor agriculture to thrive in the future, changes must be made to address arising global issues. These issues are the lack of arable land, increasingly harsh cropping conditions and the need to maintain food security, which involves being able to provide the world population with sufficient nutrition. Crops need to be able to mature in multiple environments to allow worldwide access, which involves solving problems including drought tolerance. It has been suggested that global solutions are achievable through the process of plant breeding, with its ability to select specific genes allowing crops to perform at a level which yields the desired results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhodes |title=Addressing the potential for a selective breeding-based approach in sustainable agriculture |journal=International Journal of Agricultural Research |date=2013 |volume=42 |issue=12 |url=https://scatting.net/scat-clip/6019-shitjessica-scat-spy-scatting-blond-shopscat-fullhd-1080p.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Yield ===\n\nWith an increasing population, the production of food needs to increase with it.  It is estimated that a 70% increase in food production is needed by 2050 in order to meet the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security. But with the degradation of agricultural land, simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option. New varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area. An example of this can be seen in Asia, where food production per capita has increased twofold.  This has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers, but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area.<ref name=\"Tester, Langridge\">{{cite journal|last1=Tester|last2= Langridge|first1= Mark |first2= Peter |title=Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=February 2010 |volume=327 |issue=5967 |pages=818\u2013822 |doi=10.1126/science.1183700 |pmid=20150489|bibcode= 2010Sci...327..818T}}</ref><ref name=\"Godfray, Crute, Haddad, Lawrence, Muir, Pretty, Robinson.

Improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since 1960; this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time, meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker. The main area genetic increases were made was in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) resulting in 0.7-2.5% increase, at just 1% increase in IVDMD a single Bos Taurus also known as beef cattle reported 3.2% increase in daily gains. This improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=B\u00e4nziger|title=Breeding for drought and nitrogen stress tolerance in maize: from theory to practice|journal=From Theory to Practice|year=2000|pages=7\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HlluklozxuQC&pg=PA6&dq=B%C3%A4nziger,+M.+(2000).+Breeding+for+drought+and+nitrogen+stress+tolerance+in+maize:+from+theory+to+practice.+#v=onepage&q=B%C3%A4nziger%2C%20M.%20(2000).%20Breeding%20for%20drought%20and%20nitrogen%20stress%20tolerance%20in%20maize%3A%20from%20theory%20to%20practice.&f=false|accessdate=2013-11-07|isbn=9789706480460}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental stressors ===\n\nPlant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment. With long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture. Plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions; a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen. It is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security.\n<ref name=\"Casler, Vogal\">{{cite journal|last=Casler, Vogal|first=M.K.|title=Accomplishments and impact from breeding for increased forage nutritional value|journal=Crop Science|date=January\u2013February 1999 |volume=39|issue=1|pages=12\u201320|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/39/1/CS0390010012 |doi=10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183x003900010003x}}</ref>\nIn countries that experience harsh winters such as Iceland, Germany and further east in Europe, plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost, continuous snow-cover, frost-drought (desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost) and high moisture levels in soil in winter.<ref>Link, W.; Balko, C.; Stoddard, F.; Winter hardiness in faba bean: Physiology and breeding.

His experiments with plant [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] led to his establishing [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of inheritance]]. Genetics stimulated research to improve crop production through plant breeding.\n\nModern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[entomology]], [[chemistry]], and [[statistics]] ([[biometrics]]). It has also developed its own technology.\n\n== Classical plant breeding ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}\n{{For|the role of crossing and plant breeding in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}\n\n[[File:Wild Mustard Plant Selective Breeding.svg|thumb|Selective breeding enlarged desired traits of the wild cabbage plant (''[[Brassica oleracea]]'') over hundreds of years, resulting in dozens of today's agricultural crops. [[Cabbage]], [[kale]], [[broccoli]], and [[cauliflower]] are all [[cultivars]] of this plant.]]\n\nOne major technique of plant breeding is selection, the process of selectively propagating plants with desirable characteristics and eliminating or \"culling\" those with less desirable characteristics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Deppe |first=Carol |date=2000 |title=Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing}} |page=237-244</ref>\n\nAnother technique is the deliberate interbreeding ('''crossing''') of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties. Plants are crossbred to introduce [[Trait (biological)|traits]]/[[gene]]s from one variety or line into a new genetic background. For example, a [[mildew]]-resistant [[pea]] may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, ('''[[backcrossing]]'''). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield (selection, as described above) and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce '''inbred''' varieties for breeding. Pollinators may be [[Pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]] through the use of [[pollination bags]].\n\nClassical breeding relies largely on [[genetic recombination|homologous recombination]] between chromosomes to generate [[genetic diversity]]. The classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of ''in vitro'' techniques such as [[somatic fusion|protoplast fusion]], [[embryo rescue]] or [[mutagenesis]] (see below) to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in [[nature]].\n\nTraits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include:\n# Improved [[Quality (business)|quality]], such as increased nutrition, improved flavor, or greater beauty\n# Increased [[Crop yield|yield]] of the crop\n# Increased [[Physiological tolerance|tolerance]] of environmental pressures ([[salinity]], extreme [[temperature]], [[drought]])\n# Resistance to [[virus]]es, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]\n# Increased tolerance to [[insect]] pests\n# Increased tolerance of [[herbicide]]s\n# Longer storage period for the harvested crop\n\n=== Before World War II ===\n[[File:Gartons-1902-Catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|Garton's catalogue from 1902]]\n\nSuccessful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late 19th century.{{clarify|and a citation that there were none before that time|date=October 2013}} [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through cross-pollination.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|title=Plant breeding|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021184545/http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|archivedate=2013-10-21}}</ref> The firm's first introduction was Abundance [[Oat]], one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.<ref>Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=140|isbn=9780226437057}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, plant breeders realized that [[gregor mendel|Mendel's]]  findings on the non-random nature of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] could be applied to [[seedling]] populations produced through deliberate [[pollination]]s to predict the frequencies of different types. Wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of [[Italy]] during the so-called \"[[Battle for Grain]]\" (1925\u20131940). [[Heterosis]] was explained by [[George Harrison Shull]]. It describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. [[Maize]] was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids.\n\n[[statistics|Statistical]] methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] (CMS), developed in maize, was described by [[Marcus Morton Rhoades]]. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile [[pollen]]. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive [[detasseling]].\n\nThese early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after [[World War II]], the [[Green Revolution]] increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]\nFollowing [[World War II]] a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species, and artificially induce genetic diversity.\n\nWhen distantly related species are crossed, plant breeders make use of a number of [[plant tissue culture]] techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating. Interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally [[reproduction|sexually reproduce]] with each other. These crosses are referred to as ''Wide crosses''. For example, the [[cereal]] [[triticale]] is a [[wheat]] and [[rye]] hybrid. The cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as result was sterile. The [[cell division]] inhibitor [[colchicine]] was used to double the number of [[chromosome]]s in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and thus allow the production of a fertile line.\n\nFailure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre- or post-[[fertilization]] incompatibility. If fertilization is possible between two species or genera, the hybrid [[embryo]] may abort before maturation. If this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant. Such a method is referred to as [[Embryo Rescue]]. This technique has been used to produce [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]], an interspecific cross of Asian rice ''(Oryza sativa)'' and [[African rice]] ''(Oryza glaberrima)''.\n\nHybrids may also be produced by a technique called [[protoplast]] fusion. In this case protoplasts are fused, usually in an electric field. Viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture.\n\nChemical [[mutagen]]s like [[ethyl methanesulfonate|EMS]] and [[dimethyl sulfate|DMS]], [[radiation]] and [[transposon]]s are used to generate [[mutant]]s with desirable traits to be bred with other [[cultivar]]s \u2013 a process known as ''Mutation Breeding''. Classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called [[somaclonal variation]], which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture, particularly plants derived from [[plant tissue culture|callus]]. Induced [[polyploidy]], and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called [[chromosome engineering]] may also be used.\n[[File:\u041e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438-\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044f.jpg|left|thumb|Agricultural research on potato plants]]\n\nWhen a desirable trait has been bred into a species, a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible. Returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the high-yielding parent, the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations (See [[backcrossing]] ). This process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent. Classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process.\n\nWith classical breeding techniques, the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars. Some [[scientist]]s therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] plants. There have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption, for example the [[poison]] [[solanine]] was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of [[potato]] through plant breeding. New potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace.\n\n== Modern plant breeding ==\nModern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select, or in the case of genetic modification, to insert, desirable traits into plants. Application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as [[molecular breeding]].\n\n[[File:Adelport 270.jpg|350px|thumb|Modern facilities in molecular biology are now used in plant breeding.]]\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n*\n\n=== Marker assisted selection ===\n{{Main|Marker assisted selection}}\nSometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding. The use of tools such as [[molecular marker]]s or [[DNA fingerprinting]] can map thousands of genes. This allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest. The screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures, rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant. The purpose of marker assisted selection, or plant genomes analysis, is to identify the location and function ([[phenotype]]) of various genes within the genome. If all of the genes are identified it leads to [[Genome sequence]]. All plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins, but many are also the same. If a gene's location and function is identified in one plant species, a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another species genome.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\">{{cite journal|title=Biotechnology and world food supply|journal = Genome|volume = 42|issue = 4|last1=Kasha|first1=Ken|pages=642\u2013645|doi=10.1139/g99-043|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Reverse breeding and doubled haploids (DH) ===\n{{Main|Doubled haploidy}}\n{{clarify|reason=some explanation of reverse breeding is still missing here|date=March 2017}}[[Homozygous]] plants with desirable traits can be produced from [[heterozygous]] starting plants, if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced, and then used to make a [[Doubled haploidy|doubled haploid]]. The doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits. Furthermore, two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of [[F1 hybrid]] plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits. Thus, an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety (F1 hybrid) without the necessity of [[vegetative reproduction]] but as the result of the cross of two homozygous/doubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2003017753|title=Reverse Breeding|website=wipo.int}}</ref> Using plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations. This minimizes the amount of genetic diversity among that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals. Using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homologous for the desired traits, therefore save much time in the process. There are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve the haploid plants, but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them.<ref name=\"Biotech and food supply\" />\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Transgenic plants}}\n[[Genetic modification]] of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with [[RNAi]], to produce a desirable [[phenotype]]. The plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as [[transgenic plants]]. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called [[cisgenesis|cisgenic plants]]. Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered.\n\nTo genetically modify a plant, a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant. To do this, a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] to drive [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene, and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant. A marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included. In the [[laboratory]], [[antibiotic resistance]] is a commonly used marker: Plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics; plants that have not been transformed will die. In some instances markers for selection are removed by [[backcrossing]] with the parent plant prior to commercial release.\n\nThe construct can be inserted in the plant genome by [[genetic recombination]] using the bacteria ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|A. rhizogenes]]'', or by direct methods like the [[gene gun]] or [[microinjection]]. Using plant [[virus]]es to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility, but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus. For example, [[Cauliflower mosaic virus]] (CaMV) only infects [[cauliflower]] and related species. Another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on the progeny, so every plant has to be inoculated.\n\nThe majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to [[insect]] [[pest (animal)|pests]] and [[herbicide]]s. Insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) that encodes a [[protein]] that is toxic to some insects. For example, the [[Helicoverpa zea|cotton bollworm]], a common cotton pest, feeds on [[Bt cotton]] it will ingest the toxin and die. Herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moreland|first=D E|title=Mechanisms of Action of Herbicides|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=597\u2013638|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121|year=1980}}</ref> The enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides ''target site''.  Herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of ''target site'' protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide. This is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant crop plants (See [[Glyphosate#Glyphosate resistance|Glyphosate]])\n\nGenetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment. Stresses such as temperature variation, are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a [[Transcription factor]] to regulate [[Gene expression]]. Overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to become more resistant to freezing, which is one common cause of yield loss<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Wang, Wangxia |author2=Vinocur, Basia |author3=Altmann, Arie |title=Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures: towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance|journal=Planta|volume=218|issue=1 |pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5|year=2003 |pmid=14513379}}</ref>\n\nGenetic modification of plants that can produce [[pharmaceutical]]s (and industrial chemicals), sometimes called ''[[pharming (genetics)|pharming]]'', is a rather radical new area of plant breeding.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Genetically modified plants and human health | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | date=1 June 2008 |author1=Suzie Key |author2=Julian K-C Ma |author3=Pascal MW Drake  |last-author-amp=yes | pages=290\u2013298 | pmc=2408621 | pmid=18515776 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.070372 | volume=101| issue=6 }}</ref>\n\n== Issues and concerns ==\nModern plant breeding, whether classical or through genetic engineering, comes with issues of concern, particularly with regard to food crops. The question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on [[nutrition]]al value is central in this respect. Although relatively little direct research in this area has been done, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded. A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American College of Nutrition]]'' in 2004, entitled ''Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999'', compared nutritional analysis of [[vegetable]]s done in 1950 and in 1999, and found substantial decreases in six of 13 [[nutrient]]s measured, including 6% of [[protein]] and 38% of [[riboflavin]]. Reductions in [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[iron]] and [[ascorbic acid]] were also found. The study, conducted at the Biochemical Institute, [[University of Texas at Austin]], concluded in summary: ''\"We suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between 1950 and 1999, in which there may be trade-offs between [[Crop yield|yield]] and nutrient content.\"''<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Epp | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Riordan | first3 = H.D. | year = 2004 | title =  Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999| url = | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 669\u2013682 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2004.10719409| pmid = 15637215 }}</ref>\n\nThe debate surrounding genetically modified food during the 1990s peaked in 1999 in terms of media coverage and risk perception,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Costa-Font | first1 = J. | last2 = Mossialos | first2 = E. | year = 2007 | title =  Are perceptions of 'risks' and 'benefits' of genetically modified food (in)dependent?| url = | journal = Food Quality and Preference | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 173\u2013182 | doi=10.1016/j.foodqual.2005.09.013}}</ref> and continues today \u2013 for example, \"''Germany has thrown its weight behind a growing European mutiny over [[genetically modified crops]] by banning the planting of a widely grown pest-resistant corn variety.''\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/14/germany-gm-crops|title=Germany deals blow to GM crops|last=Connoly|first=Kate|date=2009-04-14|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> The debate encompasses the [[Ecological impact of transgenic plants|ecological impact of genetically modified plants]], the safety of [[genetically modified food]] and concepts used for safety evaluation like [[substantial equivalence]]. Such concerns are not new to plant breeding. Most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers' needs. Examples include variety registration, seed schemes, regulatory authorizations for GM plants, etc.\n\n[[Plant breeders' rights]] is also a major and controversial issue. Today, production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders, who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in [[intellectual property rights]]. The range of related issues is complex. In the simplest terms, critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that, through a combination of technical and economic pressures, commercial breeders are reducing [[biodiversity]] and significantly constraining individuals (such as farmers) from developing and trading seed on a regional level.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Luby|first=C.

Some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds. Seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results. Isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting. Isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops, plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages (most commonly used when producing F1 hybrids.)\n\n== Role of plant breeding in organic agriculture ==\nCritics of [[organic agriculture]] claim it is too low-yielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture.  However, part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Kevin M. |author2=K.G. Campbell |author3=S.R.

Breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential.  This requires selection for traits such as:<ref name=\"Lammerts 1\" />\n* Water use efficiency\n* Nutrient use efficiency (particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]])\n* Weed competitiveness\n* Tolerance of [[mechanical weed control]]\n* Pest/disease resistance\n* Early maturity (as a mechanism for avoidance of particular stresses)\n* Abiotic stress tolerance (i.e. drought, salinity, etc...)\n\nCurrently, few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection (i.e. selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture).  However, because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large, a given [[genotype]] may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment (see [[gene-environment interaction]]).  If this interaction is severe enough, an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment, which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals.<ref name=\"Murphy\" />  To ensure the most adapted varieties are identified, advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection (i.e. selection in the target environment) for many agronomic traits.\n\nThere are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on [[genetically modified organisms]].  For instance, controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes.  [[Marker assisted selection]] can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired trait(s), greatly speeding up the breeding process.<ref name=\"Lammerts 2\">{{cite journal|last=Lammerts van Bueren|first=E.

Unfortunately, [[molecular markers]] are not currently available for many important traits, especially complex ones controlled by many genes.\n\n== Breeding and food security ==\nFor agriculture to thrive in the future, changes must be made to address arising global issues. These issues are the lack of arable land, increasingly harsh cropping conditions and the need to maintain food security, which involves being able to provide the world population with sufficient nutrition. Crops need to be able to mature in multiple environments to allow worldwide access, which involves solving problems including drought tolerance. It has been suggested that global solutions are achievable through the process of plant breeding, with its ability to select specific genes allowing crops to perform at a level which yields the desired results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhodes |title=Addressing the potential for a selective breeding-based approach in sustainable agriculture |journal=International Journal of Agricultural Research |date=2013 |volume=42 |issue=12 |url=https://scatting.net/scat-clip/6019-shitjessica-scat-spy-scatting-blond-shopscat-fullhd-1080p.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Yield ===\n\nWith an increasing population, the production of food needs to increase with it.  It is estimated that a 70% increase in food production is needed by 2050 in order to meet the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security. But with the degradation of agricultural land, simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option. New varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area. An example of this can be seen in Asia, where food production per capita has increased twofold.  This has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers, but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area.<ref name=\"Tester, Langridge\">{{cite journal|last1=Tester|last2= Langridge|first1= Mark |first2= Peter |title=Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=February 2010 |volume=327 |issue=5967 |pages=818\u2013822 |doi=10.1126/science.1183700 |pmid=20150489|bibcode= 2010Sci...327..818T}}</ref><ref name=\"Godfray, Crute, Haddad, Lawrence, Muir, Pretty, Robinson.

Improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since 1960; this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time, meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker. The main area genetic increases were made was in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) resulting in 0.7-2.5% increase, at just 1% increase in IVDMD a single Bos Taurus also known as beef cattle reported 3.2% increase in daily gains. This improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=B\u00e4nziger|title=Breeding for drought and nitrogen stress tolerance in maize: from theory to practice|journal=From Theory to Practice|year=2000|pages=7\u20139|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HlluklozxuQC&pg=PA6&dq=B%C3%A4nziger,+M.+(2000).+Breeding+for+drought+and+nitrogen+stress+tolerance+in+maize:+from+theory+to+practice.+#v=onepage&q=B%C3%A4nziger%2C%20M.%20(2000).%20Breeding%20for%20drought%20and%20nitrogen%20stress%20tolerance%20in%20maize%3A%20from%20theory%20to%20practice.&f=false|accessdate=2013-11-07|isbn=9789706480460}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental stressors ===\n\nPlant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment. With long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture. Plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions; a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen. It is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security.\n<ref name=\"Casler, Vogal\">{{cite journal|last=Casler, Vogal|first=M.K.|title=Accomplishments and impact from breeding for increased forage nutritional value|journal=Crop Science|date=January\u2013February 1999 |volume=39|issue=1|pages=12\u201320|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/39/1/CS0390010012 |doi=10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183x003900010003x}}</ref>\nIn countries that experience harsh winters such as Iceland, Germany and further east in Europe, plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost, continuous snow-cover, frost-drought (desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost) and high moisture levels in soil in winter.<ref>Link, W.; Balko, C.; Stoddard, F.; Winter hardiness in faba bean: Physiology and breeding.

They are a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group of wizards and witches, led by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who seek to purify the wizarding community by eliminating wizards and witches born to non-magical parents. They attempt to create a new order within the [[Ministry of Magic]] by spreading fear through the wizarding community and murdering those who speak out against them. Their primary opposition are the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]].\n\nDeath Eaters recognise one another by the [[Dark Mark]], a [[sigil]] branded on each of their left forearms that allows Voldemort to summon any of them instantly. Their typical attire includes black hooded robes and black masks. The Death Eaters as a group first appeared in the novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', although individual members of the group, such as [[Severus Snape]], [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] had appeared in earlier books in the series.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Pre-Harry Potter ===\nThe Death Eaters first existed 11 years before the events of the books, torturing and murdering Muggles, as well as anyone who opposed them. They also did this to people who were blood traitors(Ronald Weasley). Around 10 years after the Death Eaters first surfaced, a Seer named [[Sybill Trelawney]] made a prophecy about a boy who would have the power to defeat Voldemort forever. The prophecy could have referred to two different boys, [[Harry Potter]] or [[Neville Longbottom]]; however, Voldemort chose Harry as said in the prophecy, that \"the Dark Lord would mark him as his equal\". As Voldemort was a half-blood, he chose his \"equal\", Harry, whose mother was a Muggle-born witch, instead of Neville, who came from a long line of pure-blooded wizards. Acting on information from [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]]'s Secret-Keeper [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], Voldemort attempted to complete the prophecy and kill his infant rival. Due to Harry's mother's sacrifice to save her son, Voldemort's deadly curse rebounded off Harry and disembodied Voldemort.\n\nWith Voldemort vanquished after failing to kill Harry Potter, the Death Eaters largely disbanded and vanished. The Ministry rounded many of them up and imprisoned them in the Wizarding prison [[Azkaban]],  but some eluded justice by claiming they were bewitched by the [[Imperius Curse]] (it is implied that Lucius Malfoy did so) or by turning in other Death Eaters, as [[#Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] did; Harry witnesses Karkaroff's testimony against former Death Eaters in [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Pensieve]] during the course of the series. It appears that very few Death Eaters stood for their fallen master and proudly went to Azkaban for him (like [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]), since, in the sixth book, Snape states that if Voldemort had refused to welcome back all those who turned their backs on him when he fell, then he would have very few followers. The Lestranges are the only Death Eaters known to have willingly sacrificed their freedom for Voldemort. Voldemort takes notice of this and claims that they will be rewarded above all others for their great loyalty.  Snape's position as a Death Eater is unique - during the books he convinces all (with the exception of Dumbledore) that he is working for whichever side requires it at that time.  This is due to his skill at [[Occlumency]] allowing him to disguise his true motive - a love for Lily Potter - from Voldemort.\n\n=== Re-emergence ===\nEarly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' a group of Death Eaters rallied after the [[Quidditch World Cup]]. They gathered to form a large spectacle and disturbance which spread instant chaos and fear amongst the wizarding community. Their appearance alone created hysteria, and their numbers grew while they tortured Muggles and Muggle-borns on site. It concluded when the Dark Mark was produced in the sky by Barty Crouch Jr, frightening Death Eaters and Ministry officials alike.\n[[File:Morkets MerkeTMB2007.png|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nVoldemort, having regained his full strength at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', summoned his followers to him by touching Peter Pettigrew's Dark Mark. Except for Severus Snape (who was staying at Hogwarts to \"maintain his cover\") and those dead, imprisoned, or afraid to return, the majority returned to his service as Voldemort began his second attempt to claim all power.\n\nVoldemort states at his rebirth, \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters...three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return...he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever...he will be killed, of course...and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\"\nBased on mentions and later happenings in the books, it can be deduced that the one \"too cowardly to return\" is Igor Karkaroff. The one \"who I believe has left me forever\" is Severus Snape, who returns two hours later to explain his absence and convince Voldemort that he is a spy for him. The \"most faithful servant\" is Barty Crouch Jr., who has already been in place at Hogwarts working for Voldemort. The three dead include Evan Rosier, Wilkes and Regulus Black.\n\nThe Minister of Magic ([[Cornelius Fudge]]) deluded himself into believing that Voldemort could not have come back and that it was all a lie cooked up by Dumbledore, who Fudge believed had designs on his political office. The Death Eaters use this tactical advantage throughout ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' to maintain their secrecy. Because of the Ministry's refusal to remove the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementors]] from Azkaban, which Dumbledore advised immediately following Voldemort's return, the Death Eaters recruited the Dementors to their cause and made similar progress with the giants; the Dementors' revolt against the Ministry of Magic also allowed the Death Eaters to bolster their ranks with the mass break-out of several imprisoned Death Eaters, including Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nIn ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Voldemort sent a group of twelve Death Eaters, led by [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], into the Department of Mysteries, where he expected them to secure a prophecy of vital importance to him: having originally attacked Harry Potter based upon a partial recounting of it, he now wanted to hear the full version to better, or even fully, understand the connection between Harry and himself.  The raid on the Department failed, however; Harry Potter and his friends delayed the Death Eaters and kept the prophecy out of their hands, finally destroying it, and were eventually aided by Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore captured eleven of the twelve Death Eaters, sending Voldemort and Bellatrix fleeing after a fierce duel with the former, and ending the Death Eaters' enjoyed secrecy.  Lucius, who had been important both to the Death Eaters and within the Ministry, was captured and imprisoned.  However, the Death Eaters regrouped, assassinating and kidnapping important wizards, killing [[Muggle]]s, and in general spreading terror and chaos through the Wizarding world.  Soon after Lucius' capture, his son Draco Malfoy is made a Death Eater, and given the task of killing Albus Dumbledore, although this task is eventually performed by Severus Snape.\n\nTowards the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts for the first time, leading to the death of Albus Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school's defenders.  A second, more deadly attack near the conclusion of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' resulted in over 50 deaths, including Voldemort, who died when the Killing Curse he threw at Harry rebounded on him.  Voldemort's death signalled the end of all Death Eaters.\n\n=== Ideology ===\nVoldemort's Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic. They follow a [[Racism|racist]] ideology that places pure-blooded wizards at the top of a [[racial hierarchy]], above all other magical or non-magical people and entities. They believe wizards are, as a genealogy book within the story phrases it, \"Nature's Nobility\"; other magical creatures and the non-magical are inferior and should be subjugated. Within the wizarding community, only those who are born to wizard parents are worthy of magical power, despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such powers. They categorise wizards according to [[Blood traitor|blood purity]]; \"pure bloods\" (those with only wizards as parents) out-rank \"half-bloods\" (mixed parentage) and \"mudbloods\", a derogatory name for those born to non-magical parents ([[Muggles]]). Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them. Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], the Prewett brothers, who were murdered because of their loyalties, and the entire Weasley family. Such people are often called \"blood traitors\" by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies.\n\nIn reality, the idea of blood purity is a misnomer \u2013 Voldemort himself is a [[Half-blood (Harry Potter)|half-blood]] \u2013 and it is unlikely that all of them could be pure-bloods, as very few, if any, such people could exist given the small gene pool. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Rowling depicts the Gaunts as a family who are obsessed with their ancestry and driven to inbreeding to preserve its integrity. Rowling has stated on her website that there are no true pure-blood families left but that those who call themselves such simply strike Muggles, [[Squib (Harry Potter)|Squibs]], and half-bloods from their family records. On the other hand, \"in rare circumstances\" a Muggle-born wizard can become a Death Eater.<ref name=\"JKRfestival\">{{cite web|author1=J.K.Rowling Official Site|title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|accessdate=8 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222074210/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|archivedate=22 December 2011|date=15 August 2004}}</ref> They are also not above recruiting creatures they deem inferior, as proven by [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] [[#Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and the [[Gurg|giant]] clan from continental Europe, as long as they help further the larger Death Eater agenda.\n\nThe Death Eaters seek complete power and control over the entire Wizarding world, wishing to restrict leadership to a small band of pure-bloods. The Death Eaters not only seek the restoration of pure-blood rule over the Wizarding community, but also the eventual subjugation of the Muggle community under Wizarding rule.  During their control over the Ministry of Magic, they severely persecuted Muggle-born wizards, sending them to Azkaban for life or feeding them to Dementors.\n\n=== Death Eaters and their crimes ===\n<!-- NOTE: Narcissa Malfoy is NOT!! a Death Eater, as stated by J.K.

Amycus is described as being squat and lumpy, with a lopsided leer and a wheezy giggle; Alecto is described as a \"stocky little woman\" and shares her brother's squatness and laugh. It is said that after Voldemort's first downfall, they believed that he was gone forever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |title=Rowling's website FAQ about Carrows |accessdate=8 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510030650/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |archivedate=10 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Alecto and Amycus become \"teachers\" at Hogwarts, severely disciplining students who oppose Voldemort. Amycus teaches [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], but as [[Neville Longbottom]] puts it, it becomes just \"[[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|The Dark Arts]]\" in which students are forced to perform the [[Cruciatus Curse]] against students who have been assigned to detention. Alecto teaches [[Muggle Studies]], which becomes a compulsory subject, and teaches students that [[Muggle]]s are like animals. Right before the Battle of Hogwarts, Alecto waits in Ravenclaw Tower on Voldemort's orders, preparing to capture Harry, but is stunned by [[Luna Lovegood]] after touching her Dark Mark to summon Voldemort. Amycus, after seeing what happened, tries to conspire with [[Minerva McGonagall]] who helped him into the room to offer some Ravenclaw students as sacrifices to Voldemort while planning to use the lie that Ravenclaws had ambushed Alecto and forced her to press her Dark Mark. McGonagall refuses and argues with Amycus, who spits in her face. Enraged at this, Harry casts the Cruciatus Curse, with such power that Amycus passes out. Later, McGonagall places the Imperius Curse on him, then binds him with his sister and places him inside a net.\n\n[[Ralph Ineson]] plays Amycus, and [[Suzie Toase]] appears as Alecto in the films, wherein they are reduced to non-speaking roles. In the second part of the final film, Snape deflects a spell from McGonagall which hits the Carrows, possibly to protect the students from their abuses and to show his allegiance to Dumbledore.\n\n=== Barty Crouch Jr. ===\n'''Bartemius \"Barty\" Crouch, Junior''' was captured with [[Bellatrix Lestrange and Rodolophus Lestrange]], who tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom, parents of [[Neville Longbottom]], into insanity. His father, [[Barty Crouch Sr.]], who headed the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the time, sentenced him to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. However, he later rescues his son as a favour to his dying wife. When they visit him in Azkaban, Mrs. Crouch used Polyjuice Potion to switch appearances with her son, enabling him to escape while she remains in his place. When she dies, she is buried under his identity. Crouch Jr. is nursed back to health by [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Winky|Winky]], the family's [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#House-elves|house-elf]].\n\nTo prevent him from returning to Voldemort's service, Crouch Sr. controls his son with the Imperius Curse and keeps him hidden under an [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]]. When [[Bertha Jorkins]] discovers the truth, the news reaches Voldemort, who rescues Crouch Jr. and puts Crouch Sr. under the Imperius Curse. Crouch Jr. then imprisons [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody]], a famous auror, and using Polyjuice Potion, assumes Moody's appearance and position to infiltrate Hogwarts as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Despite not being a real teacher, Crouch Jr. does a fair job and the class learns vast amounts from him, including valuable knowledge related to the three \"unforgivable curses\". Crouch Sr. escapes and, exhausted and delirious from the Imperius Curse, reaches Hogwarts to tell Dumbledore about Voldemort's return; but his loyal Death-Eater son murders him on the castle grounds, transfigures the body into a bone, and buries the bone in freshly turned earth in front of Hagrid's cabin.<ref>Rowling, J.K. ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' (New York: Arthur A. Levine Books, 2000), pages 690 and 691</ref>\n\nThe revived Triwizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts, and Voldemort tasks Crouch Jr. with making sure Harry wins. To do so, he bewitches [[Viktor Krum]] to attack [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] in the maze and to stun [[Fleur Delacour]]. When Harry and Cedric simultaneously touch the Triwizard Cup, which is a [[Portkeys|portkey]], it transports them to the graveyard in Little Hangleton, home of the Riddle family. There, after killing Cedric, [[Scabbers|Death Eater Peter Pettigrew]] uses Harry's blood in a ritual that re-embodies Voldemort. The Dark Lord attempts to kill Harry, but with the help of the ghost-echoes from Voldemort's wand, Harry escapes via the Portkey.\n\nWhen Harry reappears at Hogwarts, the still-disguised Crouch Jr. hopes to succeed where his master failed; but Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall foil his plot. Under the effects of [[Veritaserum]], he recounts his plan to them. Although he is closely guarded so he can later repeat his testimony, a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementor]] acting as bodyguard to Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] attacks Crouch and sucks out his soul before anyone can stop it. Crouch lives bereft of his memories or sense of self.\n\nHe is played by [[David Tennant]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.\n\n=== Antonin Dolohov ===\n'''Antonin Dolohov''' has a long, pale, and twisted face, with a name that suggests he is of Slavic descent. He is confirmed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' to be one of Voldemort's first Death Eaters, being present at the Hog's Head when Voldemort comes to Hogwarts to request a teaching position and hide the [[diadem]] [[Horcrux]], c. 1956. This makes him at least sixty years old at the time of the battle in the Department of Mysteries. Dolohov is one of the five Death Eaters who murder [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)#Synopsis|Gideon and Fabian Prewett]] ([[Molly Weasley]]'s brothers). He also tortures many [[Muggle]]s and opponents of Voldemort during the first war. Dolohov is imprisoned in Azkaban but escapes during the mass break-out.\n\nHe participates in the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]], where he causes injury to Hermione, but is imprisoned again, and returns to [[Azkaban]] prison. He escapes once more some time before the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. He tracks Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a Muggle cafe after they use Voldemort's name (which had recently been made taboo). He and his companion Rowle are stunned, and have their memories erased by Hermione and then are punished by Voldemort. Dolohov participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, killing [[Remus Lupin]],<ref name=webchat/> whom [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] last sees fighting with him. He is also seen dueling with [[Dean Thomas (Harry Potter)|Dean Thomas]] until [[Parvati Patil]] uses the Body-bind Curse on him. Dolohov and Yaxley are later sent to look for Harry, and they mistakenly thought the boy would not give himself up. When the battle recommences, [[Professor Flitwick]] finally defeats him.\n\nHe is portrayed by [[Arben Bajraktaraj]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]''.\n\n=== Fenrir Greyback ===\n'''Fenrir Greyback''' is a [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] who is involved with the Death Eaters. He works alongside Lord Voldemort because Lord Voldemort promises fairness to werewolves around the country. He does not carry the Dark Mark as he is not a Death Eater.<ref name=\"HP7ref\"/> He is known as the most savage werewolf ever to live and is greatly feared throughout the wizarding world. He positions himself close to his victims when the moon is almost full. To fulfil his agenda of creating as many werewolves as possible, Greyback has infected scores of people including the young [[Remus Lupin]], when Lupin's father had angered Greyback. Greyback is known for targeting young children. Unlike most werewolves, Greyback thirsts for blood even in his human form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Greyback first appears on the night of Dumbledore's death, when he attacks Harry and badly scars [[Bill Weasley]]. Although Greyback does not transmit his [[lycanthropy]] because he was in human form at the time, Bill is subsequently shown to display a preference for very [[rare meat]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Greyback leads a Snatcher gang \u2013 Dark wizards looking for [[Muggle-born]]s and \"Undesirables\" in exchange for gold. When Harry accidentally uses Voldemort's name after it has been made taboo, Greyback is alerted and his gang attacks their camp. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are kidnapped by the Snatchers and are taken to [[Malfoy Manor]]. [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] promises Hermione to Greyback in return for his services, but the prisoners fight their way out and escape, Greyback being hit by a triple Stunning Spell. Greyback is the main werewolf within the pack that agrees to aid Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Hermione, using a blasting curse, prevents Greyback from attacking injured [[Lavender Brown (Harry Potter)|Lavender Brown]], and a crystal ball thrown by [[Professor Trelawney]] stuns him. He rejoins the battle in time for the Death Eaters' last stand, when [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] combine forces to take him down by magic.\n\n[[Dave Legeno]] portrayed Greyback in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. He reprised the role in both parts of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.\n\n=== Igor Karkaroff ===\n'''Igor Karkaroff''' ([[Cyrillic]]: \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432) is the Headmaster at [[Durmstrang]] Institute, one of the three schools (together with Hogwarts and [[Beauxbatons]] Academy) that enter the Triwizard Tournament. As Headmaster, Karkaroff is also one of the judges. He is described as a neat, fussy-looking man with an oily voice and manner who sports a small grey goatee. While unctuously pleasant most of the time, he is capable of violent rage. He is also described as \"a man with yellowish teeth whose smile does not reach his cold stare\". Karkaroff is angered and threatens to withdraw from the tournament when Harry is selected as a fourth champion and second representative for Hogwarts.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch17\">{{HP4}}, chapter 17</ref> Although he is talked down and agrees to stay, he nevertheless shows evident favouritism towards the Durmstrang champion, Bulgarian [[Quidditch]] player [[Viktor Krum]].\n[[Sirius Black]] later identifies Karkaroff as a former Death Eater.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch19\">{{HP4}}, chapter 19</ref> Karkaroff was captured by [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. Karkaroff later told the [[Ministry of Magic]] that he had seen the error of his ways, and \"named names\", putting many people in Azkaban in exchange for his freedom.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch30\">{{HP4}}, chapter 30</ref> Karkaroff is thus also hated by the Death Eaters. Karkaroff's history gives him a connection with [[Severus Snape|Snape]], also a former Death Eater. Karkaroff interrupts a Potions lesson demanding to talk to Snape, and shows him his Dark Mark reappearing. He also apparently has an unpleasant history with Alastor Moody, and tries to avoid him unsuccessfully for the entirety of the tournament, not knowing that it is Barty Crouch Jr. in disguise.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch27\">{{HP4}}, chapter 27</ref> At the end of the novel, following Voldemort's return, Karkaroff goes into hiding, leaving behind his student charges at Durmstrang. In the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Remus Lupin]] states that Karkaroff was found dead in a shack with the Dark Mark hovering over it, an indication that he was killed by other Death Eaters. Lupin also expresses surprise that Karkaroff managed to live even a year after deserting Voldemort and that no one else has been known to avoid capture quite as long.\n\n[[Predrag Bjelac]] appeared as Karkaroff in the film adaptation of ''Goblet of Fire''.\n\nHARRY POTTER IS DEAD!\n\n=== Draco Malfoy ===\n{{Main|Draco Malfoy}} Draco Malfoy is the pure blooded son of [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]]. He was a notorious bully to Harry Potter and his friends because Hermione has Muggle parents, Draco was also assigned to kill Dumbledore, but his heart told him otherwise and Snape had to do it for him. Draco, like his family, is part of Slytherin house.\n\n===Lucius Malfoy===\n'''Lucius Malfoy''' is a Death Eater, head of a wealthy [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|pure-blood]] wizarding family and a psychopath; he lives with his wife [[Narcissa Malfoy]] (n\u00e9e Black) and their son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] at the [[Malfoy Manor]] in Wiltshire. Lucius was a [[trustee|school governor]] of Hogwarts before being sacked, and has very close connections at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. To maintain his reputation and influence, he makes donations to the Ministry, to charity, and to [[St Mungo's (Harry Potter)|St Mungo's Hospital]]. He was educated at Hogwarts, where he was a prefect in Slytherin House.\n\nHe debuts as the main antagonist in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', in which just before Draco and Harry's second year at Hogwarts, Lucius plants [[Tom Riddle's diary]] in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s [[Potions Class|potions]] cauldron while she is shopping for school supplies at [[Flourish & Blotts]], in a plot to use her to reopen the [[Chamber of Secrets]], which would lead to attacks on [[Muggle-born]] students.\n\nLucius knows the diary is cleverly enchanted, but is not aware that it is a [[horcrux]] containing a part of Voldemort's soul. He is careless with it and punished by Voldemort himself. Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father, [[Arthur Weasley]], and Dumbledore. Lucius' plans are ultimately thwarted with the help of the Malfoys' [[house-elf]] Dobby, and Harry, but not before the Chamber is opened and Lucius uses the ensuing terror (and threats to attack their families) to influence the school's Board of Governors to discredit and dismiss Dumbledore as Headmaster.\n\nSubsequently, Harry tricks Lucius into setting Dobby free. Upon this, Lucius attempts to attack Harry with his wand but Dobby disarms him before he can do any harm. Lucius is ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor. Despite his sacking, he still maintains strong ties with the Ministry of Magic.\n\nLucius next appears in the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' during the [[Quidditch]] World Cup, sharing prime seats in the Top Box with Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Later in that book, when Voldemort rises again and summons his Death Eaters, Malfoy rejoins him and asserts that he had done everything he could to help his master, who however remains unimpressed. Harry reports Malfoy's declarations to Minister Fudge, who refuses to believe him. Thus, the wealthy Malfoy continues to maintain strong ties with the Ministry.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch36\">{{HP4}}, chapter 36</ref>\n\nDuring the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Malfoy is the leader of the Death Eaters who are sent to retrieve the prophecy from Harry in the Hall of Prophecy. Lucius tries several ways to get the prophecy from Harry without breaking it, but the boy and his friends manage to escape from the Hall. Malfoy finally meets him in the Death Chamber, where Harry is about to give it to Malfoy when the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]] breaks into the Ministry and begins to duel with the Death Eaters. Dumbledore himself arrives at the end of the battle and Malfoy is captured and sent to Azkaban.\n\nBy the final book, Voldemort has given Malfoy his freedom, though he looks significantly the worse for wear, having lost Voldemort's favour. Voldemort treats him with great contempt by hijacking his house for Headquarters, and is forcing his son to do dark deeds against his nature, sparking sympathy for the notorious family for the first time in the series. Voldemort borrows Lucius' wand which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter. Later in the book, Lucius, along with his wife and sister-in-law, accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor. Voldemort punishes them severely, eventually putting them under house arrest.\n\nDespite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort's advocate of pure-blood supremacy, Lucius has decided his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he pleads with Voldemort to let him onto the battlefield to locate his son. He and the rest of his family are reunited at the end of the book. Following Voldemort's death, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco all manage to \"''weasel their way out''\" of being sent to Azkaban due to Narcissa's aiding Harry in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].<ref name=\"webchat\" />\n\nAccording to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, in 2006, Lucius Malfoy was number 12<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS NUMBER. LOOK AT THE SOURCE. --> on their [[Forbes Fictional 15]] list.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120629090429/http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/20/lucius-malfoy-money-tech-media_cx_de_06fict15_potter.html Forbes Fictional 15, No.&nbsp;12 Malfoy, Lucius]</ref>\n\nIn the film series, Lucius is portrayed by [[Jason Isaacs]] as an adult. Scenes with Tony Coburn as a teenage Lucius were cut from the final movie.<ref>[http://harrypotterspage.com/news.php/2008/05/03/tony-coburn-as-young-lucius-malfoy-in-half-blood-prince123.html Tony Coburn \u2013 Young Lucius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525222133/http://harrypotterspage.com/news.php/2008/05/03/tony-coburn-as-young-lucius-malfoy-in-half-blood-prince123.html|date=25 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIGN listed Lucius as their fifteenth top ''Harry Potter'' character, praising Jason Isaacs' portrayal of him.<ref name=\"IGN Top\"/>\n\n=== Peter Pettigrew ===\n'''Peter Pettigrew''', nicknamed '''Wormtail''', is the only Death Eater known to have been in a House other than Slytherin (Gryffindor) while at Hogwarts. There, he was a close friend of [[Sirius Black]], [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and [[Remus Lupin]], although he was the least intelligent and least talented of the group. With Sirius and James' help, Pettigrew becomes an [[Animagus]], with the ability to transform at will into a [[rat]]. After leaving Hogwarts, Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort, and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort's spy within the Order of the Phoenix, of which Pettigrew is a member. When the Potters know that their son, Harry, is Voldemort's target, Sirius suggests to them to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper because he does not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a \"weak, talentless thing\" like Pettigrew. Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that leads to James and Lily's death (and ironically, Voldemort's near-destruction). Sirius seeks revenge on Pettigrew, but during the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potters' deaths, murders twelve Muggles, and cuts off his own index finger before transforming into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters, as well as for his own murder and that of the bystanders. Pettigrew is (seemingly posthumously) awarded the Order of Merlin, and hides during the next twelve years. Wanting to keep an eye on the wizarding world, he masquerades as a rat, first as [[Percy Weasley]]'s pet, and then as [[Ron Weasley]]'s. In this form (named \"Scabbers\" by the family), he is missing a toe from one paw due to the finger he cut off.\n\nAlthough Pettigrew appears in the first two books in the form of Scabbers, his identity is not revealed until ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in which he is the main antagonist. When a photograph of the Weasley family appears in the ''Daily Prophet'' newspaper, Sirius recognises Pettigrew's Animagus form and escapes from Azkaban to track him down. The two confront each other in the [[Shrieking Shack]], where Lupin and Black compel Scabbers to resume his human form. Pettigrew confesses his treachery, claiming to have committed it only to save his own life. With Sirius and Lupin about to take their revenge, Harry begs Sirius to turn Pettigrew over to the Ministry of Magic instead, to prove Sirius' innocence. Pettigrew escapes while being led out of the Shack when Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Harry's actions result in Pettigrew owing him a life debt.\n\nPettigrew returns to the service of Voldemort, seeking him out in the forests of [[Albania]] and helping him to return to a feeble baby's body. He abducts a Ministry of Magic employee named [[Bertha Jorkins]], who is able to provide Voldemort with valuable information. Pettigrew (almost always referred to as \"Wormtail\" hereafter) assists [[#Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] in overpowering [[Mad-Eye Moody]], setting up the events in the fourth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. In the climactic confrontation in that book, Wormtail murders [[List of Harry Potter supporting characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] on Voldemort's orders, and brews the complex potion to regenerate Voldemort, severing his hand as one of the ingredients. Upon his return to corporeal form, Voldemort replaces Wormtail's missing hand with a silver one that possesses five intact fingers and great strength. Despite his actions, Wormtail's fortunes remain low; in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' Snape treats him as a servant, and in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' he is tasked with keeping watch over prisoners in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. While Harry and Ron are being kept there, Wormtail checks on the prisoners and is attacked. Wormtail begins strangling Harry with the silver hand, but when reminded by Harry that he once saved his life, Wormtail hesitates for a moment. The silver hand turns against him and strangles him to death as punishment for his moment of pity. Harry Potter thinks of him and describes it as having regrets.\n\nPettigrew is portrayed by [[Timothy Spall]] as an adult, and by [[Charles Hughes (actor)|Charles Hughes]] as a teenager in the films. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'', Pettigrew is not strangled to death by his own silver hand in Malfoy Manor as in the book; he is instead struck by Dobby and collapses. It is unknown whether he was simply stunned or killed. He only appears in a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.\n\n[[IGN]]'s Joe Utichi also listed him as his 10th top ''Harry Potter'' character.<ref name=\"Joe Top\" />\n\n=== Severus Snape ===\n{{Main|Severus Snape}}\n'''Severus Snape''' is characterised as a person of considerable complexity, whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish. In the first novel of the series, Snape is a teacher who is hostile from the start toward [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] and is built up to be the primary [[antagonist]] until the final chapters. As the series progresses, Snape's portrayal evolves from that of a malicious and partisan teacher to that of a complex, pivotal character of moral ambiguity, whose true loyalties are not revealed until the end. Snape is, as revealed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', actually a spy in Voldemort's ranks for Dumbledore.\n\n=== Corban Yaxley ===\n'''Corban'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pottermore Presents - Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists, Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> '''Yaxley''' is the brutal-faced Death Eater who is present in the battle in which Snape killed Dumbledore. He is one of the more prominent Death Eaters, and one of Voldemort's spies in the [[Ministry of Magic]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Yaxley is invited to Malfoy Manor to witness the murder of [[Charity Burbage]], and argues with Snape about the correct date of Harry's departure from the Dursleys', but [[John Dawlish]], an Auror who is tricked by an Order member, gives him incorrect information. Yaxley announces to an impressed assemblage of Death Eaters that he has placed the Imperius Curse upon [[Pius Thicknesse]], the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He uses Thicknesse to Imperius the other major department heads and they allow Voldemort to murder [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]; thus Thicknesse becomes Minister for Magic.\n\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione, disguised as ministry officials, enter the Ministry to find Slytherin's locket, it is revealed that Yaxley has become Head of Magical Law Enforcement. He also assists [[Dolores Umbridge]] in leading the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and the two seem to have a good relationship, together humiliating the Muggle-borns. Both are immobilised by Harry, but Yaxley recovers and grabs Hermione while she is Apparating her friends to safety. Yaxley arrives with them at Grimmauld Place, allowing him to reveal their headquarters to the Death Eaters, but not to the location that the trio subsequently Apparate to.\n\nHe participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he duels with [[Professor Flitwick]] and is later seen among those who wait with Voldemort for Harry Potter to come to him, mistakenly believing that Harry would not come within the allotted time.

They are a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] group of wizards and witches, led by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who seek to purify the wizarding community by eliminating wizards and witches born to non-magical parents. They attempt to create a new order within the [[Ministry of Magic]] by spreading fear through the wizarding community and murdering those who speak out against them. Their primary opposition are the members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]].\n\nDeath Eaters recognise one another by the [[Dark Mark]], a [[sigil]] branded on each of their left forearms that allows Voldemort to summon any of them instantly. Their typical attire includes black hooded robes and black masks. The Death Eaters as a group first appeared in the novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', although individual members of the group, such as [[Severus Snape]], [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] had appeared in earlier books in the series.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n=== Pre-Harry Potter ===\nThe Death Eaters first existed 11 years before the events of the books, torturing and murdering Muggles, as well as anyone who opposed them. They also did this to people who were blood traitors(Ronald Weasley). Around 10 years after the Death Eaters first surfaced, a Seer named [[Sybill Trelawney]] made a prophecy about a boy who would have the power to defeat Voldemort forever. The prophecy could have referred to two different boys, [[Harry Potter]] or [[Neville Longbottom]]; however, Voldemort chose Harry as said in the prophecy, that \"the Dark Lord would mark him as his equal\". As Voldemort was a half-blood, he chose his \"equal\", Harry, whose mother was a Muggle-born witch, instead of Neville, who came from a long line of pure-blooded wizards. Acting on information from [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]]'s Secret-Keeper [[#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], Voldemort attempted to complete the prophecy and kill his infant rival. Due to Harry's mother's sacrifice to save her son, Voldemort's deadly curse rebounded off Harry and disembodied Voldemort.\n\nWith Voldemort vanquished after failing to kill Harry Potter, the Death Eaters largely disbanded and vanished. The Ministry rounded many of them up and imprisoned them in the Wizarding prison [[Azkaban]],  but some eluded justice by claiming they were bewitched by the [[Imperius Curse]] (it is implied that Lucius Malfoy did so) or by turning in other Death Eaters, as [[#Igor Karkaroff|Igor Karkaroff]] did; Harry witnesses Karkaroff's testimony against former Death Eaters in [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Pensieve]] during the course of the series. It appears that very few Death Eaters stood for their fallen master and proudly went to Azkaban for him (like [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]]), since, in the sixth book, Snape states that if Voldemort had refused to welcome back all those who turned their backs on him when he fell, then he would have very few followers. The Lestranges are the only Death Eaters known to have willingly sacrificed their freedom for Voldemort. Voldemort takes notice of this and claims that they will be rewarded above all others for their great loyalty.  Snape's position as a Death Eater is unique - during the books he convinces all (with the exception of Dumbledore) that he is working for whichever side requires it at that time.  This is due to his skill at [[Occlumency]] allowing him to disguise his true motive - a love for Lily Potter - from Voldemort.\n\n=== Re-emergence ===\nEarly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' a group of Death Eaters rallied after the [[Quidditch World Cup]]. They gathered to form a large spectacle and disturbance which spread instant chaos and fear amongst the wizarding community. Their appearance alone created hysteria, and their numbers grew while they tortured Muggles and Muggle-borns on site. It concluded when the Dark Mark was produced in the sky by Barty Crouch Jr, frightening Death Eaters and Ministry officials alike.\n[[File:Morkets MerkeTMB2007.png|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\nVoldemort, having regained his full strength at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', summoned his followers to him by touching Peter Pettigrew's Dark Mark. Except for Severus Snape (who was staying at Hogwarts to \"maintain his cover\") and those dead, imprisoned, or afraid to return, the majority returned to his service as Voldemort began his second attempt to claim all power.\n\nVoldemort states at his rebirth, \"And here we have six missing Death Eaters...three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return...he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever...he will be killed, of course...and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\"\nBased on mentions and later happenings in the books, it can be deduced that the one \"too cowardly to return\" is Igor Karkaroff. The one \"who I believe has left me forever\" is Severus Snape, who returns two hours later to explain his absence and convince Voldemort that he is a spy for him. The \"most faithful servant\" is Barty Crouch Jr., who has already been in place at Hogwarts working for Voldemort. The three dead include Evan Rosier, Wilkes and Regulus Black.\n\nThe Minister of Magic ([[Cornelius Fudge]]) deluded himself into believing that Voldemort could not have come back and that it was all a lie cooked up by Dumbledore, who Fudge believed had designs on his political office. The Death Eaters use this tactical advantage throughout ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' to maintain their secrecy. Because of the Ministry's refusal to remove the [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementors]] from Azkaban, which Dumbledore advised immediately following Voldemort's return, the Death Eaters recruited the Dementors to their cause and made similar progress with the giants; the Dementors' revolt against the Ministry of Magic also allowed the Death Eaters to bolster their ranks with the mass break-out of several imprisoned Death Eaters, including Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nIn ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Voldemort sent a group of twelve Death Eaters, led by [[#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], into the Department of Mysteries, where he expected them to secure a prophecy of vital importance to him: having originally attacked Harry Potter based upon a partial recounting of it, he now wanted to hear the full version to better, or even fully, understand the connection between Harry and himself.  The raid on the Department failed, however; Harry Potter and his friends delayed the Death Eaters and kept the prophecy out of their hands, finally destroying it, and were eventually aided by Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore captured eleven of the twelve Death Eaters, sending Voldemort and Bellatrix fleeing after a fierce duel with the former, and ending the Death Eaters' enjoyed secrecy.  Lucius, who had been important both to the Death Eaters and within the Ministry, was captured and imprisoned.  However, the Death Eaters regrouped, assassinating and kidnapping important wizards, killing [[Muggle]]s, and in general spreading terror and chaos through the Wizarding world.  Soon after Lucius' capture, his son Draco Malfoy is made a Death Eater, and given the task of killing Albus Dumbledore, although this task is eventually performed by Severus Snape.\n\nTowards the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts for the first time, leading to the death of Albus Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school's defenders.  A second, more deadly attack near the conclusion of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' resulted in over 50 deaths, including Voldemort, who died when the Killing Curse he threw at Harry rebounded on him.  Voldemort's death signalled the end of all Death Eaters.\n\n=== Ideology ===\nVoldemort's Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic. They follow a [[Racism|racist]] ideology that places pure-blooded wizards at the top of a [[racial hierarchy]], above all other magical or non-magical people and entities. They believe wizards are, as a genealogy book within the story phrases it, \"Nature's Nobility\"; other magical creatures and the non-magical are inferior and should be subjugated. Within the wizarding community, only those who are born to wizard parents are worthy of magical power, despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such powers. They categorise wizards according to [[Blood traitor|blood purity]]; \"pure bloods\" (those with only wizards as parents) out-rank \"half-bloods\" (mixed parentage) and \"mudbloods\", a derogatory name for those born to non-magical parents ([[Muggles]]). Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them. Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], the Prewett brothers, who were murdered because of their loyalties, and the entire Weasley family. Such people are often called \"blood traitors\" by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies.\n\nIn reality, the idea of blood purity is a misnomer \u2013 Voldemort himself is a [[Half-blood (Harry Potter)|half-blood]] \u2013 and it is unlikely that all of them could be pure-bloods, as very few, if any, such people could exist given the small gene pool. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', Rowling depicts the Gaunts as a family who are obsessed with their ancestry and driven to inbreeding to preserve its integrity. Rowling has stated on her website that there are no true pure-blood families left but that those who call themselves such simply strike Muggles, [[Squib (Harry Potter)|Squibs]], and half-bloods from their family records. On the other hand, \"in rare circumstances\" a Muggle-born wizard can become a Death Eater.<ref name=\"JKRfestival\">{{cite web|author1=J.K.Rowling Official Site|title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|accessdate=8 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222074210/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|archivedate=22 December 2011|date=15 August 2004}}</ref> They are also not above recruiting creatures they deem inferior, as proven by [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] [[#Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] and the [[Gurg|giant]] clan from continental Europe, as long as they help further the larger Death Eater agenda.\n\nThe Death Eaters seek complete power and control over the entire Wizarding world, wishing to restrict leadership to a small band of pure-bloods. The Death Eaters not only seek the restoration of pure-blood rule over the Wizarding community, but also the eventual subjugation of the Muggle community under Wizarding rule.  During their control over the Ministry of Magic, they severely persecuted Muggle-born wizards, sending them to Azkaban for life or feeding them to Dementors.\n\n=== Death Eaters and their crimes ===\n<!-- NOTE: Narcissa Malfoy is NOT!! a Death Eater, as stated by J.K.

Amycus is described as being squat and lumpy, with a lopsided leer and a wheezy giggle; Alecto is described as a \"stocky little woman\" and shares her brother's squatness and laugh. It is said that after Voldemort's first downfall, they believed that he was gone forever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |title=Rowling's website FAQ about Carrows |accessdate=8 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510030650/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=116 |archivedate=10 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Alecto and Amycus become \"teachers\" at Hogwarts, severely disciplining students who oppose Voldemort. Amycus teaches [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], but as [[Neville Longbottom]] puts it, it becomes just \"[[Dark Arts (Harry Potter)|The Dark Arts]]\" in which students are forced to perform the [[Cruciatus Curse]] against students who have been assigned to detention. Alecto teaches [[Muggle Studies]], which becomes a compulsory subject, and teaches students that [[Muggle]]s are like animals. Right before the Battle of Hogwarts, Alecto waits in Ravenclaw Tower on Voldemort's orders, preparing to capture Harry, but is stunned by [[Luna Lovegood]] after touching her Dark Mark to summon Voldemort. Amycus, after seeing what happened, tries to conspire with [[Minerva McGonagall]] who helped him into the room to offer some Ravenclaw students as sacrifices to Voldemort while planning to use the lie that Ravenclaws had ambushed Alecto and forced her to press her Dark Mark. McGonagall refuses and argues with Amycus, who spits in her face. Enraged at this, Harry casts the Cruciatus Curse, with such power that Amycus passes out. Later, McGonagall places the Imperius Curse on him, then binds him with his sister and places him inside a net.\n\n[[Ralph Ineson]] plays Amycus, and [[Suzie Toase]] appears as Alecto in the films, wherein they are reduced to non-speaking roles. In the second part of the final film, Snape deflects a spell from McGonagall which hits the Carrows, possibly to protect the students from their abuses and to show his allegiance to Dumbledore.\n\n=== Barty Crouch Jr. ===\n'''Bartemius \"Barty\" Crouch, Junior''' was captured with [[Bellatrix Lestrange and Rodolophus Lestrange]], who tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom, parents of [[Neville Longbottom]], into insanity. His father, [[Barty Crouch Sr.]], who headed the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the time, sentenced him to life imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. However, he later rescues his son as a favour to his dying wife. When they visit him in Azkaban, Mrs. Crouch used Polyjuice Potion to switch appearances with her son, enabling him to escape while she remains in his place. When she dies, she is buried under his identity. Crouch Jr. is nursed back to health by [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Winky|Winky]], the family's [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#House-elves|house-elf]].\n\nTo prevent him from returning to Voldemort's service, Crouch Sr. controls his son with the Imperius Curse and keeps him hidden under an [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]]. When [[Bertha Jorkins]] discovers the truth, the news reaches Voldemort, who rescues Crouch Jr. and puts Crouch Sr. under the Imperius Curse. Crouch Jr. then imprisons [[Alastor Moody|Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody]], a famous auror, and using Polyjuice Potion, assumes Moody's appearance and position to infiltrate Hogwarts as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Despite not being a real teacher, Crouch Jr. does a fair job and the class learns vast amounts from him, including valuable knowledge related to the three \"unforgivable curses\". Crouch Sr. escapes and, exhausted and delirious from the Imperius Curse, reaches Hogwarts to tell Dumbledore about Voldemort's return; but his loyal Death-Eater son murders him on the castle grounds, transfigures the body into a bone, and buries the bone in freshly turned earth in front of Hagrid's cabin.<ref>Rowling, J.K. ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' (New York: Arthur A. Levine Books, 2000), pages 690 and 691</ref>\n\nThe revived Triwizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts, and Voldemort tasks Crouch Jr. with making sure Harry wins. To do so, he bewitches [[Viktor Krum]] to attack [[Supporting Harry Potter characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] in the maze and to stun [[Fleur Delacour]]. When Harry and Cedric simultaneously touch the Triwizard Cup, which is a [[Portkeys|portkey]], it transports them to the graveyard in Little Hangleton, home of the Riddle family. There, after killing Cedric, [[Scabbers|Death Eater Peter Pettigrew]] uses Harry's blood in a ritual that re-embodies Voldemort. The Dark Lord attempts to kill Harry, but with the help of the ghost-echoes from Voldemort's wand, Harry escapes via the Portkey.\n\nWhen Harry reappears at Hogwarts, the still-disguised Crouch Jr. hopes to succeed where his master failed; but Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall foil his plot. Under the effects of [[Veritaserum]], he recounts his plan to them. Although he is closely guarded so he can later repeat his testimony, a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dementors|Dementor]] acting as bodyguard to Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] attacks Crouch and sucks out his soul before anyone can stop it. Crouch lives bereft of his memories or sense of self.\n\nHe is played by [[David Tennant]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.\n\n=== Antonin Dolohov ===\n'''Antonin Dolohov''' has a long, pale, and twisted face, with a name that suggests he is of Slavic descent. He is confirmed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' to be one of Voldemort's first Death Eaters, being present at the Hog's Head when Voldemort comes to Hogwarts to request a teaching position and hide the [[diadem]] [[Horcrux]], c. 1956. This makes him at least sixty years old at the time of the battle in the Department of Mysteries. Dolohov is one of the five Death Eaters who murder [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)#Synopsis|Gideon and Fabian Prewett]] ([[Molly Weasley]]'s brothers). He also tortures many [[Muggle]]s and opponents of Voldemort during the first war. Dolohov is imprisoned in Azkaban but escapes during the mass break-out.\n\nHe participates in the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]], where he causes injury to Hermione, but is imprisoned again, and returns to [[Azkaban]] prison. He escapes once more some time before the events of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. He tracks Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a Muggle cafe after they use Voldemort's name (which had recently been made taboo). He and his companion Rowle are stunned, and have their memories erased by Hermione and then are punished by Voldemort. Dolohov participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, killing [[Remus Lupin]],<ref name=webchat/> whom [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] last sees fighting with him. He is also seen dueling with [[Dean Thomas (Harry Potter)|Dean Thomas]] until [[Parvati Patil]] uses the Body-bind Curse on him. Dolohov and Yaxley are later sent to look for Harry, and they mistakenly thought the boy would not give himself up. When the battle recommences, [[Professor Flitwick]] finally defeats him.\n\nHe is portrayed by [[Arben Bajraktaraj]] in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]''.\n\n=== Fenrir Greyback ===\n'''Fenrir Greyback''' is a [[Werewolf (Harry Potter)|werewolf]] who is involved with the Death Eaters. He works alongside Lord Voldemort because Lord Voldemort promises fairness to werewolves around the country. He does not carry the Dark Mark as he is not a Death Eater.<ref name=\"HP7ref\"/> He is known as the most savage werewolf ever to live and is greatly feared throughout the wizarding world. He positions himself close to his victims when the moon is almost full. To fulfil his agenda of creating as many werewolves as possible, Greyback has infected scores of people including the young [[Remus Lupin]], when Lupin's father had angered Greyback. Greyback is known for targeting young children. Unlike most werewolves, Greyback thirsts for blood even in his human form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Greyback first appears on the night of Dumbledore's death, when he attacks Harry and badly scars [[Bill Weasley]]. Although Greyback does not transmit his [[lycanthropy]] because he was in human form at the time, Bill is subsequently shown to display a preference for very [[rare meat]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Greyback leads a Snatcher gang \u2013 Dark wizards looking for [[Muggle-born]]s and \"Undesirables\" in exchange for gold. When Harry accidentally uses Voldemort's name after it has been made taboo, Greyback is alerted and his gang attacks their camp. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are kidnapped by the Snatchers and are taken to [[Malfoy Manor]]. [[#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] promises Hermione to Greyback in return for his services, but the prisoners fight their way out and escape, Greyback being hit by a triple Stunning Spell. Greyback is the main werewolf within the pack that agrees to aid Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Hermione, using a blasting curse, prevents Greyback from attacking injured [[Lavender Brown (Harry Potter)|Lavender Brown]], and a crystal ball thrown by [[Professor Trelawney]] stuns him. He rejoins the battle in time for the Death Eaters' last stand, when [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] combine forces to take him down by magic.\n\n[[Dave Legeno]] portrayed Greyback in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. He reprised the role in both parts of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.\n\n=== Igor Karkaroff ===\n'''Igor Karkaroff''' ([[Cyrillic]]: \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432) is the Headmaster at [[Durmstrang]] Institute, one of the three schools (together with Hogwarts and [[Beauxbatons]] Academy) that enter the Triwizard Tournament. As Headmaster, Karkaroff is also one of the judges. He is described as a neat, fussy-looking man with an oily voice and manner who sports a small grey goatee. While unctuously pleasant most of the time, he is capable of violent rage. He is also described as \"a man with yellowish teeth whose smile does not reach his cold stare\". Karkaroff is angered and threatens to withdraw from the tournament when Harry is selected as a fourth champion and second representative for Hogwarts.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch17\">{{HP4}}, chapter 17</ref> Although he is talked down and agrees to stay, he nevertheless shows evident favouritism towards the Durmstrang champion, Bulgarian [[Quidditch]] player [[Viktor Krum]].\n[[Sirius Black]] later identifies Karkaroff as a former Death Eater.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch19\">{{HP4}}, chapter 19</ref> Karkaroff was captured by [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]]. Karkaroff later told the [[Ministry of Magic]] that he had seen the error of his ways, and \"named names\", putting many people in Azkaban in exchange for his freedom.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch30\">{{HP4}}, chapter 30</ref> Karkaroff is thus also hated by the Death Eaters. Karkaroff's history gives him a connection with [[Severus Snape|Snape]], also a former Death Eater. Karkaroff interrupts a Potions lesson demanding to talk to Snape, and shows him his Dark Mark reappearing. He also apparently has an unpleasant history with Alastor Moody, and tries to avoid him unsuccessfully for the entirety of the tournament, not knowing that it is Barty Crouch Jr. in disguise.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch27\">{{HP4}}, chapter 27</ref> At the end of the novel, following Voldemort's return, Karkaroff goes into hiding, leaving behind his student charges at Durmstrang. In the sixth novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', [[Remus Lupin]] states that Karkaroff was found dead in a shack with the Dark Mark hovering over it, an indication that he was killed by other Death Eaters. Lupin also expresses surprise that Karkaroff managed to live even a year after deserting Voldemort and that no one else has been known to avoid capture quite as long.\n\n[[Predrag Bjelac]] appeared as Karkaroff in the film adaptation of ''Goblet of Fire''.\n\n=== Bellatrix Lestrange ===\n'''Bellatrix Lestrange''' (n\u00e9e '''Black''') is the first female Death Eater introduced in the books. She was introduced in ''Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix''. She is  the most faithful member of Voldemort's inner circle.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch33\">{{HP4}}, chapter 33</ref> She is described as being highly attractive yet emaciated due to her time in Azkaban. Bellatrix is portrayed as paranoid, insane, and fanatically devoted to Voldemort, seeing service to him as the noblest duty for any true wizard or witch. Bellatrix takes an obvious pleasure in acts of torture and cruelty, as demonstrated when she kills her cousin, Sirius Black. She is a witch of prodigious ability, as demonstrated by her many victories in duels against other characters, and as noted by Harry in the final book.<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch23\">{{HP7}}, chapter 23</ref> Her wand is [[walnut]], 12 {{frac|3|4}}&nbsp;inches, dragon heartstring, unyielding and according to [[Ollivander]] should be treated carefully.\n\nBellatrix was born Bellatrix Black to Cygnus Black and Druella Rosier in the year 1951 and has two sisters, [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] (who was disowned by the family for marrying Muggle-born Ted Tonks, which her pure-blood family saw as betrayal; therefore, she was consequently blasted off the family tree) and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]] (wife of [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] and mother to [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]). She is also a first cousin to [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and Regulus Black, and an aunt to [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Bellatrix married Rodolphus Lestrange after leaving Hogwarts because it was \"expected of her to marry a pure-blood\". However, the marriage was loveless, and Rowling stated in an interview that Bellatrix's true love was Voldemort.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Dumbledore's  [[pensieve]] is used as a [[Exposition (literary technique)|plot device]] to reveal that Bellatrix, rather than deserting Voldemort after his downfall like many other Death Eaters, was part of the group \u2013 along with Barty Crouch Jr, Rodolphus and Rabastan Lestrange \u2013 that [[torture]]d the respected [[Auror]]s [[Frank and Alice Longbottom]] (Neville Longbottom's parents) in an attempt to gain information about Voldemort's location.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch30\" /> For using the unforgivable [[Cruciatus Curse]] to torture the Longbottoms to insanity, Bellatrix and her three associates were sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. During the trial, she said Voldemort would rise again and reward them. When Voldemort has his body renewed, he reflects that the Lestranges went to [[Azkaban]] rather than renounce him and that they will be deeply rewarded when Azkaban is broken open.\n\nSeveral months after her master's resurrection, Bellatrix is one of the many Death Eaters who escape Azkaban and rejoin him. She is present at the battle of the [[Department of Mysteries]] in the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', in which a group of Death Eaters attempt to steal [[Sybill Trelawney]]'s [[prophecy]] pertaining to Voldemort's downfall. Rowling demonstrates Bellatrix's ability during the mission when she overpowers her niece Tonks and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] in one-on-one duels, kills her cousin Sirius by blasting him through the veil in the Death Chamber, and deflects one of Dumbledore's spells as she makes her escape. Harry attempts to use the Cruciatus Curse on her in revenge for killing Sirius, but the curse is ineffective due to the lack of real cruelty behind it. Voldemort suddenly appears but moments later, Bellatrix is subdued by Dumbledore in the [[Ministry of Magic]]'s atrium as he prepares to duel Voldemort. Unable to overcome Dumbledore, Voldemort rescues Bellatrix by [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Apparition and Disapparition|disapparating]] with her.\n\nAt the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Bellatrix attempts to keep Narcissa from confiding Draco's secret mission to Snape at [[Spinner's End]], and she is furious to learn that Snape already knows about the plan. Rowling used the conversation between Snape and Bellatrix to imply that Voldemort is still furious at Bellatrix's failure in the previous book.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch2\">{{HP6}}, chapter 2</ref> That conversation also suggests that Bellatrix mistrusts Snape not only because of his low birth, but also for many valid questions about his loyalty to the Dark Lord. Snape surprises Bellatrix by replying to each of her arguments and by agreeing to create an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa to assist Draco in his mission to assassinate [[Dumbledore]]. Later in the book, it is mentioned by Snape that Bellatrix had been teaching [[occlumency]] to Draco, in an effort to aid him with his mission. In the film, she and Fenrir Greyback arrive at the Burrow (the Weasley house) and burn it down. Harry and Ginny chase after them, with Bellatrix taunting \"I killed Sirius Black!\". In the film, she is one of several Death Eaters smuggled into Hogwarts using a pair of Vanishing Cabinets to assassinate Dumbledore, though she does not take part in this mission in the book.\n\nBellatrix later becomes the main antagonist in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]''. The first chapter of the book implies that Voldemort has yet to forgive Bellatrix for her failure, as he mocks her with the fact that her niece Tonks married werewolf [[Remus Lupin]].<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch1\">{{HP7}}, chapter 1</ref> However, Voldemort gives Bellatrix a chance to \"prune\" her family tree during the Death Eaters' attempt to capture Harry as the boy departs from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]]' home; during the attack, Bellatrix devotes much of her energies in efforts to kill Tonks, but is unsuccessful.<ref name=\"{{HP7}}ch5\">{{HP7}}, chapter 5</ref> In this book, Bellatrix inadvertently reveals she is the guardian of [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup, when the captured Harry, Ron, and Hermione are brought to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse, believing them to have sneaked into her vault at Gringotts due to their possession of [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Godric Gryffindor's Sword|Godric Gryffindor's sword]], but [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]] appears and saves the prisoners, though not before being hit by a knife thrown by Bellatrix as they disapparate to safety. Later in the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione use a stray hair of Bellatrix's to disguise Hermione as Bellatrix using polyjuice potion, to gain access to the Lestranges' Gringotts vault. Though Voldemort apparently punishes Bellatrix and the Malfoys severely for interrupting his hunt for the [[Deathly Hallows (objects)#Elder Wand|Elder Wand]] only to have Potter escape and steal the cup, she nevertheless fights for her master in the Battle of Hogwarts towards the end of the novel. Rowling stated in an interview that, during the battle, it was Bellatrix who killed Tonks.<ref name=\"webchat\" /> When the battle resumes inside the Great Hall after Harry's supposed death, Bellatrix simultaneously duels with Hermione, [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], proving more than a match for all three, and nearly hits Ginny with a [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]]. An enraged [[Molly Weasley]] engages Bellatrix and fires a curse that hits Bellatrix right over the heart, killing her.<ref name=\"the-leaky-cauldron.org\">\"[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/11/19/new-interview-with-j-k-rowling-for-release-of-dutch-edition-of-deathly-hallows New Interview with J.K.

[[Helen McCrory]] auditioned for the role in [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|the fifth film]] but dropped out due to pregnancy, making Bonham Carter win the role.

He was a notorious bully to Harry Potter and his friends because Hermione has Muggle parents, Draco was also assigned to kill Dumbledore, but his heart told him otherwise and Snape had to do it for him. Draco, like his family, is part of Slytherin house.\n\n===Lucius Malfoy===\n'''Lucius Malfoy''' is a Death Eater, head of a wealthy [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|pure-blood]] wizarding family and a psychopath; he lives with his wife [[Narcissa Malfoy]] (n\u00e9e Black) and their son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] at the [[Malfoy Manor]] in Wiltshire. Lucius was a [[trustee|school governor]] of Hogwarts before being sacked, and has very close connections at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. To maintain his reputation and influence, he makes donations to the Ministry, to charity, and to [[St Mungo's (Harry Potter)|St Mungo's Hospital]]. He was educated at Hogwarts, where he was a prefect in Slytherin House.\n\nHe debuts as the main antagonist in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', in which just before Draco and Harry's second year at Hogwarts, Lucius plants [[Tom Riddle's diary]] in [[Ginny Weasley]]'s [[Potions Class|potions]] cauldron while she is shopping for school supplies at [[Flourish & Blotts]], in a plot to use her to reopen the [[Chamber of Secrets]], which would lead to attacks on [[Muggle-born]] students.\n\nLucius knows the diary is cleverly enchanted, but is not aware that it is a [[horcrux]] containing a part of Voldemort's soul. He is careless with it and punished by Voldemort himself. Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father, [[Arthur Weasley]], and Dumbledore. Lucius' plans are ultimately thwarted with the help of the Malfoys' [[house-elf]] Dobby, and Harry, but not before the Chamber is opened and Lucius uses the ensuing terror (and threats to attack their families) to influence the school's Board of Governors to discredit and dismiss Dumbledore as Headmaster.\n\nSubsequently, Harry tricks Lucius into setting Dobby free. Upon this, Lucius attempts to attack Harry with his wand but Dobby disarms him before he can do any harm. Lucius is ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor. Despite his sacking, he still maintains strong ties with the Ministry of Magic.\n\nLucius next appears in the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' during the [[Quidditch]] World Cup, sharing prime seats in the Top Box with Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]]. Later in that book, when Voldemort rises again and summons his Death Eaters, Malfoy rejoins him and asserts that he had done everything he could to help his master, who however remains unimpressed. Harry reports Malfoy's declarations to Minister Fudge, who refuses to believe him. Thus, the wealthy Malfoy continues to maintain strong ties with the Ministry.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch36\">{{HP4}}, chapter 36</ref>\n\nDuring the climax of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Malfoy is the leader of the Death Eaters who are sent to retrieve the prophecy from Harry in the Hall of Prophecy. Lucius tries several ways to get the prophecy from Harry without breaking it, but the boy and his friends manage to escape from the Hall. Malfoy finally meets him in the Death Chamber, where Harry is about to give it to Malfoy when the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]] breaks into the Ministry and begins to duel with the Death Eaters. Dumbledore himself arrives at the end of the battle and Malfoy is captured and sent to Azkaban.\n\nBy the final book, Voldemort has given Malfoy his freedom, though he looks significantly the worse for wear, having lost Voldemort's favour. Voldemort treats him with great contempt by hijacking his house for Headquarters, and is forcing his son to do dark deeds against his nature, sparking sympathy for the notorious family for the first time in the series. Voldemort borrows Lucius' wand which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter. Later in the book, Lucius, along with his wife and sister-in-law, accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor. Voldemort punishes them severely, eventually putting them under house arrest.\n\nDespite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort's advocate of pure-blood supremacy, Lucius has decided his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he pleads with Voldemort to let him onto the battlefield to locate his son. He and the rest of his family are reunited at the end of the book. Following Voldemort's death, Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco all manage to \"''weasel their way out''\" of being sent to Azkaban due to Narcissa's aiding Harry in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]].<ref name=\"webchat\" />\n\nAccording to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, in 2006, Lucius Malfoy was number 12<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS NUMBER.

There, he was a close friend of [[Sirius Black]], [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and [[Remus Lupin]], although he was the least intelligent and least talented of the group. With Sirius and James' help, Pettigrew becomes an [[Animagus]], with the ability to transform at will into a [[rat]]. After leaving Hogwarts, Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort, and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort's spy within the Order of the Phoenix, of which Pettigrew is a member. When the Potters know that their son, Harry, is Voldemort's target, Sirius suggests to them to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper because he does not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a \"weak, talentless thing\" like Pettigrew. Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort, an act that leads to James and Lily's death (and ironically, Voldemort's near-destruction). Sirius seeks revenge on Pettigrew, but during the confrontation, Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potters' deaths, murders twelve Muggles, and cuts off his own index finger before transforming into a rat, thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters, as well as for his own murder and that of the bystanders. Pettigrew is (seemingly posthumously) awarded the Order of Merlin, and hides during the next twelve years. Wanting to keep an eye on the wizarding world, he masquerades as a rat, first as [[Percy Weasley]]'s pet, and then as [[Ron Weasley]]'s. In this form (named \"Scabbers\" by the family), he is missing a toe from one paw due to the finger he cut off.\n\nAlthough Pettigrew appears in the first two books in the form of Scabbers, his identity is not revealed until ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in which he is the main antagonist. When a photograph of the Weasley family appears in the ''Daily Prophet'' newspaper, Sirius recognises Pettigrew's Animagus form and escapes from Azkaban to track him down. The two confront each other in the [[Shrieking Shack]], where Lupin and Black compel Scabbers to resume his human form. Pettigrew confesses his treachery, claiming to have committed it only to save his own life. With Sirius and Lupin about to take their revenge, Harry begs Sirius to turn Pettigrew over to the Ministry of Magic instead, to prove Sirius' innocence. Pettigrew escapes while being led out of the Shack when Lupin transforms into a werewolf. Harry's actions result in Pettigrew owing him a life debt.\n\nPettigrew returns to the service of Voldemort, seeking him out in the forests of [[Albania]] and helping him to return to a feeble baby's body. He abducts a Ministry of Magic employee named [[Bertha Jorkins]], who is able to provide Voldemort with valuable information. Pettigrew (almost always referred to as \"Wormtail\" hereafter) assists [[#Barty Crouch Jr.|Barty Crouch Jr.]] in overpowering [[Mad-Eye Moody]], setting up the events in the fourth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. In the climactic confrontation in that book, Wormtail murders [[List of Harry Potter supporting characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] on Voldemort's orders, and brews the complex potion to regenerate Voldemort, severing his hand as one of the ingredients. Upon his return to corporeal form, Voldemort replaces Wormtail's missing hand with a silver one that possesses five intact fingers and great strength. Despite his actions, Wormtail's fortunes remain low; in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' Snape treats him as a servant, and in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' he is tasked with keeping watch over prisoners in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. While Harry and Ron are being kept there, Wormtail checks on the prisoners and is attacked. Wormtail begins strangling Harry with the silver hand, but when reminded by Harry that he once saved his life, Wormtail hesitates for a moment. The silver hand turns against him and strangles him to death as punishment for his moment of pity. Harry Potter thinks of him and describes it as having regrets.\n\nPettigrew is portrayed by [[Timothy Spall]] as an adult, and by [[Charles Hughes (actor)|Charles Hughes]] as a teenager in the films. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'', Pettigrew is not strangled to death by his own silver hand in Malfoy Manor as in the book; he is instead struck by Dobby and collapses. It is unknown whether he was simply stunned or killed. He only appears in a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''.\n\n[[IGN]]'s Joe Utichi also listed him as his 10th top ''Harry Potter'' character.<ref name=\"Joe Top\" />\n\n=== Severus Snape ===\n{{Main|Severus Snape}}\n'''Severus Snape''' is characterised as a person of considerable complexity, whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish. In the first novel of the series, Snape is a teacher who is hostile from the start toward [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] and is built up to be the primary [[antagonist]] until the final chapters. As the series progresses, Snape's portrayal evolves from that of a malicious and partisan teacher to that of a complex, pivotal character of moral ambiguity, whose true loyalties are not revealed until the end. Snape is, as revealed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', actually a spy in Voldemort's ranks for Dumbledore.\n\n=== Corban Yaxley ===\n'''Corban'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pottermore Presents - Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists, Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> '''Yaxley''' is the brutal-faced Death Eater who is present in the battle in which Snape killed Dumbledore. He is one of the more prominent Death Eaters, and one of Voldemort's spies in the [[Ministry of Magic]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Yaxley is invited to Malfoy Manor to witness the murder of [[Charity Burbage]], and argues with Snape about the correct date of Harry's departure from the Dursleys', but [[John Dawlish]], an Auror who is tricked by an Order member, gives him incorrect information. Yaxley announces to an impressed assemblage of Death Eaters that he has placed the Imperius Curse upon [[Pius Thicknesse]], the Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He uses Thicknesse to Imperius the other major department heads and they allow Voldemort to murder [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]; thus Thicknesse becomes Minister for Magic.\n\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione, disguised as ministry officials, enter the Ministry to find Slytherin's locket, it is revealed that Yaxley has become Head of Magical Law Enforcement. He also assists [[Dolores Umbridge]] in leading the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and the two seem to have a good relationship, together humiliating the Muggle-borns. Both are immobilised by Harry, but Yaxley recovers and grabs Hermione while she is Apparating her friends to safety. Yaxley arrives with them at Grimmauld Place, allowing him to reveal their headquarters to the Death Eaters, but not to the location that the trio subsequently Apparate to.\n\nHe participates in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he duels with [[Professor Flitwick]] and is later seen among those who wait with Voldemort for Harry Potter to come to him, mistakenly believing that Harry would not come within the allotted time. When the battle resumes, he is defeated by [[Fred and George Weasley|George Weasley]] and [[Lee Jordan (Harry Potter)|Lee Jordan]].\n\n[[Peter Mullan]] plays Yaxley in the film adaptation of ''Deathly Hallows''.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{hpw|Death Eaters}}\n* [http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/death_eaters.html The Harry Potter Lexicon item] on Death Eaters\n* [http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/pronunciation/play.htm How to pronounce Bellatrix's name] at the official [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]] website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613095313/http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/pottercast/episode/show/52 PotterCast #40: Bag of 'trix] \u2013 A podcast debating Bellatrix's role in the series\n* [http://slate.com/id/2123105 When Harry Met Osama.
