He led the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] from its foundation in 1990 and rose to power as Serbian President during efforts to reform the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia]] in response to alleged marginalization of Serbia, views that the powers of Serbia's autonomous provinces were too strong making them almost independent from Serbia, and claims of political incapacity to deter [[Albanians|Albanian]] separatist unrest in Serbia's autonomous province of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]].\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107's presidency of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was marked by several major reforms to Serbia's constitution from the 1980s to the 1990s that reduced the powers of the autonomous provinces in Serbia. In 1990 Serbia transitioned from a [[Titoism|Titoist]] [[One-party state|one-party system]] to a [[multi-party system]] and attempted reforms to the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia. The constituent republics of the country [[breakup of Yugoslavia|split apart]] amid the outbreak of wars, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was founded by the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro.

While at the university, he befriended [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]], whose uncle [[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] had been a president of Serbian Executive Council (the Communist equivalent of a prime minister). This was to prove a crucial connection for Milo\u0161evi\u0107's career prospects, as Stamboli\u0107 sponsored his rise through the SKJ hierarchy.\n\nAfter his graduation in 1966, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 became an economic advisor to Mayor of [[Belgrade]] [[Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107]]. Five years later, he married his childhood friend, [[Mirjana Markovi\u0107]], with whom he had two children: [[Marko Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Marko]] and Marija.

Throughout the two-year period, the trial was being closely followed by the public of the involved former Yugoslav republics as it covered various notable events from the war and included several high-profile witnesses.\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 died before the trial could be concluded; he was therefore never found guilty of the charges brought against him.\n \nThe ICTY in its ruling of the case against  Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 stated \"there was no sufficient evidence presented in this case to find that Slobodan Milosevic agreed with the common plan [to create territories ethnically cleansed of non-Serbs].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/milosevic-war-crime-deniers-feed-receptive-audience/27910664.html|title=Milosevic 'Exonerated'?

While at the university, he befriended [[Ivan Stamboli\u0107]], whose uncle [[Petar Stamboli\u0107]] had been a president of Serbian Executive Council (the Communist equivalent of a prime minister). This was to prove a crucial connection for Milo\u0161evi\u0107's career prospects, as Stamboli\u0107 sponsored his rise through the SKJ hierarchy.\n\nAfter his graduation in 1966, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 became an economic advisor to Mayor of [[Belgrade]] [[Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107]].

Milo\u0161evi\u0107 claimed that ethnic Albanian authorities had abused their powers, that the autonomy of Kosovo was allowing the entrenchment of separatism in Kosovo, and that the rights of the Serbs in the province were being regularly violated. As a solution, he called for political change to reduce the autonomy, protect minority Serb rights, and initiate a strong crackdown on separatism in Kosovo.\n\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 was criticized by opponents, who claimed he and his allies were attempting to strengthen the position of Serbs in Yugoslavia at the expense of Kosovar Albanians and other nationalities, a policy they accused of being nationalist, which was a [[taboo]] in the Yugoslav Communist system and effectively a political crime, as nationalism was identified as a violation of the Yugoslav Communists' commitment to [[Brotherhood and Unity]]. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 always denied allegations that he was a nationalist or that he exploited Serbian nationalism in his rise to power. In a 1995 interview with ''[[Time magazine|TIME]]'', he defended himself from these accusations by claiming he stood for every nationality in Yugoslavia (though he made no direct or indirect mention of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] or [[Montenegrins]] who are often seen by nationalist Serbs as being Serbs by ethnic heritage): \"All my speeches up to '89 were published in my book.

In the five-man presidential race held on 24 September 2000, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was defeated in the first round by opposition leader [[Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica]], who won slightly more than 50% of the vote.

The Yugoslav constitution called for a runoff between the top two candidates in the event that no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.

He defined the thought process, and how it reaches the status of conviction or conceptsand discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the Nafs or emotions and sentiments. Delving into the internal workings of how people reach conclusions & the psychology behind the process derives itself from Taqiuddin al-Nabhani's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism from his first teacher and maternal grandfather Ismail al-Nabhani.\n\nAl-Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and information processing research discussed in the Addison-Wesley published book \"Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine (Systems Programming Series)\" and used in London South Bank University's information systems department.\n\nAfter many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is via discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. It is from this philosophical basis that he argued that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argued that a decline in the Muslims' thought, emotions and concepts led to their decline & the eventual destruction of the Khilafah. He believed the first major step towards decline in the Muslims was confusion about, and dealing with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued the Islamic World did not know how to tackle & contextualise these ideas because they became insular, and complacent of preserving & keeping relevant their own Islamic thoughts or philosophy to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions, or emotions, via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed Islam is founded on rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after belief (Aqeeda) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]) but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book [4], contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction.

He discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the Nafs or emotions and sentiments. Delving into the internal workings of how people reach conclusions & the psychology behind the process derives itself from Taqiuddin al-Nabhani's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism from his first teacher and maternal grandfather Ismail al-Nabhani.\n\nAl-Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and information processing research discussed in the Addison-Wesley published book \"Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine (Systems Programming Series)\" and used in London South Bank University's information systems department.\n\nAfter many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is via discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. It is from this philosophical basis that he argued that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argued that a decline in the Muslims' thought, emotions and concepts led to their decline & the eventual destruction of the Khilafah. He believed the first major step towards decline in the Muslims was confusion about, and dealing with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued the Islamic World did not know how to tackle & contextualise these ideas because they became insular, and complacent of preserving & keeping relevant their own Islamic thoughts or philosophy to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions, or emotions, via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed Islam is founded on rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after belief (Aqeeda) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]) but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book [4], contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that the dependency of, and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception point ultimately to an unlimited creator that is beyond need and dependency, an Absolute Infinite.\n\n==Books==\n*''Saving Palestine'' - 1950<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html Sheikh Muhammad Taqiuddin al-Nabhani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819200236/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html |date=2010-08-19 }}, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].</ref>\n*''The Message of the Arabs'' - 1950\n*''The System for Society'' - 1950\n*''The Ruling System in Islam'' - 1953\n*''[[The Economic System In Islam]]'' - 1953\n*''The Social System in Islam'' -1953\n*''The Party Structure'' -1953\n*''The Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic State'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic Personality'' (in three volumes) - 1960\n*''Political Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1969\n*''Political View of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1972\n*''Introduction to the Constitution or the Reasons That Make it Obligatory'' - 1963\n*''The Khilafah'' - 1967\n*''Presence of Mind'' - 1976\n*''A Burning Call to the Muslims from Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1965\n*''Thinking'' - 1973\n*''The Jurisprudence of Prayer''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n |magazine    = Al-Waie Magazine\n |issue       = 234-235\n |date        = August\u2013September 2006\n |language    = Arabic\n |title       = \u0628\u0632\u0648\u063a \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649: \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\n |url         = http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209002225/http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |archivedate = 2015-02-09\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n |title       = An-Nabhani: Palestinian Intellectual\n |work        = [[Islamic Da'wah Foundation Malaysia]]\n |url         = http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219055210/http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |archivedate = 2010-12-19\n}}\n* {{Citation |last=Watt|first=Montgomery|title=The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali (Translation of al-Munqid min al-Dalal)|year=2004|place=Oxford|publisher=OneWorld Publications}}\n* {{Citation |last=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=The System of Islam Nidham al-Islam|year=2002|publication-place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Thought al-Tafkeer|year=2004|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Islamic Personality al-Shaksiyyah al-Islamiyyah|year=2005|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabhani, Taqiuddin}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Arab people in British Palestine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian Islamists]]\n[[Category:Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir]]\n[[Category:Al-Azhar University alumni]]\n", "name_user": "XxSamuraixXYT", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePhilosophy and Theology", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_al-Din_al-Nabhani"}

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]hmhgm.mgjjh.hnhnf]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail tofdavcdsysdvysdfysbvbbvsbvdvbvd produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, eachhmf'\nmm.mh;m;;,ml up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of sodvosfdo[dgnknpgjnjmnhme {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3\u20134}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n===Harvesting===\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 200,000 saffron stigmas to be hand-picked from 70,000 crocus flowers for each {{convert|1|lb}} of saffron product.<ref name=hooker/><ref name=cnn/>{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lak |first=Daniel |date=11 November 1998 |title=Kashmiris pin hopes on saffron |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/212491.stm |accessdatnxbfhgxdbghfbgbhffe=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried; roughly 150 flowers yield {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron, {{Convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried spice.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} \n\n==Spice==\n\n===Phytochemistry and sensory properties===\n[[File:Picrocrocin.svg|thumb|Structure of picrocrocin:{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}}\n{|fbldfmfffd\n|-\n|{{Legend|#AEAEFF|[[Anomer|\u03b2]]\u2013[[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]-glucopyranose derivative}}\n|-\n|{{Legend|#F5D76C|safranal moiety}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Crocetin safranal esterification.png|thumb|[[Esterification|Esterification reaction]] between [[crocetin]] and [[gentiobiose]].

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]], a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

Varieties (not varieties in the botanical sense) from Spain, including the tradenames \"Spanish Superior\" and \"Creme\", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish. Greek saffron produced in the town of [[Krokos]] is [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]] protected due to its particularly high-quality colour and strong flavour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and-quality/certification/quality-labels/eu-quality-food-and-drink/krokos-kozanis|title=Krokos Kozanis PDO |last=Bishop |first=Stephen|date=2018-04-26|website=European Commission|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> Various \"boutique\" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries\u2014some of them organically grown.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3\u20134}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n===Harvesting===\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 200,000 saffron stigmas to be hand-picked from 70,000 crocus flowers for each {{convert|1|lb}} of saffron product.<ref name=hooker/><ref name=cnn/>{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lak |first=Daniel |date=11 November 1998 |title=Kashmiris pin hopes on saffron |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/212491.stm |accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried; roughly 150 flowers yield {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron, {{Convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried spice.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} \n\n==Spice==\n\n===Phytochemistry and sensory properties===\n[[File:Picrocrocin.svg|thumb|Structure of picrocrocin:{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}}\n{|\n|-\n|{{Legend|#AEAEFF|[[Anomer|\u03b2]]\u2013[[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]-glucopyranose derivative}}\n|-\n|{{Legend|#F5D76C|safranal moiety}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Crocetin safranal esterification.png|thumb|[[Esterification|Esterification reaction]] between [[crocetin]] and [[gentiobiose]].

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]], a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

Varieties (not varieties in the botanical sense) from Spain, including the tradenames \"Spanish Superior\" and \"Creme\", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish. Greek saffron produced in the town of [[Krokos]] is [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]] protected due to its particularly high-quality colour and strong flavour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and-quality/certification/quality-labels/eu-quality-food-and-drink/krokos-kozanis|title=Krokos Kozanis PDO |last=Bishop |first=Stephen|date=2018-04-26|website=European Commission|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> Various \"boutique\" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries\u2014some of them organically grown.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognisable by its dark maroon-purple hue; it is among the world's darkest, which hints at strong flavour, aroma, and colouring effect.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:SaffMHD.jpg|thumb|left|Saffron market, [[Iran]]]]\n\nAlmost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain in the west to [[Kashmir]] in the east.

Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') in [[Derbent]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles,{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=17\u201318}} Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Non-Persians also feared the Persians' usage of saffron as a drugging agent and aphrodisiac.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=41}} During his Asian campaigns, [[Alexander the Great]] used Persian saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths as a curative for battle wounds.

Its use in foods and dyes subsequently spread throughout South Asia. Buddhist monks wear saffron-coloured robes; however, the robes are not dyed with costly saffron but [[turmeric]], a less expensive dye, or [[jackfruit]].{{Sfn|Finlay|2003|p=224}} Monks' robes are dyed the same colour to show equality with each other, and turmeric or ochre were the cheapest, most readily available dyes.

According to Chinese herbalist Wan Zhen, \"[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha.\" Wan also reflected on how it was used in his time: \"The flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained.

With this fall, European saffron cultivation plummeted. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century AD Moors or with the [[Avignon]] papacy in the 14th century AD.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=63}} Similarly, the spread of Islamic civilisation may have helped reintroduce the crop to Spain and Italy.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=70}}\n\nThe 14th-century [[Black Death]] caused demand for saffron-based [[medicament]]s to peak, and Europe imported large quantities of threads via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week-long ''[[Saffron War]]''.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=99}} The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred corm cultivation in [[Basel]]; it thereby grew prosperous.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=101}} The crop then spread to [[Nuremberg]], where endemic and insalubrious adulteration brought on the ''Safranschou'' code\u2014whereby culprits were variously fined, imprisoned, and executed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=103\u2013104}} Meanwhile, cultivation continued in southern France, Italy, and Spain.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=133}}\n\nThe [[Essex]] town of [[Saffron Walden]], named for its new specialty crop, emerged as a prime saffron growing and trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries but cultivation there was abandoned; saffron was re-introduced around 2013 as well as other parts of the UK (Cheshire).<ref name=BBCessex2014>{{cite news|last1=Granleese|first1=Bob|title=Interview: Meet the saffron producer: 'It seemed ridiculous that the UK didn't grow it' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/16/meet-the-saffron-producer-uk |work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Saffron spice returns to Essex after 200 years |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-29943720 |work=BBC News|date=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\nEuropeans introduced saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the [[Schwenkfelder Church]] left Europe with a trunk containing its corms.

Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was equal to gold.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=138}} Trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=138\u2013139}} Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=142\u2013146}} American saffron cultivation survives into modern times, mainly in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Books'''\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Celsus|first=Aulus Cornelius|translator-last=Spencer|translator-first=W.
