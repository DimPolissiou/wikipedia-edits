{"title_page": "Air quality and EU legislation", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{citation style|date=November 2016}}\n{{tone|date=November 2016}}\n}}\n\nSince the late 1970s, the European Union's (EU) policy has been to develop and drive appropriate measures to improve air quality throughout the EU. The control of emissions from mobile sources, improving fuel quality and promoting and integrating environmental protection requirements into the transport and energy sector are part of these aims.\n\nThe main advising agency of the EU is the European Environment Agency (EEA). It came into force in late 1993, after the decision to locate the EEA in Copenhagen. Work started in earnest in 1994. The EEA's mandate is to help the community and member countries make informed decisions about improving the environment and integrating environmental considerations into economic policies, and to coordinate the European environment information and observation network (Eionet). Eionet is a partnership network across member states involving approximately 1000 experts and more than 350 national institutions. The network supports the collection and organisation of data and the development and dissemination of information concerning Europe's environment.\n\n==Background==\nThe first serious attempt at an environmental harm treaty was the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. Earlier attempts, such as the 1979 [[Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution]] and 1985 [[Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]], turned out to be largely futile. (Birnie et al., 2009).\n\nThe genesis of [[air quality]] within the EU is the Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management which is commonly referred to as the Air Quality Framework Directive. It described the approach as to how air quality would be assessed and managed in the EU member states. It lists the pollutants for which air quality standards and objectives would be developed and specified in legislation (EU, 1996). There were four \u2018daughter\u2019 directives for specified pollutants; however as shown in the Cleaner Air For Europe Directive (CAFE), 2008/50/EC below, Daughter Directives 1, 2 and 3 were subsumed into CAFE, with daughter directive 4 to be subsumed at a later stage (EPA, 2016).\n\nSubsequent to the [[Gothenburg Protocol]] [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) agreed in December 1999, which focused on reducing, by 2010, the air concentrations of four air pollutants, namely [[sulfur dioxide]] (to be reduced by 63%), [[nitrogen oxides]] (41%), [[volatile organic compound]]s (40%) and [[ammonia]] (17%), leading the EU to introduce the 2001/81/EC Directive on national emissions ceilings. This became law in Ireland by way of the European Communities (National Emissions Ceilings) Regulations 2004. The Environmental Protection Agency was assigned the status of competent authority to assess ambient air quality, approving air measuring devices, etc. (Menzies, 2016).\n\nThe [[Cleaner Air For Europe]] Directive, 2008/50/EC or CAFE as it is known, sets out the need to ascertain the ambient air qualities, assessing for comparison and informing the public where need be. In order to do this the legislation sets out the need for member states to break their countries into zones and agglomerations (collections of people). Ireland is broken into 4 zones, A, B, C and D representing Dublin, Cork, small towns/cities and rural areas respectively (Menzies, 2016). CAFE, like that of the 2001/81/EC Directive, determines that additional pollutants will be measured and reduced, namely:\n\n* [[Carbon monoxide]]\n* [[PM10]] and [[PM2.5]]s (particulate matter)\n* [[Lead]]\n* [[Benzene]]\n* Sulfur dioxide\n* [[Nitrogen dioxide]]\n\nThe CAFE Directive was transposed into Irish legislation by the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 180 of 2011) which in turn replaced the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 271 of 2002), the Ozone in Ambient Air Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 53 of 2004) and S.I. No. 33 of 1999 - Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations. (EPA, 2016).\n\n==Monitoring==\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is the designated competent authority for the implementation of all Irish and EU ambient air quality legislation. The EPA manages the national ambient air quality monitoring network - assisted in its role of implementing this legislation by the local authorities, many of whom carry out ambient air quality monitoring - while also measuring the levels of a number of atmospheric pollutants (see bullet points above). For example, the EPA utilises several state and semi-state buildings, such as fire stations and garda stations, around the Greater Dublin area to gather data in real time and on a collected basis.\n\nDomestic solid fuel use such as coal and turf is the other main source of air pollution in Ireland (outside Greater Dublin) and particularly impacts air quality in areas where the sale of coal is permitted. When the Air Pollution (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuel) Regulations were enacted in 1990, this banned the sale of [[bituminous fuel]]s in the [[Greater Dublin area]]. This led to an immediate reduction in smoke levels, thus offering the potential for better health. According to the Dublin Regional Air Quality Management Plan 2009 \u2013 2012 (Dublin City Council, 2009): \"these levels subsequently reduced from being close to or exceeding legal limit values to a point that is almost one tenth of the legal standard of 250 \u03bcg/m3.\"\n\nAs a result, air pollution from the burning of solid fuel can be of a greater concern in smaller towns in Ireland (Dublin City Council, 2009).\n\n==Irish legislation==\nAmong the many reasons that something had to be done was the importance of reducing the [[greenhouse gas]]es that contribute to [[global warming]]. Before the [[industrial revolution]] era of the late 1700s, [[carbon dioxide]] could be measured in the atmosphere at around 280 [[parts per million]] (ppm), whereas in 2005 it was found to be 379 ppm. [[Methane]], similarly in the same period, was 715ppm reaching up to 1774 ppm. This is significant because methane has a potential for global warming 70% more than CO2 (Birnie et al., 2009, Bodansky et al., 2007).\n\nThe [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] which came into force in 1999 set out new objectives such as [[environmental protection]] in its own right as opposed to being a subset of [[economic development]]. Article 6 ensures that \"environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of Community policies\" (Asser Institute, 2016) which in effect meant that it went from \"semi-obscurity\" in previous environmental provisions to an Article in the [[core principle]]s of the Treaty, the only constitutional document in the World to do so (Macrory, 2010). In fact the 2000 EU Charter of Rights alludes to the concept in Article 37: \"[a] high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment must...\" This was copper fastened in the 2007 Lisbon (EU Reform) Treaty, Article 7 by virtue of Article 6 of the same Treaty which affords the integration concept with the same value/status as the Treaties themselves (Macrory, 2010).\n\n==Air pollution nuisance defined==\nSection 4 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 defines air pollution as:\n\"a condition of the atmosphere in which a pollutant is present in such a quantity as to be liable to: \n# be injurious to public health\n# have a deleterious effect on flora or fauna or damage property, or\n# impair or interfere with amenities or the environment\"\n\nThe legislation applies in cases where there are emissions of smoke, particulate matter, fumes or where there are odours in areas specifically defined in the regulations.\n\n==Regulation of solid fuels==\nThe Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations, 2012 (S.I. No. 326 of 2012), consolidated all previous applicable/associated regulations made under the Air Pollution Act, e.g. Air Pollution (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuel) Regulations 1990. Under Section 6 it is an offence in these regulations for the home owner/occupier of any private dwelling to burn bituminous (smoky) coal. Not only that but is also an offence to market, sell or distribute any fuels specified in the regulations within defined areas of Ireland.\n\n==Penalties for non-compliance==\nThe Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations, 2012 enable local authorities to take enforcement action against anyone suspected of non-compliance by initiating prosecutions at District Court level.\n\nSection 20 of the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2015 increased the enforcement options for local authorities by amending Section 12A of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 to enable the issuing of fixed penalty notices i.e. on the spot fines. Following the signing into law of the Air Pollution (Fixed Payment Notice) Regulations, 2015 in December 2015, by Minister Alan Kelly, local authorities now have the option of issuing fixed penalty notices for alleged breaches of the 2012 Regulations. (Limerick City Council, 2016)\n\nPenalties range from a ceiling of \u20ac1000 (marketing, selling or distributing) for on the spot fines or up to \u20ac5000 plus costs if court proceedings are instigated.\n\n==Future direction==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nBecause of the failure to meet the objectives of WHO, i.e. clean air is considered to be a basic requirement of human health and the fact that within the EU, \u201cpoor air quality is worse than for road traffic accidents, making it the number one environmental cause of premature death in the EU.\u201d (EU, 2015a) that in December 2013, the EU announced a Clean Air Policy Package<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/clean-air/|title=The clean air package: Improving Europe's air quality|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> (after a comprehensive review which began in 2011) to reduce the effect on human health. This package has at its core the following;:\n\n* A new Clean Air Programme for Europe enabling existing targets are met in a much shorter term with more detailed new air quality objectives for the period up to 2030. Support via research, innovation and probably most important of all, co-operation between all stakeholders will be a factor. \n* The current National Emission Ceilings Directive will be revised thus ensuring a much more stringent approach to the six main pollutants named above,\n* A proposal for a new Directive to reduce pollution from smaller power stations that have not been included heretofore, i.e. combustion plants up to 50MWth (EU, 2015b)\n\nGiven the fact that in Ireland in 2012 approximately 1200 deaths were attributed to air pollution, as such it is still an issue that requires further measures (EEA, 2014).\n\nThe EU estimate that the benefits to health, by 2020 and certainly by 2030, will save society in the region of at least \u20ac40 billion with even more if the higher productivity brought about by healthier workers (fewer lost working days) was to materialise. Other benefits would be reduced healthcare costs such as lower levels of asthmatics for example. The reduction of acid rain, the scourge of many cities because of damaged buildings, would be another benefit\n\n==See also==\n* [[Environment of the European Union]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Birnie, P, Boyle, A, Redgwell, C.

The standard ECG leads (external leads) are I, II, III, aVL, V<sub>1</sub>, and V<sub>6</sub>. Two to four intracardiac leads are added via cardiac catheterization. The word \"electrogram\" (EGM) without further specification usually means an intracardiac electrogram.\n\n===Lead locations on an ECG report===\nA standard 12-lead ECG report (an electrocardiograph) shows a 2.5 second tracing of each of the twelve leads. The tracings are most commonly arranged in a grid of four columns and three rows. The first column is the limb leads (I, II, and III), the second column is the augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, and aVF), and the last two columns are the precordial leads (V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>6</sub>).\nAdditionally, a rhythm strip may be included as a fourth or fifth row.\n\nThe timing across the page is continuous and not tracings of the 12 leads for the same time period.\nIn other words, if the output were traced by needles on paper, each row would switch which leads as the paper is pulled under the needle.\nFor example, the top row would first trace lead I, then switch to lead aVR, then switch to V<sub>1</sub>, and then switch to V<sub>4</sub>, and so none of these four tracings of the leads are from the same time period as they are traced in sequence through time.\n\n==={{anchor|Lead groups}}Contiguity of leads===\n[[File:Contiguous leads.svg|300px|thumb|Diagram showing the contiguous leads in the same color in the standard 12-lead layout]]\nEach of the 12 ECG leads records the electrical activity of the heart from a different angle, and therefore align with different anatomical areas of the heart.

For example, though V<sub>4</sub> is an anterior lead and V<sub>5</sub> is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are next to one another.\n\n==Electrophysiology==\n{{main|Cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\nThe study of the conduction system of the heart is called [[cardiac electrophysiology]] (EP).  An EP study is performed via a right-sided [[cardiac catheterization]]: a wire with an electrode at its tip is inserted into the right heart chambers from a peripheral vein, and placed in various positions in close proximity to the conduction system so that the electrical activity of that system can be recorded.\n\n==Interpretation==\nInterpretation of the ECG is fundamentally about understanding the [[electrical conduction system of the heart]].\nNormal conduction starts and propagates in a predictable pattern, and deviation from this pattern can be a normal variation or be [[pathological]].\nAn ECG does not equate with mechanical pumping activity of the heart, for example, [[pulseless electrical activity]] produces an ECG that should pump blood but no pulses are felt (and constitutes a [[medical emergency]] and [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] should be performed).\n[[Ventricular fibrillation]] produces an ECG but is too dysfunctional to produce a life-sustaining cardiac output. Certain rhythms are known to have good cardiac output and some are known to have bad cardiac output.\nUltimately, an [[echocardiogram]] or other anatomical imaging modality is useful in assessing the mechanical function of the heart.\n\nLike all medical tests, what constitutes \"normal\" is based on [[population studies]]. The heartrate range of between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is considered normal since data shows this to be the usual resting heart rate.\n\n===Theory===\n[[File:ECG Vector.svg|230px|thumb|right|QRS is upright in a lead when its axis is aligned with that lead's [[Euclidean vector|vector]]]]\n[[File:EKG Complex en.svg|280px|thumb|Schematic representation of a normal ECG]]\n\nInterpretation of the ECG is ultimately that of pattern recognition.\nIn order to understand the patterns found, it is helpful to understand the theory of what ECGs represent.\nThe theory is rooted in [[electromagnetics]] and boils down to the four following points:\n* depolarization of the heart ''towards'' the positive electrode produces a positive deflection\n* depolarization of the heart ''away'' from the positive electrode produces a negative deflection\n* repolarization of the heart ''towards'' the positive electrode produces a negative deflection\n* repolarization of the heart ''away'' from the positive electrode produces a positive deflection\n\nThus, the overall direction of depolarization and repolarization produces positive or negative deflection on each lead's trace.\nFor example, depolarizing from right to left would produce a positive deflection in lead I because the two vectors point in the same direction.\nIn contrast, that same depolarization would produce minimal deflection in V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> because the vectors are perpendicular, and this phenomenon is called isoelectric.\n\nNormal rhythm produces four entities \u2013 a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and a U wave \u2013 that each have a fairly unique pattern.\n* The P wave represents atrial depolarization.\n* The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization.\n* The T wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n* The U wave represents papillary muscle repolarization.\n\nChanges in the structure of the heart and its surroundings (including blood composition) change the patterns of these four entities.\n\nThe U wave is not typically seen and its absence is generally ignored. Atrial repolarisation is typically hidden in the much more prominent QRS complex and normally cannot be seen without additional, specialised electrodes.\n\n===Background grid===\nECGs are normally printed on a grid.\nThe horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents voltage.\nThe standard values on this grid are shown in the adjacent image:\n* A small box is 1&nbsp;mm \u00d7  1&nbsp;mm and represents 0.1 mV \u00d7 0.04 seconds.\n* A large box is 5&nbsp;mm \u00d7  5&nbsp;mm and represents 0.5 mV \u00d7  0.20 seconds.\n\nThe \"large\" box is represented by a heavier [[Font weight|line weight]] than the small boxes.\n\n[[File:ECG Paper v2.svg|500px|left|Measuring time and voltage with ECG graph paper]]\n{{clear}}\n\nNot all aspects of an ECG rely on precise recordings or having a known scaling of amplitude or time.\nFor example, determining if the tracing is a sinus rhythm only requires feature recognition and matching, and not measurement of amplitudes or times (i.e., the scale of the grids are irrelevant).\nAn example to the contrary, the voltage requirements of [[left ventricular hypertrophy]] require knowing the grid scale.\n\n===Rate and rhythm===\nIn a normal heart, the heart rate is the rate in which the [[sinoatrial node]] depolarizes since it is the source of depolarization of the heart.\nHeart rate, like other [[vital signs]] such as blood pressure and respiratory rate, change with age.\nIn adults, a normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm (normocardic), whereas it is higher in children.\nA heart rate below normal is called \"[[bradycardia]]\" (<60 in adults) and above normal is called \"[[tachycardia]]\" (>100 in adults).\nA complication of this is when the atria and ventricles are not in synchrony and the \"heart rate\" must be specified as atrial or ventricular (e.g., the ventricular rate in [[ventricular fibrillation]] is 300\u2013600 bpm, whereas the atrial rate can be normal [60\u2013100] or faster [100\u2013150]).\n\nIn normal resting hearts, the physiologic rhythm of the heart is [[normal sinus rhythm]] (NSR).\nNormal sinus rhythm produces the prototypical pattern of P wave, QRS complex, and T wave.\nGenerally, deviation from normal sinus rhythm is considered a [[cardiac arrhythmia]].\nThus, the first question in interpreting an ECG is whether or not there is a sinus rhythm.\nA criterion for sinus rhythm is that P waves and QRS complexes appear 1-to-1, thus implying that the P wave causes the QRS complex.\n\nOnce sinus rhythm is established, or not, the second question is the rate.\nFor a sinus rhythm, this is either the rate of P waves or QRS complexes since they are 1-to-1.\nIf the rate is too fast, then it is [[sinus tachycardia]], and if it is too slow, then it is [[sinus bradycardia]].\n\nIf it is not a sinus rhythm, then determining the rhythm is necessary before proceeding with further interpretation.\nSome arrhythmias with characteristic findings:\n* Absent P waves with \"irregularly irregular\" QRS complexes is the hallmark of [[atrial fibrillation]].\n* A \"saw tooth\" pattern with QRS complexes is the hallmark of [[atrial flutter]].\n* A [[sine wave]] pattern is the hallmark of [[ventricular flutter]].\n* Absent P waves with wide QRS complexes and a fast heart rate is [[ventricular tachycardia]].\n\nDetermination of rate and rhythm is necessary in order to make sense of further interpretation.\n\n===Axis===\nThe heart has several axes, but the most common by far is the axis of the QRS complex (references to \"the axis\" imply the QRS axis).\nEach axis can be computationally determined to result in a number representing degrees of deviation from zero, or it can be categorized into a few types.\n\nThe QRS axis is the general direction of the ventricular depolarization wavefront (or mean electrical vector) in the frontal plane.\nIt is often sufficient to classify the axis as one of three types: normal, left deviated, or right deviated.\nPopulation data shows that a normal QRS axis is from \u221230\u00b0 to 105\u00b0, with 0\u00b0 being along lead I and positive being inferior and negative being superior (best understood graphically as the [[hexaxial reference system]]).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chou's electrocardiography in clinical practice : adult and pediatric |last=Surawicz |first=Borys |last2=Knillans |first2=Timothy |date=2008 |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |isbn=978-1416037743 |edition=6th |location=Philadelphia, PA |page=12}}</ref>\nBeyond +105\u00b0 is [[right axis deviation]] and beyond \u221230\u00b0 is [[left axis deviation]] (the third quadrant of \u221290\u00b0 to \u2212180\u00b0 is very rare and is an indeterminate axis).\nA shortcut for determining if the QRS axis is normal is if the QRS complex is mostly positive in lead I and lead II (or lead I and aVF if +90\u00b0 is the upper limit of normal).\n\nThe normal QRS axis is generally ''down and to the left'', following the anatomical orientation of the heart within the chest. An abnormal axis suggests a change in the physical shape and orientation of the heart or a defect in its conduction system that causes the ventricles to depolarize in an abnormal way.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Any deviation from the normal tracing is potentially pathological and therefore of clinical significance.\n\nFor ease of measuring the amplitudes and intervals, an ECG is printed on graph paper at a standard scale: each 1&nbsp;mm (one small box on the standard ECG paper) represents 40 milliseconds of time on the x-axis, and 0.1 millivolts on the y-axis.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Feature\n!Description\n!Pathology\n!Duration\n|-\n|[[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]]\n|The P wave represents depolarization of the atria. Atrial depolarization spreads from the SA node towards the AV node, and from the right [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]] to the left [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]].\n|The P wave is typically upright in most leads except for aVR; an unusual P wave axis (inverted in other leads) can indicate an [[Ectopic pacemaker|ectopic atrial pacemaker]]. If the P wave is of unusually long duration, it may represent atrial enlargement. Typically a large ''right atrium'' gives a tall, peaked P wave while a large ''left atrium'' gives a two-humped bifid P wave.\n|<80 ms\n|-\n|[[PR interval]]\n|The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. This interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus node through the AV node.\n|A PR interval shorter than 120 ms suggests that the electrical impulse is bypassing the AV node, as in [[Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome]]. A PR interval consistently longer than 200 ms diagnoses [[first degree atrioventricular block]]. The PR segment (the portion of the tracing after the P wave and before the QRS complex) is typically completely flat, but may be depressed in [[pericarditis]].\n|120 to 200 ms\n|-\n|[[QRS complex]]\n|The QRS complex represents the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles. The ventricles have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has a much larger amplitude than the P wave.\n|If the QRS complex is wide (longer than 120 ms) it suggests disruption of the heart's conduction system, such as in [[LBBB]], [[RBBB]], or ventricular rhythms such as [[ventricular tachycardia]]. Metabolic issues such as severe [[hyperkalemia]], or [[tricyclic antidepressant overdose]] can also widen the QRS complex.

Likewise, a positive current traveling away from the positive electrode and towards the negative electrode creates a negative deflection on the ECG.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://simple-cardio.blogspot.com/2012/12/ecg-ekg-paper.html |title=Simple Cardiology: - ECG (EKG) Paper. |last=Cardio-online |date=2012-12-12 |website=Simple Cardiology |access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cvphysiology.com/Arrhythmias/A014 |title=CV Physiology {{!}} Volume Conductor Principles and ECG Rules of Interpretation |website=www.cvphysiology.com |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> The red arrow represents the overall direction of travel of the depolarization. The magnitude of the red arrow is proportional to the amount of tissue being depolarized at that instance. The red arrow is simultaneously shown on the axis of each of the 3 limb leads. Both the direction and the magnitude of the red arrow's projection onto the axis of each limb lead is shown with blue arrows. Then, the direction and magnitude of the blue arrows are what theoretically determine the deflections on the ECG. For example, as a blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves from the negative electrode, to the right, towards the positive electrode, the ECG line rises, creating an upward wave. As the blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves to the left, a downward wave is created. The greater the magnitude of the blue arrow, the greater the deflection on the ECG for that particular limb lead.\n\nFrames 1 through 3 depict the depolarization being generated in and spreading through the [[Sinoatrial node]]. The SA node is too small for its depolarization to be detected on most ECGs. Frames 4 through 10 depict the depolarization traveling through the atria, towards the [[Atrioventricular node]]. During frame 7, the depolarization is traveling through the largest amount of tissue in the atria, which creates the highest point in the P wave. Frames 11 and 12 depict the depolarization traveling through the AV node. Like the SA node, the AV node is too small for the depolarization of its tissue to be detected on most ECGs. This creates the flat PR segment.<ref>{{Citation |last=Noble |first=R.

It depicts the depolarization as it starts to travel down the interventricular septum, through the [[Bundle of His]] and [[Bundle branches]]. After the Bundle of His, the conduction system splits into the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. Both branches conduct action potentials at about 1&nbsp;m/s. Interestingly, however, the action potential starts traveling down the left bundle branch about 5 milliseconds before it starts traveling down the right bundle branch, as depicted by frame 13. This causes the depolarization of the interventricular septum tissue to spread from left to right, as depicted by the red arrow in frame 14. In some cases, this gives rise to a negative deflection after the PR interval, creating a Q wave such as the one seen in lead I in the animation to the right. Depending on the mean electrical axis of the heart, this phenomenon can result in a Q wave in lead II as well.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scher |first=Allen M. |last2=Young |first2=Allan C. |last3=Malmgren |first3=Arthur L. |last4=Erickson |first4=Robert V. |date=January 1955 |title=Activation of the Interventricular Septum |journal=Circulation Research |language=en |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201364 |doi=10.1161/01.RES.3.1.56 |pmid=13231277 |issn=0009-7330}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cvphysiology.com/Arrhythmias/A016 |title=CV Physiology {{!}} Ventricular Depolarization and the Mean Electrical Axis |website=www.cvphysiology.com |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nFollowing depolarization of the interventricular septum, the depolarization travels towards the apex of the heart. This is depicted by frames 15 through 17 and results in a positive deflection on all three limb leads, which creates the R wave. Frames 18 through 21 then depict the depolarization as it travels throughout both ventricles from the apex of the heart, following the action potential in the [[Purkinje fibers]]. This phenomenon creates a negative deflection in all three limb leads, forming the S wave on the ECG. Repolarization of the atria occurs at the same time as the generation of the QRS complex, but it is not detected by the ECG since the tissue mass of the ventricles is so much larger than that of the atria. Ventricular contraction occurs between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. During this time, there is no movement of charge, so no deflection is created on the ECG. This results in the flat ST segment after the S wave.\n\nFrames 24 through 28 in the animation depict repolarization of the ventricles. The epicardium is the first layer of the ventricles to repolarize, followed by the myocardium. The endocardium is the last layer to repolarize. The plateau phase of depolarization has been shown to last longer in endocardial cells than in epicardial cells. This causes repolarization to start from the apex of the heart and move upwards. Since repolarization is the spread of negative current as membrane potentials decrease back down to the resting membrane potential, the red arrow in the animation is pointing in the direction opposite of the repolarization. This therefore creates a positive deflection in the ECG, and creates the T wave.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lukas |first=Anton |date=2016-06-29 |title=Electrophysiology of Myocardial Cells in the Epicardial, Midmyocardial, and Endocardial Layers of the Ventricle |journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Therapeutics |language=en |doi=10.1177/107424849700200108 |pmid=10684443 |volume=2 |pages=61\u201372}}</ref>\n\n===Ischemia and infarction===\n{{Main|Electrocardiography in myocardial infarction}}\nIschemia or [[NSTEMI|non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions]] (non-STEMIs) may manifest as [[ST depression]] or inversion of [[T wave]]s.

Overall, the diagnoses are made based on the patterns.  For example, an \"irregularly irregular\" QRS complex without P waves is the hallmark of [[atrial fibrillation]]; however, other findings can be present as well, such as a [[bundle branch block]] that alters the shape of the QRS complexes.  ECGs can be interpreted in isolation but should be applied \u2013 like all [[diagnostic tests]] \u2013 in the context of the patient.  For example, an observation of peaked T waves is not sufficient to diagnose hyperkalemia; such a diagnosis should be verified by measuring the blood potassium level.  Conversely, a discovery of hyperkalemia should be followed by an ECG for manifestations such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and loss of P waves.

Today, electrocardiographs use [[analog-to-digital converter]]s to convert the electrical activity of the heart to a [[digital signal]].

The standard ECG leads (external leads) are I, II, III, aVL, V<sub>1</sub>, and V<sub>6</sub>. Two to four intracardiac leads are added via cardiac catheterization. The word \"electrogram\" (EGM) without further specification usually means an intracardiac electrogram.\n\n===Lead locations on an ECG report===\nA standard 12-lead ECG report (an electrocardiograph) shows a 2.5 second tracing of each of the twelve leads. The tracings are most commonly arranged in a grid of four columns and three rows. The first column is the limb leads (I, II, and III), the second column is the augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, and aVF), and the last two columns are the precordial leads (V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>6</sub>).\nAdditionally, a rhythm strip may be included as a fourth or fifth row.\n\nThe timing across the page is continuous and not tracings of the 12 leads for the same time period.\nIn other words, if the output were traced by needles on paper, each row would switch which leads as the paper is pulled under the needle.\nFor example, the top row would first trace lead I, then switch to lead aVR, then switch to V<sub>1</sub>, and then switch to V<sub>4</sub>, and so none of these four tracings of the leads are from the same time period as they are traced in sequence through time.\n\n==={{anchor|Lead groups}}Contiguity of leads===\n[[File:Contiguous leads.svg|300px|thumb|Diagram showing the contiguous leads in the same color in the standard 12-lead layout]]\nEach of the 12 ECG leads records the electrical activity of the heart from a different angle, and therefore align with different anatomical areas of the heart. Two leads that look at neighboring anatomical areas are said to be ''contiguous''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Category\n! Leads\n!

For example, though V<sub>4</sub> is an anterior lead and V<sub>5</sub> is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are next to one another.\n\n==Electrophysiology==\n{{main|Cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\nThe study of the conduction system of the heart is called [[cardiac electrophysiology]] (EP).  An EP study is performed via a right-sided [[cardiac catheterization]]: a wire with an electrode at its tip is inserted into the right heart chambers from a peripheral vein, and placed in various positions in close proximity to the conduction system so that the electrical activity of that system can be recorded.\n\n==Interpretation==\nInterpretation of the ECG is fundamentally about understanding the [[electrical conduction system of the heart]].\nNormal conduction starts and propagates in a predictable pattern, and deviation from this pattern can be a normal variation or be [[pathological]].\nAn ECG does not equate with mechanical pumping activity of the heart, for example, [[pulseless electrical activity]] produces an ECG that should pump blood but no pulses are felt (and constitutes a [[medical emergency]] and [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] should be performed).\n[[Ventricular fibrillation]] produces an ECG but is too dysfunctional to produce a life-sustaining cardiac output. Certain rhythms are known to have good cardiac output and some are known to have bad cardiac output.\nUltimately, an [[echocardiogram]] or other anatomical imaging modality is useful in assessing the mechanical function of the heart.\n\nLike all medical tests, what constitutes \"normal\" is based on [[population studies]]. The heartrate range of between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is considered normal since data shows this to be the usual resting heart rate.\n\n===Theory===\n[[File:ECG Vector.svg|230px|thumb|right|QRS is upright in a lead when its axis is aligned with that lead's [[Euclidean vector|vector]]]]\n[[File:EKG Complex en.svg|280px|thumb|Schematic representation of a normal ECG]]\n\nInterpretation of the ECG is ultimately that of pattern recognition.\nIn order to understand the patterns found, it is helpful to understand the theory of what ECGs represent.\nThe theory is rooted in [[electromagnetics]] and boils down to the four following points:\n* depolarization of the heart ''towards'' the positive electrode produces a positive deflection\n* depolarization of the heart ''away'' from the positive electrode produces a negative deflection\n* repolarization of the heart ''towards'' the positive electrode produces a negative deflection\n* repolarization of the heart ''away'' from the positive electrode produces a positive deflection\n\nThus, the overall direction of depolarization and repolarization produces positive or negative deflection on each lead's trace.\nFor example, depolarizing from right to left would produce a positive deflection in lead I because the two vectors point in the same direction.\nIn contrast, that same depolarization would produce minimal deflection in V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> because the vectors are perpendicular, and this phenomenon is called isoelectric.\n\nNormal rhythm produces four entities \u2013 a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and a U wave \u2013 that each have a fairly unique pattern.\n* The P wave represents atrial depolarization.\n* The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization.\n* The T wave represents ventricular repolarization.\n* The U wave represents papillary muscle repolarization.\n\nChanges in the structure of the heart and its surroundings (including blood composition) change the patterns of these four entities.\n\nThe U wave is not typically seen and its absence is generally ignored. Atrial repolarisation is typically hidden in the much more prominent QRS complex and normally cannot be seen without additional, specialised electrodes.\n\n===Background grid===\nECGs are normally printed on a grid.\nThe horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents voltage.\nThe standard values on this grid are shown in the adjacent image:\n* A small box is 1&nbsp;mm \u00d7  1&nbsp;mm and represents 0.1 mV \u00d7 0.04 seconds.\n* A large box is 5&nbsp;mm \u00d7  5&nbsp;mm and represents 0.5 mV \u00d7  0.20 seconds.\n\nThe \"large\" box is represented by a heavier [[Font weight|line weight]] than the small boxes.\n\n[[File:ECG Paper v2.svg|500px|left|Measuring time and voltage with ECG graph paper]]\n{{clear}}\n\nNot all aspects of an ECG rely on precise recordings or having a known scaling of amplitude or time.\nFor example, determining if the tracing is a sinus rhythm only requires feature recognition and matching, and not measurement of amplitudes or times (i.e., the scale of the grids are irrelevant).\nAn example to the contrary, the voltage requirements of [[left ventricular hypertrophy]] require knowing the grid scale.\n\n===Rate and rhythm===\nIn a normal heart, the heart rate is the rate in which the [[sinoatrial node]] depolarizes since it is the source of depolarization of the heart.\nHeart rate, like other [[vital signs]] such as blood pressure and respiratory rate, change with age.\nIn adults, a normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm (normocardic), whereas it is higher in children.\nA heart rate below normal is called \"[[bradycardia]]\" (<60 in adults) and above normal is called \"[[tachycardia]]\" (>100 in adults).\nA complication of this is when the atria and ventricles are not in synchrony and the \"heart rate\" must be specified as atrial or ventricular (e.g., the ventricular rate in [[ventricular fibrillation]] is 300\u2013600 bpm, whereas the atrial rate can be normal [60\u2013100] or faster [100\u2013150]).\n\nIn normal resting hearts, the physiologic rhythm of the heart is [[normal sinus rhythm]] (NSR).\nNormal sinus rhythm produces the prototypical pattern of P wave, QRS complex, and T wave.\nGenerally, deviation from normal sinus rhythm is considered a [[cardiac arrhythmia]].\nThus, the first question in interpreting an ECG is whether or not there is a sinus rhythm.\nA criterion for sinus rhythm is that P waves and QRS complexes appear 1-to-1, thus implying that the P wave causes the QRS complex.\n\nOnce sinus rhythm is established, or not, the second question is the rate.\nFor a sinus rhythm, this is either the rate of P waves or QRS complexes since they are 1-to-1.\nIf the rate is too fast, then it is [[sinus tachycardia]], and if it is too slow, then it is [[sinus bradycardia]].\n\nIf it is not a sinus rhythm, then determining the rhythm is necessary before proceeding with further interpretation.\nSome arrhythmias with characteristic findings:\n* Absent P waves with \"irregularly irregular\" QRS complexes is the hallmark of [[atrial fibrillation]].\n* A \"saw tooth\" pattern with QRS complexes is the hallmark of [[atrial flutter]].\n* A [[sine wave]] pattern is the hallmark of [[ventricular flutter]].\n* Absent P waves with wide QRS complexes and a fast heart rate is [[ventricular tachycardia]].\n\nDetermination of rate and rhythm is necessary in order to make sense of further interpretation.\n\n===Axis===\nThe heart has several axes, but the most common by far is the axis of the QRS complex (references to \"the axis\" imply the QRS axis).\nEach axis can be computationally determined to result in a number representing degrees of deviation from zero, or it can be categorized into a few types.\n\nThe QRS axis is the general direction of the ventricular depolarization wavefront (or mean electrical vector) in the frontal plane.\nIt is often sufficient to classify the axis as one of three types: normal, left deviated, or right deviated.\nPopulation data shows that a normal QRS axis is from \u221230\u00b0 to 105\u00b0, with 0\u00b0 being along lead I and positive being inferior and negative being superior (best understood graphically as the [[hexaxial reference system]]).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chou's electrocardiography in clinical practice : adult and pediatric |last=Surawicz |first=Borys |last2=Knillans |first2=Timothy |date=2008 |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |isbn=978-1416037743 |edition=6th |location=Philadelphia, PA |page=12}}</ref>\nBeyond +105\u00b0 is [[right axis deviation]] and beyond \u221230\u00b0 is [[left axis deviation]] (the third quadrant of \u221290\u00b0 to \u2212180\u00b0 is very rare and is an indeterminate axis).\nA shortcut for determining if the QRS axis is normal is if the QRS complex is mostly positive in lead I and lead II (or lead I and aVF if +90\u00b0 is the upper limit of normal).\n\nThe normal QRS axis is generally ''down and to the left'', following the anatomical orientation of the heart within the chest. An abnormal axis suggests a change in the physical shape and orientation of the heart or a defect in its conduction system that causes the ventricles to depolarize in an abnormal way.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Any deviation from the normal tracing is potentially pathological and therefore of clinical significance.\n\nFor ease of measuring the amplitudes and intervals, an ECG is printed on graph paper at a standard scale: each 1&nbsp;mm (one small box on the standard ECG paper) represents 40 milliseconds of time on the x-axis, and 0.1 millivolts on the y-axis.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Feature\n!Description\n!Pathology\n!Duration\n|-\n|[[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]]\n|The P wave represents depolarization of the atria. Atrial depolarization spreads from the SA node towards the AV node, and from the right [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]] to the left [[atrium (anatomy)|atrium]].\n|The P wave is typically upright in most leads except for aVR; an unusual P wave axis (inverted in other leads) can indicate an [[Ectopic pacemaker|ectopic atrial pacemaker]]. If the P wave is of unusually long duration, it may represent atrial enlargement. Typically a large ''right atrium'' gives a tall, peaked P wave while a large ''left atrium'' gives a two-humped bifid P wave.\n|<80 ms\n|-\n|[[PR interval]]\n|The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. This interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus node through the AV node.\n|A PR interval shorter than 120 ms suggests that the electrical impulse is bypassing the AV node, as in [[Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome]]. A PR interval consistently longer than 200 ms diagnoses [[first degree atrioventricular block]]. The PR segment (the portion of the tracing after the P wave and before the QRS complex) is typically completely flat, but may be depressed in [[pericarditis]].\n|120 to 200 ms\n|-\n|[[QRS complex]]\n|The QRS complex represents the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles. The ventricles have a large muscle mass compared to the atria, so the QRS complex usually has a much larger amplitude than the P wave.\n|If the QRS complex is wide (longer than 120 ms) it suggests disruption of the heart's conduction system, such as in [[LBBB]], [[RBBB]], or ventricular rhythms such as [[ventricular tachycardia]]. Metabolic issues such as severe [[hyperkalemia]], or [[tricyclic antidepressant overdose]] can also widen the QRS complex.

[[ST elevation]] can also be caused by [[pericarditis]], [[Brugada syndrome]], or can be a normal variant (J-point elevation).\n|\n|-\n|[[T wave]]\n|The T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles.

Recall that a positive current (as created by depolarization of cardiac cells) traveling towards the positive electrode and away from the negative electrode creates a positive deflection on the ECG. Likewise, a positive current traveling away from the positive electrode and towards the negative electrode creates a negative deflection on the ECG.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://simple-cardio.blogspot.com/2012/12/ecg-ekg-paper.html |title=Simple Cardiology: - ECG (EKG) Paper. |last=Cardio-online |date=2012-12-12 |website=Simple Cardiology |access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cvphysiology.com/Arrhythmias/A014 |title=CV Physiology {{!}} Volume Conductor Principles and ECG Rules of Interpretation |website=www.cvphysiology.com |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> The red arrow represents the overall direction of travel of the depolarization. The magnitude of the red arrow is proportional to the amount of tissue being depolarized at that instance. The red arrow is simultaneously shown on the axis of each of the 3 limb leads. Both the direction and the magnitude of the red arrow's projection onto the axis of each limb lead is shown with blue arrows. Then, the direction and magnitude of the blue arrows are what theoretically determine the deflections on the ECG. For example, as a blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves from the negative electrode, to the right, towards the positive electrode, the ECG line rises, creating an upward wave. As the blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves to the left, a downward wave is created. The greater the magnitude of the blue arrow, the greater the deflection on the ECG for that particular limb lead.\n\nFrames 1 through 3 depict the depolarization being generated in and spreading through the [[Sinoatrial node]]. The SA node is too small for its depolarization to be detected on most ECGs. Frames 4 through 10 depict the depolarization traveling through the atria, towards the [[Atrioventricular node]]. During frame 7, the depolarization is traveling through the largest amount of tissue in the atria, which creates the highest point in the P wave. Frames 11 and 12 depict the depolarization traveling through the AV node. Like the SA node, the AV node is too small for the depolarization of its tissue to be detected on most ECGs. This creates the flat PR segment.<ref>{{Citation |last=Noble |first=R.

It depicts the depolarization as it starts to travel down the interventricular septum, through the [[Bundle of His]] and [[Bundle branches]]. After the Bundle of His, the conduction system splits into the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. Both branches conduct action potentials at about 1&nbsp;m/s. Interestingly, however, the action potential starts traveling down the left bundle branch about 5 milliseconds before it starts traveling down the right bundle branch, as depicted by frame 13. This causes the depolarization of the interventricular septum tissue to spread from left to right, as depicted by the red arrow in frame 14. In some cases, this gives rise to a negative deflection after the PR interval, creating a Q wave such as the one seen in lead I in the animation to the right. Depending on the mean electrical axis of the heart, this phenomenon can result in a Q wave in lead II as well.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scher |first=Allen M. |last2=Young |first2=Allan C. |last3=Malmgren |first3=Arthur L. |last4=Erickson |first4=Robert V. |date=January 1955 |title=Activation of the Interventricular Septum |journal=Circulation Research |language=en |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201364 |doi=10.1161/01.RES.3.1.56 |pmid=13231277 |issn=0009-7330}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cvphysiology.com/Arrhythmias/A016 |title=CV Physiology {{!}} Ventricular Depolarization and the Mean Electrical Axis |website=www.cvphysiology.com |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\nFollowing depolarization of the interventricular septum, the depolarization travels towards the apex of the heart. This is depicted by frames 15 through 17 and results in a positive deflection on all three limb leads, which creates the R wave. Frames 18 through 21 then depict the depolarization as it travels throughout both ventricles from the apex of the heart, following the action potential in the [[Purkinje fibers]]. This phenomenon creates a negative deflection in all three limb leads, forming the S wave on the ECG. Repolarization of the atria occurs at the same time as the generation of the QRS complex, but it is not detected by the ECG since the tissue mass of the ventricles is so much larger than that of the atria. Ventricular contraction occurs between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. During this time, there is no movement of charge, so no deflection is created on the ECG. This results in the flat ST segment after the S wave.\n\nFrames 24 through 28 in the animation depict repolarization of the ventricles. The epicardium is the first layer of the ventricles to repolarize, followed by the myocardium. The endocardium is the last layer to repolarize. The plateau phase of depolarization has been shown to last longer in endocardial cells than in epicardial cells. This causes repolarization to start from the apex of the heart and move upwards. Since repolarization is the spread of negative current as membrane potentials decrease back down to the resting membrane potential, the red arrow in the animation is pointing in the direction opposite of the repolarization. This therefore creates a positive deflection in the ECG, and creates the T wave.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lukas |first=Anton |date=2016-06-29 |title=Electrophysiology of Myocardial Cells in the Epicardial, Midmyocardial, and Endocardial Layers of the Ventricle |journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Therapeutics |language=en |doi=10.1177/107424849700200108 |pmid=10684443 |volume=2 |pages=61\u201372}}</ref>\n\n===Ischemia and infarction===\n{{Main|Electrocardiography in myocardial infarction}}\nIschemia or [[NSTEMI|non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions]] (non-STEMIs) may manifest as [[ST depression]] or inversion of [[T wave]]s.

Overall, the diagnoses are made based on the patterns.  For example, an \"irregularly irregular\" QRS complex without P waves is the hallmark of [[atrial fibrillation]]; however, other findings can be present as well, such as a [[bundle branch block]] that alters the shape of the QRS complexes.  ECGs can be interpreted in isolation but should be applied \u2013 like all [[diagnostic tests]] \u2013 in the context of the patient.  For example, an observation of peaked T waves is not sufficient to diagnose hyperkalemia; such a diagnosis should be verified by measuring the blood potassium level.  Conversely, a discovery of hyperkalemia should be followed by an ECG for manifestations such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and loss of P waves.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]], launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''.\n(English ''chapman'', German ''Kaufmann'', Dutch ''koopman'', Swedish ''k\u00f6pman'', Danish ''k\u00f8bmand'', Icelandic ''kaupma\u00f0ur'': in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin ''caupo'', \"tradesman\".)

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C.

Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city.

To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616.
