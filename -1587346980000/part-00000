Higgs was preceded by the interim leader of his party [[Bruce Fitch]].\n\n==History==\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Gallant government opened the legislature's second session with a promise to \"get tough\" on the province's tattered finances. The speech from the throne documented how the province had accumulated a debt of $12.4 billion by failing to produce a balanced budget since 2007. The province spent more on interest payments than it did on post-secondary education, and the consultation of citizens called the \"Strategic Program Review\" had all but concluded. The province said its credit rating was at risk, and the costs to service the debt if the rating were downgraded would then rise.  The projected deficit for the 2015-16 budget was at the time $453 million. A report issued the previous Friday had calculated at $300 million the benefit to the government of a two-percent rise of the [[harmonized sales tax]] (HST) from 13% to 15%.<ref name=\"throne\">{{cite news|title=New Brunswick throne speech warns of looming get-tough budget|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/new-brunswick-speech-from-the-throne-warns-of-looming-get-tough-budget/article27553200/|accessdate=11 June 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|date=1 December 2015|location=Toronto}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 2015, it was brought to light that the province's [[Medical Officer for Health|Chief Medical Officer of Health]] Dr. Eilish Cleary had been obliged by her Deputy Minister to go \"on leave\". She said she was not allowed to discuss the reasons for the leave. \"I was surprised and upset when it happened. The whole situation has caused me significant stress and anxiety. And not being able to talk about it makes it worse.\" Her office had been \"developing a plan to further explore\" the [[carcinogenic]] effects of [[glyphosate]], a substance which was found earlier in 2015 to be \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], a branch of the [[World Health Organization]], and which is utilized in New Brunswick by forestry company [[J.D. Irving Ltd.]] and by [[NB Power]], a provincial Crown corporation. [[Victor Boudreau]], the Minister of Health at the time, told reporters Cleary's leave was \"a personnel matter. It's not something we can comment about. It has nothing to do with the office per se, or the independence of the office. It's an HR issue and I won't comment anymore.\"<ref name=cbc2dec>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/eilish-cleary-glyphosate-leave-1.3347020 cbc.ca: \"Dr. Eilish Cleary studying glyphosate when put on leave\"], 2 Dec 2015</ref> The next day, the Deputy Minister of Health, Tom Maston, rejected suggestions that Cleary was being silenced, and the Minister of Environment was questioned on the matter in the legislature.

([[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservative]]) led the Official Opposition from fall 2016 until the end of the legislature.  Higgs was preceded by the interim leader of his party [[Bruce Fitch]].\n\n==History==\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Gallant government opened the legislature's second session with a promise to \"get tough\" on the province's tattered finances. The speech from the throne documented how the province had accumulated a debt of $12.4 billion by failing to produce a balanced budget since 2007. The province spent more on interest payments than it did on post-secondary education, and the consultation of citizens called the \"Strategic Program Review\" had all but concluded. The province said its credit rating was at risk, and the costs to service the debt if the rating were downgraded would then rise.  The projected deficit for the 2015-16 budget was at the time $453 million. A report issued the previous Friday had calculated at $300 million the benefit to the government of a two-percent rise of the [[harmonized sales tax]] (HST) from 13% to 15%.<ref name=\"throne\">{{cite news|title=New Brunswick throne speech warns of looming get-tough budget|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/new-brunswick-speech-from-the-throne-warns-of-looming-get-tough-budget/article27553200/|accessdate=11 June 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|date=1 December 2015|location=Toronto}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 2015, it was brought to light that the province's [[Medical Officer for Health|Chief Medical Officer of Health]] Dr. Eilish Cleary had been obliged by her Deputy Minister to go \"on leave\". She said she was not allowed to discuss the reasons for the leave. \"I was surprised and upset when it happened. The whole situation has caused me significant stress and anxiety. And not being able to talk about it makes it worse.\" Her office had been \"developing a plan to further explore\" the [[carcinogenic]] effects [[glyphosate]], a substance which was found earlier in 2015 to be \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], a branch of the [[World Health Organization]], and which is utilized in New Brunswick by forestry company [[J.D. Irving Ltd.]] and by [[NB Power]], a provincial Crown corporation. [[Victor Boudreau]], the Minister of Health at the time, told reporters Cleary's leave was \"a personnel matter. It's not something we can comment about. It has nothing to do with the office per se, or the independence of the office. It's an HR issue and I won't comment anymore.\"<ref name=cbc2dec>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/eilish-cleary-glyphosate-leave-1.3347020 cbc.ca: \"Dr. Eilish Cleary studying glyphosate when put on leave\"], 2 Dec 2015</ref> The next day, the Deputy Minister of Health, Tom Maston, rejected suggestions that Cleary was being silenced, and the Minister of Environment was questioned on the matter in the legislature.  The [[leader of the opposition]] said that there was a \"disturbing\" trend of the Gallant Liberals trying to silence independent watchdogs, and pointed to the ruling party's recent feud with the [[Auditor-General]] and failure to appoint a new [[conflict of interest]] commissioner for six months.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/eilish-cleary-health-glyphosate-1.3349554 cbc.ca: \"Eilish Cleary not on leave to force silence: deputy minister\"], 3 Dec 2015</ref> On 7 December, Cleary\u2014who had been removed from her office on 2 November\u2014stated in an e-mail that she had been fired by the provincial government without cause: \"I can confirm that my employment as Chief Medical Officer has been terminated without cause effective immediately.\" The government did not respond to requests for information, while various opposition politicians made hay and a public protest ensued in support of Cleary.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/eilish-cleary-fired-nb-1.3354380 cbc.ca: \"Dr. Eilish Cleary says she was fired by the Gallant government\"], 7 Dec 2015</ref> The next day, the Liberal government was grilled in question period.

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Summary==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914131104/http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0304/numeri.jsp|title= Season 2002-30 Palermo |publisher=ilpalermocalcio.it|language=Italian}}</ref>. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs

Friedman]] that analyzes [[globalization]], primarily in the early 21st century. The title is a metaphor for viewing the world as a [[level playing field]] in terms of commerce, wherein all competitors have an equal opportunity. As the first edition cover illustration indicates, the title also alludes to the perceptual shift required for countries, companies, and individuals to remain competitive in a global market in which historical and geographic divisions are becoming increasingly irrelevant.\n\nFriedman is a strong advocate of those changes, calling himself a \"free-trader\" and a \"compassionate flatist\", and he criticizes societies that resist the changes. He emphasizes the inevitability of a rapid pace of change and the extent to which the emerging abilities of individuals and developing countries are creating many pressures on businesses and individuals in the United States; he has special advice for Americans and for the developing world (but says almost nothing about Europe). Friedman's is a popular work based on much personal research, travel, conversation, and reflection. In his characteristic style, through personal anecdotes and opinions, he combines in ''The World Is Flat'' a conceptual analysis accessible to a broad public. The book was first released in 2005, was later released as an \"updated and expanded\" edition in 2006, and was yet again released with additional updates in 2007 as \"further updated and expanded: Release 3.0\". The title was derived from a statement by [[Nandan Nilekani]], former CEO of [[Infosys]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Daniel H.

Friedman termed the period Globalization 3.0, thereby differentiating it from the previous, Globalization 1.0, during which countries and governments were the main protagonists, and Globalization 2.0, during which multinational companies led the way in driving global integration.\n\nFriedman recounts many examples of companies based in India and China that, by providing labor ranging from that of typists and call center operators to accountants and computer programmers, have become integral parts of complex global [[supply chains]]; such companies are [[Dell]], [[AOL]], and [[Microsoft]]. Friedman's [[capitalist peace]] theory called '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''' is discussed in the book's penultimate chapter.\n\nFriedman repeatedly uses lists as organizational devices to communicate key concepts, usually numbered and often with provocative labels. Two example lists are the ten forces that flattened the world, and three points of convergence.\n\n=== Ten flatteners ===\nFriedman defines ten \"flatteners\" that he sees as levelling the global playing field:\n# '''[[Collapse of the Berlin Wall]] &ndash; 9/11/89''': Friedman called the flattener \"When the walls came down, and the windows came up.\" The event not only symbolized the end of the [[Cold War]] but also allowed people from the other side of the wall to join the economic mainstream. \"11/9/89\" is a discussion about the Berlin Wall's coming down, the \"fall\" of communism, and the impact that Windows-powered PCs (personal computers) had on the ability of individuals to create their own content and connect to one another. At that point, the basic platform for the revolution to follow was created: the IBM PC, Windows, a graphical interface for word processing, dial-up modems, a standardized tool for communication, and a global phone network.\n# '''[[Netscape]] &ndash; 8/9/95''': Netscape went public at the price of $28. Netscape and the Web broadened the audience for the Internet from its roots as a communications medium used primarily by \"early adopters and geeks\" to something that made the Internet accessible to everyone from five-year-olds to ninety-five-year-olds. The digitization that took place meant that everyday occurrences such as words, files, films, music, and pictures could be accessed and manipulated on a computer screen by all people across the world.\n# '''[[Workflow management system|Workflow software]]''': This is Friedman's catch-all for the standards and technologies that allowed work to flow. It is the ability of machines to talk to other machines with no humans involved. Friedman believes the first three forces have become a \"crude foundation of a whole new global platform for collaboration\". This is complemented by the emergence of software protocols ([[SMTP]] &ndash; simple mail transfer protocol; [[HTML]] &ndash; the language that enabled anyone to design and publish documents that could be transmitted to and read on any computer anywhere). The emergence of such software is the \"Genesis moment of the flat world\" and means \"that people can work with other people on more stuff than ever before\". This created a global platform for multiple forms of collaboration, on which the next six flatteners depend.\n# '''[[Uploading]]''': Uploading involves communities that upload and collaborate on online projects. Examples are [[Open-source software|open source]] software, blogs, and [[Wikipedia]]. Friedman considers the phenomenon \"the most disruptive force of all\".\n# '''[[Outsourcing]]''': Friedman argues that outsourcing has enabled companies to split service and manufacturing activities into components that can be subcontracted and performed in the most efficient, most cost-effective way. This process became easier with the mass distribution of fiber-optic cable during the introduction of the World Wide Web.\n# '''[[Offshoring]]''': This is the internal relocation of a company's manufacturing or other processes to a foreign land to take advantage of less costly operations there. China's entrance into the [[World Trade Organization]] allowed for greater competition on the playing field. Now such countries as Malaysia, Mexico, and Brazil must compete against China and one another to have businesses offshore to them.\n# '''[[Supply-chain]]ing'mpares the modern retail supply chain to a river by pointing to [[Wal-Mart]] as the best example of a company that uses technology to streamline item sales, distribution, and shipping.\n# '''[[Insourcing]]''': Friedman uses [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] as a prime example for insourcing, whereby the company's employees perform services &ndash; beyond shipping &ndash; for another company. For example, UPS repairs Toshiba computers on behalf of Toshiba. The work is done at the UPS hub by UPS employees.\n# '''Informing''': Google and other search engines and Wikipedia are the prime examples. \"Never before in the history of the planet have so many people &ndash; on their own &ndash; had the ability to find so much information about so many things and about so many other people\", writes Friedman. The growth of search engines is tremendous; for example, Friedman states, Google is \"now processing roughly one billion searches per day, up from 150 million just three years ago\".\n# '''\"The Steroids\"''': The steroids are wireless, [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP), and file sharing and are used on personal digital devices like mobile phones, iPods, and personal digital assistants; on instant messaging; and on VoIP phones. Digital, mobile, personal, and virtual as well as all analog content and processes (from entertainment to photography, to word processing) can be digitized and therefore shaped, manipulated, and transmitted; and these processes can be done at high speed with total ease; mobile can be done anywhere and anytime by anyone, and can be done to anyone.\n\n=== Proposed remedies ===\nFriedman believes that to fight the quiet crisis of a flattening world, the US workforce should keep updating its work skills. Making the workforce more adaptable, Friedman argues, will keep it more employable. He also suggests that the government make it easier for people to switch jobs by making retirement benefits and health insurance less dependent on one's employer and by providing insurance that would partly cover a possible drop in income when changing jobs. Friedman also believes there should be more inspiration for youth to become scientists, engineers, and mathematicians because of a decrease in the percentage of those professionals who are American.\n\n===Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention===\n\nThe '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''', also known as simply the '''Dell Theory''', is a [[capitalist peace]] theory and an updated version of Friedman's previous \"[[Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention]]\". According to Friedman:\n\n{{quote|The Dell Theory stipulates: No two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, like Dell's, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain.<ref name=\"Friedman, 421\">''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421</ref>}}\n\nThat is, as long as corporations have major [[supply chain]] operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts. This is because of the economic interdependence between nations that arises when a large corporation (such as [[Dell]]) has supply chain operations in multiple global locations and when developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) are reluctant to give up their newfound wealth.\n\nIn his previous book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'', Friedman argued that no two nations with a [[McDonald's]] franchise had ever gone to war with one another; this was known as the [[Golden Arches theory]]. Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the \"Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention\" by saying that people or nations do not just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by a McDonald's franchise in their downtown but also want to have that lump of the labor sector that is created by [[globalization]]. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multinational companies that venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.\n\n[[Thomas Friedman]] also warns that the Dell theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations that are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It means, rather, that the governments of those nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. Such costs include long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.\n\nThis theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in their [[2001\u20132002 India\u2013Pakistan standoff|2001\u20132002 nuclear standoff]], wherein India was at risk of losing its global partners. [[Cross-Strait relations|The relationship]] between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] was also cited as an example of that theory: both countries have strong supply relations with each other, and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''The World Is Flat'' received generally positive popular and critical reception as well as some negative criticism, peppered with doubt.\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the book an \"engrossing tour\" and an \"enthralling read\". The review closed with, \"We've no real idea how the 21st century's history will unfold, but this terrifically stimulating book will certainly inspire readers to start thinking it all through\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17314-2005Mar31.html |title=The Great Leveling |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2005-04-03|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref>\n\nAn opposing viewpoint was found in a 2007 ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine article in which Professor [[Pankaj Ghemawat]] argued that 90% of the world's phone calls, [[World Wide Web|Web]] traffic, and investments are local, suggesting that Friedman has grossly exaggerated the significance of the trends he describes: \"Despite talk of a new, wired world where information, ideas, money, and people can move around the planet faster than ever before, just a fraction of what we consider globalization actually exists.\"<ref>Pankaj Ghemawat (March/April 2007).

Friedman's work history has been mostly with ''[[The New York Times]]'', and that may have influenced the way the book was written &ndash; some would have preferred a book written in a more \"inclusive voice\".<ref>Peter Begley (2006).

Not only is the world not flat: in many ways, it has been getting less flat.|author=Joseph E. Stiglitz (2007): ''[[Making Globalization Work]]''. pp.&nbsp;56\u201357}}\n\n[[Richard Florida]] expresses similar views in his 2005 ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic]]'' article \"The World Is Spiky\".<ref>Richard Florida (October 2005).

Accessed 2009-05-09.</ref>\n\nJohn Gray, formerly a School Professor of European Thought at the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]], wrote another critical review of Friedman's book called \"The World Is Round\". In it, Gray confirms Friedman's assertion that globalization is making the world more interconnected and, in some parts, richer but disputes the notion that globalization makes the world more peaceful or freer. Gray also declares, \"least of all does it make it flat\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Gray, John|title=The World is Round|edition= Trans. Array, Web|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|year= 2005|pages= 1\u20139}}</ref>\n\nGeographers on the whole have been particularly critical of Friedman's writings, views influenced by the large body of work within their field demonstrating the uneven nature of globalization, the strong influence place still has on people's lives, and the dependent relationships that have been established between the have and have-not regions in the current world-system. Geographer [[Harm de Blij]] detailed those arguments for the general public in ''Why Geography Matters: Three Challenges Facing America'' (2005) and ''The Power of Place: Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape'' (2008).\n\n== Editions ==\n\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat|edition=1st|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]|year=2005|isbn=0-374-29288-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/worldisflatbri00frie}} [The original jacket illustration, reproducing the painting ''I Told You So'' by [[Ed Miracle]], depicting a sailing ship falling off the edge of the world, was changed during the print run due to copyright issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/10/17/8358061/index.htm |title=A Painter Is Flat-Out Flimflammed |accessdate=2007-10-21 |author=[[Justin Fox]] |date=October 17, 2005 |work=[[Fortune Magazine]]}}</ref> These issues were settled in March, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanlaw.typepad.com/humanlaw/2006/03/the_world_is_fl.html|title=The World Is Flat - Ed Miracle and defendants settle case|publisher=}}</ref>]\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat|publisher=Audio Renaissance|edition=Audiobook|year= 2005|isbn=1-59397-668-2}}\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat: Updated and Expanded (Release 2.0)|edition=2nd |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |year=2006|isbn= 0-374-29279-5}}\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat: Further Updated and Expanded (Release 3.0)|edition=2nd revised and expanded |publisher= Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year= 2007|isbn= 0-374-29278-7}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/ Author's website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World Is Flat, The}}\n[[Category:2005 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Books about globalization]]\n[[Category:Texts related to the history of the Internet]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2016}}\n{{Infobox book\n | name = The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century\n | image = Worldisflat.gif\n | caption = Original 1st edition cover\n | author = [[Thomas Friedman]]\n | country = United States\n | language = English\n | subject = [[Globalization]]\n | publisher = [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]\n | release_date = April 5, 2005\n | media_type = Print ([[Hardcover]] and [[Paperback]]) and [[Compact disc|audio-CD]]\n | pages = 488\n | isbn = 0-374-29288-4\n | dewey= 330.90511 22\n| congress= HM846 .F74 2005\n| oclc= 57202171\n| preceded_by = [[Longitudes and Attitudes]]\n| followed_by = [[Hot, Flat, and Crowded]]\n}}\n\n'''''The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century''''' is an international best-selling book by [[Thomas Friedman|Thomas L.

Friedman termed the period Globalization 3.0, thereby differentiating it from the previous, Globalization 1.0, during which countries and governments were the main protagonists, and Globalization 2.0, during which multinational companies led the way in driving global integration.\n\nFriedman recounts many examples of companies based in India and China that, by providing labor ranging from that of typists and call center operators to accountants and computer programmers, have become integral parts of complex global [[supply chains]]; such companies are [[Dell]], [[AOL]], and [[Microsoft]]. Friedman's [[capitalist peace]] theory called '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''' is discussed in the book's penultimate chapter.\n\nFriedman repeatedly uses lists as organizational devices to communicate key concepts, usually numbered and often with provocative labels. Two example lists are the ten forces that flattened the world, and three points of convergence.\n\n=== Ten flatteners ===\nFriedman defines ten \"flatteners\" that he sees as levelling the global playing field:\n# '''[[Collapse of the Berlin Wall]] &ndash; 9/11/89''': Friedman called the flattener \"When the walls came down, and the windows came up.\" The event not only symbolized the end of the [[Cold War]] but also allowed people from the other side of the wall to join the economic mainstream. \"11/9/89\" is a discussion about the Berlin Wall's coming down, the \"fall\" of communism, and the impact that Windows-powered PCs (personal computers) had on the ability of individuals to create their own content and connect to one another. At that point, the basic platform for the revolution to follow was created: the IBM PC, Windows, a graphical interface for word processing, dial-up modems, a standardized tool for communication, and a global phone network.\n# '''[[Netscape]] &ndash; 8/9/95''': Netscape went public at the price of $28. Netscape and the Web broadened the audience for the Internet from its roots as a communications medium used primarily by \"early adopters and geeks\" to something that made the Internet accessible to everyone from five-year-olds to ninety-five-year-olds. The digitization that took place meant that everyday occurrences such as words, files, films, music, and pictures could be accessed and manipulated on a computer screen by all people across the world.\n# '''[[Workflow management system|Workflow software]]''': This is Friedman's catch-all for the standards and technologies that allowed work to flow. It is the ability of machines to talk to other machines with no humans involved. Friedman believes the first three forces have become a \"crude foundation of a whole new global platform for collaboration\". This is complemented by the emergence of software protocols ([[SMTP]] &ndash; simple mail transfer protocol; [[HTML]] &ndash; the language that enabled anyone to design and publish documents that could be transmitted to and read on any computer anywhere). The emergence of such software is the \"Genesis moment of the flat world\" and means \"that people can work with other people on more stuff than ever before\". This created a global platform for multiple forms of collaboration, on which the next six flatteners depend.\n# '''[[Uploading]]''': Uploading involves communities that upload and collaborate on online projects. Examples are [[Open-source software|open source]] software, blogs, and [[Wikipedia]]. Friedman considers the phenomenon \"the most disruptive force of all\".\n# '''[[Outsourcing]]''': Friedman argues that outsourcing has enabled companies to split service and manufacturing activities into components that can be subcontracted and performed in the most efficient, most cost-effective way. This process became easier with the mass distribution of fiber-optic cable during the introduction of the World Wide Web.\n# '''[[Offshoring]]''': This is the internal relocation of a company's manufacturing or other processes to a foreign land to take advantage of less costly operations there. China's entrance into the [[World Trade Organization]] allowed for greater competition on the playing field. Now such countries as Malaysia, Mexico, and Brazil must compete against China and one another to have businesses offshore to them.\n# '''[[Supply-chain]]ing''': Friedman compares the modern retail supply chain to a river by pointing to [[Wal-Mart]] as the best example of a company that uses technology to streamline item sales, distribution, and shipping.\n# '''[[Insourcing]]''': Friedman uses [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] as a prime example for insourcing, whereby the company's employees perform services &ndash; beyond shipping &ndash; for another company. For example, UPS repairs Toshiba computers on behalf of Toshiba. The work is done at the UPS hub by UPS employees.\n# '''Informing''': Google and other search engines and Wikipedia are the prime examples. \"Never before in the history of the planet have so many people &ndash; on their own &ndash; had the ability to find so much information about so many things and about so many other people\", writes Friedman. The growth of search engines is tremendous; for example, Friedman states, Google is \"now processing roughly one billion searches per day, up from 150 million just three years ago\".\n# '''\"The Steroids\"''': The steroids are wireless, [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP), and file sharing and are used on personal digital devices like mobile phones, iPods, and personal digital assistants; on instant messaging; and on VoIP phones. Digital, mobile, personal, and virtual as well as all analog content and processes (from entertainment to photography, to word processing) can be digitized and therefore shaped, manipulated, and transmitted; and these processes can be done at high speed with total ease; mobile can be done anywhere and anytime by anyone, and can be done to anyone.\n\n=== Proposed remedies ===\nFriedman believes that to fight the quiet crisis of a flattening world, the US workforce should keep updating its work skills. Making the workforce more adaptable, Friedman argues, will keep it more employable. He also suggests that the government make it easier for people to switch jobs by making retirement benefits and health insurance less dependent on one's employer and by providing insurance that would partly cover a possible drop in income when changing jobs. Friedman also believes there should be more inspiration for youth to become scientists, engineers, and mathematicians because of a decrease in the percentage of those professionals who are American.\n\n===Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention===\n\nThe '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''', also known as simply the '''Dell Theory''', is a [[capitalist peace]] theory and an updated version of Friedman's previous \"[[Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention]]\". According to Friedman:\n\n{{quote|The Dell Theory stipulates: No two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, like Dell's, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain.<ref name=\"Friedman, 421\">''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421</ref>}}\n\nThat is, as long as corporations have major [[supply chain]] operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts. This is because of the economic interdependence between nations that arises when a large corporation (such as [[Dell]]) has supply chain operations in multiple global locations and when developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) are reluctant to give up their newfound wealth.\n\nIn his previous book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'', Friedman argued that no two nations with a [[McDonald's]] franchise had ever gone to war with one another; this was known as the [[Golden Arches theory]]. Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the \"Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention\" by saying that people or nations do not just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by a McDonald's franchise in their downtown but also want to have that lump of the labor sector that is created by [[globalization]]. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multinational companies that venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.\n\n[[Thomas Friedman]] also warns that the Dell theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations that are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It means, rather, that the governments of those nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. Such costs include long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.\n\nThis theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in their [[2001\u20132002 India\u2013Pakistan standoff|2001\u20132002 nuclear standoff]], wherein India was at risk of losing its global partners. [[Cross-Strait relations|The relationship]] between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] was also cited as an example of that theory: both countries have strong supply relations with each other, and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''The World Is Flat'' received generally positive popular and critical reception as well as some negative criticism, peppered with doubt.\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the book an \"engrossing tour\" and an \"enthralling read\". The review closed with, \"We've no real idea how the 21st century's history will unfold, but this terrifically stimulating book will certainly inspire readers to start thinking it all through\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17314-2005Mar31.html |title=The Great Leveling |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2005-04-03|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref>\n\nAn opposing viewpoint was found in a 2007 ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine article in which Professor [[Pankaj Ghemawat]] argued that 90% of the world's phone calls, [[World Wide Web|Web]] traffic, and investments are local, suggesting that Friedman has grossly exaggerated the significance of the trends he describes: \"Despite talk of a new, wired world where information, ideas, money, and people can move around the planet faster than ever before, just a fraction of what we consider globalization actually exists.\"<ref>Pankaj Ghemawat (March/April 2007).

Accessed 2009-05-09.</ref>\n\nJohn Gray, formerly a School Professor of European Thought at the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]], wrote another critical review of Friedman's book called \"The World Is Round\". In it, Gray confirms Friedman's assertion that globalization is making the world more interconnected and, in some parts, richer but disputes the notion that globalization makes the world more peaceful or freer. Gray also declares, \"least of all does it make it flat\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Gray, John|title=The World is Round|edition= Trans. Array, Web|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|year= 2005|pages= 1\u20139}}</ref>\n\nGeographers on the whole have been particularly critical of Friedman's writings, views influenced by the large body of work within their field demonstrating the uneven nature of globalization, the strong influence place still has on people's lives, and the dependent relationships that have been established between the have and have-not regions in the current world-system. Geographer [[Harm de Blij]] detailed those arguments for the general public in ''Why Geography Matters: Three Challenges Facing America'' (2005) and ''The Power of Place: Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape'' (2008).\n\n== Editions ==\n\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat|edition=1st|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]|year=2005|isbn=0-374-29288-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/worldisflatbri00frie}} [The original jacket illustration, reproducing the painting ''I Told You So'' by [[Ed Miracle]], depicting a sailing ship falling off the edge of the world, was changed during the print run due to copyright issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/10/17/8358061/index.htm |title=A Painter Is Flat-Out Flimflammed |accessdate=2007-10-21 |author=[[Justin Fox]] |date=October 17, 2005 |work=[[Fortune Magazine]]}}</ref> These issues were settled in March, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanlaw.typepad.com/humanlaw/2006/03/the_world_is_fl.html|title=The World Is Flat - Ed Miracle and defendants settle case|publisher=}}</ref>]\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat|publisher=Audio Renaissance|edition=Audiobook|year= 2005|isbn=1-59397-668-2}}\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat: Updated and Expanded (Release 2.0)|edition=2nd |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |year=2006|isbn= 0-374-29279-5}}\n* {{cite book|title=The World is Flat: Further Updated and Expanded (Release 3.0)|edition=2nd revised and expanded |publisher= Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year= 2007|isbn= 0-374-29278-7}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/ Author's website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World Is Flat, The}}\n[[Category:2005 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Books about globalization]]\n[[Category:Texts related to the history of the Internet]]\n", "name_user": "173.3.9.233", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTen flatteners)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Is_Flat"}

He also blamed Warner Bros. for the poor commercial performance of ''Love Symbol'', claiming they had marketed it insufficiently. It was out of these developments that the aborted ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]'' was officially released, seven years after its initial recording. The \"new\" release was already in wide circulation as a [[bootleg recording|bootleg]].

The session vocalist was Raynard. J. The song appeared on a number of compilations, which was internationally distributed. An Italian court ruled on 2003 that Prince's 1994 hit, ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World'', was a plagiarism from the song by the two Italian writers. Bergonzi and Vicino won on appeal in 2007.

Warner Bros. allowed the single \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\" to be released via a small, independent distributor, [[Bellmark Records]], in February 1994. The release reached No. 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, but it did not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing ''The Gold Experience'', fearing poor sales and citing \"[[market saturation]]\" as a defense. When released in September 1995, ''The Gold Experience'' reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' 200 initially. The album is now out of print.\n\n''[[Chaos and Disorder]]'', released in 1996, was Prince's final album of new material for Warner Bros., as well as one of his least commercially successful releases.\n\n===1996\u20132000: Free at last \u2013 ''Emancipation'', ''Crystal Ball'' and ''Rave''===\nFree of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Prince attempted a major comeback later that year with the release of ''[[Emancipation (Prince album)|Emancipation]]'', a 36-song, 3-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long).

The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was shipped; these pre-orders were delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the ''Kamasutra'' disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail; one is a four-disc sized jewel case with a white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle while the other contains all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The ''[[Newpower Soul]]'' album was released three months later. His collaborations on [[Chaka Khan]]'s ''[[Come 2 My House]]'' and [[Larry Graham]]'s ''[[GCS2000]]'', both released on the [[NPG Records]] label around the same time as ''Newpower Soul'', were promoted by live appearances on ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe with Sinbad]]'' and the [[NBC]] ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show's Summer Concert Series.\n\nIn 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label, [[Arista Records]], to release a new record, ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]''.

In a press conference, he stated that after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name \"Prince\", he would revert to using his real name. Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol-shaped guitar.

Live!]]'', which features performances from the [[One Nite Alone...Tour]]. The 3-CD box set also includes a disc of \"aftershow\" music entitled ''It Ain't Over!''. During this time, Prince sought to engage more effectively with his fan base via the [[NPG Music Club]], pre-concert sound checks, and at yearly \"celebrations\" at Paisley Park, his music studios.

Warner Bros. allowed the single \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\" to be released via a small, independent distributor, [[Bellmark Records]], in February 1994. The release reached No. 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, but it did not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing ''The Gold Experience'', fearing poor sales and citing \"[[market saturation]]\" as a defense.

The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was shipped; these pre-orders were delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the ''Kamasutra'' disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail; one is a four-disc sized jewel case with a white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle while the other contains all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The ''[[Newpower Soul]]'' album was released three months later.

Prince continued to use the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and to play a Love Symbol-shaped guitar.
