On Ground 2, the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 the ERO was repealed by implication by the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] and/or the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) as applied in Hong Kong by the Basic Law. On Ground 3, the ERO cannot empower the Chief Executive to make any regulation restricting fundamental rights under the Basic Law or Bill of Rights. On Ground 4, the \u2018principle of legality ground\u2019, the Chief Executive acted ''ultra vires'' in that the ERO only applies to emergency situations. On Ground 5A, the \u2019section 3 proportionality ground\u2019, section 3 of the regulation, which prohibits the use of facial coverings, disproportionately restricts privacy, and freedom of expression and assembly; on Ground 5B, the \u2018section 5 proportionality ground\u2019, section 5, concerning enforcement powers, is also disproportionate.\n\n==== Ground 1: the delegation of legislative power ground ====\n\nThe applicants submitted that under the Basic Law, legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislative Council; since the ERO would grant legislative power to the executive, it is inconsistent with the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=35}}</ref> The government submitted that there is \u2018nothing in the Basic Law which provides whether expressly or by implication that the LegCo cannot authorise the CEIC [Chief Executive in Council] to make regulations during an occasion of public danger or emergency\u2019, that the ERO had already twice been held to be valid, that regulations made thereunder were not intended to be permanent, and that the LegCo could apply negative vetting to such regulations.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=36}}</ref>\n\nThe court declined to rule on the question of the constitutionality of the making of regulations by the Chief Executive in Council on an occasion of an emergency, and solely considered that concerning public danger.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=37}}</ref> The court accepted that there was a distinction between \u2018general legislative power\u2019 and the power to make \u2018subordinate legislation\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=53}}</ref> It drew such a distinction on the basis that the LegCo is \u2018designated as ''the'' legislature\u2019{{efn|Emphasis the court\u2019s.}} and that in the Chinese text of the Basic Law gives the LegCo \u2018''functions'' which in Chinese is \u201c\u8077\u201d in the phrase \u201c\u8077\u6b0a\u201d\u2019, which \u2018connotes\u2026[a] \u2019job\u2019\u201d.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=52}}</ref> The court then determined that the character of the powers granted by the ERO was more akin to that of a general legislative power than a subsidiary one, for several reasons. First, the powers granted by the ERO seemed not so much to \u2019leav[e] another body to devise the detailed legal norms that elaborate or put flesh on the broad matters laid down in the primary legislation\u2019 so much as to allow general legislation\u2014thus this very regulation was the first enactment to concern face covering in Hong Kong.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=56}}</ref> Second, the phrase \u2018any regulations whatsoever\u2019 grants powers \u2018of the widest possible nature\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=57}}</ref> Third, \u2018public danger\u2019 is inadequately defined.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref> Fourth, the ERO grants the Chief Executive power to amend or suspend any other enactment.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=63}}</ref> Fifth, the ERO permits the Chief Executive to prescribe punishments up to life imprisonment, ''inter alia'', which exceed those envisaged by the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1) vis \u00e0 vis subsidiary legislation.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|1|28|1|e}}</ref> Sixth, no time limit is envisaged by the ERO.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=68}}</ref> Seventh, negative vetting is an inadequate safeguard given, ''inter alia'', that its operation could be suspended by a regulation under the ERO, and that the legal effects of its application before repeal by the Legislative Council would not be undone even if negative vetting were possible.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=74}}</ref> \n\nOn the fourth ground, the government submitted that such clauses are entirely permissible in other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Australia;<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=65}}</ref> however, the court rejected the applicability of such a Diceyan notion of absolute parliamentary sovereignty in Hong Kong, on the basis that the Legislative Council\u2019s powers are derived from the Basic Law.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=66}}</ref> Ultimately the court concluded that the ERO in allowing for the making of regulations by the Chief Executive at a time of \u2018public danger\u2019 did so sufficiently broadly that it \u2018seems\u2026to create in Hong Kong a separate source of laws that are primary legislation in all but name\u2019.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=80}}</ref>\n\nThe government further submitted that the ERO had been vetted for constitutionality before the handover as a \u2018factor in favour of validity\u2019; however, the court held that article 160 of the Basic Law provided for the subsequent discovery of unconstitutionality.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=94}}</ref> The court therefore held the regulation unconstitutional under ground 1, at least insofar as \u2018public danger\u2019 is concerned.<ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=97}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hong Kong case|id=125452|list=HKCFI|number=2820|year=2019|litigants=Kwok et al.|pinpoint=193}}</ref>\n\n==== Ground 2: the \u2018implied repeal ground\u2019 ====\n\nThe applicants submitted that legislation could only derogate from the Bill of Rights when \u2018the life of the nation\u2019 is at risk, but that the ERO allowed for such derogations in a larger set of circumstances, and therefore was repealed by implication.{{efn|For brevity, the full argument is omitted;

They exhibit a keen understanding of Greek philosophical terms and the Greek [[Koine]] language in general, and use Greek philosophical concepts throughout their text, including such concepts as [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] (reality, existence), [[ousia]] (essence, substance, being), and [[demiurge]] (creator God). Good examples include texts such as the [[Hypostasis of the Archons]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/Hypostas-Barnstone.html|title=The Reality of the Rulers (Hypostasis of the Archons) - Barntone and Meyer - The Nag Hammadi Library|author=|date=|website=www.gnosis.org}}</ref>(Reality of the Rulers) or [[Trimorphic Protennoia]] (The First Thought which is in Three forms).<ref>[[Trimorphic Protennoia]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}}\n\nGnostics structured their world of transcendent being by ontological distinctions. The plenitude of the divine world emerges from a sole high deity by emanation, radiation, unfolding and mental self-reflection. The technique of self-performable contemplative mystical ascent towards and beyond a realm of pure being, which is rooted in Plato's Symposium and was common in Gnostic thought, was also expressed by Plotinus.{{refn|group=note|See Life of Plotinus}}\n\nDivine triads, tetrads, and ogdoads in Gnostic thought often are closely related to Neo-Pythagorean [[arithmology]]. The trinity of the \"triple-powered one\" (with the powers consisting of the modalities of existence, life and mind) in Allogenes mirrors quite closely the Neoplatonic doctrine of the Intellect differentiating itself from the One in three phases, called [[Existence]] or [[reality]] ([[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]), Life, and Intellect ([[nous]]). Both traditions heavily emphasize the role of negative theology or [[Negative theology|apophasis]], and Gnostic emphasis on the ineffability of God often echoes Platonic (and Neoplatonic) formulations of the ineffability of the One or the Good.\n\nThere were some important philosophical differences. Gnostics emphasized magic and ritual in a way that would have been disagreeable to the more sober Neoplatonists such as [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], though perhaps not to later Neoplatonists such as [[Iamblichus]]. Gnostics were in conflict with the idea expressed by Plotinus that the approach to the infinite force, which is the One or [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]], cannot be through knowing or not knowing.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrB53l4wNK0C&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=plotinus+energy&source=web&ots=rbnlnnwui5&sig=84RfXY8ErxUowZm2xT21Nuk8_II#PPA6,M1 |title=Faith and philosophy By David G.

H. Armstrong (translator), Plotinus' ''Enneads'' in the tract named ''Against the Gnostics'': Footnote, p. 264 1.</ref>\n\n==Neo-Platonic objections==\nIn the third century CE both Christianity and neo-Platonism reject and turn against Gnosticism, with neo-Platonists as Plotinus, Porphyry and Amelius attacking the Sethians. [[John D. Turner]] believes that this double attack led to Sethianism fragmentation into numerous smaller groups ([[Audian]]s, [[Borborites]], [[Archontics]] and perhaps [[Phibionites]], [[Stratiotici]], and [[Borborites|Secundians]]).\n\nPlotinus' objections seem applicable to some of the Nag Hammadi texts, although others such as the Valentinians, or the Tripartite Tractate, appear to insist on the goodness of the world and the Demiurge. In particular, Plotinus seems to direct his attacks at a very specific sect of Gnostics, most notably a sect that held anti-polytheistic views, anti-daemon views, expressed anti-Greek sentiments, believed magic was a cure for diseases, and preached salvation was possible without struggle. Certainly, the aforementioned points are not part of any scholar definition of Gnosticism, and might have been unique to the sect Plotinus had interacted with.\n\nPlotinus raises objections to several core tenants of Gnosticism, although some of them might have come from misunderstandings: Plotinus states that he didn't have the opportunity to see the Gnostics explain their teachings in a considerate and philosophical manner. Indeed, it seems most of his conceptions of Gnosticism had come from foreign preachers that he perceived as harboring resentment against his homeland. Nonetheless, the major differences between Plotinus and Gnostics can be summarized as follows:<ref name=\"gerson\">{{cite book |title=Plotinus: The Enneads |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107001770 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCw2yAEACAAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=James James McConkey |last2=Smith |first2=Richard |last3=Project |first3=Coptic Gnostic Library |title=The Nag Hammadi Library in English |date=1996 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004088566 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiSFUJ6al1IC |language=en}}</ref>\n# Plotinus felt Gnostics were trying to cut in line what he considered a natural hierarchy of ascension; whereas Gnostics considered they had to step aside from the material realm in order to start ascending in the first place. Like Aristotle, Plotinus believed the hierarchy to be observable in the celestial bodies, which he considered as conscious beings above the rank of humans.\n# Plotinus considered the observable cosmos to be the entirety of the sensible plane, and therefore eternal; whereas Gnostics believed the material realm to be a subset of the sensible plane, a distortion created by the Demiurge. Therefore, according to Plotinus, to be consequent with their ideas, Gnostics must have believed the material realm to have had a beginning.\n# Plotinus considered that human souls must be new compared to the beings inhabiting the celestial plane, and thus must have been born from the observable cosmos; whereas Gnostics considered that at least a part of the human soul must have come from the celestial plane, either fallen due to ignorance or purposefully descended to illuminate the lower plane, and thus the longing to ascend. Consequently, Plotinus implied that such pretensions were arrogant.\n# Plotinus felt that, although admittedly not the ideal existence for a soul, experiencing the cosmos was absolutely necessary in order to ascend; whereas Gnostics considered the material realm as merely a distraction.\n# Plotinus considered that no evil entity could possibly arise from the celestial plane such as the Demiurge as described by some Gnostics; whereas some Gnostics indeed believed the Demiurge to be evil. However, some other Gnostics believed it to be simply ignorant, and some others even believed it to be good, placing the blame on themselves for depending on it.\n# Plotinus believed that, should one accept the Gnostic premises, awaiting death would be enough to free oneself of the material plane; whereas Gnostics thought that death without proper preparation would just lead one into reincarnating again or to lose themselves in the winds of the sensible plane. This in part shows that Plotinus did not fully understand some aspects of the Gnostic teachings, perhaps owing to the fact that Plotinus believed the material realm to be equal to the sensible plane.\n# Plotinus believed that Gnostics should simply think of evil as a deficiency in wisdom; whereas most Gnostics did so already. This highlights another aspect that Plotinus might have misunderstood, perhaps due to his interactions with a particular Gnostic sect that was not representative of Gnosticism as a whole.\n# Plotinus believed that, in order to attain the path of ascension, one needed precise explanations of what virtue entails; whereas Gnostics believed this kind of knowledge could be attained intuitively from one's eternal connection to the Monad.\n# Plotinus argued that trying to establish a relationship with God without celestial intermediaries would be disrespectful to the deities, favored sons of God; whereas Gnostics believed that they too were the sons of God, and that most celestial beings would not take offense.\n# Plotinus, at least in his texts against the Gnostics, portrayed God as a separate entity that human souls needed to go towards; whereas Gnostics believed that in every human soul there was a divine spark of God already. However, Gnostics did not disagree with the Neoplatonist notion of getting closer to the source.\n# Plotinus argued that God should be everywhere according to Gnostic teachings, and thus they were being contradictory in claiming that matter is evil; whereas Gnostics differentiated soul from substance, the latter not necessarily having God in it, or having a considerably lower amount. This might be another case of Plotinus misunderstanding Gnostics, perhaps due to the lack of access to most of their written doctrines.\n# Plotinus argued that the good in the material realm is an indication of the goodness of it as a whole; whereas most Gnostics thought it was merely the result of the good nature of God slipping in through the cracks that the Demiurge could not cover.\n\nPlotinus himself attempted to summarize the differences between Neoplatonism and certain forms of Gnosticism with an analogy:<ref name=\"gerson\" />{{quote|There are two people occupying the identical house, a beautiful house, where one of them censures its construction and its builder but nevertheless keeps living in it, and the other does not censure him and says rather that the builder made it most proficiently, and yet he is waiting for the time to come when he will be released from the house and will no longer require it.\n[...]\n\nIt is possible, then, not to be lovers of the body, and to become pure, and to disdain death, and to know the higher beings and pursue them.|}}\n\n==First International Conference==\nThe '''First International Conference on Neoplatonism and Gnosticism''' at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1984 explored the relationship between [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Gnosticism]]. The conference also led to a book named ''Neoplatonism and Gnosticism''.\n\nThe book's intent was to document the creation of a conference in the academic world exploring the relationship between late and middle Platonic philosophy and Gnosticism. The book marked a turning point in the discussion on the subject of Neoplatonism<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|first=Richard T.|last=Wallis|page=2 |quote=Its study has, however been hindered until recently by lack of original Gnostics writings, the main exceptions being a few short texts quoted by the Church Fathers and some (mostly late) works translated from Greeks into Coptic, the native Egyptian language. Our picture has, however, been revolutionized by the discovery in late 1945 of a Coptic Gnostic library at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt|year=1992|title=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|publisher=New York Press|isbn=0-7914-1337-3}}</ref> because it took into account the understanding of the gnostics of Plotinus' day in light of the discovery of the ''[[Nag Hammadi library]]''. Further discussions of the topics covered in the book led to the formation of a new committee of scholars to once again translate [[Plotinus]]' ''[[Enneads]]''. Both Richard Wallis and [[A.H. Armstrong]], the major editors of the work, have died since the completion of the book and conference.\n\nThis conference was held to cover some of the controversies surrounding these issues and other aspects of the two groups. The objective of the event (and the book that documents the event) was to clarify the relationship between Neoplatonism / Neoplatonists and the sectarian groups of the day, the Gnostics. The book republished the works of a wide spectrum of scholars in the field of [[philosophy]]. The book's content consisted of presentations that the experts delivered at the first International Conference. One purpose was to clarify the meaning of the words and phrases repeated in other [[religion]]s and belief systems of the [[Mediterranean]] region during Plotinus' time. Another was to try to clarify the extent to which Plotinus' work followed directly from [[Plato]], and how much influence Plotinus had on the religions of his time and vice versa. The conference and the book documenting it is considered a key avenue for dialogue among the different scholars in the [[history of philosophy]].\n\n===Later conferences and studies===\nJohn D. Turner of the University of Nebraska has led additional conferences covering topics and materials relating to Neoplatonism and Gnosticism. Presentations from seminars that took place between 1993 and 1998 are published in the book ''Gnosticism and Later Platonism: Themes, Figures, and Texts Symposium Series'' (Society of Biblical Literature)''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/rak/courses/535/reviews/Turner-CP.htm|title=Carl Pfendner|author=|date=|website=ccat.sas.upenn.edu}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Allegorical interpretations of Plato]]\n* [[Henology]]\n* [[Julian the Apostate]]\n* [[Neoplatonism and Christianity]]\n* [[Sophism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last =Magris | first =Aldo | year =2005 | chapter =Gnosticism: Gnosticism from its origins to the Middle Ages (further considerations) | editor-last =Jones | editor-first= Lindsay  |title =MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religion | publisher =MacMillan}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Abramowski, L. \u201cNag Hammadi 8,1 \u2018Zostrianos\u201d, das Anonymum Brucianum, Plotin Enn. 2,9 (33).\u201d In: ''Platonismus und Christentum: Festschrift f\u00fcr Heinrich D\u00f6rrie''.

Therefore, according to Plotinus, to be consequent with their ideas, Gnostics must have believed the material realm to have had a beginning.\n# Plotinus considered that human souls must be new compared to the beings inhabiting the celestial plane, and thus must have been born from the observable cosmos; whereas Gnostics considered that at least a part of the human soul must have come from the celestial plane, either fallen due to ignorance or purposefully descended to illuminate the lower plane, and thus the longing to ascend. Consequently, Plotinus implied that such pretensions were arrogant.\n# Plotinus felt that, although admittedly not the ideal existence for a soul, experiencing the cosmos was absolutely necessary in order to ascend; whereas Gnostics considered the material realm as merely a distraction.\n# Plotinus considered that no evil entity could possibly arise from the celestial plane such as the Demiurge as described by some Gnostics; whereas some Gnostics indeed believed the Demiurge to be evil. However, some other Gnostics believed it to be simply ignorant, and some others even believed it to be good, placing the blame on themselves for depending on it.\n# Plotinus believed that, should one accept the Gnostic premises, awaiting death would be enough to free oneself of the material plane; whereas Gnostics thought that death without proper preparation would just lead one into reincarnating again or to lose themselves in the winds of the sensible plane. This in part shows that Plotinus did not fully understand some aspects of the Gnostic teachings, perhaps owing to the fact that Plotinus believed the material realm to be equal to the sensible plane.\n# Plotinus believed that Gnostics should simply think of evil as a deficiency in wisdom; whereas most Gnostics did so already. This highlights another aspect that Plotinus might have misunderstood, perhaps due to his interactions with a particular Gnostic sect that was not representative of Gnosticism as a whole.\n# Plotinus believed that, in order to attain the path of ascension, one needed precise explanations of what virtue entails; whereas Gnostics believed this kind of knowledge could be attained intuitively from one's eternal connection to the Monad.\n# Plotinus argued that trying to establish a relationship with God without celestial intermediaries would be disrespectful to the deities, favored sons of God; whereas Gnostics believed that they too were the sons of God, and that most celestial beings would not take offense.\n# Plotinus, at least in his texts against the Gnostics, portrayed God as a separate entity that human souls needed to go towards; whereas Gnostics believed that in every human soul there was a divine spark of God already. However, Gnostics did not disagree with the Neoplatonist notion of getting closer to the source.\n# Plotinus argued that God should be everywhere according to Gnostic teachings, and thus they were being contradictory in claiming that matter is evil; whereas Gnostics differentiated soul from substance, the latter not necessarily having God in it, or having a considerably lower amount. This might be another case of Plotinus misunderstanding Gnostics, perhaps due to the lack of access to most of their written doctrines.\n# Plotinus argued that the good in the material realm is an indication of the goodness of it as a whole; whereas most Gnostics thought it was merely the result of the good nature of God slipping in through the cracks that the Demiurge could not cover.\n\nPlotinus himself attempted to summarize the differences between Neoplatonism and certain forms of Gnosticism with an analogy:<ref name=\"gerson\" />{{quote|There are two people occupying the identical house, a beautiful house, where one of them censures its construction and its builder but nevertheless keeps living in it, and the other does not censure him and says rather that the builder made it most proficiently, and yet he is waiting for the time to come when he will be released from the house and will no longer require it.\n[...]\n\nIt is possible, then, not to be lovers of the body, and to become pure, and to disdain death, and to know the higher beings and pursue them.|}}\n\n==First International Conference==\nThe '''First International Conference on Neoplatonism and Gnosticism''' at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1984 explored the relationship between [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Gnosticism]]. The conference also led to a book named ''Neoplatonism and Gnosticism''.\n\nThe book's intent was to document the creation of a conference in the academic world exploring the relationship between late and middle Platonic philosophy and Gnosticism. The book marked a turning point in the discussion on the subject of Neoplatonism<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|first=Richard T.|last=Wallis|page=2 |quote=Its study has, however been hindered until recently by lack of original Gnostics writings, the main exceptions being a few short texts quoted by the Church Fathers and some (mostly late) works translated from Greeks into Coptic, the native Egyptian language. Our picture has, however, been revolutionized by the discovery in late 1945 of a Coptic Gnostic library at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt|year=1992|title=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|publisher=New York Press|isbn=0-7914-1337-3}}</ref> because it took into account the understanding of the gnostics of Plotinus' day in light of the discovery of the ''[[Nag Hammadi library]]''. Further discussions of the topics covered in the book led to the formation of a new committee of scholars to once again translate [[Plotinus]]' ''[[Enneads]]''. Both Richard Wallis and [[A.H. Armstrong]], the major editors of the work, have died since the completion of the book and conference.\n\nThis conference was held to cover some of the controversies surrounding these issues and other aspects of the two groups. The objective of the event (and the book that documents the event) was to clarify the relationship between Neoplatonism / Neoplatonists and the sectarian groups of the day, the Gnostics. The book republished the works of a wide spectrum of scholars in the field of [[philosophy]]. The book's content consisted of presentations that the experts delivered at the first International Conference. One purpose was to clarify the meaning of the words and phrases repeated in other [[religion]]s and belief systems of the [[Mediterranean]] region during Plotinus' time. Another was to try to clarify the extent to which Plotinus' work followed directly from [[Plato]], and how much influence Plotinus had on the religions of his time and vice versa. The conference and the book documenting it is considered a key avenue for dialogue among the different scholars in the [[history of philosophy]].\n\n===Later conferences and studies===\nJohn D. Turner of the University of Nebraska has led additional conferences covering topics and materials relating to Neoplatonism and Gnosticism. Presentations from seminars that took place between 1993 and 1998 are published in the book ''Gnosticism and Later Platonism: Themes, Figures, and Texts Symposium Series'' (Society of Biblical Literature)''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/rak/courses/535/reviews/Turner-CP.htm|title=Carl Pfendner|author=|date=|website=ccat.sas.upenn.edu}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Allegorical interpretations of Plato]]\n* [[Henology]]\n* [[Julian the Apostate]]\n* [[Neoplatonism and Christianity]]\n* [[Sophism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last =Magris | first =Aldo | year =2005 | chapter =Gnosticism: Gnosticism from its origins to the Middle Ages (further considerations) | editor-last =Jones | editor-first= Lindsay  |title =MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religion | publisher =MacMillan}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Abramowski, L. \u201cNag Hammadi 8,1 \u2018Zostrianos\u201d, das Anonymum Brucianum, Plotin Enn. 2,9 (33).\u201d In: ''Platonismus und Christentum: Festschrift f\u00fcr Heinrich D\u00f6rrie''.

Admission to an [[intensive care unit]], preferably one experienced in [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma medicine]], may be appropriate; even well-seeming patients need observation. Treat open wounds as surgically appropriate, with [[debridement]], [[Antibiotic|antibiotics]] and [[Tetanus vaccine|tetanus toxoid;]] apply ice to injured areas.\n\nIntravenous hydration of up to 1.5 L/hour should continue to prevent hypotension. A urinary output of at least 300 ml/hour should be maintained with IV fluids and [[mannitol]], and [[hemodialysis]] considered if an increase in urine is not achieved. Use intravenous [[sodium bicarbonate]] to keep the urine pH at 6.5 or greater, to prevent myoglobin and uric acid deposition in kidneys.\n\nTo prevent hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia, consider the following adult doses:<ref name=CDC/>\n*[[calcium gluconate]] 10% 10ml or [[calcium chloride]] 10% 5 ml IV over 2 minutes\n*[[sodium bicarbonate]] 1 meq/kg IV slow push\n*regular [[insulin]] 5\u201310 U \n*50% [[glucose]] 1\u20132 ampules IV bolus\n*[[kayexalate]] 25\u201350 g  with sorbitol 20% 100 ml by mouth or rectum. \n\nEven so, [[Arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] may develop; electrocardiographic monitoring is advised, and specific treatment begun promptly.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Sever MS, Vanholder R, Lameire N |title=Management of crush-related injuries after disasters |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=354 |issue=10 |pages=1052\u201363 |year=2006 |pmid=16525142 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra054329}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 13135 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|T|79|5|t|79}}  \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|958.5}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           =  \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         = D003444\n}}\n* [http://www.slate.com/id/2242214/ Life or Limb: What happens when your leg gets trapped under a building?]\n\n{{Certain early complications of trauma}}\n{{Trauma |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Injuries]]\n[[Category:Early complications of trauma]]\n[[Category:Nephrology]]\n[[Category:Syndromes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Textbook|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Crush syndrome\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n[[File:1985 Mexico Earthquake - Collapsed General Hospital.jpg|thumb|407x407px|Collapsed building from 1985 Mexico earthquake.

Overall treatment depends on preventing kidney failure (renal failure) which is done by rehydrating the patient. It also depends on making urine have a more basic pH (alkalinization of urine)<ref name=\":0\" />.\n[[File:Acute compartment and crush syndrome.jpg|thumb|441x441px|Crush Syndrome progression]]\nImmediate untreated crush syndrome death is caused by severe head injury, torso injury with damaged abdominal organs, and [[asphyxia]] (excessive loss of oxygen). Early untreated crush syndrome death is caused by [[Hyperkalemia]] and by [[Hypovolemic shock]]. Late untreated crush syndrome death is caused by renal failure, [[coagulopathy]] and hemorrhage, and [[sepsis]]<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nDue to the risk of crush syndrome, current recommendation to lay first-aiders (in the UK) is to not release victims of crush injury who have been trapped for more than 15 minutes.<ref>St John Ambulance UK First Aid Manual, 10th Edition, p. 118</ref> Treatment consists of not releasing the [[tourniquet]] and fluid overloading the patient with added Dextran 4000 iu and slow release of pressure. If pressure is released during first aid, then fluid is restricted and an input-output chart for the patient is maintained, and proteins are decreased in the diet.<!-- these two recommendations seem contradictory to each other ~~~~ -->\n\n===Field management===\nAs mentioned, permissive hypotension is unwise. Especially if the crushing weight is on the patient for more than 4 hours, but often if it persists more than one hour, careful fluid overload is wise, as well as the administration of intravenous [[sodium bicarbonate]]. The San Francisco emergency services protocol calls for a basic adult dose of a 2 L [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] of [[normal saline]] followed by 500&nbsp;ml/h, limited for \"pediatric patients and patients with history of cardiac or renal dysfunction.\"<ref name=SF>{{cite journal |publisher=San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency |date=1 July 2002 |id=Protocol: #P-101 |title=Crush Syndrome |url=http://firespecialops.com/files/2010/02/San-Fran-EMS-Crush-Protocol.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028105440/http://firespecialops.com/files/2010/02/San-Fran-EMS-Crush-Protocol.pdf |archivedate=28 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIf the patient cannot be fluid-loaded, this may be an indication for a [[tourniquet]] to be applied.\n\n===Initial hospital management===\nThe clinician must protect the patient against [[hypotension]], [[kidney failure]], [[acidosis]], [[hyperkalemia]] and [[hypocalcemia]]. Admission to an [[intensive care unit]], preferably one experienced in [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma medicine]], may be appropriate; even well-seeming patients need observation. Treat open wounds as surgically appropriate, with [[debridement]], [[Antibiotic|antibiotics]] and [[Tetanus vaccine|tetanus toxoid;]] apply ice to injured areas.\n\nIntravenous hydration of up to 1.5 L/hour should continue to prevent hypotension. A urinary output of at least 300 ml/hour should be maintained with IV fluids and [[mannitol]], and [[hemodialysis]] considered if an increase in urine is not achieved. Use intravenous [[sodium bicarbonate]] to keep the urine pH at 6.5 or greater, to prevent myoglobin and uric acid deposition in kidneys.\n\nTo prevent hyperkalemia/hypocalcemia, consider the following adult doses:<ref name=CDC/>\n*[[calcium gluconate]] 10% 10ml or [[calcium chloride]] 10% 5 ml IV over 2 minutes\n*[[sodium bicarbonate]] 1 meq/kg IV slow push\n*regular [[insulin]] 5\u201310 U \n*50% [[glucose]] 1\u20132 ampules IV bolus\n*[[kayexalate]] 25\u201350 g  with sorbitol 20% 100 ml by mouth or rectum. \n\nEven so, [[Arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] may develop; electrocardiographic monitoring is advised, and specific treatment begun promptly.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Sever MS, Vanholder R, Lameire N |title=Management of crush-related injuries after disasters |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=354 |issue=10 |pages=1052\u201363 |year=2006 |pmid=16525142 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra054329}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = 13135 \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|T|79|5|t|79}}  \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|958.5}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           =  \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  =  \n|  eMedicineTopic =  \n|  MeshID         = D003444\n}}\n* [http://www.slate.com/id/2242214/ Life or Limb: What happens when your leg gets trapped under a building?]\n\n{{Certain early complications of trauma}}\n{{Trauma |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Injuries]]\n[[Category:Early complications of trauma]]\n[[Category:Nephrology]]\n[[Category:Syndromes]]\n", "name_user": "Reb298", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reduced jargon and re-phrased sentences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush_syndrome"}
