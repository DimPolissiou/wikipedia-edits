Television Distribution]] and premiered on September 5, 1994. The program serves as a straight rundown of news headlines and gossip throughout the entertainment industry, providing coverage of events and celebrities; however, since 2013, it has also placed an even greater emphasis on interviews and insider previews of upcoming film and television projects. {{As of|2019}}, the program's weekday broadcasts are [[news presenter|anchored]] by [[Billy Bush]], with the weekend editions anchored by [[Renee Bargh]] and [[Jennifer Lahmers]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Victory Studios.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Victory Studios, where ''Extra'' was produced from 1994 to 2010.]]\nThe series was developed in the fall of 1993, for a planned launch during the 1994\u201395 television season. The program was developed under the [[working title]] ''Entertainment News Television''; however due to claims that it too closely mirrored its own name, cable channel [[E!|E!: Entertainment Television]] filed a lawsuit against [[Warner Bros. Television]] and [[Telepictures|Telepictures Productions]] to bar them from using the title; although E! lost the lawsuit in a summary judgment hearing allowing Warner Bros. to continue to use the ''ENT'' title for the series, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of the program to ''Extra: The Entertainment Magazine'' in May 1994, four months before the series made its debut, with Warner Bros. executives citing that the abbreviated ''ENT'' title itself would be too similar to that used by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', long shortened officially to just ''ET'', possibly leading to viewer confusion and confusing [[Nielsen Media|A.C. Nielsen]] ratings diary homes which would have seen their panelists writing down the wrong program they watched.<ref>{{cite web|title='Extra': Warner Bros.

Neville joined the program after being anchor at [[New Orleans]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WVUE-DT|WVUE-TV]] (now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate) and a three-year run on Extreme Close-Up, a one-on-one celebrity interview show that she co-produced for [[E!]] Entertainment TV. ''Extra'' was initially distributed by Time-Telepictures Television, a joint venture between [[Time Inc.]] and Telepictures \u2013 both of which were owned at the time by [[Time Warner]] (which would eventually spin off Time Inc. in 2012) \u2013 that was absorbed by Telepictures in 2003. Nemeth and Neville were both replaced by Brad Goode and [[Libby Weaver]] on June 10, 1996 for the remainder of Season 2, and Season 3 (which premiered on September 9, 1996), before Weaver was replaced by [[Maureen O'Boyle]] in July 1997 during Season 3. O'Boyle took over as main anchor of the program in September 1997 during season 4 premiere; following O'Boyle's departure in September 2000, former ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' anchor/correspondent and talk show host [[Leeza Gibbons]] became its main anchor of season 7.\n\nIn September 2002, Telepictures debuted a spin-off series, ''[[Celebrity Justice]]''. The program, which was hosted and executive produced by [[Harvey Levin]], had originated as a segment featured on ''Extra'' that focused on legal issues involving celebrities and high-profile court cases with little to no relation to the entertainment industry; ''Celebrity Justice'' ran for three seasons before being cancelled in 2005 (Levin would subsequently launch the celebrity news website [[TMZ (website)|TMZ]] and three years later, partner with Telepictures and Warner Bros. Television Distribution on a more successful entertainment newsmagazine venture spun off from the site, ''[[TMZ on TV]]'').\n\nFollowing Gibbons's departure in 2004, ''Extra'' switched to a two-anchor format for the weekday editions with [[Sugar Ray]] lead singer/founder [[Mark McGrath]] and correspondent [[Dayna Devon]] (who was formerly a news anchor/reporter at ABC affiliates [[KMID]] and [[WATN-TV|WPTY-TV]]) taking over as presenters. In September 2007, the production staff of ''Extra'' also began handling production responsibilities for ''[[CW Now]]'', a weekly lifestyle newsmagazine that aired as part of [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]'s Sunday night lineup; that program was cancelled due to low ratings in February 2008, after 18 episodes, continuing to broadcast some CW interstitial segments for several more months after.\n\nOn July 28, 2008, Telepictures announced that actor [[Mario Lopez]] would take over as solo host of the program; Dayna Devon was moved to a correspondent role, while Mark McGrath chose to leave the show and return to his music career.\n\nOn September 13, 2010, the date of the program's 17th-season premiere, ''Extra'' became the fourth American syndicated newsmagazine to begin broadcasting in [[High-definition video|high definition]], after ''Entertainment Tonight'', ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''; the program also abandoned its longtime soundstage at Victory Studios in [[Glendale, California]] and moved its taping location to [[The Grove at Farmers Market]], a well-known shopping and entertainment venue in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Extra|url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/about/|website=Extra|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

News]]'', actress/producer [[Tracey Edmonds]] and ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]''-turned-''[[Fox Sports Live]]'' co-host [[Charissa Thompson]] were added to replace her as co-hosts. Edmonds later left in June 2017. Thompson left at the end of the program's 23rd season.\n\nOn August 7, 2017, Telepictures announced co-host changes in preparation for the program's 24th season: former host/correspondent [[Tanika Ray]] would return to ''Extra'' as weekday co-host, with correspondents [[A.J. Calloway]] and current weekend edition host [[Renee Bargh]] also becoming weekday co-hosts. All join fellow host Mario Lopez.

It will also move to the [[The Burbank Studios|former NBC lot]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] where ''Access'' had previously been based. In the months before, Telepictures had signed an agreement with [[Fox Television Stations]] to move the series in a number of major top-10 to top-50 markets to syndication on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] stations, ending a long-term agreement with [[NBC Owned Television Stations]] to syndicate the series to [[NBC]]'s owned and operated stations.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/billy-bush-anchor-new-version-extra-fall-1208811 \"Billy Bush to Anchor New Version of 'Extra' in Fall\"] from ''The Hollywood Reporter (May 8, 2019)</ref> \n\nOn July 31, 2019, Calloway was terminated from ''Extra'' after a number of sexual harassment and assault allegations not involving show staff surfaced (he had previously been suspended earlier in February).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-bros-severs-ties-extra-host-aj-calloway-investigation-assault-claims-1228389|title=Warner Bros.

''[https://extraextra.biz/ ExtraExtra Show Daily]'', an entertainment industry expo [[trade magazine|trade publication]], had utilized the title since 1997 under a [[registered trademark]]. ''EESD'' owner Sandra Driggin notified Telepictures about possible confusion with her publication, a week before the show's premiere, and threatened legal action if the show aired as ''Extra Extra''. Telepictures ultimately decided to retain the ''Extra'' name as-is, as the show's staff had not really taken up the new name behind the scenes during off-air rehearsals with Bush.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/billy-bush-s-extra-extra-renamed-legal-threat-1237487|title=Billy Bush\u2019s \u2018Extra Extra\u2019 Renamed After Legal Threat|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=6 September 2019|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=7 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==On-air staff==\n===Current on-air staff===\n====Anchor====\n* [[Billy Bush]] \u2013 anchor (2019\u2013present)\n\n====Correspondents====\n* [[Renee Bargh]] \u2013 weekend anchor/correspondent (2010\u2013present; previously served as weekday co-anchor from 2017 to 2019)\n* [[Nate Burleson]] \u2014 New York correspondent (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Michael Corbett (actor)|Michael Corbett]] \u2013 special, lifestyle, home and real estate correspondent (2000\u2013present)\n* Adam Glassman \u2014 special correspondent (2019\u2014present)\n* [[Samantha Harris]] \u2013 correspondent (2020\u2013present; previously served as weekend anchor/correspondent 2003\u20132004)\n* [[Jana Kramer]] \u2014 Nashville correspondent (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Cheslie Kryst]] \u2013 New York correspondent (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Jennifer Lahmers]] \u2014 weekend anchor/correspondent/fill-in anchor (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Terri Seymour]] \u2013 special correspondent (2004\u2013present)\n* [[Charissa Thompson]] \u2013 Las Vegas correspondent (2019\u2013present; previously served as a co-host from 2014\u2013present)\n* [[Mark Wright (TV personality)|Mark Wright]] \u2013 correspondent (2017\u2013present)\n\n===Former on-air staff===\n* Dana Adams \u2013 correspondent (1994\u20131997)\n* [[Hilaria Baldwin]] \u2013 lifestyle correspondent (2012\u20132019)\n* [[Doug Bruckner]] \u2013 correspondent (1999\u20132004)\n* Michael Bryant \u2013 correspondent (2000\u20132005)\n* [[A.J.

Television Distribution]] and premiered on September 5, 1994. The program serves as a straight rundown of news headlines and gossip throughout the entertainment industry, providing coverage of events and celebrities; however, since 2013, it has also placed an even greater emphasis on interviews and insider previews of upcoming film and television projects. {{As of|2019}}, the program's weekday broadcasts are [[news presenter|anchored]] by [[Billy Bush]], with the weekend editions anchored by [[Renee Bargh]] and [[Jennifer Lahmers]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Victory Studios.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Victory Studios, where ''Extra'' was produced from 1994 to 2010.]]\nThe series was developed in the fall of 1993, for a planned launch during the 1994\u201395 television season. The program was developed under the [[working title]] ''Entertainment News Television''; however due to claims that it too closely mirrored its own name, cable channel [[E!|E!: Entertainment Television]] filed a lawsuit against [[Warner Bros. Television]] and [[Telepictures|Telepictures Productions]] to bar them from using the title; although E! lost the lawsuit in a summary judgment hearing allowing Warner Bros. to continue to use the ''ENT'' title for the series, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of the program to ''Extra: The Entertainment Magazine'' in May 1994, four months before the series made its debut, with Warner Bros. executives citing that the abbreviated ''ENT'' title itself would be too similar to that used by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', long shortened officially to just ''ET'', possibly leading to viewer confusion and confusing [[Nielsen Media|A.C. Nielsen]] ratings diary homes which would have seen their panelists writing down the wrong program they watched.<ref>{{cite web|title='Extra': Warner Bros.

Neville joined the program after being anchor at [[New Orleans]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WVUE-DT|WVUE-TV]] (now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate) and a three-year run on Extreme Close-Up, a one-on-one celebrity interview show that she co-produced for [[E!]] Entertainment TV. ''Extra'' was initially distributed by Time-Telepictures Television, a joint venture between [[Time Inc.]] and Telepictures \u2013 both of which were owned at the time by [[Time Warner]] (which would eventually spin off Time Inc. in 2012) \u2013 that was absorbed by Telepictures in 2003. Nemeth and Neville were both replaced by Brad Goode and [[Libby Weaver]] on June 10, 1996 for the remainder of Season 2, and Season 3 (which premiered on September 9, 1996), before Weaver was replaced by [[Maureen O'Boyle]] in July 1997 during Season 3. O'Boyle took over as main anchor of the program in September 1997 during season 4 premiere; following O'Boyle's departure in September 2000, former ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' anchor/correspondent and talk show host [[Leeza Gibbons]] became its main anchor of season 7.\n\nIn September 2002, Telepictures debuted a spin-off series, ''[[Celebrity Justice]]''. The program, which was hosted and executive produced by [[Harvey Levin]], had originated as a segment featured on ''Extra'' that focused on legal issues involving celebrities and high-profile court cases with little to no relation to the entertainment industry; ''Celebrity Justice'' ran for three seasons before being cancelled in 2005 (Levin would subsequently launch the celebrity news website [[TMZ (website)|TMZ]] and three years later, partner with Telepictures and Warner Bros. Television Distribution on a more successful entertainment newsmagazine venture spun off from the site, ''[[TMZ on TV]]'').\n\nFollowing Gibbons's departure in 2004, ''Extra'' switched to a two-anchor format for the weekday editions with [[Sugar Ray]] lead singer/founder [[Mark McGrath]] and correspondent [[Dayna Devon]] (who was formerly a news anchor/reporter at ABC affiliates [[KMID]] and [[WATN-TV|WPTY-TV]]) taking over as presenters. In September 2007, the production staff of ''Extra'' also began handling production responsibilities for ''[[CW Now]]'', a weekly lifestyle newsmagazine that aired as part of [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]'s Sunday night lineup; that program was cancelled due to low ratings in February 2008, after 18 episodes, continuing to broadcast some CW interstitial segments for several more months after.\n\nOn July 28, 2008, Telepictures announced that actor [[Mario Lopez]] would take over as solo host of the program; Dayna Devon was moved to a correspondent role, while Mark McGrath chose to leave the show and return to his music career.\n\nOn September 13, 2010, the date of the program's 17th-season premiere, ''Extra'' became the fourth American syndicated newsmagazine to begin broadcasting in [[High-definition video|high definition]], after ''Entertainment Tonight'', ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''; the program also abandoned its longtime soundstage at Victory Studios in [[Glendale, California]] and moved its taping location to [[The Grove at Farmers Market]], a well-known shopping and entertainment venue in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Extra|url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/about/|website=Extra|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

News]]'', actress/producer [[Tracey Edmonds]] and ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]''-turned-''[[Fox Sports Live]]'' co-host [[Charissa Thompson]] were added to replace her as co-hosts. Edmonds later left in June 2017. Thompson left at the end of the program's 23rd season.\n\nOn August 7, 2017, Telepictures announced co-host changes in preparation for the program's 24th season: former host/correspondent [[Tanika Ray]] would return to ''Extra'' as weekday co-host, with correspondents [[A.J. Calloway]] and current weekend edition host [[Renee Bargh]] also becoming weekday co-hosts. All join fellow host Mario Lopez. British TV personality [[Mark Wright (TV personality)|Mark Wright]] will also join as weekday correspondent.<ref>{{cite web|title='Extra': Tanika Ray, Renee Bargh & AJ Calloway Named New Co-Hosts; Mark Wright Joins As Correspondent|url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/extra-tanika-ray-renee-bargh-aj-calloway-co-host-mark-wright-correspondent-mario-lopez-1202143895/|author=Denise Petski|periodical=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=August 7, 2017}}</ref> [[Jerry Penacoli]] serves as an off-air correspondent for the series and is rarely seen, voicing most of the show's segments and stories that are not done from CityWalk.\n\nOn May 8, 2019, Telepictures announced a revamp for the program's 26th season, starting September 9, 2019; former ''Access Hollywood'' host [[Billy Bush]] will join as co-host, replacing Mario Lopez -- who himself will move to rival ''Access Hollywood''. It will also move to the [[The Burbank Studios|former NBC lot]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] where ''Access'' had previously been based. In the months before, Telepictures had signed an agreement with [[Fox Television Stations]] to move the series in a number of major top-10 to top-50 markets to syndication on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] stations, ending a long-term agreement with [[NBC Owned Television Stations]] to syndicate the series to [[NBC]]'s owned and operated stations.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/billy-bush-anchor-new-version-extra-fall-1208811 \"Billy Bush to Anchor New Version of 'Extra' in Fall\"] from ''The Hollywood Reporter (May 8, 2019)</ref> \n\nOn July 31, 2019, Calloway was terminated from ''Extra'' after a number of sexual harassment and assault allegations not involving show staff surfaced (he had previously been suspended earlier in February).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-bros-severs-ties-extra-host-aj-calloway-investigation-assault-claims-1228389|title=Warner Bros.

''[https://extraextra.biz/ ExtraExtra Show Daily]'', an entertainment industry expo [[trade magazine|trade publication]], had utilized the title since 1997 under a [[registered trademark]]. ''EESD'' owner Sandra Driggin notified Telepictures about possible confusion with her publication, a week before the show's premiere, and threatened legal action if the show aired as ''Extra Extra''. Telepictures ultimately decided to retain the ''Extra'' name as-is, as the show's staff had not really taken up the new name behind the scenes during off-air rehearsals with Bush.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/billy-bush-s-extra-extra-renamed-legal-threat-1237487|title=Billy Bush\u2019s \u2018Extra Extra\u2019 Renamed After Legal Threat|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=6 September 2019|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=7 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==On-air staff==\n===Current on-air staff===\n====Anchor====\n* [[Billy Bush]] \u2013 anchor (2019\u2013present)\n\n====Correspondents====\n* [[Renee Bargh]] \u2013 weekend anchor/correspondent (2010\u2013present; previously served as weekday co-anchor from 2017 to 2019)\n* [[Nate Burleson]] \u2014 New York correspondent (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Michael Corbett (actor)|Michael Corbett]] \u2013 special, lifestyle, home and real estate correspondent (2000\u2013present)\n* Adam Glassman \u2014 special correspondent (2019\u2014present)\n* [[Samantha Harris]] \u2013 correspondent (2020\u2013present; previously served as weekend anchor/correspondent 2003\u20132004)\n* [[Jana Kramer]] \u2014 Nashville correspondent (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Cheslie Kryst]] \u2013 New York correspondent (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Jennifer Lahmers]] \u2014 weekend anchor/correspondent/fill-in anchor (2019\u2013present)\n* [[Terri Seymour]] \u2013 special correspondent (2004\u2013present)\n* [[Charissa Thompson]] \u2013 Las Vegas correspondent (2019\u2013present; previously served as a co-host from 2014\u2013present)\n* [[Mark Wright (TV personality)|Mark Wright]] \u2013 correspondent (2017\u2013present)\n\n===Former on-air staff===\n* Dana Adams \u2013 correspondent (1994\u20131997)\n* [[Hilaria Baldwin]] \u2013 lifestyle correspondent (2012\u20132019)\n* [[Doug Bruckner]] \u2013 correspondent (1999\u20132004)\n* Michael Bryant \u2013 correspondent (2000\u20132005)\n* [[A.J.

This categorization is a foundational aspect of generalizing.\n\n== '''Research on Generalization''' ==\nIn scientific studies looking at generalization, a generalization gradient is often used. This tool is used to measure how often and how much animals or humans respond to certain stimuli, depending on whether the stimuli are perceived to be similar or different. The curvilinear shape of the gradient is achieved by placing the perceived similarity of a stimulus on the x-axis and the strength of the response on the y-axis.<ref>Boddez, Y., Bennett, M.

Nine-month-old infants require very few (sometimes only 3) experiences with a category before learning to generalize.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> In fact, infants generalize so well during early stages of development (such as learning to recognize specific sounds as language) that it can be hard for them to discriminate between variations of the generalized stimuli at later stages of development (such as failing to distinguish between the subtly different sounds of similar phonemes).<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> One potential explanation for why children are such efficient learners is that they operate in accordance with the goal of making their world more predictable, therefore encouraging them to hold strongly to generalizations that effectively help them to navigate their environment.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nSome evidence suggests that children are born with innate processes for accurately generalizing things. For example, children tend to generalize based on taxonomic rather than thematic similarities (an experience with one ball leads to the child identifying other ball-shaped objects as \u201cball\u201d rather than labeling a bat as \u201cball\u201d because a bat is used to hit a ball).<ref>Banich, M.

Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest studies about fear generalization in humans was conducted by Watson and Raynor (1920): the [[Little Albert experiment]]. In their study, an infant known as Little Albert was exposed to various kinds of animals, none of which elicited a fear response from Little Albert. However, after 7 pairings of a white rat and the sound of a hammer clanging against a steel bar (which did elicit a fear response), the 11-month old child began to cry and try to get away from the white rat even without the loud noise. Months later, additional trials showed that Little Albert had generalized his fear response to things that were similar to the white rat, including a dog, a rabbit, and a fur coat.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nBrain regions involved in fear generalization include the [[Amygdala]] and the [[Hippocampus]].<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> The hippocampus seems to be more involved in the development of context fear generalization (developing a generalized fear for a specific environment) than stimulus fear generalization (such as Little Albert\u2019s acquisition of a fear response to white, furry objects). The amygdala, which is associated with all types of emotional responses, is fundamental in developing a classically conditioned fear response to either a stimulus or the context in which it is found.<ref>Banich, M.

In their study, an infant known as Little Albert was exposed to various kinds of animals, none of which elicited a fear response from Little Albert. However, after 7 pairings of a white rat and the sound of a hammer clanging against a steel bar (which did elicit a fear response), the 11-month old child began to cry and try to get away from the white rat even without the loud noise. Months later, additional trials showed that Little Albert had generalized his fear response to things that were similar to the white rat, including a dog, a rabbit, and a fur coat.<ref>Banich, M.

The amygdala, which is associated with all types of emotional responses, is fundamental in developing a classically conditioned fear response to either a stimulus or the context in which it is found.<ref>Banich, M.

{"title_page": "Dogs of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition", "text_new": "[[File:Detail of the sledge dog Amundsen.jpg|thumb|One of the twenty-one dogs donated to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition by Roald Amundsen for its unplanned second season in Antarctica]]\n\nIn common with many of the expeditions of the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration|Heroic Age]], [[Douglas Mawson]]'s [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] (AAE) employed dog-hauled sledges as a principal means of transportation during exploration of the continent. Dog sledges could carry more weight and travel faster than man-hauled sledges; they were more reliable in the freezing temperatures than motor-sledges; and dogs had proved to be more adaptable to harsh [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] conditions than ponies.\n\nMawson purchased fifty [[Sled dog|sledge dogs]] from Greenland and transported them to Antarctica on the expedition's ship {{SY|Aurora}}. The trip was arduous for the dogs and by the time the expedition arrived in Antarctica on 8 January 1912 only 28 of the dogs were still alive. These were split into two groups: nineteen stayed with Mawson at the expedition's main base and the remaining nine were sent with [[Frank Wild]] to the [[Western Base party|western base]]. All of the original dogs at the main base were dead by the end of 1912; accidents and illness had accounted for many of them and some were killed and eaten when food ran out on [[Far Eastern Party|Mawson's main sledging journey]]. At the western base two dogs survived to accompany the party home.\n\nThree pups had survived at the main base and their numbers were supplemented by 21 dogs donated to Mawson by [[Roald Amundsen]] on his return from the South Pole. Eleven of Amundsen's dogs were shot almost immediately to conserve the food supplies. During the year another dog was attacked by his companions and had to be destroyed, and the only bitch died during an operation. One puppy was born though, so twelve dogs were picked up with the party at the end of 1913.\n\nThe dogs were put briefly into quarantine in [[Adelaide Zoo]] and then a number were adopted by members of the expedition. Two were donated to the zoo, and the remaining dogs were sent to [[Kosciuszko National Park]] where they joined the surviving dog from the western base pulling sledges for visitors.\n\n==Dogs on polar expeditions==\n[[File:Amundsen - Lassesen and Fix.jpg|thumb|Fix and Lassesen, two of Amundsen's dogs. Fix would later be given to Mawson for his second season.]]\nDouglas Mawson, the leader and organizer of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, decided to take fifty [[Greenland dog]]s with him; he believed that number would be more than sufficient for the exploratory sledge journeys that he was planning to undertake during the year he planned to spend in Antarctica.{{sfn|Mawson Expedition...Training the Dogs at Hobart}} Mawson favoured dogs over ponies because, although they could only pull a little more than their own body weight, their food could be supplemented with meat from the fauna of Antarctica and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 from other dogs, so they did not need the vast imports of fodder that ponies required to see them through an expedition.{{sfn|FitzSimon|2012|p=75}} Mawson had been impressed by the enthusiasm of the dogs on the [[Nimrod Expedition|''Nimrod'' Expedition]] when he had accompanied [[Ernest Shackleton]] to Antarctica.{{sfn|FitzSimon|2012|p=75}} Both Shackleton and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] were dubious of the advantage of dogs over ponies. Amundsen and the Arctic pioneer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] were passionate advocates and thought the British explorers had misunderstood how to employ dogs in the polar regions; Amundsen pointed to their successes in the Northern Hemisphere and the relative ease of handling dogs compared with ponies, especially in heavily crevassed areas where a fallen dog could often be easily retrieved but a fallen pony was usually lost.{{sfn|Amundsen|2008|pp=57\u201360}} The Norwegians were thoroughly utilitarian in their approach to dogs though; although they could be affectionate with the animals, there was little thought given to their survival when they had outlived their usefulness. Scott had used dogs on his [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]] and had felt it badly when he had been forced to kill them all during his southern sledging journey.{{sfn|Crane|2005}} Nevertheless, his attitude towards dogs was similar to Amundsen's and Mawson's:  \n\n{{quote|One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions. On the other hand, it may be pointed out with good reason that to forego the great objects that may be achieved by the sacrifice of dog-life is carrying sentiment to undue length. It is a case, if ever there was one, where the end justifies the means. There is no real reason why the life of a dog should be considered more than that of a sheep, and no one would pause to consider the cruelty of driving a diminishing flock of sheep to supply the wants and aid the movements of travellers in more temperate climes. {{mdash}} Robert Falcon Scott, ''The Voyage of the Discovery''{{sfn|Scott|2014|pp=465\u2013466}}}}\n\n==Voyage to Antarctica==\n[[File:Ginger-and-her-pups-Mertz.jpg|thumb|Ginger and her pups on board ''Aurora'' during the voyage to Hobart. The pups did not survive.]]\nWith the help of C. A. Bang and the [[Royal Danish Geographical Society]] in Copenhagen, Mawson procured fifty dogs from Greenland in July 1911.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}} As Bang was not a dog expert, Mawson made sure [[Ernest Joyce]], the dog handler from Shackleton's ''Nimrod'' Expedition, was on hand to assist him. One of the dogs went missing in Greenland while waiting to be transported,{{sfn|Leane|Tiffin|2012|p=186}} but it was replaced and the dogs were shipped to Copenhagen. Unfortunately, [[Wilhelm Filchner]] had also ordered dogs from Greenland for his [[Second German Antarctic Expedition|Antarctic expedition]] and the two sets of dogs were delivered as a single group. The Germans arrived first to collect their consignment and initially selected all the best dogs, but when Joyce arrived he insisted that they should be divided more fairly. By the time the dogs were ready to travel to England three pups had been born, swelling the number to 53, but en route to London one of the adult dogs was lost.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}}\n\nOn arriving in London on 17 July 1911, they were placed in quarantine at Spratts Dog Home in Surrey until ''Aurora'', the expedition's ship, was ready to sail on 27 July. One dog and one pup died at Spratts.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}} Travelling with the 48 remaining dogs and two pups from London were two members of the expedition, [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Belgrave Sutton Ninnis]] and [[Xavier Mertz]], who had been appointed dog-handlers despite having no previous experience. From the start, discipline among the dogs on board ''Aurora'' was maintained by frequent \"thrashings\".{{sfn|Leane|Tiffin|2012|p=186}}\n\n''Aurora'' went first to Cardiff arriving on 31 July and after four days set out for Cape Town on 4 August. On the day of the sailing Ninnis recorded that they had lost a pregnant bitch but the two pups were still well.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}}  The voyage to Cape Town was hard on the dogs and, although there were frequent litters born, few of the pups survived for any time; at least 27 pups died between leaving Cardiff and arriving at Cape Town on 27 August.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}} The adult dogs suffered too and by the time the ship docked in South Africa the two best breeders, Peggy and Hilda were having seizures. They were diagnosed as having [[canine distemper|distemper]] and [[chorea]] and both died on 28 September the day after the ship had put out from Cape Town.{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=14}}\n\nFive more dogs and at least four pups died between the ship leaving South Africa on 27 September and arriving in Australia on 4 November,{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}{{refn|The dogs lost were: Jack's Brother, Mordkin, Nelson and two unnamed dogs. The pups were: Teddy Bear, Togo and two which had not yet been named.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}|group=n}} as the fits that had affected Peggy and Hilda became more common. Though Ninnis and Mertz wanted to vary the dogs' diet they had little to feed them other than biscuit and were unable to devise a regimen that prevented or decreased the symptoms.{{sfn|The Eskimo Dogs: An Interview with Dr. Mertz}} ''Aurora'''s captain, [[John King Davis]], had intended to get a stock of fish before leaving Cape Town as a supplement for the dogs' diet,{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=12}} but Mertz made no mention of this addition when he was interviewed after the dogs had arrived in Tasmania.{{sfn|The Eskimo Dogs: An Interview with Dr. Mertz}} \n\nIn Hobart, the dogs (accompanied by Ninnis and Mertz){{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}{{sfn|The Eskimo Dogs: An Interview with Dr. Mertz}} were put into quarantine until the expedition was ready to depart. Mawson had intended that they start their training during their stay in Hobart, but quarantine was strict and nothing seems to have come of this plan.{{sfn|Mawson Expedition...Training the Dogs at Hobart}} At the quarantine station \u2013 on a better diet, in less harsh conditions, and able to exercise \u2013 most put on weight and their condition improved,{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=16}} but the seizures and deaths continued. Vets and inspectors were unable to agree on a diagnosis or prescribe for the illness, and five more dogs including Hooker, one of the early pups, died during the month they spent in quarantine.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}{{refn|The dogs lost were: Jumbo, Nigger, two unnamed dogs and the pup, Hooker.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}|group=n}} On 2 December 1911, the remaining 36 dogs and two pups were loaded back aboard, and ''Aurora'' set sail first for [[Macquarie Island]] and then Antarctica. The ship arrived at Macquarie on 12 December and the dogs were let off under the care of Ninnis while the wireless relay station was established. The sealers working on the island helped secure the dogs and killed some [[elephant seal]]s to feed them:\n\n{{quote|We stretched a rope along the beach and they tied the dogs in sets of four along the rope. We got our gear out and killed a couple of elephants and flensed the blubber and flesh off to feed the dogs. We cut it off in about 80 to 100 lbs pieces and threw one piece to each four dogs. They were just like a pack of wolves tearing at it. {{mdash}} Livingstone, one of the sealers{{sfn|Cumpston|1968|p=240}}}}\n\nOn 23 December most of the dogs were re-embarked;{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=21}} one which had proved itself vicious was abandoned.{{sfn|Hurley|Laseron|2002|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nThe mysterious seizures continued to cause deaths among the dogs as the expedition approached its destination; seven more dogs died. The expedition's medical officers, Sydney Jones and [[Archibald Lang McLean]], determined the cause to be [[gastroenteritis]] in the majority of cases.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|pp=132\u2013133}}{{refn|The dogs lost were: Jack, Ross, King Lear, Jeffries, Pollux, Lady Hamilton and Charcot{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|pp=132\u2013133}}|group=n}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:The dogs on arrival on board, England.jpg|The dogs on first boarding ''Aurora'' in London\nFile:Getting the dogs aboard the Aurora at the Quarantine Station, Hobart.jpg|Getting the dogs on board after their stay in quarantine in Hobart\nFile:Dogs_tethered_out_on_Macquarie_Island.jpg| The dogs tethered out during their brief stay at Macquarie Island while on the journey south\n</gallery>\n\n==Main base ==\n\n=== First season, 1912===\n[[File:Blizzard_pup.jpg|thumb|Blizzard, the only pup that survived to adulthood in the first year]]\n[[File:Huskies pulling sledge (2868980227).jpg|thumb|Dogs in harness pulling Ninnis]]\nBy the time Mawson decided to make his main camp at [[Cape Denison]] on 8 January 1912, there were 29 adult dogs left on board.{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=31}} One of these, Mrs Bruce, died during the time the ship was being unloaded and the main base established,{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=133}} and her pup died on 11 January when it was accidentally washed overboard by the crew.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=133}} Mawson and [[Frank Wild]] agreed that 19 of the remaining dogs would stay at the main base and 9 would accompany Wild and his party as they sailed west to set up a second base.\n\nAt Cape Denison the dogs initially fared well. Although the winds were fierce and blizzards frequent, the dogs seldom suffered unless the temperatures were well below zero; some of the stronger dogs were quite happy to sleep outside even when the conditions were severe enough to keep the men trapped in the huts.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2713}} When the conditions became too extreme the dogs were brought in to the \"verandah\",{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2843}} a partially enclosed passage outside the door of the hut, or into the hangar.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2799}} In July conditions deteriorated to such an extent that even though the dogs had been taken into the verandah, they were still often found frozen to the ground \u2013 Mawson noted \"They whine piteously for they can't move\".{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3465}}  \n\nA hierarchy among the dogs was quickly established. Basilisk, who was \"quick as lightning when it came to a scrap\",{{sfn|Hurley|Laseron|2002|p=46}} became the leader, Ginger Bitch (originally and officially called Alexandra) was his constant companion, and Shackleton was next in line as top dog. Another dog, Jack Johnson \u2013 named after the [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|boxer]] \u2013 was constantly testing himself against the other dogs, he had heavy scarring as result.\n\nThere was little attempt to control breeding; any pups that survived to adulthood would be useful additions to the sledge teams. Pups were born regularly, but few survived more than a few days; they were either eaten by their mothers, killed by the other dogs, or perished in the harsh conditions. It was not until March 1912 though that the first casualty occurred among the immigrants. On 7 March Mawson recorded that one of the dogs, Caruso, had been found with a cord wound tightly round his neck. McLean operated on him. Although the wound was deep and over a {{convert|1|foot|cm}} long,{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2536}}  his condition initially improved, but after a few weeks he deteriorated and on 30 March he had to be shot.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2728}} On 28 June McLean accidentally mixed some broken glass into the dog's food. Mawson was anxious about them but they did not appear to experience any ill effects.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3371}} \n\nMawson planned for a number of sledging parties to set out as soon as the weather allowed. The work outside the camp mostly involved laying up stores in supply depots in preparation for these journeys. Serious training for the dogs was underway by June and progressed well.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3251}} In hauling the supplies out to the depots the dogs were invaluable; six dogs could pull a sledge with a load of {{convert|1000|lb|kg}}.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3381}}{{refn|The wooden sledges could not carry any more weight without being damaged.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3388}}|group=n}} Unfortunately the men became somewhat blase about managing the dogs and on 15 August 1912 Mawson, Ninnis and [[Cecil Madigan]], returning from a drop at the supply depot known as Aladdin's Cave noticed that the dogs which had accompanied them had not followed them when they had left for the base. The weather was already closing in and it was decided that they could not go back to fetch the dogs. The blizzard lasted for days and it was not until 21 August that a rescue party consisting of [[Bob Bage]], Mertz and [[Frank Hurley]] could set out.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3639}} By the time the rescuers reached Aladdin's Cave, the dogs \u2013 frozen and starving \u2013 were close to death. Grandmother was in the worse condition and despite the men's best efforts died four hours later. Franklin and Basilisk were left behind again on 26 September. Mertz, Hurley and Ninnis set out rescue them on 1 October when the blizzard lifted but were forced to turn back and were not able to set out again until 3 October. They eventually located the cave but the dogs were no longer there; when the group returned to the huts they found the two dogs had arrived just ahead of them, none the worse for wear.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3815}}\n\nEarly in September, Scott disappeared (Mawson believed he had probably fallen into a [[crevasse]]).{{sfn|Mawson|2008|p=125}} This left 16 dogs to support the three sledging parties planned for the beginning of November, but Blizzard, one of the pups that had been born to Gadget early in the year, had survived and was also now big enough to pull. As [[Frank Bickerton]]'s party was to test the \"[[air-tractor sledge]]\", it did not require dogs; Mawson decided that his party would take the 17 dogs and Madigan's team, which would be on easier ground closer to the coast, would man-haul.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4147}}\n\nThe timing for the start of the sledging journey was unfortunate: all the bitches were on the point of giving birth.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4089}} On 17 November, just after the three sledging parties separated, Gadget was killed because she had proved a poor puller and was judged to be tired out from carrying her pups. She was \"cut up into about 24 rations counting 7 pups\"{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4213}} to be fed to the other dogs, but they did not seem to enjoy eating her.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4221}} Fusilier and Jappy followed soon afterwards; Jappy was fed to the other dogs along with the pups of Ginger Bitch. Betli disappeared on 27 November when the dogs were let off. Blizzard was injured by Mertz on skis on 18 December and had to be shot on 28 November.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2536}}\n\nOn 14 December disaster struck Mawson's team. Ninnis, his sledge, and the six of the strongest dogs: Basilisk, Ginger Bitch, Shackleton, Castor, Franklin, and John Bull fell into a crevasse. Having lost their travelling companion, half the dogs and most of their supplies, Mawson and Mertz had no choice but to turn for home. They immediately began to supplement their meagre rations by killing and eating the remaining dogs. George was dispatched on 15 December, Johnson on 17 December, Mary on 18 December and Haldane on 21 December. The men had to lighten the load for the remaining dogs by discarding equipment; among the items they left was the rifle, so when they came to kill Pavlova on 23 December they had to do it with a knife.{{sfn|Leane|Tiffin|2012|p=188}} The final dog, Ginger, was killed on 28 December.

All of the original dogs that had landed at Cape Denison were now dead; three of Ginger's pups survived \u2013 D'Urville, Ross, and Wilkes.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=135}} Just before he left his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|Antarctic base]], Amundsen had been informed that Mawson may need resupplying with dogs for a second season, so he had taken all his surviving animals on board \u2013 he had been planning on leaving a good number behind.{{sfn|Amundsen|2008|p=2:181}} When ''Aurora'' steamed out of Commonwealth Bay on 8 February 1913 she left behind 21 dogs that Amundsen had presented to the AAE when he put in at Hobart. Eleven of these were almost immediately shot as there were estimated to be provisions only for about 13 dogs.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5224}}\n\nThe next season was mostly uneventful for the dogs. Madigan took over the duties of dog-handler. Unlike the previous year, no clear leader emerged among the dogs; instead there were small factions: the three surviving pups of Ginger: D'Urville, Ross and Wilkes formed a group; George and Lassesen joined Peary and Fix; and Colonel was the leader of the other dogs against these two groups.{{sfn|Mawson|2008|p=145}} There was a good deal of fighting; Lassesen had to be shot after being set upon,{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5530}} and George was attacked a few days later. George had been set upon by Ginger's pups, and Mawson suspected they were to blame for Lassesen's death too.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5546\u20135556}}  \n\nAfter Lassesen's death, Fix, Peary and George would often separate themselves from the rest of the dogs, taking shelter amongst the rocks by the Magnetograph House. In August, Peary was attacked by all the other dogs and badly wounded; the state of his paw was of particular concern.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5890}} \n\nMary, one of the dogs given by Amundsen, gave birth on 8 April 1913.

The first problem on landing the dogs was getting them up the ice cliff to the shelf where the base was to be established. This was accomplished by attaching them to the flying fox and then sending them up a rough ladder until they were high enough for a man at the top to grab. [[Charles Harrisson]] was not impressed with the dogs:\n\n{{quote|Chained up all the dogs last night, but someone let them loose today.

Two men, Watson and Kennedy, stayed at the camp to feed and train the dogs and to fetch the remaining stores from the edge of the ice shelf. Wild and the other five men left the base on 13 March and returned on 6 April by which time Watson and Kennedy had trained five of the dogs to pull in harness, although Crippen had died on 28 March after being unwell for a few days.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=134}}{{refn|The five dogs were probably Amundsen, Nansen, Sandow, Switzerland and Zip. Crippen had died soon after the sledging party had left and Wild later noted that Sweep and the two bitches, Tich and Tiger, would not pull in harness.|group=n}}\n\nThe two bitches, Tich and Tyger were small and did not pull well, so to preserve the party's small stock of dog food they were both shot in April. Sweep was also a poor sledge dog and it was planned that he would be killed too. On 1 May, Watson, Harrisson and [[Charles Hoadley]] took the four trained dogs on a short trip south to try them out. The sledge was lightly loaded and the dogs pulled it easily. \n\nOn 20 May, Sweep and Zip disappeared during a blizzard. Zip was found by [[Charles Dovers]] and Hoadley on the floe the next day but, although his tracks were visible all over the floe, Sweep was never seen again.{{sfn|Moyes diary, 1912}} Zip disappeared again on 18 July, this time with Sandow, the lead dog. After two days, Zip reappeared at the camp, but there was no trace of Sandow. Wild thought it was likely he had been crushed by large block of frozen snow falling from the glacier edge.\n\nA further six-man depot-laying trip was planned for 20 August. There were now only three of the original nine dogs left alive: Zip, Switzerland, and the new lead dog, Amundsen. This meant that while one sledge could be pulled by the dogs, the other had to be man-hauled. A final depot-laying journey to the south \u2013 led by Jones \u2013 was scheduled for four weeks starting on 26 September with the dogs again employed to pull one of the sledges. Switzerland went missing in a blizzard during the trip and was presumed dead, but turned up after three days.{{sfn|Moyes diary, 1912}} When Jones's party did not return within the four weeks, Wild, Watson and Kennedy set out to look for them with additional rations, though Wild thought that they would eat the dogs if food ran low. Jones and his party were seen on the horizon when Wild's party was less than a day out.\n\nThe dates for the main exploratory journeys were set as 28 October for Wild, Watson and Kennedy to travel eastwards, and 2 November for Jones, Dovers and Hoadley to go westwards. Wild's party would take the dogs. Harrisson eventually persuaded Wild to allow him to accompany the eastern party as far as the \"Hippo\" depot to look after the dogs and carry additional supplies. When the party reached the depot, the sledge that had been laid up was gone; with too much weight to carry on a single sledge even with the assistance of the dogs, Wild had no other choice but to include Harrisson and his sledge on the rest of the journey. The dogs were pulling well but were hungry:\n\n{{quote|The dogs were working very well and, if only a little additional food could be procured for them, I knew they could be kept alive. Zip broke loose one night and ate one of my socks which was hanging on the sledge to dry; it probably tasted of seal blubber from the boots. Switzerland, too, was rather a bother, eating his harness whenever he had a chance. {{mdash}} Frank Wild, ''Home of the Blizzard}}\n\nDespite including an extra man in the party the men were not short of rations but, by the time Wild was forced to turn for home on 27 November, the dog food was exhausted. They fed the dogs with their own biscuit ration for a while, but on 6 December Wild felt he could not risk using any more of the men's dwindling rations. Switzerland was shot and his meat fed to the other two dogs; Zip would not eat it, but Amundsen did not hesitate. A couple of days later, the party managed to catch almost seventy [[snow petrel]]s and collect sixty of their eggs. This bounty assured the dogs survival until they reached a depot with more rations which in turn meant they had sufficient food to be able to reach the camp.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} \n\nFormerly the two bigger dogs, Amundsen and Switzerland had ganged up against Zip whenever there was a fight, but with Switzerland gone, Zip began to assert himself and \"downed\" Amundsen several times.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} By 4 January both dogs had sore and bleeding paws so they were let off and the men took over the hauling of the sledge for a while; it was the first time Zip had been let off pulling the sledge for over 4 months.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} The following day they were harnessed up again but they were still both lame and Zip was soon limping badly, so they were let off again.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}}\n\nOn 6 January the party reached the hut to the great joy of [[Morton Moyes]] who had thought Harrisson dead. The dogs immediately began hunting out food and Amundsen (whom Harrisson disparagingly called \"Chucklehead\") gorged himself:\n\n{{quote|The dogs have had a day!

This left the dogs mostly free. Recovering from the deprivations of the eastern journey they quickly lost form and put on weight.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} The men took them out on occasional short sledging trips but they were at first reluctant to be back in harness.

twenty-one dogs donated to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition by Roald Amundsen for its unplanned second season in Antarctica]]\n\nIn common with many of the expeditions of the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration|Heroic Age]], [[Douglas Mawson]]'s [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] (AAE) employed dog-hauled sledges as a principal means of transportation during exploration of the continent. Dog sledges could carry more weight and travel faster than man-hauled sledges; they were more reliable in the freezing temperatures than motor-sledges; and dogs had proved to be more adaptable to harsh [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] conditions than ponies.\n\nMawson purchased fifty [[Sled dog|sledge dogs]] from Greenland and transported them to Antarctica on the expedition's ship {{SY|Aurora}}. The trip was arduous for the dogs and by the time the expedition arrived in Antarctica on 8 January 1912 only 28 of the dogs were still alive. These were split into two groups: nineteen stayed with Mawson at the expedition's main base and the remaining nine were sent with [[Frank Wild]] to the [[Western Base party|western base]]. All of the original dogs at the main base were dead by the end of 1912; accidents and illness had accounted for many of them and some were killed and eaten when food ran out on [[Far Eastern Party|Mawson's main sledging journey]]. At the western base two dogs survived to accompany the party home.\n\nThree pups had survived at the main base and their numbers were supplemented by 21 dogs donated to Mawson by [[Roald Amundsen]] on his return from the South Pole. Eleven of Amundsen's dogs were shot almost immediately to conserve the food supplies. During the year another dog was attacked by his companions and had to be destroyed, and the only bitch died during an operation. One puppy was born though, so twelve dogs were picked up with the party at the end of 1913.\n\nThe dogs were put briefly into quarantine in [[Adelaide Zoo]] and then a number were adopted by members of the expedition. Two were donated to the zoo, and the remaining dogs were sent to [[Kosciuszko National Park]] where they joined the surviving dog from the western base pulling sledges for visitors.\n\n==Dogs on polar expeditions==\n[[File:Amundsen - Lassesen and Fix.jpg|thumb|Fix and Lassesen, two of Amundsen's dogs. Fix would later be given to Mawson for his second season.]]\nDouglas Mawson, the leader and organizer of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, decided to take fifty [[Greenland dog]]s with him; he believed that number would be more than sufficient for the exploratory sledge journeys that he was planning to undertake during the year he planned to spend in Antarctica.{{sfn|Mawson Expedition...Training the Dogs at Hobart}} Mawson favoured dogs over ponies because, although they could only pull a little more than their own body weight, their food could be supplemented with meat from the fauna of Antarctica and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 from other dogs, so they did not need the vast imports of fodder that ponies required to see them through an expedition.{{sfn|FitzSimon|2012|p=75}} Mawson had been impressed by the enthusiasm of the dogs on the [[Nimrod Expedition|''Nimrod'' Expedition]] when he had accompanied [[Ernest Shackleton]] to Antarctica.{{sfn|FitzSimon|2012|p=75}} Both Shackleton and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] were dubious of the advantage of dogs over ponies. Amundsen and the Arctic pioneer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] were passionate advocates and thought the British explorers had misunderstood how to employ dogs in the polar regions; Amundsen pointed to their successes in the Northern Hemisphere and the relative ease of handling dogs compared with ponies, especially in heavily crevassed areas where a fallen dog could often be easily retrieved but a fallen pony was usually lost.{{sfn|Amundsen|2008|pp=57\u201360}} The Norwegians were thoroughly utilitarian in their approach to dogs though; although they could be affectionate with the animals, there was little thought given to their survival when they had outlived their usefulness. Scott had used dogs on his [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]] and had felt it badly when he had been forced to kill them all during his southern sledging journey.{{sfn|Crane|2005}} Nevertheless, his attitude towards dogs was similar to Amundsen's and Mawson's:  \n\n{{quote|One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions. On the other hand, it may be pointed out with good reason that to forego the great objects that may be achieved by the sacrifice of dog-life is carrying sentiment to undue length. It is a case, if ever there was one, where the end justifies the means. There is no real reason why the life of a dog should be considered more than that of a sheep, and no one would pause to consider the cruelty of driving a diminishing flock of sheep to supply the wants and aid the movements of travellers in more temperate climes. {{mdash}} Robert Falcon Scott, ''The Voyage of the Discovery''{{sfn|Scott|2014|pp=465\u2013466}}}}\n\n==Voyage to Antarctica==\n[[File:Ginger-and-her-pups-Mertz.jpg|thumb|Ginger and her pups on board ''Aurora'' during the voyage to Hobart. The pups did not survive.]]\nWith the help of C. A. Bang and the [[Royal Danish Geographical Society]] in Copenhagen, Mawson procured fifty dogs from Greenland in July 1911.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}} As Bang was not a dog expert, Mawson made sure [[Ernest Joyce]], the dog handler from Shackleton's ''Nimrod'' Expedition, was on hand to assist him. One of the dogs went missing in Greenland while waiting to be transported,{{sfn|Leane|Tiffin|2012|p=186}} but it was replaced and the dogs were shipped to Copenhagen. Unfortunately, [[Wilhelm Filchner]] had also ordered dogs from Greenland for his [[Second German Antarctic Expedition|Antarctic expedition]] and the two sets of dogs were delivered as a single group. The Germans arrived first to collect their consignment and initially selected all the best dogs, but when Joyce arrived he insisted that they should be divided more fairly. By the time the dogs were ready to travel to England three pups had been born, swelling the number to 53, but en route to London one of the adult dogs was lost.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}}\n\nOn arriving in London on 17 July 1911, they were placed in quarantine at Spratts Dog Home in Surrey until ''Aurora'', the expedition's ship, was ready to sail on 27 July. One dog and one pup died at Spratts.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}} Travelling with the 48 remaining dogs and two pups from London were two members of the expedition, [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Belgrave Sutton Ninnis]] and [[Xavier Mertz]], who had been appointed dog-handlers despite having no previous experience. From the start, discipline among the dogs on board ''Aurora'' was maintained by frequent \"thrashings\".{{sfn|Leane|Tiffin|2012|p=186}}\n\n''Aurora'' went first to Cardiff arriving on 31 July and after four days set out for Cape Town on 4 August. On the day of the sailing Ninnis recorded that they had lost a pregnant bitch but the two pups were still well.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=128}}  The voyage to Cape Town was hard on the dogs and, although there were frequent litters born, few of the pups survived for any time; at least 27 pups died between leaving Cardiff and arriving at Cape Town on 27 August.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}} The adult dogs suffered too and by the time the ship docked in South Africa the two best breeders, Peggy and Hilda were having seizures. They were diagnosed as having [[canine distemper|distemper]] and [[chorea]] and both died on 28 September the day after the ship had put out from Cape Town.{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=14}}\n\nFive more dogs and at least four pups died between the ship leaving South Africa on 27 September and arriving in Australia on 4 November,{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}{{refn|The dogs lost were: Jack's Brother, Mordkin, Nelson and two unnamed dogs. The pups were: Teddy Bear, Togo and two which had not yet been named.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}|group=n}} as the fits that had affected Peggy and Hilda became more common. Though Ninnis and Mertz wanted to vary the dogs' diet they had little to feed them other than biscuit and were unable to devise a regimen that prevented or decreased the symptoms.{{sfn|The Eskimo Dogs: An Interview with Dr. Mertz}} ''Aurora'''s captain, [[John King Davis]], had intended to get a stock of fish before leaving Cape Town as a supplement for the dogs' diet,{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=12}} but Mertz made no mention of this addition when he was interviewed after the dogs had arrived in Tasmania.{{sfn|The Eskimo Dogs: An Interview with Dr. Mertz}} \n\nIn Hobart, the dogs (accompanied by Ninnis and Mertz){{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}{{sfn|The Eskimo Dogs: An Interview with Dr. Mertz}} were put into quarantine until the expedition was ready to depart. Mawson had intended that they start their training during their stay in Hobart, but quarantine was strict and nothing seems to have come of this plan.{{sfn|Mawson Expedition...Training the Dogs at Hobart}} At the quarantine station \u2013 on a better diet, in less harsh conditions, and able to exercise \u2013 most put on weight and their condition improved,{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=16}} but the seizures and deaths continued. Vets and inspectors were unable to agree on a diagnosis or prescribe for the illness, and five more dogs including Hooker, one of the early pups, died during the month they spent in quarantine.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}{{refn|The dogs lost were: Jumbo, Nigger, two unnamed dogs and the pup, Hooker.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=132}}|group=n}} On 2 December 1911, the remaining 36 dogs and two pups were loaded back aboard, and ''Aurora'' set sail first for [[Macquarie Island]] and then Antarctica. The ship arrived at Macquarie on 12 December and the dogs were let off under the care of Ninnis while the wireless relay station was established. The sealers working on the island helped secure the dogs and killed some [[elephant seal]]s to feed them:\n\n{{quote|We stretched a rope along the beach and they tied the dogs in sets of four along the rope. We got our gear out and killed a couple of elephants and flensed the blubber and flesh off to feed the dogs. We cut it off in about 80 to 100 lbs pieces and threw one piece to each four dogs. They were just like a pack of wolves tearing at it. {{mdash}} Livingstone, one of the sealers{{sfn|Cumpston|1968|p=240}}}}\n\nOn 23 December most of the dogs were re-embarked;{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=21}} one which had proved itself vicious was abandoned.{{sfn|Hurley|Laseron|2002|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nThe mysterious seizures continued to cause deaths among the dogs as the expedition approached its destination; seven more dogs died. The expedition's medical officers, Sydney Jones and [[Archibald Lang McLean]], determined the cause to be [[gastroenteritis]] in the majority of cases.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|pp=132\u2013133}}{{refn|The dogs lost were: Jack, Ross, King Lear, Jeffries, Pollux, Lady Hamilton and Charcot{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|pp=132\u2013133}}|group=n}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:The dogs on arrival on board, England.jpg|The dogs on first boarding ''Aurora'' in London\nFile:Getting the dogs aboard the Aurora at the Quarantine Station, Hobart.jpg|Getting the dogs on board after their stay in quarantine in Hobart\nFile:Dogs_tethered_out_on_Macquarie_Island.jpg| The dogs tethered out during their brief stay at Macquarie Island while on the journey south\n</gallery>\n\n==Main base ==\n\n=== First season, 1912===\n[[File:Blizzard_pup.jpg|thumb|Blizzard, the only pup that survived to adulthood in the first year]]\n[[File:Huskies pulling sledge (2868980227).jpg|thumb|Dogs in harness pulling Ninnis]]\nBy the time Mawson decided to make his main camp at [[Cape Denison]] on 8 January 1912, there were 29 adult dogs left on board.{{sfn|Davis|1919|p=31}} One of these, Mrs Bruce, died during the time the ship was being unloaded and the main base established,{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=133}} and her pup died on 11 January when it was accidentally washed overboard by the crew.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=133}} Mawson and [[Frank Wild]] agreed that 19 of the remaining dogs would stay at the main base and 9 would accompany Wild and his party as they sailed west to set up a second base.\n\nAt Cape Denison the dogs initially fared well. Although the winds were fierce and blizzards frequent, the dogs seldom suffered unless the temperatures were well below zero; some of the stronger dogs were quite happy to sleep outside even when the conditions were severe enough to keep the men trapped in the huts.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2713}} When the conditions became too extreme the dogs were brought in to the \"verandah\",{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2843}} a partially enclosed passage outside the door of the hut, or into the hangar.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2799}} In July conditions deteriorated to such an extent that even though the dogs had been taken into the verandah, they were still often found frozen to the ground \u2013 Mawson noted \"They whine piteously for they can't move\".{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3465}}  \n\nA hierarchy among the dogs was quickly established. Basilisk, who was \"quick as lightning when it came to a scrap\",{{sfn|Hurley|Laseron|2002|p=46}} became the leader, Ginger Bitch (originally and officially called Alexandra) was his constant companion, and Shackleton was next in line as top dog. Another dog, Jack Johnson \u2013 named after the [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|boxer]] \u2013 was constantly testing himself against the other dogs, he had heavy scarring as result.\n\nThere was little attempt to control breeding; any pups that survived to adulthood would be useful additions to the sledge teams. Pups were born regularly, but few survived more than a few days; they were either eaten by their mothers, killed by the other dogs, or perished in the harsh conditions. It was not until March 1912 though that the first casualty occurred among the immigrants. On 7 March Mawson recorded that one of the dogs, Caruso, had been found with a cord wound tightly round his neck. McLean operated on him. Although the wound was deep and over a {{convert|1|foot|cm}} long,{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2536}}  his condition initially improved, but after a few weeks he deteriorated and on 30 March he had to be shot.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2728}} On 28 June McLean accidentally mixed some broken glass into the dog's food. Mawson was anxious about them but they did not appear to experience any ill effects.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3371}} \n\nMawson planned for a number of sledging parties to set out as soon as the weather allowed. The work outside the camp mostly involved laying up stores in supply depots in preparation for these journeys. Serious training for the dogs was underway by June and progressed well.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3251}} In hauling the supplies out to the depots the dogs were invaluable; six dogs could pull a sledge with a load of {{convert|1000|lb|kg}}.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3381}}{{refn|The wooden sledges could not carry any more weight without being damaged.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3388}}|group=n}} Unfortunately the men became somewhat blase about managing the dogs and on 15 August 1912 Mawson, Ninnis and [[Cecil Madigan]], returning from a drop at the supply depot known as Aladdin's Cave noticed that the dogs which had accompanied them had not followed them when they had left for the base. The weather was already closing in and it was decided that they could not go back to fetch the dogs. The blizzard lasted for days and it was not until 21 August that a rescue party consisting of [[Bob Bage]], Mertz and [[Frank Hurley]] could set out.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3639}} By the time the rescuers reached Aladdin's Cave, the dogs \u2013 frozen and starving \u2013 were close to death. Grandmother was in the worse condition and despite the men's best efforts died four hours later. Franklin and Basilisk were left behind again on 26 September. Mertz, Hurley and Ninnis set out rescue them on 1 October when the blizzard lifted but were forced to turn back and were not able to set out again until 3 October. They eventually located the cave but the dogs were no longer there; when the group returned to the huts they found the two dogs had arrived just ahead of them, none the worse for wear.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=3815}}\n\nEarly in September, Scott disappeared (Mawson believed he had probably fallen into a [[crevasse]]).{{sfn|Mawson|2008|p=125}} This left 16 dogs to support the three sledging parties planned for the beginning of November, but Blizzard, one of the pups that had been born to Gadget early in the year, had survived and was also now big enough to pull. As [[Frank Bickerton]]'s party was to test the \"[[air-tractor sledge]]\", it did not require dogs; Mawson decided that his party would take the 17 dogs and Madigan's team, which would be on easier ground closer to the coast, would man-haul.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4147}}\n\nThe timing for the start of the sledging journey was unfortunate: all the bitches were on the point of giving birth.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4089}} On 17 November, just after the three sledging parties separated, Gadget was killed because she had proved a poor puller and was judged to be tired out from carrying her pups. She was \"cut up into about 24 rations counting 7 pups\"{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4213}} to be fed to the other dogs, but they did not seem to enjoy eating her.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=4221}} Fusilier and Jappy followed soon afterwards; Jappy was fed to the other dogs along with the pups of Ginger Bitch. Betli disappeared on 27 November when the dogs were let off. Blizzard was injured by Mertz on skis on 18 December and had to be shot on 28 November.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=2536}}\n\nOn 14 December disaster struck Mawson's team. Ninnis, his sledge, and the six of the strongest dogs: Basilisk, Ginger Bitch, Shackleton, Castor, Franklin, and John Bull fell into a crevasse. Having lost their travelling companion, half the dogs and most of their supplies, Mawson and Mertz had no choice but to turn for home. They immediately began to supplement their meagre rations by killing and eating the remaining dogs. George was dispatched on 15 December, Johnson on 17 December, Mary on 18 December and Haldane on 21 December. The men had to lighten the load for the remaining dogs by discarding equipment; among the items they left was the rifle, so when they came to kill Pavlova on 23 December they had to do it with a knife.{{sfn|Leane|Tiffin|2012|p=188}} The final dog, Ginger, was killed on 28 December. Mertz died early on 8 January 1913 \u2013 it is generally thought that he suffered from [[Hypervitaminosis a|vitamin A poisoning]] brought on by eating the dogs' livers.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Basilisk & Ginger at Main Base photograph by Xavier Mertz.jpg|Basilisk and Ginger at Cape Denison\nFile:Sledge-dogs-at-winter-quarters-Cape-Denison-Hurley.png|Some of the first season dogs at Cape Denison\nFile:Greenland esquimaux dogs (Basilisk and Ginger-bitch), Antarctica, 1911-1914 - Frank Hurley (8442222877).jpg|Basilisk and Ginger Bitch at Cape Denison\n</gallery>\n\n=== Second season, 1913 ===\n\nMawson made it back to base on 8 February 1913. All of the original dogs that had landed at Cape Denison were now dead; three of Ginger's pups survived \u2013 D'Urville, Ross, and Wilkes.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=135}} Just before he left his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|Antarctic base]], Amundsen had been informed that Mawson may need resupplying with dogs for a second season, so he had taken all his surviving animals on board \u2013 he had been planning on leaving a good number behind.{{sfn|Amundsen|2008|p=2:181}} When ''Aurora'' steamed out of Commonwealth Bay on 8 February 1913 she left behind 21 dogs that Amundsen had presented to the AAE when he put in at Hobart. Eleven of these were almost immediately shot as there were estimated to be provisions only for about 13 dogs.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5224}}\n\nThe next season was mostly uneventful for the dogs. Madigan took over the duties of dog-handler. Unlike the previous year, no clear leader emerged among the dogs; instead there were small factions: the three surviving pups of Ginger: D'Urville, Ross and Wilkes formed a group; George and Lassesen joined Peary and Fix; and Colonel was the leader of the other dogs against these two groups.{{sfn|Mawson|2008|p=145}} There was a good deal of fighting; Lassesen had to be shot after being set upon,{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5530}} and George was attacked a few days later. George had been set upon by Ginger's pups, and Mawson suspected they were to blame for Lassesen's death too.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5546\u20135556}}  \n\nAfter Lassesen's death, Fix, Peary and George would often separate themselves from the rest of the dogs, taking shelter amongst the rocks by the Magnetograph House. In August, Peary was attacked by all the other dogs and badly wounded; the state of his paw was of particular concern.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5890}} \n\nMary, one of the dogs given by Amundsen, gave birth on 8 April 1913. One of her pups, Hoyle, survived to depart with the expedition,{{sfn|Mawson|2008|p=142}} but Mary herself fell ill and had to have an operation on 30 August.{{sfn|Jacka|Jacka|2008|loc=5890}} It seems she did not improve and she died during a second operation on 29 October.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=135}} Hoyle was treated with benevolence by the other dogs while he was a pup. Once he was put in with the other dogs on 17 July, he quickly joined the group with Ginger's pups. \n\nThe only major sledging activity of the second season was a trip to try to recover some abandoned equipment from the previous year's journeys.

The first problem on landing the dogs was getting them up the ice cliff to the shelf where the base was to be established. This was accomplished by attaching them to the flying fox and then sending them up a rough ladder until they were high enough for a man at the top to grab. [[Charles Harrisson]] was not impressed with the dogs:\n\n{{quote|Chained up all the dogs last night, but someone let them loose today.

Two men, Watson and Kennedy, stayed at the camp to feed and train the dogs and to fetch the remaining stores from the edge of the ice shelf. Wild and the other five men left the base on 13 March and returned on 6 April by which time Watson and Kennedy had trained five of the dogs to pull in harness, although Crippen had died on 28 March after being unwell for a few days.{{sfn|Riffenburgh|2014|p=134}}{{refn|The five dogs were probably Amundsen, Nansen, Sandow, Switzerland and Zip. Crippen had died soon after the sledging party had left and Wild later noted that Sweep and the two bitches, Tich and Tiger, would not pull in harness.|group=n}}\n\nThe two bitches, Tich and Tyger were small and did not pull well, so to preserve the party's small stock of dog food they were both shot in April. Sweep was also a poor sledge dog and it was planned that he would be killed too. On 1 May, Watson, Harrisson and [[Charles Hoadley]] took the four trained dogs on a short trip south to try them out. The sledge was lightly loaded and the dogs pulled it easily. \n\nOn 20 May, Sweep and Zip disappeared during a blizzard. Zip was found by [[Charles Dovers]] and Hoadley on the floe the next day but, although his tracks were visible all over the floe, Sweep was never seen again.{{sfn|Moyes diary, 1912}} Zip disappeared again on 18 July, this time with Sandow, the lead dog. After two days, Zip reappeared at the camp, but there was no trace of Sandow. Wild thought it was likely he had been crushed by large block of frozen snow falling from the glacier edge.\n\nA further six-man depot-laying trip was planned for 20 August. There were now only three of the original nine dogs left alive: Zip, Switzerland, and the new lead dog, Amundsen. This meant that while one sledge could be pulled by the dogs, the other had to be man-hauled. A final depot-laying journey to the south \u2013 led by Jones \u2013 was scheduled for four weeks starting on 26 September with the dogs again employed to pull one of the sledges. Switzerland went missing in a blizzard during the trip and was presumed dead, but turned up after three days.{{sfn|Moyes diary, 1912}} When Jones's party did not return within the four weeks, Wild, Watson and Kennedy set out to look for them with additional rations, though Wild thought that they would eat the dogs if food ran low. Jones and his party were seen on the horizon when Wild's party was less than a day out.\n\nThe dates for the main exploratory journeys were set as 28 October for Wild, Watson and Kennedy to travel eastwards, and 2 November for Jones, Dovers and Hoadley to go westwards. Wild's party would take the dogs. Harrisson eventually persuaded Wild to allow him to accompany the eastern party as far as the \"Hippo\" depot to look after the dogs and carry additional supplies. When the party reached the depot, the sledge that had been laid up was gone; with too much weight to carry on a single sledge even with the assistance of the dogs, Wild had no other choice but to include Harrisson and his sledge on the rest of the journey. The dogs were pulling well but were hungry:\n\n{{quote|The dogs were working very well and, if only a little additional food could be procured for them, I knew they could be kept alive. Zip broke loose one night and ate one of my socks which was hanging on the sledge to dry; it probably tasted of seal blubber from the boots. Switzerland, too, was rather a bother, eating his harness whenever he had a chance. {{mdash}} Frank Wild, ''Home of the Blizzard}}\n\nDespite including an extra man in the party the men were not short of rations but, by the time Wild was forced to turn for home on 27 November, the dog food was exhausted. They fed the dogs with their own biscuit ration for a while, but on 6 December Wild felt he could not risk using any more of the men's dwindling rations. Switzerland was shot and his meat fed to the other two dogs; Zip would not eat it, but Amundsen did not hesitate. A couple of days later, the party managed to catch almost seventy [[snow petrel]]s and collect sixty of their eggs. This bounty assured the dogs survival until they reached a depot with more rations which in turn meant they had sufficient food to be able to reach the camp.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} \n\nFormerly the two bigger dogs, Amundsen and Switzerland had ganged up against Zip whenever there was a fight, but with Switzerland gone, Zip began to assert himself and \"downed\" Amundsen several times.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} By 4 January both dogs had sore and bleeding paws so they were let off and the men took over the hauling of the sledge for a while; it was the first time Zip had been let off pulling the sledge for over 4 months.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} The following day they were harnessed up again but they were still both lame and Zip was soon limping badly, so they were let off again.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}}\n\nOn 6 January the party reached the hut to the great joy of [[Morton Moyes]] who had thought Harrisson dead. The dogs immediately began hunting out food and Amundsen (whom Harrisson disparagingly called \"Chucklehead\") gorged himself:\n\n{{quote|The dogs have had a day! Chucklehead was busy in the rubbish heap when we arrived. Had had a breakfast of a couple of snow petrels \u2013 but round the hut with the scraps we took out, he manages to \"fill up\" \u2013 for he\u2019s not the least particular in his diet. By 3 pm he looked like perambulating [indecipherable] with a barrel under his hide. An hour or so later he was lying helplessly by the sledges.

This left the dogs mostly free. Recovering from the deprivations of the eastern journey they quickly lost form and put on weight.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} The men took them out on occasional short sledging trips but they were at first reluctant to be back in harness. By the time the men started moving items to the floe in preparation for leaving, the dogs were fitter and pulling well, and by 9 February Harrisson reported: \"Two dogs are now good friends, & they were gamboling & playing together in the soft snow there like 2 puppies.\"{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}}\n\n''Aurora'' arrived on 25 February and by the evening the men and dogs were on board heading for Tasmania.{{sfn|Harrisson diary, 1913}} \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Hauling-the-dogs-up-the-flying-fox-at-The-Grottoes-Watson.png|Hauling the dogs up the [[Zip line|flying fox]] just after landing.
