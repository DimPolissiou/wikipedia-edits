It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India.\n\n==Summary==\nKartik likes a girl after seeing her selflessness but Kartik's mother does not like the girl because of her complexion. \n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood.

It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India.\n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumeet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. Shanaya's photographer is Sumeet, Kartik's brother.\n\n\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik\n* Kavita Ghai as Soni, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Purnima's step-mother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora / Shanu, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Mohit Chauhan as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumeet, Kartik's cousin\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n", "name_user": "Shameera1234", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartik_Purnima_(TV_Show)"}

The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"[[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]]\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|title=Russia banned from Tokyo Olympics and football World Cup|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|date=9 December 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209155622/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/russia-banned-from-tokyo-olympics-and-football-world-cup|archive-date=9 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598|title=Russia banned for four years to include 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup|work=BBC Sport|date=9 December 2019|access-date=9 December 2019|language=en-GB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211171354/https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598 |archive-date=11 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |title=WADA lawyer defends lack of blanket ban on Russia |date=13 December 2019 |access-date=17 December 2019 |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |work=[[The Japan Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214162048/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/12/13/olympics/wada-lawyer-defends-lack-blanket-ban-russia/#.Xfknqej7S00 |archive-date=14 December 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Russia later filed an appeal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) against the WADA decision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |title=Russia Confirms It Will Appeal 4-Year Olympic Ban |date=27 December 2019 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227213853/https://time.com/5756077/russia-olympic-ban-appeal/ |archive-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2020|03|12|df=}}, the following 153 [[National Olympic Committee]]s have qualified (other than through universality places in athletics and swimming, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Literaturoper", "text_new": "'''Literaturoper''' (''literature opera'', plural \u201cLiteraturopern\u201d), a term coined by the German music critic Edgar Istel, describes a genre of [[opera]] that emerged during the late 19th century. When an existing play for the legitimate theatre is set to music without major changes and without the intervention of a librettist, a \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d is the result. Although the term is [[German language|German]], it can be applied to any kind of opera, irrespective of style or language. (In that sense it can be regarded as a term rather than a genre as such.)\n\nThe former, much broader usage of the term \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d for opera libretti on the basis of dramas, novels and short stories of undoubted literary renown, which was still common until around 1980, has been made obsolete by recent research on the history of the opera libretto. Since opera libretti have relied on subject matter from the history of literature since the very origin of the genre of opera, a broader usage of the term would cover the entire history of opera, regardless of the underlying libretto structure.<ref>Albert Gier: ''Das Libretto. Theorie und Geschichte einer musikoliterarischen Gattung.'' Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1998, ISBN 3-534-12368-9. (Second edition: Insel, Frankfurt am Main 2000, ISBN 3-458-34366-0)</ref>\n\n== Current definition ==\nAccording to a seminal publication by Peter Petersen, the term means \u201ea special form of music theater in which the libretto is based on a literary work whose linguistic, semantic and aesthetic structure remains recognizable in the musical-dramatic work as a structural layer.\u201c<ref>Peter Petersen: ''Der Terminus \"Literaturoper\" \u2013 eine Begriffsbestimmung.'' In ''[[Archiv f\u00fcr Musikwissenschaft]]'' vol. 56, 1999, pp. 52\u201370.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe tradition of literaturoper only became established in European opera culture when, with [[Richard Wagner]] and the \"through-composed dramatic form\" he developed, the conventions of verse metrics for the opera libretto had faded. At the same time, the personal union of libretto poet and composer appeared as the new norm of opera production.

When an existing play for the legitimate theatre is set to music without major changes and without the intervention of a librettist, a \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d is the result. Although the term is [[German language|German]], it can be applied to any kind of opera, irrespective of style or language. (In that sense it can be regarded as a term rather than a genre as such.)\n\nThe former, much broader usage of the term \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d for opera libretti on the basis of dramas, novels and short stories of undoubted literary renown, which was still common until around 1980, has been made obsolete by recent research on the history of the opera libretto. Since opera libretti have relied on subject matter from the history of literature since the very origin of the genre of opera, a broader usage of the term would cover the entire genre of opera.<ref>Albert Gier: ''Das Libretto. Theorie und Geschichte einer musikoliterarischen Gattung.'' Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1998, ISBN 3-534-12368-9. (Second edition: Insel, Frankfurt am Main 2000, ISBN 3-458-34366-0)</ref>\n\n== Current definition ==\nAccording to a seminal publication by Peter Petersen, the term means \u201ea special form of music theater in which the libretto is based on a literary work whose linguistic, semantic and aesthetic structure remains recognizable in the musical-dramatic work as a structural layer.\u201c<ref>Peter Petersen: ''Der Terminus \"Literaturoper\" \u2013 eine Begriffsbestimmung.'' In ''[[Archiv f\u00fcr Musikwissenschaft]]'' vol. 56, 1999, pp. 52\u201370.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe tradition of literaturoper only became established in European opera culture when, with [[Richard Wagner]] and the \"through-composed dramatic form\" he developed, the conventions of verse metrics for the opera libretto had faded. At the same time, the personal union of libretto poet and composer appeared as the new norm of opera production.

Kirby of the Stars}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} is an [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] series developed by [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. The series centers around the adventures of a young, pink alien hero named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] as he fights to save his home on the distant Planet Popstar from a variety of threats. The majority of the games in the series are [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformers]] with puzzle solving and [[beat 'em up]] elements. Kirby has the ability to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, spitting them out as a projectile or eating them. If he eats certain things he can gain the powers or properties of that object manifesting as a new weapon or power-up called a Copy Ability. The series is intended to be easy to pick up and play even for people unfamiliar with [[action game]]s, while at the same time offering additional challenge and depth for more experienced players to come back to.\n\npoyo\n\n==POYO==\nThe main [[protagonist]] of the ''Kirby'' series is a young, spherical 8-inch-tall alien boy named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] who lives on a far away [[Five-pointed star|star]]-shaped planet called Popstar in the country of Dream Land. Much of Dream Land is peaceful and its people lead laid back and carefree lives. However, when peace in Dream Land is shattered from threats, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial in origin, it's up to Kirby to become a brave warrior and save his home. Despite his young and carefree personality; Kirby possesses many incredible abilities, such as the power to inhale objects and enemies, sucking them into his stretchy mouth and spitting them out with force. He can also take on the properties of enemies and objects that he eats to gain Copy Abilities, transforming into new forms and gaining new powers; such as breathing fire, wielding a sword, launching sparks in every direction, or attacking enemies with direct hand-to-hand combat.\n\nMany [[List of Kirby characters|recurring characters]] appear throughout the series both allies and enemies. The most frequent one being [[King Dedede]], a gluttonous blue penguin-like bird and self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land. King Dedede has appeared in every ''Kirby'' game except for ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]''. King Dedede's selfish nature often leads him and Kirby to clash, however he sometimes teams up with Kirby when a greater threat appears. Another major character of the series is the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], a chivalrous masked man who wishes to one day fight the strongest warrior in the galaxy and leads a band of like-minded warriors. Whenever he and Kirby duel, he will always offer Kirby a sword beforehand so that the fight is fair. While his true face resembles Kirby's, his exact relationship with Kirby remains a mystery.\n\nThe main ''Kirby'' games are side-scrolling action-platformers. Kirby must run, jump, and attack enemies while traversing through a number of areas, solving puzzles and fighting [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] along the way. One of the things that sets ''Kirby'' apart is Kirby's ability to inflate himself with a gulp of air and fly. In most games he can do this for as long as he likes however, his attack options are limited while doing so.\n\nKirby games often contain a number of hidden items that either unlock more parts to the game or are simple incentives to collect, and are usually required to achieve 100% completion in the game. These special items usually relate to the plot of the game, most often used to create a special weapon required to defeat the final boss. In some games, the special weapon is optional and can be used in the game regularly after defeating the final boss with it. These elements have remained constant throughout most the series, with each game having its own unique twist to affect gameplay.\n\nThe games' fantasy world of [[#Fictional universe|Popstar]] includes many regions of different climates and terrains, which are home to [[List of Kirby characters|many different creatures]]. Each game features uniquely named areas, but all games feature typical locations such as fiery mountains, open meadows, water-filled or submerged areas, icy snowfields, and similar nature-based places.\n\nThere are also several spinoff games in the series, which involve a variety of different gaming genres such as [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], puzzle, [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], a game based on motion-sensor technology. A number of these side games take advantage of Kirby's round, ball-like appearance.\n\n==History==\n{{VG timeline\n|\n|poyo\n}}\n\n===1990s===\nThe first game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the original [[Game Boy]], was released in Japan in April 1992 and later in North America in August that year. A simple game, consisting of five levels, it introduced Kirby's ability to inhale enemies and objects. The game contains an unlockable hard mode, known as the \"Extra Game\", which features stronger enemies and more difficult bosses. The North American box art showed a white Kirby, although the Japanese box art had the correct pink coloring.\n\npoyo\nAfter ''Kirby's Adventure'', the ''Kirby'' series received a number of spin-off games. ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]'', released in November 1993, is a pinball game featuring Kirby as the poyoball. ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'', released in North America in February 1995, is a [[golf]]-based game which features an isometric graphic design. ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', released in February 1995 in North America and Europe, is a puzzle game, a westernized version of the Japanese game ''[[Puyo Puyo]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', released in Japan and North America in March 1995, brought the Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure'' to a handheld system, but due to system limitations lowered the number of abilities to seven. The game introduced three rideable animal companions: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the ocean sunfish. Pairing up with any of these three alters how Kirby's abilities work. The game was to be remade for the [[Game Boy Color]] as ''Kirby's Dream Land 2 DX'', but was cancelled.\n\n''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]'', released in November 1995 in North America, is a [[Breakout clone|variation]] of the game ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', featuring multiple levels, some of Kirby's Copy Abilities, and various enemies in unique boss battles.\n\n''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', known as ''Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe'' in Japan and ''Kirby's Fun Pak'' in Europe, was released in North America in September 1996. ''Kirby Super Star'' is composed of eight separate games, and features several characters and abilities which have not appeared since in the series. The game features \"Helpers\", which can be created by sacrificing the ability in use, to help the player dispatch enemies.\n\nIn 1996, a ''Kirby'' mini-game series, {{nihongo foot|''Kirby's Toy Box'',|\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u7bb1|K\u0101b\u012b no Omocha Hako|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released via the [[St.GIGA]] satellite broadcasting system for the [[Satellaview]]. These mini-games were given a unique broadcast date. Mini-game titles included: ''Arrange Ball'', ''Ball Rally'', ''Baseball'', ''Cannonball'', ''Guru Guru Ball'', ''Hoshi Kuzushi'', ''Pachinko'', and ''Pinball''.<ref>Andou, N.

Famicom House. Retrieved 24 April 2009.</ref>\n\nReleased in 1997, ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]'' is a puzzle game which involves touching two or more similar blocks together that have Kirby's animal friends on them. The game received a sequel on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1998 in Japan as ''[[Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', released in November 1997 in North America, is a direct sequel to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', as it featured the return of Kirby's animal friends. Similarly to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' features a few Copy Abilities which were modified when Kirby paired up with one of his six animal friends. The game had a multiplayer option with the second player controlling Gooey, a recurring character. The antagonist is Dark Matter, and if certain conditions are met, Zero was fought as the true final boss. The game had a unique pastel-drawing art style and used dithering to improve visual performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|title=Kirby's Dreamland 3 Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/01/06/kirbys-dream-land-3-review|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=January 6, 2009|quote=Kirby's Dream Collection 3 (...) employed an advanced-for-the-time dithering effect to enhance the visuals.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/dreamland3/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe first game to have 3D graphics in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', was released on the [[Nintendo 64]] in North America in June 2000. The game features a compound ability system that allows two of the seven abilities in the game to be merged, making a new compound ability. It also marked the first playable instance of King Dedede, where sections of some stages had Kirby riding piggyback while King Dedede attacked enemies and obstacles with his hammer. It is considered a direct follow-up to ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' due to the reemergence of Dark Matter and the final boss, albeit in a different form, called 0<sup>2</sup> (Zero Two). It also included three four-player minigames.\n\nThe next game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' became one of Nintendo's first motion-sensor-based games in August 2000. Players are instructed to tilt the Game Boy Color to move Kirby on the screen. Quickly flicking the Game Boy Color upwards would make Kirby jump into the air. ''Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble'' is the only ''Kirby'' game to have a special cartridge color (transparent pink) in North America.\n\nThe only ''Kirby'' game for the [[GameCube]], ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', was released in North America in October 2003. It is a racing game which deviates greatly from usual ''Kirby'' titles, although still featuring series staples including enemies and Copy Abilities.\n\nDuring the 2003 Holiday season, a Kirby [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-reader card]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] was released. The card was released under two names, ''Kirby Slide'' and ''Kirby Puzzle''. Swiping the card would allow for a sliding puzzle game starring Kirby to be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEC30bnj0cU|title=Kirby Puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Cards were given out at [[Toys \"R\" Us]] stores and in the 2003 December issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' and ''[[Tips & Tricks (magazine)|Tips & Tricks]]''. The game was released to advertise the English dub of ''[[Kirby: Right Back At Ya!]]''\n\n''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'' was released in October 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is the second game released on that system, following ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''. It features Kirby in a [[Metroidvania]] format, with all the levels being interconnected and able to be completed in any order. Also unique was the in-game phone, which can be used to summon up to three additional copies of Kirby to fight enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nThe next game in the series is ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'', released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan on March 24, 2005, North America on June 13, 2005, Europe on November 25, 2005, and Australia on April 6, 2006. Unlike most previous ''Kirby'' games, the player does not directly control Kirby with a [[D-pad|directional pad]], [[analog stick]], face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, Kirby is a helpless ball, and can only move when he gains momentum, the player painting paths with the stylus to direct his movement.\n\nThis was followed by ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'' in late 2006, also on the Nintendo DS, which revived traditional ''Kirby'' gameplay and dabbled in the use of the touch screen to store several items and Copy Abilities in Kirby's stomach. Ability scrolls could be found that served as upgrades for each ability, giving them additional moves and/or enhanced functionality. An unlockable Copy Ability was also introduced.\n\n''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', announced for the Nintendo DS in early fall 2007<ref>{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |date=October 11, 2007 |title=Second Hand Hands On from Japan |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/11/second-hand-hands-on-from-japan |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> and released on September 22, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/kirby-super-star-ultra/nds-14209932 |title=Kirby Super Star Ultra - Nintendo DS |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> in North America, is a remake of ''Kirby Super Star''.

Pupupu Land}}}} a country on Planet Popstar. Popstar resembles a [[five-pointed star]] encircled by two diagonal [[Ring system|rings]].\n\nWhile most of Kirby's adventures take place on Popstar, his journeys occasionally take place on an interplanetary scale; such as in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', ''Milky Way Wishes'' from ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n==Nature of the protagonist==\n{{main|Kirby (character)}}\nKirby is a small, pink, spherical alien with red feet, stubby flap-like arms and pink cheek-blushes. He is referred to as male in the animated series, and described as a young boy in the instruction manual for ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch his mouth to inhale foes or inflate himself with air and float. According to ''Super Smash Bros.'' instruction manual, he is 8 inches tall; this is contradicted in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', the former of which shows Kirby to be at about [[knee]] height compared to [[Samus Aran]] and the latter of which showing him to be a few inches shorter than the human girl Adeleine.\n\nKirby hails from the country of Dream Land on Planet Popstar, where he lives in a domed house. His appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\nKirby does not commonly speak, mainly limited to grunts, shouts, and monosyllables in such games as ''Super Smash Bros'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''. However he does speak in the stories written in some games' instruction manuals. He rarely speaks in-game, the only exception being ''Kirby's Avalanche''. He narrates the functions of Copy Abilities on the start menu in ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. Most in-game talking Kirby does is in ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]'', where Kirby explains the game's rules and gameplay. Kirby has dialogue in ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'', but it is all spoken through the game's narrator.\n\n==Other media==\n===POYO===\npoyo\n\n===Comics and manga===\nKirby stars in several [[manga]] series, none of which have been released outside of Japan yet. The longest running series is ''Kirby of the Stars'' (a rough English translation of ''Hoshi no Kirby''), written by Hirokazu Hikawa. This series was announced for a release in America by VIZ Media, but was never actually released.\n\nOther ''Kirby'' manga are typically one-shot comedy [[4koma]] based on the games, and have multiple artists. They have recurring themes and [[running gag]]s.\n\nKirby also appears in several German comics, featuring him as a detective and King Dedede as his friend. His animal friends appear as pets of a female Kirby look-alike with red glass slippers. In one comic, he meets Lolo, Lala, and Lulu, the protagonists of the ''[[Adventures of Lolo]]'' series. The German comics were meant to let German ''Kirby'' fans know of ''Kirby'' games which would be released there.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Cancelled games===\nIn the lifetime of the ''Kirby'' series, several video games have been in development that, for various reasons, were ultimately abandoned. Such titles include ''Kirby's Air Ride 64'' (also known as ''Kirby Bowl 64'' and ''Kirby Ball 64'') on the Nintendo 64,<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Kirby Ball 64 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|page=79}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Kirby Bowl 64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=90 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1996|page=23}}</ref> which was eventually released on the GameCube as ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''.\n\n''Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble 2'' on the GameCube, which was supposed to use a combination of motion-sensor technology and connectivity to the Game Boy Advance via the [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable]].<ref>The game was presented during the Nintendo Space World 2001</ref>\n\nThere was also a planned game called ''Kid Kirby'' that was to be released on the Super Nintendo.<ref>''Other Stuff: Nintendo News''. [[DieHard GameFan]]. Volume 3. Issue 6. Number 30. Pg.129. June 1995.</ref> The game would have served as a prequel to the series and would have utilized the SNES mouse. The game was cancelled due to the declining sales of the mouse; however, early screenshots of the cancelled game have been posted online. This unreleased game was developed by [[DMA Design]] for Nintendo and was scheduled for 1995.\n\nThough resurfaced as ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', the GameCube was initially going to have its own original Kirby game, simply titled ''Kirby Adventure'' at the time. It was nearly complete and featured at E3 2005, but was cancelled due to troubles incorporating a unique multiplayer mechanic, which became the special attack in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' (where all players stack on each other, hold A and release at the same time). Most of ''Kirby Adventure'' was scrapped in the game it became to be, such as the helper system that was featured in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' which made a return in the GameCube version of the game before cancellation, as well as having faster-paced gameplay similar to ''Kirby Super Star''. Such concepts would be revitalized in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Kirby'' in other video games===\n[[File:Kirby Characters in Smash.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Meta Knight]], [[King Dedede]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]  in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'']]\nKirby appears as a character in Nintendo's crossover [[fighting game]] series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' (also developed by series creator Masahiro Sakurai), appearing in all installments of the franchise. Starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' onwards, he's joined by [[Meta Knight]] and [[King Dedede]]. Many items from the Kirby series also appear in ''Super Smash Bros'' such as the Maxim Tomato (all games), Warp Star (since ''Melee''), Dragoon (since ''Brawl'') and Star Rod (all games) as items, and Knuckle Joe (''Brawl'' and ''3DS/Wii U''), Nightmare (''3DS/Wii U'') and Chef Kawasaki (''Ultimate'') appear as characters summoned by the Assist Trophy. All playable Kirby characters in ''Smash Bros.'' have the ability to jump more than twice. Kirby has also made cameo appearances in other games as well, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and ''[[Stunt Race FX]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nThe ''Kirby'' games have received reception that ranges from mixed to very favourable reviews by players and critics.

Kirby of the Stars}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} is an [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] series developed by [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. The series centers around the adventures of a young, pink alien hero named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] as he fights to save his home on the distant Planet Popstar from a variety of threats. The majority of the games in the series are [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformers]] with puzzle solving and [[beat 'em up]] elements. Kirby has the ability to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, spitting them out as a projectile or eating them. If he eats certain things he can gain the powers or properties of that object manifesting as a new weapon or power-up called a Copy Ability. The series is intended to be easy to pick up and play even for people unfamiliar with [[action game]]s, while at the same time offering additional challenge and depth for more experienced players to come back to.\n\nThe ''Kirby'' series includes a total of over [[List of Kirby games|twenty games]], and has sold over 34 million units worldwide, putting it in the top 50 best-selling video game franchises of all time.\n\n==Overview==\nThe main [[protagonist]] of the ''Kirby'' series is a young, spherical 8-inch-tall alien boy named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] who lives on a far away [[Five-pointed star|star]]-shaped planet called Popstar in the country of Dream Land. Much of Dream Land is peaceful and its people lead laid back and carefree lives. However, when peace in Dream Land is shattered from threats, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial in origin, it's up to Kirby to become a brave warrior and save his home. Despite his young and carefree personality; Kirby possesses many incredible abilities, such as the power to inhale objects and enemies, sucking them into his stretchy mouth and spitting them out with force. He can also take on the properties of enemies and objects that he eats to gain Copy Abilities, transforming into new forms and gaining new powers; such as breathing fire, wielding a sword, launching sparks in every direction, or attacking enemies with direct hand-to-hand combat.\n\nMany [[List of Kirby characters|recurring characters]] appear throughout the series both allies and enemies. The most frequent one being [[King Dedede]], a gluttonous blue penguin-like bird and self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land. King Dedede has appeared in every ''Kirby'' game except for ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]''. King Dedede's selfish nature often leads him and Kirby to clash, however he sometimes teams up with Kirby when a greater threat appears. Another major character of the series is the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], a chivalrous masked man who wishes to one day fight the strongest warrior in the galaxy and leads a band of like-minded warriors. Whenever he and Kirby duel, he will always offer Kirby a sword beforehand so that the fight is fair. While his true face resembles Kirby's, his exact relationship with Kirby remains a mystery.\n\nThe main ''Kirby'' games are side-scrolling action-platformers. Kirby must run, jump, and attack enemies while traversing through a number of areas, solving puzzles and fighting [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] along the way. One of the things that sets ''Kirby'' apart is Kirby's ability to inflate himself with a gulp of air and fly. In most games he can do this for as long as he likes however, his attack options are limited while doing so.\n\nKirby games often contain a number of hidden items that either unlock more parts to the game or are simple incentives to collect, and are usually required to achieve 100% completion in the game. These special items usually relate to the plot of the game, most often used to create a special weapon required to defeat the final boss. In some games, the special weapon is optional and can be used in the game regularly after defeating the final boss with it. These elements have remained constant throughout most the series, with each game having its own unique twist to affect gameplay.\n\nThe games' fantasy world of [[#Fictional universe|Popstar]] includes many regions of different climates and terrains, which are home to [[List of Kirby characters|many different creatures]]. Each game features uniquely named areas, but all games feature typical locations such as fiery mountains, open meadows, water-filled or submerged areas, icy snowfields, and similar nature-based places.\n\nThere are also several spinoff games in the series, which involve a variety of different gaming genres such as [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], puzzle, [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], a game based on motion-sensor technology. A number of these side games take advantage of Kirby's round, ball-like appearance.\n\n==History==\n{{VG timeline\n|\n| range1 = 1992 -\n| range1_color = #FFB6C1 #DB7093\n| 1992 = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'''''\n| 1993a = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'''''\n| 1993b = ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]''\n| 1994 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]''\n| 1995a = ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]''\n| 1995b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'''''\n| 1995c = ''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]''\n| 1996 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star]]'''''\n| 1997a =  ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]''\n| 1997b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'''''\n| 1998 = ''[[Kirby's Super Star Stacker]]''\n| 2000a = '''''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'''''\n| 2000b = ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]''\n| 2002 = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2003 = ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''\n| 2004 = '''''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'''''\n| 2005 = '''''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'''''\n| 2006 = '''''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'''''\n| 2008 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'''''\n| 2010 = '''''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2011a = '''''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'''''\n| 2011b = '''''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2012 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Collection]]''\n| 2014a = '''''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'''''\n| 2014b = ''[[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]]''\n| 2014c = ''[[Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe]]''\n| 2015 = '''''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'''''\n| 2016 = '''''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'''''\n| 2017a = ''[[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Kirby's Blowout Blast]]''\n| 2017c = ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]''\n| 2018b = '''''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'''''\n| 2019a =  '''''[[Kirby\u2019s Extra Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2019b = ''Super Kirby Clash''\n}}\n\n===1990s===\nThe first game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the original [[Game Boy]], was released in Japan in April 1992 and later in North America in August that year. A simple game, consisting of five levels, it introduced Kirby's ability to inhale enemies and objects. The game contains an unlockable hard mode, known as the \"Extra Game\", which features stronger enemies and more difficult bosses. The North American box art showed a white Kirby, although the Japanese box art had the correct pink coloring.\n\nThe second game, ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', was released in North America in May 1993. ''Kirby's Adventure'' gave Kirby the ability to gain special powers when he ate certain enemies, called Copy Abilities; the game contained a total of 25 different ones to use. These powers replaced Kirby's inhale and could be used until Kirby sustained damage causing him to drop the ability, or the player voluntarily discarded it to obtain another one. As one of the last games created for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''Kirby's Adventure'' featured advanced graphics and sound that pushed the hardware's capabilities to the limit, including pseudo 3D effects on some stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/adventure/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014|quote=It featured better than ever NES graphics, a big variety of tunes and extras galore to keep all ages glued to this classic game.}}</ref> It was re-released in 2002 on the [[Game Boy Advance]], retitled as ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', featuring updated graphics and sound, multiplayer support, and the ability to play as [[Meta Knight]].\n\nAfter ''Kirby's Adventure'', the ''Kirby'' series received a number of spin-off games. ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]'', released in November 1993, is a pinball game featuring Kirby as the pinball. ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'', released in North America in February 1995, is a [[golf]]-based game which features an isometric graphic design. ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', released in February 1995 in North America and Europe, is a puzzle game, a westernized version of the Japanese game ''[[Puyo Puyo]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', released in Japan and North America in March 1995, brought the Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure'' to a handheld system, but due to system limitations lowered the number of abilities to seven. The game introduced three rideable animal companions: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the ocean sunfish. Pairing up with any of these three alters how Kirby's abilities work. The game was to be remade for the [[Game Boy Color]] as ''Kirby's Dream Land 2 DX'', but was cancelled.\n\n''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]'', released in November 1995 in North America, is a [[Breakout clone|variation]] of the game ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', featuring multiple levels, some of Kirby's Copy Abilities, and various enemies in unique boss battles.\n\n''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', known as ''Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe'' in Japan and ''Kirby's Fun Pak'' in Europe, was released in North America in September 1996. ''Kirby Super Star'' is composed of eight separate games, and features several characters and abilities which have not appeared since in the series. The game features \"Helpers\", which can be created by sacrificing the ability in use, to help the player dispatch enemies.\n\nIn 1996, a ''Kirby'' mini-game series, {{nihongo foot|''Kirby's Toy Box'',|\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u7bb1|K\u0101b\u012b no Omocha Hako|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released via the [[St.GIGA]] satellite broadcasting system for the [[Satellaview]]. These mini-games were given a unique broadcast date. Mini-game titles included: ''Arrange Ball'', ''Ball Rally'', ''Baseball'', ''Cannonball'', ''Guru Guru Ball'', ''Hoshi Kuzushi'', ''Pachinko'', and ''Pinball''.<ref>Andou, N.

The game received a sequel on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1998 in Japan as ''[[Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', released in November 1997 in North America, is a direct sequel to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', as it featured the return of Kirby's animal friends. Similarly to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' features a few Copy Abilities which were modified when Kirby paired up with one of his six animal friends. The game had a multiplayer option with the second player controlling Gooey, a recurring character. The antagonist is Dark Matter, and if certain conditions are met, Zero was fought as the true final boss. The game had a unique pastel-drawing art style and used dithering to improve visual performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|title=Kirby's Dreamland 3 Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/01/06/kirbys-dream-land-3-review|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=January 6, 2009|quote=Kirby's Dream Collection 3 (...) employed an advanced-for-the-time dithering effect to enhance the visuals.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/dreamland3/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe first game to have 3D graphics in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', was released on the [[Nintendo 64]] in North America in June 2000. The game features a compound ability system that allows two of the seven abilities in the game to be merged, making a new compound ability. It also marked the first playable instance of King Dedede, where sections of some stages had Kirby riding piggyback while King Dedede attacked enemies and obstacles with his hammer. It is considered a direct follow-up to ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' due to the reemergence of Dark Matter and the final boss, albeit in a different form, called 0<sup>2</sup> (Zero Two). It also included three four-player minigames.\n\nThe next game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' became one of Nintendo's first motion-sensor-based games in August 2000. Players are instructed to tilt the Game Boy Color to move Kirby on the screen. Quickly flicking the Game Boy Color upwards would make Kirby jump into the air. ''Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble'' is the only ''Kirby'' game to have a special cartridge color (transparent pink) in North America.\n\nThe only ''Kirby'' game for the [[GameCube]], ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', was released in North America in October 2003. It is a racing game which deviates greatly from usual ''Kirby'' titles, although still featuring series staples including enemies and Copy Abilities.\n\nDuring the 2003 Holiday season, a Kirby [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-reader card]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] was released. The card was released under two names, ''Kirby Slide'' and ''Kirby Puzzle''. Swiping the card would allow for a sliding puzzle game starring Kirby to be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEC30bnj0cU|title=Kirby Puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Cards were given out at [[Toys \"R\" Us]] stores and in the 2003 December issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' and ''[[Tips & Tricks (magazine)|Tips & Tricks]]''. The game was released to advertise the English dub of ''[[Kirby: Right Back At Ya!]]''\n\n''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'' was released in October 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is the second game released on that system, following ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''. It features Kirby in a [[Metroidvania]] format, with all the levels being interconnected and able to be completed in any order. Also unique was the in-game phone, which can be used to summon up to three additional copies of Kirby to fight enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nThe next game in the series is ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'', released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan on March 24, 2005, North America on June 13, 2005, Europe on November 25, 2005, and Australia on April 6, 2006. Unlike most previous ''Kirby'' games, the player does not directly control Kirby with a [[D-pad|directional pad]], [[analog stick]], face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, Kirby is a helpless ball, and can only move when he gains momentum, the player painting paths with the stylus to direct his movement.\n\nThis was followed by ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'' in late 2006, also on the Nintendo DS, which revived traditional ''Kirby'' gameplay and dabbled in the use of the touch screen to store several items and Copy Abilities in Kirby's stomach. Ability scrolls could be found that served as upgrades for each ability, giving them additional moves and/or enhanced functionality. An unlockable Copy Ability was also introduced.\n\n''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', announced for the Nintendo DS in early fall 2007<ref>{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |date=October 11, 2007 |title=Second Hand Hands On from Japan |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/11/second-hand-hands-on-from-japan |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> and released on September 22, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/kirby-super-star-ultra/nds-14209932 |title=Kirby Super Star Ultra - Nintendo DS |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> in North America, is a remake of ''Kirby Super Star''. In addition to the nine games from ''Kirby Super Star'', seven new games have been added.

Players 2\u20134 could choose to play as Meta Knight, King Dedede and/or Waddle Dee, each with dedicated abilities; they could also play as different-colored Kirbys which offered power copying abilities, or as a mixture of the options.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2011/04/kirby_wii/index.html |title=\u4efb\u5929\u5802 E3 2011\u60c5\u5831 |publisher=Nintendo.co.jp |accessdate=2013-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403020246/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2011/04/kirby_wii/index.html |archivedate=2012-04-03 }}</ref>\n\nAn anthology disc for the Wii called ''[[Kirby's Dream Collection]]'' was released on July 19, 2012 in Japan and on September 16, 2012 in North America to celebrate Kirby's 20th Anniversary. It includes six games from the early history of the series, which are ''Kirby's Dream Land'', ''Kirby's Adventure'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', ''Kirby Super Star'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'', and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''. It also has new Challenge Stages that run on the engine of ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' (known in Europe and Australia as ''Kirby's Adventure Wii''), and a Kirby history section, which includes three episodes from ''Hoshi no Kirby'' (''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'' in North America).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5903945/kirby-anthology-coming-this-year-for-wii-says-nintendo |title=Kirby Anthology Coming This Year for Wii, Says Nintendo |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> Similarly to the Super Mario 25th Anniversary packaging in 2010, a booklet and a soundtrack containing music from the various games in the series are released alongside the disc.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, a new Kirby game for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] was announced, later named ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]''. The game was released in Japan on January 11, 2014, in North America on May 2, 2014, in Europe on May 16, 2014, and in Australasia on May 17, 2014. It incorporated action spanning varied depths, where Kirby could swap between the foreground and background areas. It included a multiplayer fighting mode called \"Kirby Fighters\", where players could choose one of ten available abilities and fight on themed stages, with the winner being the last Kirby standing. It also included a rhythm-based action game starring King Dedede. There were also over 250 in-game \"keychains\" to collect that featured sprites from previous Kirby games as well some original sprites based on characters from Triple Deluxe. In August 2014, Kirby Fighters Deluxe and Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe (enhanced versions of the mini-games in Kirby: Triple Deluxe) were released.\n\nAt E3 2014, a new game for the [[Wii U]] was announced. Titled ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'', the game is a direct sequel to ''Kirby: Canvas Curse'' and features a similar gameplay style. It was released by Nintendo on January 22, 2015 in Japan, February 20, 2015 in North America, May 8, 2015 in Europe and May 9, 2015 in Australasia.\n\nIn March 2016, during a Nintendo Direct, Nintendo unveiled a new game based on the context of ''Kirby: Triple Deluxe'' called ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''.

The third game was ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]'', an action-multiplayer fighting game which was released on November 3, 2017 in Europe and Australasia, November 30, 2017 in Japan, and January 19, 2018 in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/09/kirby_will_be_out_of_control_when_kirby_battle_royale_arrives_on_the_nintendo_3ds|title=Kirby Will Be Out Of Control When Kirby: Battle Royale Arrives On The Nintendo 3DS|website=Attack of The Fanboy|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt [[E3 2017]], Nintendo unveiled a new installment for the [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]], tentatively named as ''Kirby'', later given the title ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''. The game was released on March 16, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/kirby-star-allies-coming-to-nintendo-switch-early-next-year-460918.phtml|title=Kirby Will Be Out Of Control When Kirby: Battle Royale Arrives On The Nintendo 3DS|website=Destructoid|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref> Kirby can throw Friend Hearts to turn enemies into computer- or player-controlled allies, a variation of the \"Helper System\" from ''Kirby Super Star''. \"Power Combinations\" return from ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'' and ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. Kirby can also summon \"Dream Friends\", consisting of major Kirby characters acting as Helpers, which includes King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, [[Kirby's Dream Land 2|Rick, Kine, & Coo]], [[Kirby Super Star|Marx]], [[Kirby's Dream Land 3|Gooey]], [[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards|Adeleine & Ribbon]], [[Kirby & The Amazing Mirror|Dark Meta Knight]], [[Kirby: Squeak Squad|Daroach]], [[Kirby's Return to Dream Land|Magolor]], [[Kirby: Triple Deluxe|Taranza]], [[Kirby: Planet Robobot|Susie]], and The Three Mage-Sisters ([[Kirby Star Allies|Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne]]).\n\nIn September 2019, Nintendo released a new Switch game titled ''Super Kirby Clash'' on the [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/super_kirby_clash_is_a_new_free-to-start_game_launching_on_switch_today|title=Super Kirby Clash Is A New Free-To-Start Game Launching On Switch Today|website=Nintendo Life|accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional universe==\nThe setting of the games is Dream Land,{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|\u30d7\u30d7\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9|Pupupurando||lit. Pupupu Land}}}} a country on Planet Popstar. Popstar resembles a [[five-pointed star]] encircled by two diagonal [[Ring system|rings]].\n\nWhile most of Kirby's adventures take place on Popstar, his journeys occasionally take place on an interplanetary scale; such as in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', ''Milky Way Wishes'' from ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n==Nature of the protagonist==\n{{main|Kirby (character)}}\nKirby is a small, pink, spherical alien with red feet, stubby flap-like arms and pink cheek-blushes. He is referred to as male in the animated series, and described as a young boy in the instruction manual for ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch his mouth to inhale foes or inflate himself with air and float. According to ''Super Smash Bros.'' instruction manual, he is 8 inches tall; this is contradicted in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', the former of which shows Kirby to be at about [[knee]] height compared to [[Samus Aran]] and the latter of which showing him to be a few inches shorter than the human girl Adeleine.\n\nKirby hails from the country of Dream Land on Planet Popstar, where he lives in a domed house. His appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\nKirby does not commonly speak, mainly limited to grunts, shouts, and monosyllables in such games as ''Super Smash Bros'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''. However he does speak in the stories written in some games' instruction manuals. He rarely speaks in-game, the only exception being ''Kirby's Avalanche''. He narrates the functions of Copy Abilities on the start menu in ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. Most in-game talking Kirby does is in ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]'', where Kirby explains the game's rules and gameplay. Kirby has dialogue in ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'', but it is all spoken through the game's narrator.\n\n==Other media==\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nThe ''Kirby'' series was made into an [[anime]] on October 6, 2001, originally titled ''Hoshi no Kaabii''. It was produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and HAL Laboratory, Inc. It was licensed in North America by [[4Kids Entertainment]], under the title ''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!'', on [[4Kids TV]], and was distributed by [[4Kids Entertainment]] in North America and [[Nelvana Limited]] in Canada, with VHS and DVD distributions in North America by [[FUNimation Entertainment]] and DVD distributions in Australia by [[Magna Pacific]]. It ended in Japan in 2003 with 100 episodes.\n\nThe show is about the adventures Kirby has with his friends Tiff and Tuff after he crash lands in Dream Land, on Pop Star. Here, he is a legendary Star Warrior destined to save the universe from the intergalactic conqueror known as Nightmare. However, because he was awakened 200 years too early he arrived in a childlike state and his powers haven't fully developed. The ruler of Dream Land, [[King Dedede]], is jealous of the attention Kirby receives from its inhabitants and frequently orders monsters from Nightmare's company, [[Nightmare Enterprises]], in an attempt to do away with Kirby. [[Nightmare Enterprises]] at first appears to be an intergalactic delivery company, but is really a front for Nightmare's intergalactic conquest that dupes unsuspecting customers into funding Nightmare's armies. Not yet ready to achieve his destiny, Kirby must learn how to use his incredible abilities with the help of his friends, and sometimes with the help of the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], who while he claims to be loyal to King Dedede, will often work behind the scenes in order to aid Kirby or train him in the use of his abilities.\n\nThe show is based on the game series, but rather than being a direct adaptation of any of the games it uses characters and concepts from the games (especially ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'') to tell its own story.\n\n===Comics and manga===\nKirby stars in several [[manga]] series, none of which have been released outside of Japan yet. The longest running series is ''Kirby of the Stars'' (a rough English translation of ''Hoshi no Kirby''), written by Hirokazu Hikawa. This series was announced for a release in America by VIZ Media, but was never actually released.\n\nOther ''Kirby'' manga are typically one-shot comedy [[4koma]] based on the games, and have multiple artists. They have recurring themes and [[running gag]]s.\n\nKirby also appears in several German comics, featuring him as a detective and King Dedede as his friend. His animal friends appear as pets of a female Kirby look-alike with red glass slippers. In one comic, he meets Lolo, Lala, and Lulu, the protagonists of the ''[[Adventures of Lolo]]'' series. The German comics were meant to let German ''Kirby'' fans know of ''Kirby'' games which would be released there.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Cancelled games===\nIn the lifetime of the ''Kirby'' series, several video games have been in development that, for various reasons, were ultimately abandoned. Such titles include ''Kirby's Air Ride 64'' (also known as ''Kirby Bowl 64'' and ''Kirby Ball 64'') on the Nintendo 64,<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Kirby Ball 64 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|page=79}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Kirby Bowl 64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=90 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1996|page=23}}</ref> which was eventually released on the GameCube as ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''.\n\n''Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble 2'' on the GameCube, which was supposed to use a combination of motion-sensor technology and connectivity to the Game Boy Advance via the [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable]].<ref>The game was presented during the Nintendo Space World 2001</ref>\n\nThere was also a planned game called ''Kid Kirby'' that was to be released on the Super Nintendo.<ref>''Other Stuff: Nintendo News''. [[DieHard GameFan]]. Volume 3. Issue 6. Number 30. Pg.129. June 1995.</ref> The game would have served as a prequel to the series and would have utilized the SNES mouse. The game was cancelled due to the declining sales of the mouse; however, early screenshots of the cancelled game have been posted online. This unreleased game was developed by [[DMA Design]] for Nintendo and was scheduled for 1995.\n\nThough resurfaced as ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', the GameCube was initially going to have its own original Kirby game, simply titled ''Kirby Adventure'' at the time. It was nearly complete and featured at E3 2005, but was cancelled due to troubles incorporating a unique multiplayer mechanic, which became the special attack in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' (where all players stack on each other, hold A and release at the same time). Most of ''Kirby Adventure'' was scrapped in the game it became to be, such as the helper system that was featured in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' which made a return in the GameCube version of the game before cancellation, as well as having faster-paced gameplay similar to ''Kirby Super Star''. Such concepts would be revitalized in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Kirby'' in other video games===\n[[File:Kirby Characters in Smash.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Meta Knight]], [[King Dedede]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]  in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'']]\nKirby appears as a character in Nintendo's crossover [[fighting game]] series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' (also developed by series creator Masahiro Sakurai), appearing in all installments of the franchise. Starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' onwards, he's joined by [[Meta Knight]] and [[King Dedede]]. Many items from the Kirby series also appear in ''Super Smash Bros'' such as the Maxim Tomato (all games), Warp Star (since ''Melee''), Dragoon (since ''Brawl'') and Star Rod (all games) as items, and Knuckle Joe (''Brawl'' and ''3DS/Wii U''), Nightmare (''3DS/Wii U'') and Chef Kawasaki (''Ultimate'') appear as characters summoned by the Assist Trophy. All playable Kirby characters in ''Smash Bros.'' have the ability to jump more than twice. Kirby has also made cameo appearances in other games as well, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and ''[[Stunt Race FX]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nThe ''Kirby'' games have received reception that ranges from mixed to very favourable reviews by players and critics. ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'' is the most acclaimed game in the series, while ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]'' is the lowest-rated.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Aggregate review scores<br />''As of March 2018''\n!Game\n![[Metacritic]]<ref name=\"metacritic-kirby\">{{cite web|title=Kirby Search Results|url=http://www.metacritic.com/search/all/Kirby/results|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n![[GameRankings]]<!-- All rating percentages are estimated --><ref>{{cite web|title=Kirby Search Results - Reviews and News Articles|url=https://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html?search=kirby&numrev=3&site=|website=GameRankings|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Dream Land''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 62%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Adventure''{{efn|Scores calculated from the ''3D Classics'' re-release.}}\n| 77/100 (Game Boy Advance remake)\n| 78% (NES)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Pinball Land''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 70%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Dream Course''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 77%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Avalanche''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 74%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Dream Land 2''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 82%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Block Ball''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 73%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Super Star''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 86%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Star Stacker''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 73%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Dream Land 3''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 66%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''\n| 77/100\n| 74%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble''\n| {{N/A}}\n| 83%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''\n| 81/100\n| 80%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Air Ride''\n| 61/100\n| 66%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror''\n| 80/100\n| 78%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby: Canvas Curse''\n| 86/100\n| 87%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''\n| 71/100\n| 72%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Super Star Ultra''\n| 76/100\n| 80%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Epic Yarn''\n| 86/100\n| 88%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Mass Attack''\n| 83/100\n| 84%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land''\n| 77/100\n| 81%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Dream Collection''\n| 82/100\n| 81%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby: Triple Deluxe''\n| 80/100\n| 81%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Fighters Deluxe''\n| 66/100\n| 65%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe''\n| 65/100<ref name=\"metacritic-dedede-3ds\">{{cite web|title=Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/dededes-drum-dash-deluxe|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n| 63%<ref name=\"gamerankings-dedede-3ds\">{{cite web|title=Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe for 3DS|url=https://www.gamerankings.com/3ds/816317-dededes-drum-dash-deluxe/index.html|website=GameRankings|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby and the Rainbow Curse''\n| 73/100\n| 75%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby: Planet Robobot''\n| 81/100\n| 84%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Team Kirby Clash Deluxe''\n| {{N/A}}\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby's Blowout Blast''\n| 69/100\n| 71%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Battle Royale''\n| 57/100\n| 58%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | ''Kirby Star Allies''\n| 73/100\n| 73%\n|}\n\nThe Kirby manga has over 10 million copies in print.<ref>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/10/26-1/corocoro-comics-kirby-manga-series-reaches-milestone-of-10-million-copies</ref>\n\n===Sales===\nMany ''Kirby'' games have performed commercially well, selling at least one million or more copies worldwide.

Even prior to learning he was the Avatar, Aang distinguished himself by becoming one of the youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique. As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples.<ref name=\"The Storm\">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref><ref name=\"The Southern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|airdate=2005-02-25|season=1|number=3|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan, Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among [[iceberg]]s, where he remained suspended for a century.

While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered [[middle age]] in his 50s, the strain of this exertion increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into [[Korra]] of the Southern Water Tribe. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist [[Zaheer]]) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.\n\n====Book One: Air====\n[[File:Legend of Korra Aang.png|thumb|Avatar Aang's spirit with [[Korra]] in ''The Legend of Korra''.]]\nIn the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, [[Amon (The Legend of Korra)|Amon]] and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.\n\n====Book Two: Spirits====\nThe sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her.

The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style; each of these styles philosophies and set movements corresponds to a specific \"bending arts\".<ref name=\"Kisu\">{{cite web | title=Kisu - Filmography by TV Series | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457467/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_msc_1#tt0417299 |publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\nThe creators made bending a natural extension of consistent limitations and rules of the world. Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending. The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies. The Water Tribes were a naval superpower: their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates. Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation. The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master [[metallurgy]] with their bending or fire and lightning.\n\nAt the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend them with ease since he was a young child. Through the teaching Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom. Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favor's airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his [[pacifism]] principles.\n\n*'''Airbending''': the martial art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a ''Southern Temple Style'' based on an \"[[Neijia|internal]]\" [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] called [[Baguazhang]]. Aang is the only person in [[living memory]] to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, [[Tenzin]], who with the aid of [[Korra]], would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Due to the genocide of his people, all other \"styles of airbending arts\" have been forever lost to history. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders.<ref name=\"NickAv\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/| title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site| accessdate = 2006-12-02| publisher = Nick.com}}</ref> Airbending represents the element of freedom,<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\">Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director).

Airbending involves \"smooth coiling and uncoiling actions\"; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the \"intangibility and explosive power of wind\". These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow\u2014allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury\u2014a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people. Airbending lacks \"finishing moves\" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents.\n*'''Waterbending''': the martial art Katara teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[Chinese martial arts]] techniques of \"[[Neijia|internal style]]\" [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Jeet Kune Do]]. When Aang traveled north, he learned ''Northern Tribe Yin-style''. During the [[Legend of Korra]], Katara is the only Master of \"[[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Southern Tribe Yang-style]]\", forced to reconstruct the style from surviving manuscripts; all other masters were killed, their collective knowledge [[Book burning|confiscated or destroyed]] by the Fire Nation.<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Water, page 31 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\">http://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=1038</ref><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|airdate=April 7, 2006|season=2|number=3|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep23}}</ref> Waterbending represents the element of change - a shapeshifter constantly changing forms -<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\"/> and is categorized as the most adaptive or pliable of the \"four bending arts\".

Despite these advantages, Waterbending is almost entirely dependent on inertia; it is essential for practitioners to not be rigid, but to be fluid and able to adapt to any situation.\n*'''Earthbending''': the martial art Toph teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Hung Ga|H\u00f3ng Qu\u00e1n]] and [[Southern Praying Mantis|Chu Gar N\u00e1n P\u00e0i T\u00e1ngl\u00e1ng]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully). Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n*'''Firebending''': the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Changquan]], [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolinquan]], [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu|L\u00f3ng X\u00edng M\u00f3 Qi\u00e1o]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\"/><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles \"regressed\" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered ''Dancing Dragon Style'' from the last surviving dragons.\n*'''Energybending''': Aang learned energybending from his desire not to kill. He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n===The Avatar State===\n[[File:Avatar reincarnations.png|thumb|right|alt=The Avatars standing in line, including Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen, in that order.|The Avatars (from right to left): Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen, and other previous Avatars.]]\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.\n\nHis most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout that of his predecessors. In addition, he also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on. The form is activated by Aang being in a predicament that he will either not be able to combat with his current skills or when his life is in mortal danger. While speaking in the Avatar State, Aang's voice becomes in-sync with that of Raava's as a testament to their connection. His weaknesses in the state is that he is vulnerable, and if killed, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated.\n\n==Critical reception==\nAang was received exceptionally by critics and fans.

As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples.<ref name=\"The Storm\">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref><ref name=\"The Southern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|airdate=2005-02-25|season=1|number=3|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan, Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among [[iceberg]]s, where he remained suspended for a century.

Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into [[Korra]] of the Southern Water Tribe. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist [[Zaheer]]) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.\n\n====Book One: Air====\n[[File:Legend of Korra Aang.png|thumb|Avatar Aang's spirit with [[Korra]] in ''The Legend of Korra''.]]\nIn the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, [[Amon (The Legend of Korra)|Amon]] and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.\n\n====Book Two: Spirits====\nThe sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her. Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.\n\n====Book Three: Change====\nWhen Zaheer gave an ultimatum: Surrender to him or lose the new airbenders, Korra mediated into the spirit realm, she expressed her wish to call upon Aang's spirit and ask his advice in saving the new Air Nomads. Iroh's spirit assured her that, even though Aang was no longer able to guide her, she could ask one of Aang's closest friends: [[Zuko|Lord Zuko]].\n\n===Appearances in other media===\n====Games====\nAang's character appeared in the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game]]'' on a multitude of cards.<ref name=\"Trading Cards\"/><ref name=\"Trading Cards 2\"/> He appeared in the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)|''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' video game]] as one of the four [[Player character|playable characters]].<ref name=\"AvatarVideoGame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|title=Avatar: The Last Airbender Video Game|accessdate=2008-03-22|work=Nick.com|publisher=Nickelodeon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206045806/http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|archive-date=2013-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two sequels were made: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Burning Earth]]'',<ref name=\"The Burning Earth\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|title=IGN.com: Avatar: The Burning Earth|accessdate=2008-03-13|publisher=IGN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925154305/http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|archive-date=2008-09-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 Into the Inferno]]''.\n\nAang also appeared in ''Escape from the Spirit World'', an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon's official website.

Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending. The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies. The Water Tribes were a naval superpower: their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates. Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation. The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master [[metallurgy]] with their bending or fire and lightning.\n\nAt the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend them with ease since he was a young child. Through the teaching Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom. Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favor's airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his [[pacifism]] principles.\n\n*'''Airbending''': the martial art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a ''Southern Temple Style'' based on an \"[[Neijia|internal]]\" [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] called [[Baguazhang]]. Aang is the only person in [[living memory]] to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, [[Tenzin]], who with the aid of [[Korra]], would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Due to the genocide of his people, all other \"styles of airbending arts\" have been forever lost to history. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders.<ref name=\"NickAv\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/| title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site| accessdate = 2006-12-02| publisher = Nick.com}}</ref> Airbending represents the element of freedom,<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\">Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director).

Airbending involves \"smooth coiling and uncoiling actions\"; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the \"intangibility and explosive power of wind\". These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow\u2014allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury\u2014a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people. Airbending lacks \"finishing moves\" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents.\n*'''Waterbending''': the martial art Katara teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[Chinese martial arts]] techniques of \"[[Neijia|internal style]]\" [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Jeet Kune Do]]. When Aang traveled north, he learned ''Northern Tribe Yin-style''.

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully). Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n*'''Firebending''': the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Changquan]], [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolinquan]], [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu|L\u00f3ng X\u00edng M\u00f3 Qi\u00e1o]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\"/><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles \"regressed\" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered ''Dancing Dragon Style'' from the last surviving dragons.\n*'''Energybending''': Aang learned energybending from his desire not to kill. He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n===The Avatar State===\n[[File:Avatar reincarnations.png|thumb|right|alt=The Avatars standing in line, including Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen, in that order.|The Avatars (from right to left): Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen, and other previous Avatars.]]\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.\n\nHis most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout that of his predecessors.
