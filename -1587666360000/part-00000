The '''1st Durham EV''' was raised and commanded by [[Sir Charles Palmer, 1st Baronet|Charles Palmer]] (1822\u20131907), founder of [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]] and later the first mayor and [[Member of Parliament]] for Jarrow.<ref>Burke.</ref> The 1st Durham initially comprised six companies and Palmer was commissioned as [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Commandant.<ref>Beckett, Appendix IX</ref><ref name = List68>''Official Army List'' 1868\u201388.</ref><ref name = Westlake>Westlake, p. 7.</ref><ref name=DurhamFort>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123125804/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/du-fort.htm Durham Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org]</ref>\n\nBy 1874 the 1st Durham EV (now 8 companies strong) and the 1st Newcastle EV (1 company) were united into the 1st Durham Administrative Battalion EV, consolidated in 1880 as the '''1st Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham EV''', with Palmer as commanding officer and an establishment of 1300 men.<ref name = List68/><ref name = Westlake/><ref name = DurhamFort/><ref>Short ''et al.'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1885, the Inspector-General of Fortifications, [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke]], sent a detachment of Volunteers to the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Suakin Expedition|Suakin]] to assist the Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) in railway construction for the British force engaged there.

At first they were employed on constructing field defences, erecting hutted camps, ''etc''. By the summer of 1915 there were three strong lines of entrenchments, bomb-proof shelters and dug-outs linking strongpoints and gun positions along the coast as well as the fixed defences at Tynemouth and Hartlepool. In August 1916 the Durham Fortress Engineers overcame shifting sand dunes to construct Link House Battery to defend [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth Harbour]].<ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 44, 52, 56.</ref>\n\nAlthough the coastal towns of NE England were bombarded by the German Navy on 16 December 1914 ([[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]]) and by [[Zeppelin]]s in January and June 1915, it became clear that a fullscale German invasion of Britain was unlikely, while the armies in the field required large numbers of engineers. The Fortress Engineer units therefore began organising field companies for overseas service.<ref name = W&R62>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 62, 69.</ref>\n\nThe Durham Fortress Engineers found three field companies, while the remainder of the unit continued to be employed around the Tyne Garrison.

First founded in 1868 it was sometimes united with the [[Tyne Electrical Engineers]], at other times it formed an independent unit. Although its main role was defence of the North East Coast of England, the unit sent detachments on active service to the [[Suakin Expedition]], the [[Second Boer War]], and the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]] during the [[World War I|First World War]].\n\n==Volunteer Force==\nIn 1868 a new unit of Engineer Volunteers (EV) was formed at [[Jarrow]] on the [[County Durham]] bank of the [[River Tyne]]. The '''1st Durham EV''' was raised and commanded by [[Sir Charles Palmer, 1st Baronet|Charles Palmer]] (1822\u20131907), founder of [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]] and later the first mayor and [[Member of Parliament]] for Jarrow.<ref>Burke.</ref> The 1st Durham initially comprised six companies and Palmer was commissioned as [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Commandant.<ref>Beckett, Appendix IX</ref><ref name = List68>''Official Army List'' 1868\u201388.</ref><ref name = Westlake>Westlake, p. 7.</ref><ref name=DurhamFort>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123125804/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/du-fort.htm Durham Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org]</ref>\n\nBy 1874 the 1st Durham EV (now 8 companies strong) and the 1st Newcastle EV (1 company) were united into the 1st Durham Administrative Battalion EV, consolidated in 1880 as the '''1st Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham EV''', with Palmer as commanding officer and an establishment of 1300 men.<ref name = List68/><ref name = Westlake/><ref name = DurhamFort/><ref>Short ''et al.'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1885, the Inspector-General of Fortifications, [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer)|Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke]], sent a detachment of Volunteers to the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Suakin Expedition|Suakin]] to assist the Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) in railway construction for the British force engaged there.

At first they were employed on constructing field defences, erecting hutted camps, ''etc''. By the summer of 1915 there were three strong lines of entrenchments, bomb-proof shelters and dug-outs linking strongpoints and gun positions along the coast as well as the fixed defences at Tynemouth and Hartlepool. In August 1916 the Durham Fortress Engineers overcame shifting sand dunes to construct Link House Battery to defend [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth Harbour]].<ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 44, 52, 56.</ref>\n\nAlthough the coastal towns of NE England were bombarded by the German Navy on 16 December 1914 ([[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]]) and by [[Zeppelin]]s in January and June 1915, it became clear that a fullscale German invasion of Britain was unlikely, while the armies in the field required large numbers of engineers. The Fortress Engineer units therefore began organising field companies for overseas service.<ref name = W&R62>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 62, 69.</ref>\n\nThe Durham Fortress Engineers found three field companies, while the remainder of the unit continued to be employed around the Tyne Garrison. These companies were numbered 1st to 3rd (or formally 1/1st to 1/3rd, since they were composed of '1st-Line' Territorials who had volunteered for overseas service) and went to France in September 1915.<ref name = Trail/><ref name = W&R62/><ref name = Forum1>{{Cite web |url=http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=29199 |title=1st Durham Field Company at Great War Forum |access-date=2015-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071601/http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=29199 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A 530th (Durham) Reserve Field Company was also formed, from 2nd or even 3rd Line Territorials.
