Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits (a luxury good that reflects and signals a certain social standing) outside the capitals was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the [[Hudson River Valley]]. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \"likenesses\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n \nPhillips may actually have learned some of his skills from the portraits by John Vanderlyn he saw hanging in the homes of his wealthy patrons. Some aspects of Phillips' works are reminiscent of Vanderlyn's.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall.

New York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2012. P. 36.</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery of the Artist and Reconstruction of his Body of Work==\n\nPhillips' modern rediscovery began in 1924, when a group of portraits of women, shown leaning forward in three-quarter view and wearing dark dresses, were displayed in an antique show in [[Kent, Connecticut]]. The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved June 2, 2014.</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1958 that Ammi Phillips' identity as the painter of both groups of portraits was established by Barbara and Larry Holdridge, and endorsed by Mary Black, writing on May 21, 1959, to three fellow folk-art historians, \"You are the ones who should be the first to know that I have joined the opposition [i.e., the Holdridges] and now believe that the Border Limner, Ammi Phillips, A. Phillips, and the Kent Limner are one and the same person.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Additional works were identified, showing the artist's transition from the delicate coloration of the Border period to the bold and dramatic works that followed.

Later he glossed over problems with anatomy by using flat dark-colored backgrounds and dark dresses and suits\".<ref name=\"Black1976\"/> Phillips' work influenced the style of his younger contemporary, [[Erastus Salisbury Field]], who worked as an itinerant portrait painter in the region just east of Phillips.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nThe Museum of American Folk Art showed its first major exhibition devoted to the work of a single folk portraitist to \"Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter 1788\u20131865,\" on exhibit from October 16 to December 2, 1968.

This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n \nPhillips may actually have learned some of his skills from the portraits by John Vanderlyn he saw hanging in the homes of his wealthy patrons. Some aspects of Phillips' works are reminiscent of Vanderlyn's.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall. He was buried in Amenia, New York, where he had lived earlier in his life.\n\n==''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog''==\n[[File:Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ammi Phillips, ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', 1830-1835]]The artist's most famous work is ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', which is in the collection of the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in New York.

The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online.

That is, it is a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some [[integer]] {{math|''n''}}.  They are named after [[Marin Mersenne]], a French [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], who studied them in the early 17th century.\n\nThe [[exponentiation|exponents]] {{math|''n''}} which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31,&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000043}} and the resulting Mersenne primes are [[3 (number)|3]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[127 (number)|127]], 8191, 131071, 524287, [[2147483647]],&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000668}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n''}} is a [[composite number]] then so is {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}}. ({{math|2<sup>''ab''</sup> \u2212 1}} is divisible by both {{math|2<sup>''a''</sup> \u2212 1}} and {{math|2<sup>''b''</sup> \u2212 1}}.) This definition is therefore equivalent to the definition as a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some prime {{math|''p''}}.\n\nMore generally, numbers of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} without the primality requirement may be called '''Mersenne numbers'''.  Sometimes, however, Mersenne numbers are defined to have the additional requirement that {{math|''n''}} be prime.\nThe smallest composite Mersenne number with prime exponent ''n'' is {{nowrap|2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their [[#Perfect numbers|connection to perfect numbers]].\n\n{{As of|2020|2|url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=4}}, 51 Mersenne primes are known.

It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The [[Lenstra\u2013Pomerance\u2013Wagstaff conjecture]] asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their [[asymptotic analysis|order of growth]]. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are [[composite number|composite]], although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of [[Sophie Germain prime]]s [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 3 ([[Modular arithmetic|mod 4]]). For these primes {{mvar|p}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} (which is also prime) will divide {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}, for example, {{math|23&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>11</sub>}}, {{math|47&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>23</sub>}}, {{math|167&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>83</sub>}}, {{math|263&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>131</sub>}}, {{math|359&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>179</sub>}}, {{math|383&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>191</sub>}}, {{math|479&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>239</sub>}}, and {{math|503&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>251</sub>}} {{OEIS|id=A002515}}. Since for these primes {{math|''p''}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} is congruent to 7 mod 8, so 2 is a [[quadratic residue]] mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}}, and the [[multiplicative order]] of 2 mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}} must divide <math>\\frac{(2p+1)-1}{2}</math> = {{mvar|p}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is a prime, it must be {{mvar|p}} or 1. However, it cannot be 1 since <math>\\Phi_1(2)=1</math> and 1 has no [[prime factor]]s, so it must be {{mvar|p}}. Hence, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides <math>\\Phi_p(2)=2^p-1</math> and <math>2^p-1=M_p</math> cannot be prime.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes are {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 3}}, {{math|''M''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} 7}}, {{math|''M''<sub>5</sub> {{=}} 31}} and {{math|''M''<sub>7</sub> {{=}} 127}} and because the first Mersenne prime starts at {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub>}}, all Mersenne primes are congruent to 3 (mod 4). Other than {{math|''M''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''M''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 1}}, all other Mersenne numbers are also congruent to 3 (mod 4). Consequently, in the [[prime factorization]] of a Mersenne number (&nbsp;{{math|&ge;&nbsp;''M''<sub>2</sub>}}&nbsp;) there must be at least one prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4).\n\nA basic [[theorem]] about Mersenne numbers states that if {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime, then the exponent {{math|''p''}} must also be prime. This follows from the identity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}2^{ab}-1&=(2^a-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\\right)\\\\&=(2^b-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\\right). \\end{align}</math>\nThis rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as {{math|''M''<sub>4</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>4</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 15 {{=}} 3 \u00d7 5 {{=}} (2<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1) \u00d7 (1 + 2<sup>2</sup>)}}.\n\nThough the above examples might suggest that {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for all primes {{mvar|p}}, this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number\n\n: {{math|''M''<sub>11</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected odd integer of similar size.<ref name=\"Wagstaff\" /> Nonetheless, prime values of {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} appear to grow increasingly sparse as {{mvar|p}} increases. For example, eight of the first 11 primes {{mvar|p}} give rise to a Mersenne prime {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} (the correct terms on Mersenne's original list), while {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for only 43 of the first two million prime numbers (up to 32,452,843).\n\nThe lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]] (LLT) is an efficient [[primality test]] that greatly aids this task, making it much easier to test the primality of Mersenne numbers than that of most other numbers of the same size. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a [[cult following]]. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using [[distributed computing]].\n\nArithmetic modulo a Mersenne number is particularly efficient on a [[Binary number|binary computer]], making them popular choices when a prime modulus is desired, such as the [[Park\u2013Miller random number generator]].  To find a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] of Mersenne number order requires knowing the factorization of that number, so Mersenne primes allow one to find to primitive polynomials of very high order.  Such [[primitive polynomial (field theory)#Primitive trinomials|primitive trinomials]] are used in [[pseudorandom number generator]]s with very large periods such as the [[Mersenne twister]], generalized shift register and [[Lagged Fibonacci generator]]s.\n\n==Perfect numbers==\n{{main|Euclid\u2013Euler theorem}}\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their connection with [[perfect number]]s. In the 4th century BC, [[Euclid]] proved that if {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime, then {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>(2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as {{math|{{sfrac|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>(''M<sub>p</sub>'' + 1)|2}}}}, is the {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}th [[triangular number]] and the {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}th [[hexagonal number]].

The exponents listed by Mersenne were as follows:\n\n::2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.\n\nHis list replicated the known primes of his time with exponents up to 19. His next entry, 31, was correct, but the list then became largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>257</sub>}} (which are composite) and omitted {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}}, and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}} (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.<ref>The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=MersennesConjecture Mersenne's conjecture].</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9douard Lucas]] proved in 1876 that {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}} is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.  {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} was determined to be prime in 1883 by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]], though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by [[Frank Nelson Cole]] in 1903.<ref>{{citation|last=Cole|first= F. N.\n|title=On the factoring of large numbers|jfm= 34.0216.04|journal=Bull. Amer. Math.

The fifth, {{math|''M''<sub>13</sub> {{=}} 8191}}, was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ({{math|''M''<sub>17</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>19</sub>}}) were found by [[Pietro Cataldi]] in 1588. After nearly two centuries, {{math|''M''<sub>31</sub>}} was verified to be prime by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}}, found by [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] in 1876, then {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]] in 1883. Two more ({{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}}) were found early in the 20th century, by [[R. E. Powers]] in 1911 and 1914, respectively.\n\nThe best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]]. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime {{math|''p'' > 2}}, {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime [[if and only if]] {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}} divides {{math|''S''<sub>''p'' \u2212 2</sub>}}, where {{math|''S''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 4}} and {{math|''S<sub>k</sub>'' {{=}} (''S''<sub>''k'' \u2212 1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} for {{math|''k'' > 0}}.\n\nDuring the era of manual calculation, all the exponents up to and including 257 were tested with the Lucas\u2013Lehmer test and found to be composite. A notable contribution was made by retired Yale physics professor Horace Scudder Uhler, who did the calculations for exponents 157, 167, 193, 199, 227, and 229.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Scripta Mathematica |volume= 18 |year=1952 |pp=122\u2013131 |title=A Brief History of the Investigations on Mersenne Numbers and the Latest Immense Primes |author=Horace S.

[[Alan Turing]] searched for them on the [[Manchester Mark 1]] in 1949,<ref>Brian Napper, [http://www.computer50.org/mark1/maths.html The Mathematics Department and the Mark 1].</ref> but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, {{math|''M''<sub>521</sub>}}, by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]] [[SWAC (computer)|Western Automatic Computer (SWAC)]] at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], under the direction of [[Derrick Henry Lehmer|Lehmer]], with a computer search program written and run by Prof. [[Raphael M. Robinson|R. M. Robinson]]. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, {{math|''M''<sub>607</sub>}}, was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more&nbsp;\u2014 {{math|''M''<sub>1279</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>2203</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>2281</sub>}}&nbsp;\u2014 were found by the same program in the next several months. {{math|''M''<sub>4253</sub>}} is the first Mersenne prime that is [[titanic prime|titanic]], {{math|''M''<sub>44,497</sub>}} is the first [[gigantic prime|gigantic]], and {{math|''M''<sub>6,972,593</sub>}} was the first [[megaprime]] to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.<ref>The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Megaprime The Prime Glossary: megaprime].</ref> All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size.

The prize, finally confirmed in October 2009, is for the first known prime with at least 10 million digits.  The prime was found on a [[Dell OptiPlex]] 745 on August 23, 2008.

Supposing latter true, then {{math|2<sup>''p''+1</sup> {{=}} (2<sup>{{sfrac|1|2}}(''p'' + 1)</sup>)<sup>2</sup> \u2261 \u22122 (mod ''q'')}}, so \u22122 would be a quadratic residue mod {{mvar|q}}. However, since {{mvar|p}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, {{mvar|q}} is congruent to {{nowrap|7 (mod 8)}} and therefore 2 is a quadratic residue mod {{mvar|q}}. Also since {{mvar|q}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, \u22121 is a quadratic nonresidue mod {{mvar|q}}, so \u22122 is the product of a residue and a nonresidue and hence it is a nonresidue, which is a contradiction. Hence, the former congruence must be true and {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}.\n# All composite divisors of prime-exponent Mersenne numbers are [[strong pseudoprime]]s to the base 2.\n# With the exception of 1, a Mersenne number cannot be a perfect power. In other words, and in accordance with [[Catalan's conjecture|Mih\u0103ilescu's theorem]], the equation {{math|2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} ''n<sup>k</sup>''}} has no solutions where {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}, and {{mvar|k}} are integers with {{math|''m'' > 1}} and {{math|''k'' > 1}}.\n\n==List of known Mersenne primes==\nThe table below lists all known Mersenne primes (sequence {{OEIS link|id=A000043}} ({{math|''p''}}) and {{OEIS link|id=A000668}} ({{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}) in [[OEIS]]):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n! {{math|''p''}}\n! {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}\n! {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}} digits\n!

In the [[Rhind papyrus]] (1650 BC) the Egyptian fraction expansions have fairly different forms for primes and composites, so it may be argued that they knew about prime numbers. \"The Egyptians used ($) in the table above for the first primes {{math|''r''}} = 3, 5, 7, or 11 (also for {{math|''r''}} = 23). Here is another intriguing observation: That the Egyptians stopped the use of ($) at 11 suggests they understood (at least some parts of) Eratosthenes's Sieve 2000 years before Eratosthenes 'discovered' it.\" [http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptroll2-n.html The Rhind 2/{{math|''n''}} Table] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].\n\nIn the school of [[Pythagoras]] (b. about 570 \u2013 d. about 495 BC) and the [[Pythagoreans]], we find the first sure observations of prime numbers. Hence the first two Mersenne primes, 3 and 7, were known to and may even be said to have been discovered by them. There is no reference, though, to their special form 2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and 2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 as such.\n\nThe sources to the knowledge of prime numbers among the Pythagoreans are late. The Neoplatonic philosopher [[Iamblichus]], AD c. 245\u2013c. 325, states that the Greek Platonic philosopher [[Speusippus]], c. 408 \u2013 339/8 BC, wrote a book named ''On Pythagorean Numbers''. According to Iamblichus this book was based on the works of the Pythagorean [[Philolaus]], c. 470\u2013c. 385 BC, who lived a century after [[Pythagoras]], 570 \u2013 c. 495 BC. In his ''Theology of Arithmetic'' in the chapter ''On the Decad'', Iamblichus writes: \"Speusippus, the son of Plato's sister Potone, and head of the Academy before Xenocrates, compiled a polished little book from the Pythagorean writings which were particularly valued at any time, and especially from the writings of Philolaus; he entitled the book ''On Pythagorean Numbers''. In the first half of the book, he elegantly expounds linear numbers [that is, prime numbers], polygonal numbers and all sorts of plane numbers, solid numbers and the five figures which are assigned to the elements of the universe, discussing both their individual attributes and their shared features, and their proportionality and reciprocity.\" [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38568451/Theologoumena-Arithmeticae#page=112 ''Iamblichus'' The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 112f.] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].\n\n[[Iamblichus]] also gives us a direct quote from [[Speusippus]]' book where [[Speusippus]] among other things writes: \"Secondly, it is necessary for a perfect number [the concept \"perfect number\" is not used here in a modern sense] to contain an equal amount of prime and incomposite numbers, and secondary and composite numbers.\" [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38568451/Theologoumena-Arithmeticae#page=113 ''Iamblichus'' The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 113.] [Retrieved 2012-11-11].

However, not all Mersenne numbers are Mersenne primes, and the composite Mersenne numbers may be factored non-trivially.  Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the [[special number field sieve]] algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number.  {{As of|2019|6}}, 2{{sup|1,193}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 is the record-holder,<ref>[[Thorsten Kleinjung]], [[Joppe Bos]], [[Arjen Lenstra]] \"Mersenne Factorization Factory\" http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653.pdf</ref> having been factored with a variant of the special number field sieve that allows the factorization of several numbers at once.  See [[integer factorization records]] for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a [[primality test]] on the cofactor. {{As of|2019|6}}, the largest factorization with [[probable prime]] factors allowed is {{nowrap|2<sup>7,313,983</sup> &minus; 1 {{=}} 305,492,080,276,193 \u00d7 {{math|''q''}}}}, where {{math|''q''}} is a 2,201,714-digit probable prime.

That is, {{math|''x''}} must be in {{oeis|id=A027861}}.)

(When {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are both perfect {{math|''r''}}th powers for an {{math|''r'' > 1}} or when {{math|\u22124''ab''}} is a perfect fourth power, it can be shown that there are at

That is, it is a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some [[integer]] {{math|''n''}}.  They are named after [[Marin Mersenne]], a French [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], who studied them in the early 17th century.\n\nThe [[exponentiation|exponents]] {{math|''n''}} which give Mersenne primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31,&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000043}} and the resulting Mersenne primes are [[3 (number)|3]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[31 (number)|31]], [[127 (number)|127]], 8191, 131071, 524287, [[2147483647]],&nbsp;... {{OEIS|id=A000668}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n''}} is a [[composite number]] then so is {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}}. ({{math|2<sup>''ab''</sup> \u2212 1}} is divisible by both {{math|2<sup>''a''</sup> \u2212 1}} and {{math|2<sup>''b''</sup> \u2212 1}}.) This definition is therefore equivalent to the definition as a prime number of the form {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} for some prime {{math|''p''}}.\n\nMore generally, numbers of the form {{math|''M<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} without the primality requirement may be called '''Mersenne numbers'''.  Sometimes, however, Mersenne numbers are defined to have the additional requirement that {{math|''n''}} be prime.\nThe smallest composite Mersenne number with prime exponent ''n'' is {{nowrap|2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their [[#Perfect numbers|connection to perfect numbers]].\n\n{{As of|2020|2|url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=4}}, 51 Mersenne primes are known. The [[largest known prime number]], {{nowrap|2<sup>82,589,933</sup> \u2212 1}}, is a Mersenne prime.<ref name=\"GIMPS-2018\">{{cite web |title=GIMPS Project Discovers Largest Known Prime Number: 2<sup>82,589,933</sup>-1 |url=https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M82589933.html |date=21 December 2018 |work=Mersenne Research, Inc. |accessdate=21 December 2018 }}</ref> Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS), a [[distributed computing]] project on the Internet.\n\n==About Mersenne primes==\n{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes?}}\nMany fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The [[Lenstra\u2013Pomerance\u2013Wagstaff conjecture]] asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their [[asymptotic analysis|order of growth]]. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are [[composite number|composite]], although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of [[Sophie Germain prime]]s [[Congruence relation|congruent]] to 3 ([[Modular arithmetic|mod 4]]). For these primes {{mvar|p}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} (which is also prime) will divide {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}, for example, {{math|23&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>11</sub>}}, {{math|47&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>23</sub>}}, {{math|167&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>83</sub>}}, {{math|263&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>131</sub>}}, {{math|359&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>179</sub>}}, {{math|383&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>191</sub>}}, {{math|479&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>239</sub>}}, and {{math|503&nbsp;{{!}}&nbsp;''M''<sub>251</sub>}} {{OEIS|id=A002515}}. Since for these primes {{math|''p''}}, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} is congruent to 7 mod 8, so 2 is a [[quadratic residue]] mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}}, and the [[multiplicative order]] of 2 mod {{math|2''p'' + 1}} must divide <math>\\frac{(2p+1)-1}{2}</math> = {{mvar|p}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is a prime, it must be {{mvar|p}} or 1. However, it cannot be 1 since <math>\\Phi_1(2)=1</math> and 1 has no [[prime factor]]s, so it must be {{mvar|p}}. Hence, {{math|2''p'' + 1}} divides <math>\\Phi_p(2)=2^p-1</math> and <math>2^p-1=M_p</math> cannot be prime.\n\nThe first four Mersenne primes are {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} 3}}, {{math|''M''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} 7}}, {{math|''M''<sub>5</sub> {{=}} 31}} and {{math|''M''<sub>7</sub> {{=}} 127}} and because the first Mersenne prime starts at {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub>}}, all Mersenne primes are congruent to 3 (mod 4). Other than {{math|''M''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''M''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 1}}, all other Mersenne numbers are also congruent to 3 (mod 4). Consequently, in the [[prime factorization]] of a Mersenne number (&nbsp;{{math|&ge;&nbsp;''M''<sub>2</sub>}}&nbsp;) there must be at least one prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4).\n\nA basic [[theorem]] about Mersenne numbers states that if {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime, then the exponent {{math|''p''}} must also be prime. This follows from the identity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}2^{ab}-1&=(2^a-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^a+2^{2a}+2^{3a}+\\cdots+2^{(b-1)a}\\right)\\\\&=(2^b-1)\\cdot \\left(1+2^b+2^{2b}+2^{3b}+\\cdots+2^{(a-1)b}\\right). \\end{align}</math>\nThis rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as {{math|''M''<sub>4</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>4</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 15 {{=}} 3 \u00d7 5 {{=}} (2<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1) \u00d7 (1 + 2<sup>2</sup>)}}.\n\nThough the above examples might suggest that {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for all primes {{mvar|p}}, this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number\n\n: {{math|''M''<sub>11</sub> {{=}} 2<sup>11</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 \u00d7 89}}.\n\nThe evidence at hand suggests that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected odd integer of similar size.<ref name=\"Wagstaff\" /> Nonetheless, prime values of {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} appear to grow increasingly sparse as {{mvar|p}} increases. For example, eight of the first 11 primes {{mvar|p}} give rise to a Mersenne prime {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} (the correct terms on Mersenne's original list), while {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}} is prime for only 43 of the first two million prime numbers (up to 32,452,843).\n\nThe lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]] (LLT) is an efficient [[primality test]] that greatly aids this task, making it much easier to test the primality of Mersenne numbers than that of most other numbers of the same size. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a [[cult following]]. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using [[distributed computing]].\n\nArithmetic modulo a Mersenne number is particularly efficient on a [[Binary number|binary computer]], making them popular choices when a prime modulus is desired, such as the [[Park\u2013Miller random number generator]].  To find a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] of Mersenne number order requires knowing the factorization of that number, so Mersenne primes allow one to find to primitive polynomials of very high order.  Such [[primitive polynomial (field theory)#Primitive trinomials|primitive trinomials]] are used in [[pseudorandom number generator]]s with very large periods such as the [[Mersenne twister]], generalized shift register and [[Lagged Fibonacci generator]]s.\n\n==Perfect numbers==\n{{main|Euclid\u2013Euler theorem}}\nMersenne primes {{math|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>}} are also noteworthy due to their connection with [[perfect number]]s. In the 4th century BC, [[Euclid]] proved that if {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime, then {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>(2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as {{math|{{sfrac|''M''<sub>''p''</sub>(''M<sub>p</sub>'' + 1)|2}}}}, is the {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}}th [[triangular number]] and the {{math|2<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}th [[hexagonal number]]. In the 18th century, [[Leonhard Euler]] proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.<ref>Chris K. Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/index.html Mersenne Primes: History, Theorems and Lists]</ref> This is known as the [[Euclid\u2013Euler theorem]].

The exponents listed by Mersenne were as follows:\n\n::2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.\n\nHis list replicated the known primes of his time with exponents up to 19. His next entry, 31, was correct, but the list then became largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>257</sub>}} (which are composite) and omitted {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}}, and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}} (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.<ref>The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=MersennesConjecture Mersenne's conjecture].</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9douard Lucas]] proved in 1876 that {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}} is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed.  This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever found by hand.  {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} was determined to be prime in 1883 by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]], though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number.  This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that {{math|''M''<sub>67</sub>}} is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by [[Frank Nelson Cole]] in 1903.<ref>{{citation|last=Cole|first= F. N.\n|title=On the factoring of large numbers|jfm= 34.0216.04|journal=Bull. Amer. Math.

The fifth, {{math|''M''<sub>13</sub> {{=}} 8191}}, was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two ({{math|''M''<sub>17</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>19</sub>}}) were found by [[Pietro Cataldi]] in 1588. After nearly two centuries, {{math|''M''<sub>31</sub>}} was verified to be prime by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was {{math|''M''<sub>127</sub>}}, found by [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] in 1876, then {{math|''M''<sub>61</sub>}} by [[Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin]] in 1883. Two more ({{math|''M''<sub>89</sub>}} and {{math|''M''<sub>107</sub>}}) were found early in the 20th century, by [[R. E. Powers]] in 1911 and 1914, respectively.\n\nThe best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the [[Lucas\u2013Lehmer primality test]]. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime {{math|''p'' > 2}}, {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>'' {{=}} 2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is prime [[if and only if]] {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}} divides {{math|''S''<sub>''p'' \u2212 2</sub>}}, where {{math|''S''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 4}} and {{math|''S<sub>k</sub>'' {{=}} (''S''<sub>''k'' \u2212 1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} for {{math|''k'' > 0}}.\n\nDuring the era of manual calculation, all the exponents up to and including 257 were tested with the Lucas\u2013Lehmer test and found to be composite. A notable contribution was made by retired Yale physics professor Horace Scudder Uhler, who did the calculations for exponents 157, 167, 193, 199, 227, and 229.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Scripta Mathematica |volume= 18 |year=1952 |pp=122\u2013131 |title=A Brief History of the Investigations on Mersenne Numbers and the Latest Immense Primes |author=Horace S.

Robinson|R. M. Robinson]]. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, {{math|''M''<sub>607</sub>}}, was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more&nbsp;\u2014 {{math|''M''<sub>1279</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>2203</sub>}}, {{math|''M''<sub>2281</sub>}}&nbsp;\u2014 were found by the same program in the next several months. {{math|''M''<sub>4253</sub>}} is the first Mersenne prime that is [[titanic prime|titanic]], {{math|''M''<sub>44,497</sub>}} is the first [[gigantic prime|gigantic]], and {{math|''M''<sub>6,972,593</sub>}} was the first [[megaprime]] to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.<ref>The Prime Pages, [http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=Megaprime The Prime Glossary: megaprime].</ref> All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size.

Since {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}, for all positive integers {{math|''c''}}, {{mvar|q}} is also a factor of {{math|2<sup>''pc''</sup> \u2212 1}}. Since {{mvar|p}} is prime and {{mvar|q}} is not a factor of {{nowrap|2<sup>1</sup> \u2212 1}}, {{mvar|p}} is also the smallest positive integer {{mvar|x}} such that {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''x''</sup> \u2212 1}}. As a result, for all positive integers {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''x''</sup> \u2212 1}} if and only if {{mvar|p}} is a factor of {{mvar|x}}. Therefore, since {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''q''\u22121</sup> \u2212 1}}, {{mvar|p}} is a factor of {{math|''q'' \u2212 1}} so {{math|''q'' \u2261 1 (mod ''p'')}}. Furthermore, since {{mvar|q}} is a factor of {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}}, which is odd, {{mvar|q}} is odd. Therefore, {{math|''q'' \u2261 1 (mod 2''p'')}}.\n#* This fact leads to a proof of [[Euclid's theorem]], which asserts the infinitude of primes, distinct from the proof written by Euclid: for every odd prime {{mvar|p}}, all primes dividing {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} are larger than {{mvar|p}}; thus there are always larger primes than any particular prime.\n#* It follows from this fact that for every prime {{math|''p'' > 2}}, there is at least one prime of the form {{math|2''kp''+1}} less than or equal to {{mvar|M<sub>p</sub>}}, for some integer {{mvar|k}}.\n# If {{mvar|p}} is an odd prime, then every prime {{mvar|q}} that divides {{math|2<sup>''p''</sup> \u2212 1}} is congruent to {{nowrap|\u00b11 (mod 8)}}.\n#* '''Proof''': {{math|2<sup>''p''+1</sup> \u2261 2 (mod ''q'')}}, so {{math|2<sup>{{sfrac|1|2}}(p+1)</sup>}} is a square root of {{math|2 mod ''q''}}.  By [[quadratic reciprocity]], every prime modulus in which the number 2 has a square root is congruent to {{nowrap|\u00b11 (mod 8)}}.\n# A Mersenne prime cannot be a [[Wieferich prime]].\n#* '''Proof''': We show if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1}} is a Mersenne prime, then the congruence {{math|2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup> \u2261 1 (mod ''p''<sup>2</sup>)}} does not hold. By Fermat's little theorem, {{math|''m'' {{!}} ''p'' \u2212 1}}.  Therefore, one can write {{math|''p'' \u2212 1 {{=}} ''m\u03bb''}}. If the given congruence is satisfied, then {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup> {{!}} 2<sup>''m\u03bb''</sup> \u2212 1}}, therefore {{math|0 \u2261 {{sfrac|2<sup>''m\u03bb''</sup> \u2212 1|2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1}}}} {{math|{{=}} 1 + 2<sup>''m''</sup> + 2<sup>2''m''</sup> + ... + 2<sup>(''\u03bb'' \u2212 1)''m''</sup>}} {{math|\u2261 \u2212''\u03bb'' mod (2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1)}}. Hence {{math|2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1 {{!}} ''\u03bb''}}, and therefore {{math|''\u03bb'' \u2265 2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1}}. This leads to {{math|''p'' \u2212 1  \u2265 ''m''(2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1)}}, which is impossible since {{math|''m'' \u2265 2}}.\n#If {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are natural numbers then {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are [[coprime]] if and only if {{math|2<sup>''m''</sup> \u2212 1}} and {{math|2<sup>''n''</sup> \u2212 1}} are coprime.

However, since {{mvar|p}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, {{mvar|q}} is congruent to {{nowrap|7 (mod 8)}} and therefore 2 is a quadratic residue mod {{mvar|q}}. Also since {{mvar|q}} is congruent to {{nowrap|3 (mod 4)}}, \u22121 is a quadratic nonresidue mod {{mvar|q}}, so \u22122 is the product of a residue and a nonresidue and hence it is a nonresidue, which is a contradiction.

In his ''Theology of Arithmetic'' in the chapter ''On the Decad'', Iamblichus writes: \"Speusippus, the son of Plato's sister Potone, and head of the Academy before Xenocrates, compiled a polished little book from the Pythagorean writings which were particularly valued at any time, and especially from the writings of Philolaus; he entitled the book ''On Pythagorean Numbers''.

However, not all Mersenne numbers are Mersenne primes, and the composite Mersenne numbers may be factored non-trivially.

See [[integer factorization records]] for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor.

Some smart speakers can also act as a [[smart device]] that utilizes [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]] and other protocol standards to extend usage beyond audio playback, such as to control [[home automation]] devices.

However, these continuously listening microphones also raise privacy concerns among users.<ref name=\"lau\">{{cite journal|title=Alexa, Are You Listening?: Privacy Perceptions, Concerns and Privacy-seeking Behaviors with Smart Speakers|first1=Josephine|last1=Lau|first2=Benjamin|last2=Zimmerman|first3=Florian|last3=Schaub|date=1 November 2018|journal=Proc.

In 2017, British security researcher Mark Barnes showed that pre-2017 Echos have exposed pins that allow for a compromised OS to be booted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-wiretap-hack/|title=A Hacker Turned an Amazon Echo Into a 'Wiretap'|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|date=1 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2019|via=www.wired.com}}</ref>\n\n===Voice assistance vs privacy===\nWhile voice assistants provide a valuable service, there can be some hesitation towards using them in various social contexts, such as in public or around other users.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31205-2_10 Sarah Mennicken and Elaine M.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 143\u2013160.]</ref> However, only more recently have users begun interacting with voice assistants through an interaction with smart speakers rather than an interaction with the phone. On the phone, most voice assistants have the option to be engaged by a physical button (e.g., Siri with a long press of the home button) rather than solely by hot word-based engagement in a smart speaker. While this distinction increases the privacy by limiting when the microphone is on, users felt that having to press a button first removed the convenience of voice interaction. <ref>Christoffer Lambertsson. 2017. Expectations of Privacy in Voice Interaction\u2013A Look at Voice Controlled Bank Transactions. Ph.D. Dissertation. KTH Royal Institute of Technology</ref> This trade-off is not unique to voice assistants; as more and more devices come online, there is an increasing trade-off between convenience and privacy.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-todays-homes-consumers-are-willing-to-sacrifice-privacy-for-convenience/2018/09/11/5f951b4a-a241-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html Rao, Sonia (12 September 2018) \"In today's homes, consumers are willing to sacrifice privacy for convenience\".

For example, visitors to a home or office, or people in a publicly accessible area outside an open window, partial wall, or security fence, may be able to be heard by a speaker.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 143\u2013160.]</ref> However, only more recently have users begun interacting with voice assistants through an interaction with smart speakers rather than an interaction with the phone. On the phone, most voice assistants have the option to be engaged by a physical button (e.g., Siri with a long press of the home button) rather than solely by hot word-based engagement in a smart speaker. While this distinction increases the privacy by limiting when the microphone is on, users felt that having to press a button first removed the convenience of voice interaction. <ref>Christoffer Lambertsson. 2017.

In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

Shuntelle & Michael decided to travel to the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] enroute to [[Belize]]. Dom & Lizzie chose to go from [[Oaxaca City]] to [[Guatemala]] via the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast route, but visited the infinity pool at [[Hierve el Agua]] while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon & Jamiul chose the interior route so they can see the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Palenque]]. Initially they had intended to go via [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]], but found that it would involved a six hour detour, and had to changed bus half-way through. \n\nJo & Sam originally also intended to go to Belize, but modified their plan and go via Guatemala instead after a chance meeting with a stranger in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] who advised them on the ideal route. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas. Emon & Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat.

Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]]. After stopping in [[Lim\u00f3n]], [[Costa Rica]] to work in a farm with the [[Bribri people|Bribri tribe]], they arrived at the checkpoint in [[Panama City]] first on Day 14 of the race.\n\nAs they were a long way behind, Emon & Jamiul took the faster [[Pan-American Highway#Central America|CA1 route]] via [[San Salvador]] in a attempt to make up time. They also took an expensive direct bus ride from [[Managua]] to [[David, Panama]]. They overtook Jen & Rob, who took a break in [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] and the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] and were the last team to arrive at Panama City. \n\nIn Honduras, after buying food at a stop, Michael found that he had lost his money belt containing \u00a31,155, which is more than half their money at the start of the leg.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/sydenham-and-lewisham-couple-testing-their-relationship-by-racing-the-length-of-south-america/ |title=Sydenham and Lewisham couple testing their relationship by racing the length of South America |first=Toby |last=Porter|date= 16 March 2020 |work= London News Online}}</ref> Even though they tried to earn some money at the [[Ballena National Marine Park]], at the end of the leg, Shuntelle & Michael decided to quit the race as they felt they could no longer compete with so little money left.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:5em|Order\n!style=width:12em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Pe\u00f1as Blancas District|Pe\u00f1as Blancas]] \u2192 [[Lim\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|\u2013\n|74%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 El Cuco [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|2.5\n|75%\n|-style=background:#ccf\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Shuntelle & Michael{{ref|1|[a]}}\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Comayagua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] \u2192 [[Ballena National Marine Park]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|4.5\n|14%\n|-\n|4\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[David, Panama|David]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|20\n|60%\n|-\n|5\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Monteverde, Costa Rica|Monteverde]] / [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|21.5\n|74%\n|-\n|}\n<small>{{note|1|Note a}} Shuntelle & Michael withdrew from the race after losing over a thousand pounds.</small>\n\n====Leg 3: Panama City \u2192 Villavieja ====\n[[File:Villavieja, Huila, desierto Tatacoa - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Tatacoa Desert]]]]\nThe original destination was to be [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]; however, due to [[2019 Ecuadorian protests|civil unrest]], the checkpoint was moved to the Bethel Hotel near [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] of [[Colombia]].  To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva. They crossed a river to reach Villavieja and finished second.\nJo & Sam decided to take a break at Medell\u00edn to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via [[Cali]] where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work. \nDom & Lizzie took a detour to work at [[Guatap\u00e9]] before going to Bogot\u00e1. However, this detour cost them the lead, and they finished behind all the other teams.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:5em|Order\n!style=width:12em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ustupo]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|\u2013\n| 44%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Magdalena River]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|2.5\n| 57%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cali]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|9.5\n| 54%\n|-\n| 4\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Guatap\u00e9]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| 12\n| 53%\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 4: Villavieja \u2192 Puno ====\n[[File:095 Hotel Puno Peru 3366 (15119509256).jpg|thumb|Hotel in [[Puno]]]]\nDue to the continuing civil unrest in Ecuador and for safety reasons, teams were unable to travel to Peru by land or sea and were flown to the nearest airport in [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]] in [[Peru]] to continue the race.  The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that arrived at the checkpoint in Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nJo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]], which depleted their funds. However, without stopping to work, Jo & Sam reached their destination first, which is located in [[Puno]] on an island near the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]].\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]]. Although ahead of the others, Emon & Jamiul took a detour to see the [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]. Jen & Rob travelled via a slower route but more gradual climb to Puno via [[Arequipa]]. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon & Jamiul, and beat them in a foot race to the second spot at the checkpoint. \n\nDom & Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco. It delayed their journey to Puno, and they finished last for the second time.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:5em|Order\n!style=width:12em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Airplane-logo.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]]  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Chiclayo]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Lima]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] \u2192 [[Huacachina]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Puno]]\n| \n| \n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Airplane-logo.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]]  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Chiclayo]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 Chaparri Reserve [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Lima]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Arequipa]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Puno]]\n| 1.5\n|\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Airplane-logo.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]]  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Huanchaco]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] \u2192  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Lima]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cusco]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]  [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]]  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Sicuani]]  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Puno]]\n| 1.5\n| \n|-\n|4\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Airplane-logo.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]]  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Chiclayo]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Lima]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cusco]]  [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Puno]] \n|\n|\n|}\n\n===Ratings===\nThe first episode had an overnight rating of 2 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/race-across-the-world-finds-2m/5147938.article |title=Race Across the World finds 2m |first= Robin |last=Parker|date=9 March 2020 |work=Broadcast Now}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Joel Golby of ''[[The Guardian]]'' thought it  \"an astounding piece of TV\" that \"captures all the vibrant highs and exhausted lows of travel in all of their raw glory\", and one that made him \"genuinely caring how this one ends and the impact it will have on the lives of those who lived it\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world

In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

Shuntelle & Michael decided to travel to the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] enroute to [[Belize]]. Dom & Lizzie chose to go from [[Oaxaca City]] to [[Guatemala]] via the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast route, but visited the infinity pool at [[Hierve el Agua]] while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon & Jamiul chose the interior route so they can see the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Palenque]]. Initially they had intended to go via [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]], but found that it would involved a six hour detour, and had to changed bus half-way through. \n\nJo & Sam originally also intended to go to Belize, but modified their plan and go via Guatemala instead after a chance meeting with a stranger in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] who advised them on the ideal route. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas. Emon & Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat. They finished last in this leg.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|-\n!style=width:5em|Order\n!style=width:12em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders \n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 [[Metro San L\u00e1zaro|San L\u00e1zaro]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[La Mesilla]] \u2192 [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|\u2013\n|87%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Oaxaca City]] / [[Hierve el Agua]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192  [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Tapachula]] \u2192 [[:es:Ciudad Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n|Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Lake Atitl\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]]\n|6\n|88%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 [[Metro Puebla|Puebla]] [[File:Car - The Noun Project.svg|20px]] \u2192 [[Puebla (city)|Puebla]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Frontera Corozal, Chiapas|Frontera Corozal]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Bethel, El Pet\u00e9n|Bethel]] \u2192 [[Belmopan]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Placencia]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|22\n|\n|-\n|4\n|style=text-align:left|Shuntelle & Michael\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Tulum]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Belize City]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Caye Caulker]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 Belize City [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Placencia]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|23\n|78%\n|-\n|5\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Palenque]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192 [[Belmopan]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Placencia]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] \u2192  [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] \n|33\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 2: Cop\u00e1n Ruinas \u2192 Panama City====\n[[File:Panama 08 2013 Trump Ocean Club Tower 7089.JPG|thumb|[[JW Marriott Panama]], [[Panama City]]]]\nJo & Sam chose to go through [[El Salvador]] to get to [[Nicaragua]]. Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]]. After stopping in [[Lim\u00f3n]], [[Costa Rica]] to work in a farm with the [[Bribri people|Bribri tribe]], they arrived at the checkpoint in [[Panama City]] first on Day 14 of the race.\n\nAs they were a long way behind, Emon & Jamiul took the faster [[Pan-American Highway#Central America|CA1 route]] via [[San Salvador]] in a attempt to make up time. They also took an expensive direct bus ride from [[Managua]] to [[David, Panama]]. They overtook Jen & Rob, who took a break in [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] and the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] and were the last team to arrive at Panama City. \n\nIn Honduras, after buying food at a stop, Michael found that he had lost his money belt containing \u00a31,155, which is more than half their money at the start of the leg.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/sydenham-and-lewisham-couple-testing-their-relationship-by-racing-the-length-of-south-america/ |title=Sydenham and Lewisham couple testing their relationship by racing the length of South America |first=Toby |last=Porter|date= 16 March 2020 |work= London News Online}}</ref> Even though they tried to earn some money at the [[Ballena National Marine Park]], at the end of the leg, Shuntelle & Michael decided to quit the race as they felt they could no longer compete with so little money left.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:5em|Order\n!style=width:12em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Pe\u00f1as Blancas District|Pe\u00f1as Blancas]] \u2192 [[Lim\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|\u2013\n|74%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 El Cuco [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|2.5\n|75%\n|-style=background:#ccf\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Shuntelle & Michael{{ref|1|[a]}}\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Comayagua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] \u2192 [[Ballena National Marine Park]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]] ([[Albrook (Panama Metro)|Albrook]]) [[File:Icon train.svg|35px]] \u2192 Plaza Francia \u2192 [[JW Marriott Panama]]\n|4.5\n|14%\n|-\n|4\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] \u2192 [[San Salvador]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] \u2192 [[Managua]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[David, Panama|David]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|20\n|60%\n|-\n|5\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Monteverde, Costa Rica|Monteverde]] / [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] \u2192 [[Panama City]]\n|21.5\n|74%\n|-\n|}\n<small>{{note|1|Note a}} Shuntelle & Michael withdrew from the race after losing over a thousand pounds.</small>\n\n====Leg 3: Panama City \u2192 Villavieja ====\n[[File:Villavieja, Huila, desierto Tatacoa - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Tatacoa Desert]]]]\nThe original destination was to be [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]; however, due to [[2019 Ecuadorian protests|civil unrest]], the checkpoint was moved to the Bethel Hotel near [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] of [[Colombia]].  To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva. They crossed a river to reach Villavieja and finished second.\nJo & Sam decided to take a break at Medell\u00edn to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via [[Cali]] where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work. \nDom & Lizzie took a detour to work at [[Guatap\u00e9]] before going to Bogot\u00e1. However, this detour cost them the lead, and they finished behind all the other teams.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:5em|Order\n!style=width:12em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ustupo]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|\u2013\n| 44%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Magdalena River]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|2.5\n| 57%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cali]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|9.5\n| 54%\n|-\n| 4\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Guatap\u00e9]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| 12\n| 53%\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 4: Villavieja \u2192 Puno ====\n[[File:095 Hotel Puno Peru 3366 (15119509256).jpg|thumb|Hotel in [[Puno]]]]\nDue to the continuing civil unrest in Ecuador and for safety reasons, teams were unable to travel to Peru by land or sea and were flown to the nearest airport in [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]] in [[Peru]] to continue the race.  The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that arrived at the checkpoint in Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nJo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]], which depleted their funds. However, without stopping to work, Jo & Sam reached their destination first, which is located in [[Puno]] on an island near the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]].\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]]. Although ahead of the others, Emon & Jamiul took a detour to see the [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]. Jen & Rob travelled via a slower route but more gradual climb to Puno via [[Arequipa]]. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon & Jamiul, and beat them in a foot race to the second spot at the checkpoint. \n\nDom & Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco.

He was eventually recognized as a significant regional ruler (of Ur, [[Eridu]], and Uruk) at a coronation in [[Nippur]], and is believed to have constructed buildings at Nippur, [[Larsa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], and [[Umma]].

His main achievement was state-building, and Ur-Nammu is chiefly remembered today for his [[legal code]], the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], the oldest known surviving example in the world.

He was eventually recognized as a significant regional ruler (of Ur, [[Eridu]], and Uruk) at a coronation in [[Nippur]], and is believed to have constructed buildings at Nippur, [[Larsa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], and [[Umma]]. He was known for restoring the roads and general order after the Gutian period.<ref name=\"Hamblin\"/>\n\nUr-Nammu was also responsible for ordering the construction of a number of [[ziggurat]]s, including the [[Great Ziggurat of Ur]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lib.haifa.ac.il/www/art/ur.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708050958/http://lib.haifa.ac.il/www/art/ur.html |archivedate=2007-07-08 }}</ref>\n\nHe was killed in a battle against the Gutians after he had been abandoned by his army.<ref name=\"Hamblin\">[[William J.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US. It was the best selling album of 2019 in the country. Globally, ''Lover'' was the best selling album by a solo artist of 2019. As of January 2020, it has sold over 3.2 million pure copies worldwide. To promote the album, Swift is set to embark on the [[Lover Fest]], her sixth [[concert tour]] and first [[music festival]] tour, beginning on June 20, 2020.\n\n''Lover'' received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]], which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014) and ''Reputation'' (2017), while its singles \"You Need to Calm Down\" and \"Lover\" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], respectively. The album appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019.\n\n==Background==\nSpeculation of the album started on February 24, 2019, when Swift posted a photo of seven palm trees to her [[Instagram]] account,<ref>{{cite web |last=Elizabeth |first=De |title=Taylor Swift Might Have Just Dropped a Huge Clue About Her Next Album |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326190044/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-instagram-palm-trees-fan-theories-next-album |archive-date=March 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> which the singer later confirmed was the day she finished the album.<ref name=\"EWMay\">{{cite magazine|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=May 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135902/https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/|archive-date=August 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 13, Swift released a countdown on her official website, counting down to midnight [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] ([[UTC\u221204:00]]) on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|title=Taylor Swift Updates Her Website With Countdown Clock, Teases April 26 Date|first=Katie|last=Atkinson|website=Billboard|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416134018/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8506993/taylor-swift-countdown-clock-april-26|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 25, around noon, Swift appeared before a butterfly-shaped [[mural]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and revealed that the countdown was to new music.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/230892/who-is-taylor-swift-butterfly-artist-kelsey-montague|title=The Artist Behind The Butterfly Mural Had No Idea It Was For Taylor Swift|last=Reilly|first=Kaitlin|date=April 26, 2019|website=[[Refinery29]]|language=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> At midnight, she released the album's lead single, \"[[Me!]]\" featuring [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]], along with its accompanying music video.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> Swift encouraged fans to find hints about the album title in the video and many fans pointed out that at one point in the video, the word \"Lover\" appeared on a neon light up sign at the top of a building in the background.<ref>{{cite web |last=Walsh |first=Savannah |title=Taylor Swift's New Album Title Hint Suggests That Apparently Fans May Already Know It |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |website=Bustle |accessdate=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621150341/https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swifts-new-album-title-hint-suggests-that-apparently-fans-may-already-know-it-17921363 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{Plain image with caption|image=ME! mural.jpg|caption=Swift posing in front of the interactive butterfly-shaped [[mural]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] on April 25, 2019, where she announced that new music would be released by the end of the thirteen-day countdown.

It was released on August 23, 2019, through [[Republic Records]]. As the [[executive producer]], Swift worked with producers [[Jack Antonoff]], [[Louis Bell]], [[Frank Dukes]] and [[Joel Little]] on the album. Described by Swift as \"a love letter to love itself\", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a [[summer]] aesthetic, consisting mainly of [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[synth-pop]], [[electropop]] and [[pop rock]] record that contains influences of [[Country music|country]], [[dream pop]], [[bubblegum pop]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[pop punk]] and [[indie pop]].\n\n''Lover'' features collaborations with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Brendon Urie]] of [[Panic! at the Disco]]. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; \"[[Me!]]\" and \"[[You Need to Calm Down]]\" peaked at number two, while the [[Lover (Taylor Swift song)|title track]] reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\" was released as the fourth single on January 27, 2020. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album \"lengthy\" and \"inconsistent\" in places.\n\n''Lover'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. ''Lover'' was certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for moving over 2 million units in the US.
