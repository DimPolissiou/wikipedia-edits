Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

It has also voted for the winner of the presidency in every election since 1928 except twice, voting for the loser only in 1992 and 2016.\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], [[Barack Obama]] won the county by seven points, the first Democrat to capture the county since [[Bill Clinton]]'s re-election victory in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&fips=12&f=0|title=2004 Presidential General Election Results - Florida|author=David Leip|work=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref> Obama won Hillsborough again in 2012 over Republican presidential nominee [[Mitt Romney]] by roughly the same margin.\n\nIn 2016, [[Donald Trump]] became the first Republican since [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924 to win the election without carrying the county.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:90%;\"\n|+ '''Hillsborough County vote<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}</ref><br /> by party in presidential elections'''\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

The Board of County Commissioners, which composes the legislative branch, sets overall policy by means of ordinances, resolutions, and motions.\n\nThe executive powers of county government are vested in the county administrator, appointed by county commissioners and charged by the charter to faithfully implement the powers of the board. The charter provides for a county attorney, to be hired by the county administrator with the advice and consent of the county commissioners. The charter contains a provision for a charter review board appointed by County Commissioners every five years to conduct a study of county government and propose amendments to the charter. These amendments must be presented to voters for approval. One amendment was approved in November 2002, adding the position of County Internal Performance Auditor to the government structure. This position reports directly to the County Commission.\n\nOf the seven members of the Board of County Commissioners for Hillsborough County, four are elected from single-member districts, and three are elected county-wide. The board approves the county's operating and capital budgets and the county's capital-improvement program. It may take action on any programs for the improvement of the county and the welfare of its residents.\n\n=== Government officials ===\nThese five countywide elected positions have specific responsibilities under the county charter:\n* Clerk of the Circuit Court: Pat Frank (D)\n* Sheriff: Chad Chronister (R)\n* Property Appraiser: [[Bob Henriquez]] (D)\n* Tax Collector: Doug Belden (R)\n* Supervisor of Elections: Craig Latimer (D)\n\nUnder a charter ordinance that went into effect May 1985, county commissioners are directed to perform legislative functions of government by developing policy for the management of Hillsborough County. The county administrator, a professional appointed by the board, and the administrative staff are responsible for the implementation of these policies.\n\nThe board also serves as the Environmental Protection Commission. Individual board members serve on various other boards, authorities, and commissions such as the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, Tampa Bay Water, Aviation Authority, Expressway Authority, Sports Authority, Port Authority, Arts Council of Hillsborough County, Children's Board, Metropolitan Planning Organization, and Council of Governments.\n\n===Taxes===\nHillsborough County's discretionary [[sales tax]] rate increased from 1% to 2.5% in January 2019. When combined with the state of Florida's 6%, the rate is 8.5%, the highest in Florida. The rate includes two surcharges approved by voter referendum in November 2018, 1% for transportation and 1/2% for schools.<ref name=\"Grigg Tax\">{{cite news |last1=Grigg |first1=Nicole |title=Hillsborough County's sales tax to increase Jan. 1, will be the highest in the state |url=https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/hillsborough-countys-sales-tax-to-increase-jan-1-will-be-the-highest-in-the-state |accessdate=26 February 2019 |date=December 28, 2018}}</ref> It is only collected on the first $5000 of any large purchase.\n\n=== Voter registration ===\nRegistration as of 7-11-2018.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Voter Registration and Party membership\n!\n!Political party\n!Number of registered voters\n!Percentage\n|-\n{{Party colour|Democratic Party (United States)}}\n|[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|322,472\n|38.78%\n|-\n{{Party colour|Republican Party (United States)}}\n|[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n|263,033\n|31.64%\n|-\n{{Party colour|Independent (United States)}}\n|[[Independent politician|Others]]\n|245,931\n|29.58%\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!831,436\n!100%\n|}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.votehillsborough.org/|title=Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=May 2012}}\nIn the early 20th century, Hillsborough's economy was predominantly based on cigar-making and agriculture.

The districts and sectors are cut to exclude areas covered by other local agencies.\n\n{{see also|Hillsborough County Public Schools#Security|Law enforcement organization}}\n\nThe school district uses two agencies for security. The sheriff's office employs deputies assigned to various schools throughout the county. They, along with the Hillsborough County Public Schools Security Service officers, are known as school resource officers. Generally, deputies are assigned to schools outside of the incorporated cities and HCPSSS officers are assigned to schools within city limits.

Fire service began in the 1950s as an all-volunteer force consisting of about a dozen loosely associated community-based organizations. The first full-time career firefighters were hired in 1973.  The department now has 1,019 career uniformed and support personnel who continue to set the pace in fire and emergency medical response, making it the fourth-largest department in the state. Since the 1997 consolidation of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue and Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the department has placed paramedics on each career, front-line apparatus: 28 rescues, 42 engines, four ladder trucks, and four special operations units operating out of 43 fire stations throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County. As nearly 85% of the department's more than 90,000 emergency responses require some level of medical care, having paramedics assigned to each unit assures that the citizens of Hillsborough County are receiving rapid advanced life-support care.\n\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue and the Board of County Commissioners have implemented a plan to continue placing new fire rescue stations in areas where growth is occurring or gaps in coverage may exist.  Fire Chief Dennis Jones leads a senior staff of two deputy chiefs (operations and administrative branches), the fire marshal, and the emergency manager.  All fiscal functions, facilities maintenance and supply, apparatus/equipment procurement, emergency dispatch manager, personnel chief, and training chief are under the direction of the deputy chief of administration.  The three Shift Commanders, as well as the Rescue Chief and the Special Operations Chief, report directly to the Deputy Chief of Operations. The Operations Chief is responsible for the overall response readiness of all front line personnel. The Emergency Manager oversees all Office of Emergency Management (OEM) planning and operations of the EOC.<ref>[http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/firerescue/divisions/summary.cfm Hillsborough Fire Rescue Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624013509/http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/firerescue/divisions/summary.cfm |date=June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Hillsborough County Fire Rescue Office of Emergency Management===\nThe Office of Emergency Management is a division of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue that is directly responsible for planning and coordinating the evacuation and sheltering of all county residents in the event of a natural or manmade disaster. This agency is also responsible for planning, orchestrating and coordinating response actions and [[continuity of government]] in the aftermath of a major disaster. Preston Cook has been the Emergency Manager since 2011.\n\nThe Hurricane Evacuation Assessment Tool  has been created to assist residents of Hillsborough County by providing evacuation and sheltering information in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster. This interactive program was designed to assist the public in easily determining if they are in one of the five evacuation zones. It also provides information on shelters, hospitals, fire stations, and sandbag locations.\n\nThe Office of Emergency Management also provides information to the public on: Hurricane information, procedures for hazardous-materials spills, and flooding, tornado, wildfire, and terrorism preparedness.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:EnteringHillsboroughCounty.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Sunshine Skyway]] ([[Interstate 275 (Florida)|I-275]]) connects Pinellas to Manatee Counties.

However, for the last quarter-century, it has been a powerful swing county in one of the nation's most important swing states. It is part of the politically important [[Interstate 4|I-4 Corridor]] between Tampa Bay and [[Orlando]], an area that historically decides most elections in Florida.  Hillsborough was considered a [[bellwether]] county, voting for the statewide winner in every presidential election from 1964-2012.

The Board of County Commissioners, which composes the legislative branch, sets overall policy by means of ordinances, resolutions, and motions.\n\nThe executive powers of county government are vested in the county administrator, appointed by county commissioners and charged by the charter to faithfully implement the powers of the board. The charter provides for a county attorney, to be hired by the county administrator with the advice and consent of the county commissioners. The charter contains a provision for a charter review board appointed by County Commissioners every five years to conduct a study of county government and propose amendments to the charter. These amendments must be presented to voters for approval. One amendment was approved in November 2002, adding the position of County Internal Performance Auditor to the government structure. This position reports directly to the County Commission.\n\nOf the seven members of the Board of County Commissioners for Hillsborough County, four are elected from single-member districts, and three are elected county-wide. The board approves the county's operating and capital budgets and the county's capital-improvement program. It may take action on any programs for the improvement of the county and the welfare of its residents.\n\n=== Government officials ===\nThese five countywide elected positions have specific responsibilities under the county charter:\n*Clerk of the Circuit Court: Pat Frank (D)\n*Sheriff: Chad Chronister (R)\n*Property Appraiser: [[Bob Henriquez]] (D)\n*Tax Collector: Doug Belden (R)\n*Supervisor of Elections: Craig Latimer (D)\n\nUnder a charter ordinance that went into effect May 1985, county commissioners are directed to perform legislative functions of government by developing policy for the management of Hillsborough County. The county administrator, a professional appointed by the board, and the administrative staff are responsible for the implementation of these policies.\n\nThe board also serves as the Environmental Protection Commission. Individual board members serve on various other boards, authorities, and commissions such as the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority, Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, Tampa Bay Water, Aviation Authority, Expressway Authority, Sports Authority, Port Authority, Arts Council of Hillsborough County, Children's Board, Metropolitan Planning Organization, and Council of Governments.\n\n===Taxes===\nHillsborough County's discretionary [[sales tax]] rate increased from 1% to 2.5% in January 2019. When combined with the state of Florida's 6%, the rate is 8.5%, the highest in Florida. The rate includes two surcharges approved by voter referendum in November 2018, 1% for transportation and 1/2% for schools.<ref name=\"Grigg Tax\">{{cite news |last1=Grigg |first1=Nicole |title=Hillsborough County's sales tax to increase Jan. 1, will be the highest in the state |url=https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/hillsborough-countys-sales-tax-to-increase-jan-1-will-be-the-highest-in-the-state |accessdate=26 February 2019 |date=December 28, 2018}}</ref> It is only collected on the first $5000 of any large purchase.\n\n=== Voter registration ===\nRegistration as of 7-11-2018.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Voter Registration and Party membership\n!\n!Political party\n!Number of registered voters\n!Percentage\n|-\n{{Party colour|Democratic Party (United States)}}\n|[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|322,472\n|38.78%\n|-\n{{Party colour|Republican Party (United States)}}\n|[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n|263,033\n|31.64%\n|-\n{{Party colour|Independent (United States)}}\n|[[Independent politician|Others]]\n|245,931\n|29.58%\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!831,436\n!100%\n|}\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.votehillsborough.org/|title=Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=May 2012}}\nIn the early 20th century, Hillsborough's economy was predominantly based on cigar-making and agriculture.

The districts and sectors are cut to exclude areas covered by other local agencies.\n\n{{see also|Hillsborough County Public Schools#Security|Law enforcement organization}}\n\nThe school district uses two agencies for security. The sheriff's office employs deputies assigned to various schools throughout the county. They, along with the Hillsborough County Public Schools Security Service officers, are known as school resource officers. Generally, deputies are assigned to schools outside of the incorporated cities and HCPSSS officers are assigned to schools within city limits.

Fire service began in the 1950s as an all-volunteer force consisting of about a dozen loosely associated community-based organizations. The first full-time career firefighters were hired in 1973.  The department now has 1,019 career uniformed and support personnel who continue to set the pace in fire and emergency medical response, making it the fourth-largest department in the state. Since the 1997 consolidation of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue and Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the department has placed paramedics on each career, front-line apparatus: 28 rescues, 42 engines, four ladder trucks, and four special operations units operating out of 43 fire stations throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County. As nearly 85% of the department's more than 90,000 emergency responses require some level of medical care, having paramedics assigned to each unit assures that the citizens of Hillsborough County are receiving rapid advanced life-support care.\n\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue and the Board of County Commissioners have implemented a plan to continue placing new fire rescue stations in areas where growth is occurring or gaps in coverage may exist.  Fire Chief Dennis Jones leads a senior staff of two deputy chiefs (operations and administrative branches), the fire marshal, and the emergency manager.  All fiscal functions, facilities maintenance and supply, apparatus/equipment procurement, emergency dispatch manager, personnel chief, and training chief are under the direction of the deputy chief of administration.  The three Shift Commanders, as well as the Rescue Chief and the Special Operations Chief, report directly to the Deputy Chief of Operations. The Operations Chief is responsible for the overall response readiness of all front line personnel. The Emergency Manager oversees all Office of Emergency Management (OEM) planning and operations of the EOC.<ref>[http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/firerescue/divisions/summary.cfm Hillsborough Fire Rescue Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624013509/http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/firerescue/divisions/summary.cfm |date=June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Hillsborough County Fire Rescue Office of Emergency Management===\nThe Office of Emergency Management is a division of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue that is directly responsible for planning and coordinating the evacuation and sheltering of all county residents in the event of a natural or manmade disaster.

Preston Cook has been the Emergency Manager since 2011.\n\nThe Hurricane Evacuation Assessment Tool  has been created to assist residents of Hillsborough County by providing evacuation and sheltering information in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster. This interactive program was designed to assist the public in easily determining if they are in one of the five evacuation zones. It also provides information on shelters, hospitals, fire stations, and sandbag locations.\n\nThe Office of Emergency Management also provides information to the public on: Hurricane information, procedures for hazardous-materials spills, and flooding, tornado, wildfire, and terrorism preparedness.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:EnteringHillsboroughCounty.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Sunshine Skyway]] ([[Interstate 275 (Florida)|I-275]]) connects Pinellas to Manatee Counties.

The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]\n\nThe '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (astronomy)|differ by 180\u00b0]]).<ref>[P.&nbsp;Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac/page/n253 \"Phases of the Moon\"], ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac: A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'', (Mill Valley: University Science Books, 1992), p.&nbsp;478.</ref> This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth \u2013 the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] \u2013 is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs roughly once a [[month]].\n\nThe time interval between a full (or new) moon and the next repetition of the same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be either 29 or 30 days long.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). By definition, its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing stops. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\n\nMany [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when prepared for a different [[time zone]].\n\nThe full moon is generally a suboptimal time for [[astronomical observation]] of the Moon because shadows vanish. It is a poor time for other observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon, amplified by the [[opposition surge]], then [[skyglow|outshines]] many stars.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon was [[perigee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time in the previous 15 years. This was referred to in popular media as a [[supermoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309230240/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|archive-date=9 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 March 2011, there was another full \"supermoon\", closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507035348/https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|archive-date=7 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2016, there was another full \"supermoon\"; this time it was closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Formula ===\nThe date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349\u2013354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}</ref>\n:<math> d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \\times N + 102.026 \\times 10^{-12} \\times N^2</math>\nwhere ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':\n: <math>-0.000739 - (235 \\times 10^{-12})\\times N^2</math> days\nwhere ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000.

A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14\u00b0 with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs about every six months, and often two weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during a [[new moon]] around the opposite node.\n\n==In folklore and tradition==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}\n[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|A full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]\nFull moons are traditionally associated with [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various \"magical phenomena\" such as lycanthropy. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Moon Effect On Behavior Minimal, Studies Say|date=6 February 2004|work=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html}}</ref> They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.\n\n===Full moon names===\nHistorically, month names are names of moons ([[lunation]]s, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \"moon\" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] around AD 700).\n\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, such as \"[[blue moon]]\", as well as \"harvest moon\" and \"hunter's moon\" for the full moons of autumn.\n\n[[Lunar eclipse]]s occur only at a full moon and often cause a reddish hue on the [[near side of the Moon]].

They appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the Moon.\n''Mysteries of the Moon'' by Patricia Haddock (\"Great Mysteries Series\", Greenhaven Press, 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with.<ref>repeated in ''The Moon Book'' by Kim Long (1998:[https://books.google.com/books?id=e6-ddrk3nxsC&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false 102ff.]) Also in ''Llewellyn's 1996 Moon Sign Book'' (1995)</ref> Haddock supposes that certain \"Colonial American\" moon names were adopted from [[Algonquian languages]] (which were formerly spoken in the territory of New England), while others are based in European tradition (e.g. the Colonial American names for the May moon, \"Milk Moon\", \"Mother's Moon\", \"Hare Moon\" have no parallels in the supposed native names, while the name of November, \"Beaver Moon\" is supposedly based in an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language).\n\nThe individual names (some inconsistent) given in ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', which is not authoritative, include the following:{{clarify|date=May 2013}}<!--treating farmersalmanac.com as the primary source for this.

Evidence of this is noted in the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]] in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. Passover falls on the full moon on 15 Nisan of the Hebrew calendar. The date of the Jewish [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Sukkot]] festivals along with all other [[Jewish holidays]] are dependent on the dates of the new moons.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 23:4\u20137, 33\u201335.</ref>\n\n===Intercalary months===\n{{main|Intercalary month}}\nIn lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the [[Metonic cycle]], or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the [[Hebrew Calendar]] this is noted with a periodic extra month of [[Adar]] in the early spring.\n\n==== Blue moon====\n{{further|Blue moon}}\nIn the modern system of \"traditional\" full moon names tied to the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term \"blue moon\" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well-known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).<ref>\nThe saying \"once in a blue moon\" meaning \"very rarely\" is recorded since the 1820s.\nThe term \"blue moon\" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a \"blue moon\" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.<ref>Farmers' Almanac, \"What is a blue moon?\", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124181408/https://www.farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon/ |date=2018-01-24 }}.</ref> These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the Sun. To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1:48 am on 23 March, 9:15 am on 22 June, 4:42 pm on 21 September and 12:10 am on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4:39 am on 21 March, 11:09 pm on 21 June, 2:42 pm on 23 September and 10:30 am on 22 December (all times GMT). Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine, \"blue moon\" has also been used in the sense of \"the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as \"erroneous\" by ''Sky & Telescope'' in 1999).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |title=''Sky and Telescope'' \"What's a blue moon?\" |access-date=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327035511/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |archive-date=2014-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to either definition, \"blue moons\" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of \"full moon names\" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Lunar phase]]\n* [[Month]]\n* [[Near side of the Moon]]\n* [[New moon]]\n* [[Orbit of the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Full moon}}\n* [http://stardate.org/nightsky/moon/ Moon phase calculator]\n* {{youtube|n2MtEsrcTTs|Neil Young \u2013 Harvest Moon}}\n\n{{The Moon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full Moon}}\n[[Category:Full moon| ]]\n[[Category:Phases of the Moon]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Full moon (disambiguation)|Harvest moon (disambiguation)|Hunter's moon (disambiguation)}}\n{{redirect|Strawberry Moon| the jazz album by Grover Washington Jr.|Strawberry Moon (album)}}\n{{short description|Lunar phase: completely illuminated disc}}\n[[File:Supermoon Nov-14-2016-minneapolis.jpg|thumb|The [[supermoon]] of 14 November 2016 was {{convert|356511|km|mi|abbr=on}} away<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sivertimes.com/super-moon-exceptional-brightest-moon-in-the-sky-of-normandy-monday-november-14/1872 |title='Super Moon' ExceptIonal Brightest Moon in the Sky of Normandy, Monday, November 14 |date=2016-11-12 |website=silvertimes.com|accessdate=2017-02-08}}</ref> from the center of Earth.

The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]\n\n\nThe '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (astronomy)|differ by 180\u00b0]]).<ref>[P.&nbsp;Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/131123ExplanatorySupplementAstronomicalAlmanac/page/n253 \"Phases of the Moon\"], ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac: A Revision to the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac'', (Mill Valley: University Science Books, 1992), p.&nbsp;478.</ref> This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth \u2013 the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] \u2013 is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs roughly once a [[month]].\n\nThe time interval between a full (or new) moon and the next repetition of the same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be either 29 or 30 days long.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). By definition, its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing stops. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\n\nMany [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when prepared for a different [[time zone]].\n\nThe full moon is generally a suboptimal time for [[astronomical observation]] of the Moon because shadows vanish. It is a poor time for other observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon, amplified by the [[opposition surge]], then [[skyglow|outshines]] many stars.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon was [[perigee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time in the previous 15 years. This was referred to in popular media as a [[supermoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309230240/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|archive-date=9 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 March 2011, there was another full \"supermoon\", closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507035348/https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|archive-date=7 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2016, there was another full \"supermoon\"; this time it was closer to the Earth than at any time in the previous 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Formula ===\nThe date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349\u2013354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}</ref>\n:<math> d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \\times N + 102.026 \\times 10^{-12} \\times N^2</math>\nwhere ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':\n: <math>-0.000739 - (235 \\times 10^{-12})\\times N^2</math> days\nwhere ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000.

A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14\u00b0 with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs about every six months, and often two weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during a [[new moon]] around the opposite node.\n\n==In folklore and tradition==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}\n[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|A full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]\nFull moons are traditionally associated with [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various \"magical phenomena\" such as lycanthropy.

The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.\n\n===Full moon names===\nHistorically, month names are names of moons ([[lunation]]s, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendar]]s. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \"moon\" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] around AD 700).\n\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, such as \"[[blue moon]]\", as well as \"harvest moon\" and \"hunter's moon\" for the full moons of autumn.\n\n[[Lunar eclipse]]s occur only at a full moon and often cause a reddish hue on the [[near side of the Moon]].

Hence, no long period of darkness occurred between sunset and moonrise for several days after the full moon,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://calgary.rasc.ca/sunset_moonrise.htm |title=Sunset and Moonrise |first=Larry |last=McNish |publisher=RASC Calgary Centre |year=2007 |quote=This gives a graph showing the effect as seen from Calgary, for the whole of the year 2007.}}</ref> thus lengthening the time in the evening when there is enough [[twilight]] and [[moonlight]] to work to get the harvest in.\n\n====Farmers' Almanacs====\nThe ''[[Maine Farmers' Almanac]]'' from around the 1930s began to publish Native American \"Indian\" full moon names.

They appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the Moon.\n''Mysteries of the Moon'' by Patricia Haddock (\"Great Mysteries Series\", Greenhaven Press, 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with.<ref>repeated in ''The Moon Book'' by Kim Long (1998:[https://books.google.com/books?id=e6-ddrk3nxsC&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false 102ff.]) Also in ''Llewellyn's 1996 Moon Sign Book'' (1995)</ref> Haddock supposes that certain \"Colonial American\" moon names were adopted from [[Algonquian languages]] (which were formerly spoken in the territory of New England), while others are based in European tradition (e.g. the Colonial American names for the May moon, \"Milk Moon\", \"Mother's Moon\", \"Hare Moon\" have no parallels in the supposed native names, while the name of November, \"Beaver Moon\" is supposedly based in an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language).\n\nThe individual names (some inconsistent) given in ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', which is not authoritative, include the following:{{clarify|date=May 2013}}<!--treating farmersalmanac.com as the primary source for this. But research is needed, the farmersalmanac.com page is undated, and they seem to be fiddling with it all the time, making up new names as they go along.

Evidence of this is noted in the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]] in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. Passover falls on the full moon on 15 Nisan of the Hebrew calendar. The date of the Jewish [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Sukkot]] festivals along with all other [[Jewish holidays]] are dependent on the dates of the new moons.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 23:4\u20137, 33\u201335.</ref>\n\n===Intercalary months===\n{{main|Intercalary month}}\nIn lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the [[Metonic cycle]], or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the [[Hebrew Calendar]] this is noted with a periodic extra month of [[Adar]] in the early spring.\n\n==== Blue moon====\n{{further|Blue moon}}\nIn the modern system of \"traditional\" full moon names tied to the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term \"blue moon\" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well-known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).<ref>\nThe saying \"once in a blue moon\" meaning \"very rarely\" is recorded since the 1820s.\nThe term \"blue moon\" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a \"blue moon\" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.<ref>Farmers' Almanac, \"What is a blue moon?\", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124181408/https://www.farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon/ |date=2018-01-24 }}.</ref> These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the Sun. To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1:48 am on 23 March, 9:15 am on 22 June, 4:42 pm on 21 September and 12:10 am on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4:39 am on 21 March, 11:09 pm on 21 June, 2:42 pm on 23 September and 10:30 am on 22 December (all times GMT). Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine, \"blue moon\" has also been used in the sense of \"the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as \"erroneous\" by ''Sky & Telescope'' in 1999).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |title=''Sky and Telescope'' \"What's a blue moon?\" |access-date=2009-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327035511/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html |archive-date=2014-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to either definition, \"blue moons\" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of \"full moon names\" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Lunar phase]]\n* [[Month]]\n* [[Near side of the Moon]]\n* [[New moon]]\n* [[Orbit of the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Full moon}}\n* [http://stardate.org/nightsky/moon/ Moon phase calculator]\n* {{youtube|n2MtEsrcTTs|Neil Young \u2013 Harvest Moon}}\n\n{{The Moon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full Moon}}\n[[Category:Full moon| ]]\n[[Category:Phases of the Moon]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]\n", "name_user": "Sharper", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:spacing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon"}

As they became more successful, Lee and Marie began performing with the group, and they were augmented by pop/R&B singer Judy Clay, whom Lee had unofficially adopted. [[Elvis Presley]] eventually expressed an interest in having them join his touring entourage.

After personnel changes (Dionne and Doris left the group after achieving solo success), the Gospelaires became the recording group [[the Sweet Inspirations]], who had some chart success, but were much sought-after as studio background singers. The Gospelaires and later the Sweet Inspirations performed on many records cut in New York City for artists such as [[Garnet Mimms]], [[the Drifters]], [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], Solomon Burke and later Warwick's recordings, Aretha Franklin and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> Warwick recalled, in her 2002 [[A&E Network|A&E]] Biography, that \"a man came running frantically backstage at the Apollo and said he needed background singers for a session for [[Sam Taylor (saxophonist)|Sam \"the Man\" Taylor]] and old big-mouth here spoke up and said 'We'll do it!' and we left and did the session.

Soon, the group were in demand in New York music circles for their background work for such artists as the Drifters, [[Ben E. King]], [[Chuck Jackson]], [[Dinah Washington]], [[Ronnie Hawkins|Ronnie \"the Hawk\" Hawkins]], and [[Solomon Burke]], among many others. Warwick remembered, in her [[A&E Biography]],{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}} that after school, they would catch a bus from East Orange to the Port Authority Terminal, then take the subway to recording studios in Manhattan, perform their background gigs and be back at home in East Orange in time to do their school homework.

What emotion I could get away with!\" And what complexity, compared with the usual run of pop songs. During the session, Bacharach asked Warwick if she would be interested in recording demonstration recordings of his compositions to pitch the tunes to record labels. One such demo, \"It's Love That Really Counts\" \u2014 destined to be recorded by Scepter-signed act [[the Shirelles]] \u2014 caught the attention of the President of [[Scepter Records]], [[Florence Greenberg]], who, according to ''[[Current Biography]]'' (1969 Yearbook), told Bacharach, \"Forget the song, get the girl!\"<ref name=\"fgreenberg\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/04/arts/florence-greenberg-82-pop-record-producer.html Obituary for Florence Greenberg], nytimes.com, November 4, 1995; accessed July 27, 2015.</ref>\n\nWarwick was signed to Bacharach's and David's production company, according to Warwick, which in turn was signed to Scepter Records in 1962 by Greenberg. The partnership would provide Bacharach with the freedom to produce Warwick without the control of recording company executives and company [[A&R]] men. Warwick's musical ability and education would also allow Bacharach to compose more challenging tunes.<ref name=pc24/> The demo version of \"It's Love That Really Counts\", along with her original demo of \"Make It Easy on Yourself\", would surface on Warwick's debut Scepter album, ''[[Presenting Dionne Warwick]]'', which was released in early 1963.<ref name=\"fgreenberg\"/>\n\n===Early stardom===\nIn November 1962, Scepter Records released her first solo single, \"[[Don't Make Me Over (song)|Don't Make Me Over]]\", the title of which (according to the A&E Biography of Dionne Warwick) Warwick supplied herself when she snapped the phrase at producers Burt Bacharach and Hal David in anger. Warwick had found out that \"[[Make It Easy on Yourself]]\" \u2014 a song on which she had recorded the original demo and had wanted to be her first single release \u2014 had been given to another artist, Jerry Butler.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> From the phrase \"don't make me over\", Bacharach and David created their first top 40 pop hit (#21) and a top 5 U.S. R&B hit.

This was followed by \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" in April 1964, another major international hit and million seller that solidified her career. For the rest of the 1960s, Warwick was a fixture on the U.S. and Canadian charts, and much of her output from 1962 to 1971 was written and produced by the Bacharach/David team.\n\nWarwick weathered the [[British Invasion]] better than most American artists. Her biggest [[United Kingdom|UK]] hits were \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" and \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]?\"<ref name=pc24/> In the UK, a number of Bacharach-David-Warwick songs were recorded by [[UK|British]] singers [[Cilla Black]], [[Sandie Shaw]] and [[Dusty Springfield]], most notably Black's \"[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]\" which went to No. 1 in the UK. This upset Warwick, who described feeling insulted when told that in the UK, record company executives wanted her songs recorded by someone else. Warwick even met Cilla Black while on tour in Britain. She recalled what she said to her: \"I told her that \"[[You're My World]]\" would be my next single in the States. I honestly believe that if I'd sneezed on my next record, then Cilla would have sneezed on hers too.

''Cash Box'' named her the Top Female Vocalist in 1969, 1970 and 1971. In the 1967 ''Cash Box'' poll, she was second to [[Petula Clark]], and in 1968's poll second to Aretha Franklin. ''[[Playboy]]''{{'}}s influential Music Poll of 1970 named her the Top Female Vocalist.

A new song was composed and recorded in the eleventh hour titled \"Thunderball\", performed by Tom Jones. The melody of \"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" remains a major component of the film score. The Ultimate Edition DVD of ''Thunderball'' has the Warwick song playing over the titles on one of the commentary track extras, and the song was released on the 30th anniversary CD of Bond songs.\n\n===Mid-1960s to early 1970s===\n[[File:Dionne Warwick television special 1969.JPG|thumb|Dionne Warwick 1969]]\nThe mid-1960s to early 1970s were an even more successful time period for Warwick, who saw a string of gold-selling albums and Top 20 and Top 10 hit singles. \"[[Message to Michael]]\", a Bacharach-David composition<ref name=pc24/> that the duo was certain was a \"man's song\", became a top 10 hit for Warwick in May 1966. The January 1967 LP ''Here Where There Is Love'' was her first [[RIAA]] certified Gold album, and featured \"[[Alfie (Burt Bacharach song)|Alfie]]\" and two 1966 hits: \"Trains and Boats and Planes\" and \"[[I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself]]\". \"Alfie\" had become a radio hit when disc jockeys across the nation began to play the album cut early in 1967. \"Alfie\" was released as the \"B\" side of a Bacharach/David ballad, \"The Beginning of Loneliness\", which charted in the Hot 100. Disc jockeys flipped the single and made it a double-sided hit. Bacharach had been contracted to produce \"Alfie\" for the [[Michael Caine]] film of the same name and wanted Warwick to sing the tune, but the British producers wanted a British subject to cut the tune. [[Cilla Black]] was selected to record the song, and her version peaked at #95 upon its release in the US. A cover version by [[Cher]] used in the American prints of the film peaked at #33. In the UK and [[Australia]], Black's version was a Top 10 hit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nHer follow-up to \"I Say a Little Prayer,\" \"[[(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls]],\" was unusual in several respects. It was not written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; it was the \"B\" side of her \"I Say a Little Prayer\" single, and it was a song that she almost didn't record. While the film version of ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'' was being made, actress [[Barbara Parkins]] suggested that Warwick be considered to sing the film's theme song, written by songwriting team [[Andr\u00e9 Previn|Andr\u00e9]] and [[Dory Previn]]. The song was to be recorded by [[Judy Garland]], who was subsequently fired from the film. Warwick performed the song, and when the film became a success in the early weeks of 1968, disc jockeys flipped the single and made the single one of the biggest double-sided hits of the rock era and another million seller. At the time, RIAA rules allowed only one side of a double-sided hit single to be certified as gold, but Scepter awarded Warwick an \"in-house award\" to recognize \"(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls\" as a million selling tune.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nWarwick had re-recorded a Pat Williams-arranged version of the theme at A&R Studios in New York because contractual restrictions with her label would not allow the Warwick version from the film to be included on the [[20th Century Fox]] soundtrack LP, and reverse legal restrictions would not allow the film version to be used anyplace else in a commercial LP. The LP ''[[Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls]]'', released in early 1968 and containing the re-recorded version of the movie theme (#2\u20134 weeks), \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]?\" and several new Bacharach-David compositions, hit the #6 position on the ''Billboard'' album chart and would remain on the chart for over a year. The film soundtrack LP, without Warwick vocals, failed to impress the public, while ''Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls'' earned an RIAA Gold certification.\n\nThe single \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]?\" (an international million seller and a Top 10 hit in several countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Japan and Mexico) was also a double-sided hit, with the \"B\" side \"Let Me Be Lonely\" charting at #79. More hits followed into 1971, including \"Who Is Gonna Love Me\" (#32, 1968) with \"B\" side, \"[[(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me]]\" becoming another double-sided hit; \"Promises, Promises\" (#19, 1968); \"[[This Guy's in Love with You|This Girl's in Love with You]]\" (#7, 1969); \"The April Fools\" (#37, 1969); \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" (#15, 1969); \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" (#6 Pop, #1 AC, 1969); \"[[Make It Easy on Yourself]]\" (#37 Pop, #10 AC, 1970); \"Let Me Go to Him\" (#32 Pop, #4 AC), 1970); and \"Paper Mache\" (#43 Pop, #3 AC), 1970). Warwick's final Bacharach/David penned single on the Scepter label was March 1971's \"Who Gets the Guy\" (#52 Pop, #6 AC), 1971), and her final \"official\" Scepter single release was \"He's Moving On\" b/w \"Amanda\", (#83 Pop, #12 AC) both from the soundtrack of the motion picture adaptation of [[Jacqueline Susann]]'s ''[[The Love Machine (film)|The Love Machine]]''. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nWarwick had become the priority act of Scepter Records, according to the website \"The Scepter Records Story\" and producer/A&R chief, [[Luther Dixon]] in a 2002 A&E Biography of Burt Bacharach, with the release of \"[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]\" in 1963. Other Scepter LPs certified RIAA Gold include ''Dionne Warwick's Golden Hits Part 1'' released in 1967 and ''The Dionne Warwicke Story: A Decade of Gold'' released in 1971. By the end of 1971, Warwick had sold an estimated 35 million singles and albums internationally in less than nine years and more than 16 million singles in the U.S. alone. Exact figures of her sales are unknown and probably underestimated, due to Scepter Records' apparently lax accounting policies and the company policy of not submitting recordings for RIAA audit. Warwick became the first Scepter artist to request RIAA audits of her recordings in 1967 with the release of \"I Say a Little Prayer.\"\n\nOn September 17, 1969, [[CBS Television]] aired Warwick's first television special, entitled \"The Dionne Warwick Chevy Special.\" Warwick's guests were Burt Bacharach, [[George Kirby]], [[Glen Campbell]], and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\n[[File:Pat Nixon with Dionne Warwick.jpg|thumb|right|Warwick with First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], 1971]]\n\nIn 1971, Warwick left the family atmosphere of Scepter Records for [[Warner Bros. Records]], for a $5 million contract, the most lucrative recording contract ever given to a female vocalist up to that time, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Warwick's last LP for Scepter was the aforementioned soundtrack for the motion picture ''The Love Machine'' (in which she appeared in an uncredited cameo), released in July 1971. In 1975, Bacharach and David sued Scepter Records for an accurate accounting of royalties due the team from their recordings with Warwick and labelmate [[B.J. Thomas]]. They were awarded almost $600,000 and the rights to all Bacharach/David recordings on the Scepter label. The label, with the defection of Warwick to Warner Bros. Records, filed for bankruptcy in 1975 and was sold to Springboard International Records in 1976.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nFollowing her signing with Warners, with Bacharach and David as writers and producers, Warwick returned to New York City's A&R Studios in late 1971 to begin recording her first album for the new label, the self-titled ''Dionne'' (not to be confused with her later Arista debut album) in January 1972. The album peaked at #57 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Album Chart. In 1972, Burt Bacharach and Hal David scored and wrote the tunes for the motion picture ''[[Lost Horizon]]''. However, the film was panned by the critics, and in the fallout, the songwriting duo decided to terminate their working relationship. The break-up left Warwick devoid of their services as her producers and songwriters. She was contractually obligated to fulfill her contract with Warners without Bacharach and David, and she would team with a variety of producers during her tenure with the label.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nFaced with the prospect of being sued by Warner Bros. Records due to the breakup of Bacharach/David and their failure to honor their contract with Warwick, she filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against her former partners for breach of contract. The suit was settled out of court in 1979 for $5 million, including the rights to all Warwick recordings produced by Bacharach and David.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nAlso in 1971, Warwick had her name changed to \"Warwicke\" per the advice of [[Linda Goodman]], an astrologer friend, who believed it would bring greater success. A few years later, she reverted to the old spelling after a string of disappointments and an absence from the ''Billboard'' top 40.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Eldridge |first=Allison |title=Dionne Warwick |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dionne-Warwick |date= March 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Warner era (1972\u20131978)===\nWithout the guidance and songwriting that Bacharach/David had provided, Warwick's career stalled in the early 1970s although she remained a top concert draw throughout the world. There were no big hits during the early and mid part of the decade, aside from 1974's \"[[Then Came You (Dionne Warwick & The Spinners song)|Then Came You]]\", recorded as a duet with the [[The Spinners (American band)|Spinners]] and produced by [[Thom Bell]]. Bell later noted, \"Dionne made a (strange) face when we finished [the song]. She didn't like it much, but I knew we had something. So we ripped a dollar in two, signed each half and exchanged them. I told her, 'If it doesn't go number one, I'll send you my half.' When it took off, Dionne sent hers back. There was an apology on it.\" It was her first U.S. #1 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Other than this success, Warwick's five years on [[Warner Bros. Records]] produced no other major hits, but \"Then Came You\" was issued by co-owned [[Atlantic Records]], the Spinners' label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/453202|title=Dionne Warwicke And Spinners - Then Came You|accessdate=May 19, 2019|website=45cat.com}}</ref> Two notable songs recorded during this period were \"His House and Me\" and \"Once You Hit The Road\" (#79 pop, #5 R&B, #22 Adult Contemporary), both of which were produced in 1975 by [[Thom Bell]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nWarwick recorded five albums with Warners: ''[[Dionne (album)|Dionne]]'' (1972), produced by Bacharach and David and a modest chart success; ''Just Being Myself'' (1973), produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland;\n''Then Came You'' (1975), produced by [[Jerry Ragovoy]]; ''Track of the Cat'' (1975), produced by [[Thom Bell]]; and ''[[Love at First Sight (album)|Love at First Sight]]'' (1977), produced by [[Steve Barri]] and [[Michael Omartian]]. Her five-year contract with Warners expired in 1977, and with that, she ended her stay at the label. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Warwick's dry spell on the American charts ended with her signing to Arista Records in 1979, where she began a second highly successful run of hit records and albums well into the late 1980s.\n\n===Move to Arista, 1979===\n[[File:Dionne Warwick Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Dionne Warwick by Allan Warren]]\nWith the move to Arista Records and the release of her RIAA-certified million seller \"[[I'll Never Love This Way Again]]\" in 1979, Warwick was again enjoying top success on the charts. The song was produced by [[Barry Manilow]]. The accompanying album, ''[[Dionne (album)|Dionne]]'', was [[Platinum certification|certified Platinum]] in the United States for sales exceeding one million units. The album peaked at #12 on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart and made the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' R&B Albums Chart. Warwick had been personally signed and guided by the label's founder [[Clive Davis]], who told her, \"You may be ready to give the business up, but the business is not ready to give you up.\"<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> Warwick's next single release was another major hit. \"[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Dionne Warwick song)|Deja Vu]]\" was co-written by [[Isaac Hayes]] and hit #1 Adult Contemporary as well as #15 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100. In 1980, Warwick won the NARAS Grammy Awards for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female]] for \"[[I'll Never Love This Way Again]]\" and [[Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female]] for \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\". She became the first female artist in the history of the awards to win in both categories the same year.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" /> Her second Arista album, 1980's ''[[No Night So Long]]'' sold 500,000 U.S. copies and featured the title track which became a major success \u2014 hitting #1 Adult Contemporary and #23 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20132001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=254}}</ref> \u2014 and the album peaked at #23 on the ''Billboard'' Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/albums/no+night+so+long|title=Album Search for \"no night so long\"|website=AllMusic|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1980, while under contract to Arista Records, Warwick hosted a two-hour TV special called ''Solid Gold '79''. This was adapted into the weekly one-hour show ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'', which she hosted throughout 1980 and 1981 and again in 1985\u201386. Major highlights of each show were the duets she performed with her co-hosts, which often included some of Warwick's hits and her co-hosts' hits, intermingled and arranged by ''Solid Gold'' musical director Michael Miller. Another highlight in each show was Warwick's vocal rendition of the ''Solid Gold'' theme, composed by Miller (with lyrics by [[Dean Pitchford]]).<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nAfter a brief appearance in the Top Forty in early 1982 with [[Johnny Mathis]] on \"Friends in Love\" \u2014 from the album of the same name \u2014 Warwick's next hit later that same year was her full-length collaboration with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] for the album ''[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick album)|Heartbreaker]]''. The song became one of Warwick's biggest international hits, returning her to the Top 10 of [[Billboard's Hot 100]] as well as #1 Adult Contemporary and No. 2 in both [[UK|Great Britain]] and [[Australia]]. The tune was also a Top 10 hit throughout continental Europe, Australia (#1), [[Japan]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]] and [[Asia]]. The title track was taken from the album of the same name which sold over 3 million copies internationally and earned Warwick an [[RIAA]] USA [[Music recording sales certification|Gold record]] award for the album. In Britain, the disc was certified Platinum. Warwick later stated to Wesley Hyatt in his ''Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits'' that she was not initially fond of \"[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick song)|Heartbreaker]]\" but recorded the tune because she trusted the Bee Gees' judgment that it would be a hit. The project came about when [[Clive Davis]] was attending his aunt's wedding in Orlando, Florida in early 1982 and spoke with Barry Gibb. Gibb mentioned that he had always been a fan of Warwick's, and Davis arranged for Warwick and the Bee Gees to discuss a project. Warwick and the Gibb brothers obviously hit it off as both the album and the title single were released in October 1982 to massive success.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nIn 1983, Warwick released ''[[How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye]]'', produced by [[Luther Vandross]]. The album's most successful single was the title track, \"[[How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye]]\", a Warwick/Vandross duet, which peaked at #27 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It also became a Top 10 hit on the Adult Contemporary and R&B charts. The album peaked at #57 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. Of note was a reunion with the original [[Shirelles]] on Warwick's cover of \"Will You (Still) Love Me Tomorrow?\" The album ''[[Finder of Lost Loves (album)|Finder Of Lost Loves]]'' followed in 1984 and reunited her with both [[Barry Manilow]] and Burt Bacharach, who was writing with his then current lyricist partner and wife, [[Carole Bayer Sager]]. In 1985, Warwick contributed her voice to the multi-[[Grammy Award]] winning charity song [[We Are the World]], along with vocalists like [[Michael Jackson]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Ray Charles]]. The song spent four consecutive weeks at #1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. It was the year's biggest hit \u2014 certified four times Platinum in the United States alone.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nIn 1985, Warwick recorded the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] (AmFAR) benefit single \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\" alongside [[Gladys Knight]], [[Elton John]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]. The single, credited to \"Dionne and Friends\", was released in October and eventually raised over three million dollars for that cause. The tune was a triple #1 \u2014 R&B, Adult Contemporary, and four weeks at the summit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in early 1986 \u2014 selling close to two million 45s in the United States alone. \"Working against AIDS, especially after years of raising money for work on many blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, seemed the right thing to do. You have to be granite not to want to help people with AIDS, because the devastation that it causes is so painful to see. I was so hurt to see my friend die with such agony,\" Warwick told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 1988. \"I am tired of hurting and it does hurt.\" The single won the performers the [[NARAS]] Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, as well as Song of the Year for its writers, Bacharach and Bayer Sager. It also was ranked by Billboard magazine as the most popular song of 1986. With this single Warwick also released her most successful album of the 1980s, titled ''[[Friends (Dionne Warwick album)|Friends]]'', which reached #12 on Billboard's album chart.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nIn 1987 Warwick scored another hit with \"[[Love Power (Dionne Warwick song)|Love Power]]\". Her eighth career #1 Adult Contemporary hit, it also reached #5 in R&B and #12 on Billboard's Hot 100. A duet with [[Jeffrey Osborne]], it was also written by Burt Bacharach and [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and it was featured in Warwick's album ''[[Reservations for Two]]''. The album's title song, a duet with [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], was also a chart hit.

The [[900 number]] [[psychic]] service was active from 1991 to 1998. According to press statements throughout the 1990s, the program was the most successful infomercial for several years and Warwick earned in excess of three million dollars per year as spokesperson for the network.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> In 1998, Inphomation, the corporation owning the network, filed for bankruptcy and Warwick ended her association with the organization. Warwick's longtime friend and tour manager Henry Carr acknowledged in a 2002 Biography Channel interview that \"when Dionne was going through an airport and a child recognized her as 'that psychic lady on TV,' Dionne was crushed and said she had worked too hard as an entertainer to become known as 'the psychic lady.'\"\n\nWarwick's most publicized album during this period was 1993's ''[[Friends Can Be Lovers]]'', which was produced in part by Ian Devaney and [[Lisa Stansfield]]. Featured on the album was \"Sunny Weather Lover\", which was the first song that Burt Bacharach and Hal David had written together for Warwick since 1972. It was Warwick's lead single in the United States, and was heavily promoted by [[Arista Records|Arista]], but failed to chart. A follow-up \"Where My Lips Have Been\" peaked at #95 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]]. The 1994 ''Aquarela Do Brasil'' album marked the end of Warwick's contract with Arista Records.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> In 1990, Warwick recorded the song \"[[It's All Over (Blue System song)|It's All Over]]\" with former member of [[Modern Talking]] [[Dieter Bohlen]] ([[Blue System]]).

ABC alleged the Foundation was operating at a near 90% administrative cost. ABC alleged that Warwick flew first class and was accommodated at first-class hotels for charity concerts and events in which she participated for the Foundation. Warwick, who had no executive, administrative, or management role in the organization, challenged ABC to investigate the foundation further and alleged that the ABC report was racially motivated. An Internal Revenue Service investigation of the Warwick Foundation found no wrongdoing or criminal activity on the part of the Board of Directors or Warwick, and its status as a non-profit charity was upheld. ABC maintained the report to be factually correct, but the item has not been repeated since the original air date.

The original group (known as the Drinkard Jubilairs) consisted of Cissy, Anne, Larry, and Nicky, and later included Warwick's grandparents, Nicholas and Delia Drinkard, and their children: William, Lee (Warwick's mother) and Hansom.\n\nMarie instructed the group, and they were managed by Lee. As they became more successful, Lee and Marie began performing with the group, and they were augmented by pop/R&B singer Judy Clay, whom Lee had unofficially adopted. [[Elvis Presley]] eventually expressed an interest in having them join his touring entourage. Dionne began singing gospel as a child at the [[New Hope Baptist Church (Newark)|New Hope Baptist Church]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/njwomenshistory/Period_6/warwick.htm |title=New Jersey Women's History: Home Page |date=August 15, 2008 |website=Scc.rutgers.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321070513/http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/njwomenshistory/Period_6/warwick.htm |archivedate=March 21, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===The Gospelaires===\nOther singers joined the Gospelaires from time to time, including [[Judy Clay]], [[Cissy Houston]] and [[Doris Troy|Doris \"Rikii\" Troy]], whose chart selection \"Just One Look,\" when she recorded it in 1963, featured backing vocals from the Gospelaires. After personnel changes (Dionne and Doris left the group after achieving solo success), the Gospelaires became the recording group [[the Sweet Inspirations]], who had some chart success, but were much sought-after as studio background singers. The Gospelaires and later the Sweet Inspirations performed on many records cut in New York City for artists such as [[Garnet Mimms]], [[the Drifters]], [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], Solomon Burke and later Warwick's recordings, Aretha Franklin and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> Warwick recalled, in her 2002 [[A&E Network|A&E]] Biography, that \"a man came running frantically backstage at the Apollo and said he needed background singers for a session for [[Sam Taylor (saxophonist)|Sam \"the Man\" Taylor]] and old big-mouth here spoke up and said 'We'll do it!' and we left and did the session. I wish I remembered the gentleman's name because he was responsible for the beginning of my professional career.\" {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe backstage encounter led to the group being asked to sing background sessions at recording studios in New York. Soon, the group were in demand in New York music circles for their background work for such artists as the Drifters, [[Ben E.

Warwick remembered, in her [[A&E Biography]],{{full citation needed|date=March 2016}} that after school, they would catch a bus from East Orange to the Port Authority Terminal, then take the subway to recording studios in Manhattan, perform their background gigs and be back at home in East Orange in time to do their school homework.

What emotion I could get away with!\" And what complexity, compared with the usual run of pop songs. During the session, Bacharach asked Warwick if she would be interested in recording demonstration recordings of his compositions to pitch the tunes to record labels. One such demo, \"It's Love That Really Counts\" \u2014 destined to be recorded by Scepter-signed act [[the Shirelles]] \u2014 caught the attention of the President of [[Scepter Records]], [[Florence Greenberg]], who, according to ''[[Current Biography]]'' (1969 Yearbook), told Bacharach, \"Forget the song, get the girl!\"<ref name=\"fgreenberg\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/04/arts/florence-greenberg-82-pop-record-producer.html Obituary for Florence Greenberg], nytimes.com, November 4, 1995; accessed July 27, 2015.</ref>\n\nWarwick was signed to Bacharach's and David's production company, according to Warwick, which in turn was signed to Scepter Records in 1962 by Greenberg. The partnership would provide Bacharach with the freedom to produce Warwick without the control of recording company executives and company [[A&R]] men. Warwick's musical ability and education would also allow Bacharach to compose more challenging tunes.<ref name=pc24/> The demo version of \"It's Love That Really Counts\", along with her original demo of \"Make It Easy on Yourself\", would surface on Warwick's debut Scepter album, ''[[Presenting Dionne Warwick]]'', which was released in early 1963.<ref name=\"fgreenberg\"/>\n\n===Early stardom===\nIn November 1962, Scepter Records released her first solo single, \"[[Don't Make Me Over (song)|Don't Make Me Over]]\", the title of which (according to the A&E Biography of Dionne Warwick) Warwick supplied herself when she snapped the phrase at producers Burt Bacharach and Hal David in anger.

This was followed by \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" in April 1964, another major international hit and million seller that solidified her career. For the rest of the 1960s, Warwick was a fixture on the U.S. and Canadian charts, and much of her output from 1962 to 1971 was written and produced by the Bacharach/David team.\n\nWarwick weathered the [[British Invasion]] better than most American artists. Her biggest [[United Kingdom|UK]] hits were \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" and \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]?\"<ref name=pc24/> In the UK, a number of Bacharach-David-Warwick songs were recorded by [[UK|British]] singers [[Cilla Black]], [[Sandie Shaw]] and [[Dusty Springfield]], most notably Black's \"[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]\" which went to No. 1 in the UK. This upset Warwick, who described feeling insulted when told that in the UK, record company executives wanted her songs recorded by someone else. Warwick even met Cilla Black while on tour in Britain. She recalled what she said to her: \"I told her that \"[[You're My World]]\" would be my next single in the States. I honestly believe that if I'd sneezed on my next record, then Cilla would have sneezed on hers too.

''Cash Box'' named her the Top Female Vocalist in 1969, 1970 and 1971. In the 1967 ''Cash Box'' poll, she was second to [[Petula Clark]], and in 1968's poll second to Aretha Franklin. ''[[Playboy]]''{{'}}s influential Music Poll of 1970 named her the Top Female Vocalist.

Scholarly articles probe the relationship between the Beatles and the nouvelle vague films of Jean-Luc Godard, discuss \"the brio and elegance\" of Dionne Warwick's singing style as a 'pleasurable but complex' event to be 'experienced without condescension.'

For inspirational purposes, such hip artists as Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers and [[Andy Warhol]] occasionally paint while listening to rock 'n' roll music.

A new song was composed and recorded in the eleventh hour titled \"Thunderball\", performed by Tom Jones. The melody of \"Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" remains a major component of the film score. The Ultimate Edition DVD of ''Thunderball'' has the Warwick song playing over the titles on one of the commentary track extras, and the song was released on the 30th anniversary CD of Bond songs.\n\n===Mid-1960s to early 1970s===\n[[File:Dionne Warwick television special 1969.JPG|thumb|Dionne Warwick 1969]]\nThe mid-1960s to early 1970s were an even more successful time period for Warwick, who saw a string of gold-selling albums and Top 20 and Top 10 hit singles. \"[[Message to Michael]]\", a Bacharach-David composition<ref name=pc24/> that the duo was certain was a \"man's song\", became a top 10 hit for Warwick in May 1966. The January 1967 LP ''Here Where There Is Love'' was her first [[RIAA]] certified Gold album, and featured \"[[Alfie (Burt Bacharach song)|Alfie]]\" and two 1966 hits: \"Trains and Boats and Planes\" and \"[[I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself]]\". \"Alfie\" had become a radio hit when disc jockeys across the nation began to play the album cut early in 1967. \"Alfie\" was released as the \"B\" side of a Bacharach/David ballad, \"The Beginning of Loneliness\", which charted in the Hot 100. Disc jockeys flipped the single and made it a double-sided hit. Bacharach had been contracted to produce \"Alfie\" for the [[Michael Caine]] film of the same name and wanted Warwick to sing the tune, but the British producers wanted a British subject to cut the tune. [[Cilla Black]] was selected to record the song, and her version peaked at #95 upon its release in the US. A cover version by [[Cher]] used in the American prints of the film peaked at #33. In the UK and [[Australia]], Black's version was a Top 10 hit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nHer follow-up to \"I Say a Little Prayer,\" \"[[(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls]],\" was unusual in several respects. It was not written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; it was the \"B\" side of her \"I Say a Little Prayer\" single, and it was a song that she almost didn't record. While the film version of ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'' was being made, actress [[Barbara Parkins]] suggested that Warwick be considered to sing the film's theme song, written by songwriting team [[Andr\u00e9 Previn|Andr\u00e9]] and [[Dory Previn]]. The song was to be recorded by [[Judy Garland]], who was subsequently fired from the film. Warwick performed the song, and when the film became a success in the early weeks of 1968, disc jockeys flipped the single and made the single one of the biggest double-sided hits of the rock era and another million seller. At the time, RIAA rules allowed only one side of a double-sided hit single to be certified as gold, but Scepter awarded Warwick an \"in-house award\" to recognize \"(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls\" as a million selling tune.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nWarwick had re-recorded a Pat Williams-arranged version of the theme at A&R Studios in New York because contractual restrictions with her label would not allow the Warwick version from the film to be included on the [[20th Century Fox]] soundtrack LP, and reverse legal restrictions would not allow the film version to be used anyplace else in a commercial LP. The LP ''[[Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls]]'', released in early 1968 and containing the re-recorded version of the movie theme (#2\u20134 weeks), \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]?\" and several new Bacharach-David compositions, hit the #6 position on the ''Billboard'' album chart and would remain on the chart for over a year. The film soundtrack LP, without Warwick vocals, failed to impress the public, while ''Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls'' earned an RIAA Gold certification.\n\nThe single \"[[Do You Know the Way to San Jose]]?\" (an international million seller and a Top 10 hit in several countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Japan and Mexico) was also a double-sided hit, with the \"B\" side \"Let Me Be Lonely\" charting at #79. More hits followed into 1971, including \"Who Is Gonna Love Me\" (#32, 1968) with \"B\" side, \"[[(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me]]\" becoming another double-sided hit; \"Promises, Promises\" (#19, 1968); \"[[This Guy's in Love with You|This Girl's in Love with You]]\" (#7, 1969); \"The April Fools\" (#37, 1969); \"[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]\" (#15, 1969); \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" (#6 Pop, #1 AC, 1969); \"[[Make It Easy on Yourself]]\" (#37 Pop, #10 AC, 1970); \"Let Me Go to Him\" (#32 Pop, #4 AC), 1970); and \"Paper Mache\" (#43 Pop, #3 AC), 1970). Warwick's final Bacharach/David penned single on the Scepter label was March 1971's \"Who Gets the Guy\" (#52 Pop, #6 AC), 1971), and her final \"official\" Scepter single release was \"He's Moving On\" b/w \"Amanda\", (#83 Pop, #12 AC) both from the soundtrack of the motion picture adaptation of [[Jacqueline Susann]]'s ''[[The Love Machine (film)|The Love Machine]]''. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nWarwick had become the priority act of Scepter Records, according to the website \"The Scepter Records Story\" and producer/A&R chief, [[Luther Dixon]] in a 2002 A&E Biography of Burt Bacharach, with the release of \"[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]\" in 1963. Other Scepter LPs certified RIAA Gold include ''Dionne Warwick's Golden Hits Part 1'' released in 1967 and ''The Dionne Warwicke Story: A Decade of Gold'' released in 1971. By the end of 1971, Warwick had sold an estimated 35 million singles and albums internationally in less than nine years and more than 16 million singles in the U.S. alone. Exact figures of her sales are unknown and probably underestimated, due to Scepter Records' apparently lax accounting policies and the company policy of not submitting recordings for RIAA audit. Warwick became the first Scepter artist to request RIAA audits of her recordings in 1967 with the release of \"I Say a Little Prayer.\"\n\nOn September 17, 1969, [[CBS Television]] aired Warwick's first television special, entitled \"The Dionne Warwick Chevy Special.\" Warwick's guests were Burt Bacharach, [[George Kirby]], [[Glen Campbell]], and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\n[[File:Pat Nixon with Dionne Warwick.jpg|thumb|right|Warwick with First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], 1971]]\n\nIn 1971, Warwick left the family atmosphere of Scepter Records for [[Warner Bros. Records]], for a $5 million contract, the most lucrative recording contract ever given to a female vocalist up to that time, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Warwick's last LP for Scepter was the aforementioned soundtrack for the motion picture ''The Love Machine'' (in which she appeared in an uncredited cameo), released in July 1971. In 1975, Bacharach and David sued Scepter Records for an accurate accounting of royalties due the team from their recordings with Warwick and labelmate [[B.J. Thomas]]. They were awarded almost $600,000 and the rights to all Bacharach/David recordings on the Scepter label. The label, with the defection of Warwick to Warner Bros. Records, filed for bankruptcy in 1975 and was sold to Springboard International Records in 1976.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nFollowing her signing with Warners, with Bacharach and David as writers and producers, Warwick returned to New York City's A&R Studios in late 1971 to begin recording her first album for the new label, the self-titled ''Dionne'' (not to be confused with her later Arista debut album) in January 1972. The album peaked at #57 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Album Chart. In 1972, Burt Bacharach and Hal David scored and wrote the tunes for the motion picture ''[[Lost Horizon]]''. However, the film was panned by the critics, and in the fallout, the songwriting duo decided to terminate their working relationship. The break-up left Warwick devoid of their services as her producers and songwriters. She was contractually obligated to fulfill her contract with Warners without Bacharach and David, and she would team with a variety of producers during her tenure with the label.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nFaced with the prospect of being sued by Warner Bros. Records due to the breakup of Bacharach/David and their failure to honor their contract with Warwick, she filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against her former partners for breach of contract. The suit was settled out of court in 1979 for $5 million, including the rights to all Warwick recordings produced by Bacharach and David.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nAlso in 1971, Warwick had her name changed to \"Warwicke\" per the advice of [[Linda Goodman]], an astrologer friend, who believed it would bring greater success. A few years later, she reverted to the old spelling after a string of disappointments and an absence from the ''Billboard'' top 40.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Eldridge |first=Allison |title=Dionne Warwick |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dionne-Warwick |date= March 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Warner era (1972\u20131978)===\nWithout the guidance and songwriting that Bacharach/David had provided, Warwick's career stalled in the early 1970s although she remained a top concert draw throughout the world. There were no big hits during the early and mid part of the decade, aside from 1974's \"[[Then Came You (Dionne Warwick & The Spinners song)|Then Came You]]\", recorded as a duet with the [[The Spinners (American band)|Spinners]] and produced by [[Thom Bell]]. Bell later noted, \"Dionne made a (strange) face when we finished [the song]. She didn't like it much, but I knew we had something. So we ripped a dollar in two, signed each half and exchanged them. I told her, 'If it doesn't go number one, I'll send you my half.' When it took off, Dionne sent hers back. There was an apology on it.\" It was her first U.S. #1 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Other than this success, Warwick's five years on [[Warner Bros. Records]] produced no other major hits, but \"Then Came You\" was issued by co-owned [[Atlantic Records]], the Spinners' label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/453202|title=Dionne Warwicke And Spinners - Then Came You|accessdate=May 19, 2019|website=45cat.com}}</ref> Two notable songs recorded during this period were \"His House and Me\" and \"Once You Hit The Road\" (#79 pop, #5 R&B, #22 Adult Contemporary), both of which were produced in 1975 by [[Thom Bell]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nWarwick recorded five albums with Warners: ''[[Dionne (album)|Dionne]]'' (1972), produced by Bacharach and David and a modest chart success; ''Just Being Myself'' (1973), produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland;\n''Then Came You'' (1975), produced by [[Jerry Ragovoy]]; ''Track of the Cat'' (1975), produced by [[Thom Bell]]; and ''[[Love at First Sight (album)|Love at First Sight]]'' (1977), produced by [[Steve Barri]] and [[Michael Omartian]]. Her five-year contract with Warners expired in 1977, and with that, she ended her stay at the label. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Warwick's dry spell on the American charts ended with her signing to Arista Records in 1979, where she began a second highly successful run of hit records and albums well into the late 1980s.\n\n===Move to Arista, 1979===\n[[File:Dionne Warwick Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Dionne Warwick by Allan Warren]]\nWith the move to Arista Records and the release of her RIAA-certified million seller \"[[I'll Never Love This Way Again]]\" in 1979, Warwick was again enjoying top success on the charts. The song was produced by [[Barry Manilow]]. The accompanying album, ''[[Dionne (album)|Dionne]]'', was [[Platinum certification|certified Platinum]] in the United States for sales exceeding one million units. The album peaked at #12 on the ''Billboard'' Album Chart and made the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' R&B Albums Chart. Warwick had been personally signed and guided by the label's founder [[Clive Davis]], who told her, \"You may be ready to give the business up, but the business is not ready to give you up.\"<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> Warwick's next single release was another major hit. \"[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Dionne Warwick song)|Deja Vu]]\" was co-written by [[Isaac Hayes]] and hit #1 Adult Contemporary as well as #15 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100. In 1980, Warwick won the NARAS Grammy Awards for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female]] for \"[[I'll Never Love This Way Again]]\" and [[Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female]] for \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\". She became the first female artist in the history of the awards to win in both categories the same year.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" /> Her second Arista album, 1980's ''[[No Night So Long]]'' sold 500,000 U.S. copies and featured the title track which became a major success \u2014 hitting #1 Adult Contemporary and #23 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961\u20132001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=254}}</ref> \u2014 and the album peaked at #23 on the ''Billboard'' Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/albums/no+night+so+long|title=Album Search for \"no night so long\"|website=AllMusic|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1980, while under contract to Arista Records, Warwick hosted a two-hour TV special called ''Solid Gold '79''. This was adapted into the weekly one-hour show ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'', which she hosted throughout 1980 and 1981 and again in 1985\u201386. Major highlights of each show were the duets she performed with her co-hosts, which often included some of Warwick's hits and her co-hosts' hits, intermingled and arranged by ''Solid Gold'' musical director Michael Miller. Another highlight in each show was Warwick's vocal rendition of the ''Solid Gold'' theme, composed by Miller (with lyrics by [[Dean Pitchford]]).<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nAfter a brief appearance in the Top Forty in early 1982 with [[Johnny Mathis]] on \"Friends in Love\" \u2014 from the album of the same name \u2014 Warwick's next hit later that same year was her full-length collaboration with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] for the album ''[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick album)|Heartbreaker]]''. The song became one of Warwick's biggest international hits, returning her to the Top 10 of [[Billboard's Hot 100]] as well as #1 Adult Contemporary and No. 2 in both [[UK|Great Britain]] and [[Australia]]. The tune was also a Top 10 hit throughout continental Europe, Australia (#1), [[Japan]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]] and [[Asia]]. The title track was taken from the album of the same name which sold over 3 million copies internationally and earned Warwick an [[RIAA]] USA [[Music recording sales certification|Gold record]] award for the album. In Britain, the disc was certified Platinum. Warwick later stated to Wesley Hyatt in his ''Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits'' that she was not initially fond of \"[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick song)|Heartbreaker]]\" but recorded the tune because she trusted the Bee Gees' judgment that it would be a hit. The project came about when [[Clive Davis]] was attending his aunt's wedding in Orlando, Florida in early 1982 and spoke with Barry Gibb. Gibb mentioned that he had always been a fan of Warwick's, and Davis arranged for Warwick and the Bee Gees to discuss a project. Warwick and the Gibb brothers obviously hit it off as both the album and the title single were released in October 1982 to massive success.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nIn 1983, Warwick released ''[[How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye]]'', produced by [[Luther Vandross]]. The album's most successful single was the title track, \"[[How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye]]\", a Warwick/Vandross duet, which peaked at #27 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It also became a Top 10 hit on the Adult Contemporary and R&B charts. The album peaked at #57 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. Of note was a reunion with the original [[Shirelles]] on Warwick's cover of \"Will You (Still) Love Me Tomorrow?\" The album ''[[Finder of Lost Loves (album)|Finder Of Lost Loves]]'' followed in 1984 and reunited her with both [[Barry Manilow]] and Burt Bacharach, who was writing with his then current lyricist partner and wife, [[Carole Bayer Sager]]. In 1985, Warwick contributed her voice to the multi-[[Grammy Award]] winning charity song [[We Are the World]], along with vocalists like [[Michael Jackson]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Ray Charles]]. The song spent four consecutive weeks at #1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. It was the year's biggest hit \u2014 certified four times Platinum in the United States alone.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nIn 1985, Warwick recorded the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] (AmFAR) benefit single \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\" alongside [[Gladys Knight]], [[Elton John]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]. The single, credited to \"Dionne and Friends\", was released in October and eventually raised over three million dollars for that cause. The tune was a triple #1 \u2014 R&B, Adult Contemporary, and four weeks at the summit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in early 1986 \u2014 selling close to two million 45s in the United States alone. \"Working against AIDS, especially after years of raising money for work on many blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, seemed the right thing to do. You have to be granite not to want to help people with AIDS, because the devastation that it causes is so painful to see. I was so hurt to see my friend die with such agony,\" Warwick told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 1988. \"I am tired of hurting and it does hurt.\" The single won the performers the [[NARAS]] Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, as well as Song of the Year for its writers, Bacharach and Bayer Sager. It also was ranked by Billboard magazine as the most popular song of 1986. With this single Warwick also released her most successful album of the 1980s, titled ''[[Friends (Dionne Warwick album)|Friends]]'', which reached #12 on Billboard's album chart.<ref name=\"Dionne Warwick\" />\n\nIn 1987 Warwick scored another hit with \"[[Love Power (Dionne Warwick song)|Love Power]]\". Her eighth career #1 Adult Contemporary hit, it also reached #5 in R&B and #12 on Billboard's Hot 100. A duet with [[Jeffrey Osborne]], it was also written by Burt Bacharach and [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and it was featured in Warwick's album ''[[Reservations for Two]]''. The album's title song, a duet with [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], was also a chart hit.

The [[900 number]] [[psychic]] service was active from 1991 to 1998.

Warwick's longtime friend and tour manager Henry Carr acknowledged in a 2002 Biography Channel interview that \"when Dionne was going through an airport and a child recognized her as 'that psychic lady on TV,' Dionne was crushed and said she had worked too hard as an entertainer to become known as 'the psychic lady.'\"\n\nWarwick's most publicized album during this period was 1993's ''[[Friends Can Be Lovers]]'', which was produced in part by Ian Devaney and [[Lisa Stansfield]]. Featured on the album was \"Sunny Weather Lover\", which was the first song that Burt Bacharach and Hal David had written together for Warwick since 1972. It was Warwick's lead single in the United States, and was heavily promoted by [[Arista Records|Arista]], but failed to chart. A follow-up \"Where My Lips Have Been\" peaked at #95 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]]. The 1994 ''Aquarela Do Brasil'' album marked the end of Warwick's contract with Arista Records.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /> In 1990, Warwick recorded the song \"[[It's All Over (Blue System song)|It's All Over]]\" with former member of [[Modern Talking]] [[Dieter Bohlen]] ([[Blue System]]). The single peaked at #60 (#33 airplay) on the German pop charts and it was covered on Blue System's album ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Blue System album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]''.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nIn 1993, [[Forrest Sawyer]], host of the ABC News/Entertainment program ''[[Day One (TV news series)|Day One]]'', alleged financial improprieties by the Warwick Foundation, founded in 1989 to benefit AIDS patients, and particularly Warwick's charity concert performances organized to benefit the organization. ABC alleged the Foundation was operating at a near 90% administrative cost. ABC alleged that Warwick flew first class and was accommodated at first-class hotels for charity concerts and events in which she participated for the Foundation. Warwick, who had no executive, administrative, or management role in the organization, challenged ABC to investigate the foundation further and alleged that the ABC report was racially motivated. An Internal Revenue Service investigation of the Warwick Foundation found no wrongdoing or criminal activity on the part of the Board of Directors or Warwick, and its status as a non-profit charity was upheld. ABC maintained the report to be factually correct, but the item has not been repeated since the original air date. The foundation was later dissolved.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n[[File:Dionne_Warwicke_2002.jpg|thumb|upright|Warwick in 2002]]\nOn October 16, 2002, Warwick was nominated to be [[FAO Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassador]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nIn 2004, Warwick's first Christmas album was released.

Her first and only release for the label was ''My Friends and Me'', a duets album containing reworkings of her old hits, very similar to her 1998 CD ''Dionne Sings Dionne''. Among her singing partners were [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Wynonna Judd]] and [[Reba McEntire]]. The album peaked at #66 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. The album was produced by her son, [[Damon Elliott]]. A follow-up album featuring Warwick's old hits as duets with male vocalists was planned, but the project was cancelled. The relationship with Concord concluded with the release of ''My Friends and Me''. A compilation CD of her greatest hits and love songs, ''The Love Collection'', entered the UK pop charts at number 27 on February 16, 2008.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nWarwick's second gospel album, \"Why We Sing\", was released on February 26, 2008 in the United Kingdom and on April 1, 2008 in the United States.

The finished recording, entitled ''Only Trust Your Heart'', was released in 2011.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" />\n\nOn October 20, 2009, Starlight Children's Foundation and New Gold Music Ltd. released a song that Warwick had recorded about ten years prior called \"Starlight\". The lyrics were written by [[Dean Pitchford]], prolific writer of ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'', screenwriter of \u2014 and sole or joint lyricist of every song in the soundtrack of \u2014 the original 1984 film ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', and lyricist of the ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' theme. The music had been composed by Bill Goldstein, whose versatile career included the original music for NBC's ''Fame'' TV series. Warwick, Pitchford and Goldstein announced that they would be donating 100% of their royalties to Starlight Children's Foundation, to support Starlight's mission to help seriously ill children and their families cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, education and family activities.<ref name=\"Strathdee\" /><blockquote>When Bill and Dean brought this song to me, I instantly felt connected to its message of shining a little light into the lives of people who need it most\", said Warwick. \"I admire the work of Starlight Children's Foundation and know that if the song brings hope to even just one sick child, we have succeeded.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Dionne Warwick 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Warwick performing in September 2018]]\nIn 2011, the New Jazz style CD ''Only Trust Your Heart'' was released, featuring many Sammy Cahn songs.

Warwick stated in ''Don't Make Me Over: Dionne Warwick'', a 2002 Biography Channel interview, \"I was the breadwinner. The male ego is a fragile thing. It's hard when the woman is the breadwinner.
