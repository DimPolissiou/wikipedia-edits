Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the \"hot\" sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermo-[[transient receptor potential]] channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness.<ref name=Macpherson/> Allicin, along with its decomposition products [[diallyl disulfide]] and [[diallyl trisulfide]], are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as [[vinyldithiin]]s and [[ajoene]].<ref name=Block2010/> Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the \"stinking rose\". When eaten in quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and [[garlic breath]] the following day. This is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized, forming allyl methyl sulfide. [[Allyl methyl sulfide]] (AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the [[blood]]. It is carried to the lungs and the skin, where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time.<ref name=Block2010/>\n\nThe well-known phenomenon of \"garlic breath\" is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh [[parsley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry?id=2677 |title=garlic |website=Food Dictionary, Epicurious.com |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524001130/http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry?id=2677 |archivedate=May 24, 2012 }}</ref> The herb is, therefore, included in many garlic recipes, such as ''[[pistou]]'', ''[[persillade]]'', and the garlic butter spread used in [[garlic bread]].\n\nBecause of the AMS in the bloodstream, it is believed by some to act as a mosquito repellent, but no clinically reported evidence suggests it is actually effective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in419|title=Mosquito Repellents|author1=Rutledge|first=C.

With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes.

An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling [[olive oil]] (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and [[roast]] them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are heated over the course of several weeks; the resulting product, called [[black garlic (food)|black garlic]], is sweet and syrupy, and is exported to the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\nGarlic may be applied to different kinds of bread, usually in a medium of butter or oil, to create a variety of classic dishes, such as [[garlic bread]], [[garlic toast]], [[bruschetta]], [[Crostino|crostini]], and [[canap\u00e9]]. The flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods. It is often paired with [[onion]], [[tomato]], or [[ginger]].\n\nImmature scapes are tender and edible. They are also known as \"garlic spears\", \"stems\", or \"tops\". Scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves. They are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus.<ref name=scapes/> Garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of Asia. The leaves are cut, cleaned, and then stir-fried with eggs, meat, or vegetables.\n\nGarlic powder has a different taste from fresh garlic.

In [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[chili oil]] with garlic is a popular [[dipping sauce]], especially for meat and seafood. [[Tuong ot toi Viet Nam]] (Vietnam chili garlic sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across North America and Asia.\n\nIn some cuisines, the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar, salt, and spices. In eastern Europe, the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer. [[Laba garlic]], prepared by soaking garlic in [[vinegar]], is a type of pickled garlic served with [[dumpling]]s in northern China to celebrate the [[Chinese New Year]].<ref name=Block2010/>\n\nGarlic is essential in Middle Eastern and Arabic cooking, with its presence in many food items. In Levantine countries such as [[Jordan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]], garlic is traditionally crushed together with olive oil, and occasionally salt, to create a Middle Eastern garlic sauce called [[Toum]] (\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0645; meaning \"garlic\" in Arabic). While not exclusively served with meats, toum is commonly paired with chicken or other meat dishes such as [[shawarma]]. Garlic is also a key component in some [[hummus]] varieties, an Arabic dip composed of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and salt.\n\nLightly [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]] garlic is used in British and other European cuisine. It is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game, and in soups and stews.\n\nEmulsifying garlic with olive oil produces ''[[aioli]]''. Garlic, oil, and a chunky base produce ''[[skordalia]]''. Blending garlic, [[almond]], oil, and soaked bread produces ''[[ajoblanco]]''. ''[[Tzatziki]]'', yogurt mixed with garlic and salt, is a common sauce in Eastern Mediterranean cuisines.\n\n===Storage===\n[[File:Allium sativum.

Allicin has been found to be the compound most responsible for the \"hot\" sensation of raw garlic. This chemical opens thermo-[[transient receptor potential]] channels that are responsible for the burning sense of heat in foods. The process of cooking garlic removes allicin, thus mellowing its spiciness.<ref name=Macpherson/> Allicin, along with its decomposition products [[diallyl disulfide]] and [[diallyl trisulfide]], are major contributors to the characteristic odor of garlic, with other allicin-derived compounds, such as [[vinyldithiin]]s and [[ajoene]].<ref name=Block2010/> Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the \"stinking rose\". When eaten in quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and [[garlic breath]] the following day. This is because garlic's strong-smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized, forming allyl methyl sulfide. [[Allyl methyl sulfide]] (AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the [[blood]]. It is carried to the lungs and the skin, where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time.<ref name=Block2010/>\n\nThe well-known phenomenon of \"garlic breath\" is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh [[parsley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry?id=2677 |title=garlic |website=Food Dictionary, Epicurious.com |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524001130/http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry?id=2677 |archivedate=May 24, 2012 }}</ref> The herb is, therefore, included in many garlic recipes, such as ''[[pistou]]'', ''[[persillade]]'', and the garlic butter spread used in [[garlic bread]].\n\nBecause of the AMS in the bloodstream, it is believed by some to act as a mosquito repellent, but no clinically reported evidence suggests it is actually effective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/in419|title=Mosquito Repellents|author1=Rutledge|first=C.

With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes.

An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling [[olive oil]] (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and [[roast]] them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are heated over the course of several weeks; the resulting product, called [[black garlic (food)|black garlic]], is sweet and syrupy, and is exported to the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\nGarlic may be applied to different kinds of bread, usually in a medium of butter or oil, to create a variety of classic dishes, such as [[garlic bread]], [[garlic toast]], [[bruschetta]], [[Crostino|crostini]], and [[canap\u00e9]]. The flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods. It is often paired with [[onion]], [[tomato]], or [[ginger]].\n\nImmature scapes are tender and edible. They are also known as \"garlic spears\", \"stems\", or \"tops\". Scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves. They are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus.<ref name=scapes/> Garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of Asia. The leaves are cut, cleaned, and then stir-fried with eggs, meat, or vegetables.\n\nGarlic powder has a different taste from fresh garlic.

In [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[chili oil]] with garlic is a popular [[dipping sauce]], especially for meat and seafood. [[Tuong ot toi Viet Nam]] (Vietnam chili garlic sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across North America and Asia.\n\nIn some cuisines, the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar, salt, and spices. In eastern Europe, the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer. [[Laba garlic]], prepared by soaking garlic in [[vinegar]], is a type of pickled garlic served with [[dumpling]]s in northern China to celebrate the [[Chinese New Year]].<ref name=Block2010/>\n\nGarlic is essential in Middle Eastern and Arabic cooking, with its presence in many food items. In Levantine countries such as [[Jordan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]], garlic is traditionally crushed together with olive oil, and occasionally salt, to create a Middle Eastern garlic sauce called [[Toum]] (\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0645; meaning \"garlic\" in Arabic). While not exclusively served with meats, toum is commonly paired with chicken or other meat dishes such as [[shawarma]]. Garlic is also a key component in some [[hummus]] varieties, an Arabic dip composed of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and salt.\n\nLightly [[smoking (cooking)|smoked]] garlic is used in British and other European cuisine. It is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game, and in soups and stews.\n\nEmulsifying garlic with olive oil produces ''[[aioli]]''. Garlic, oil, and a chunky base produce ''[[skordalia]]''. Blending garlic, [[almond]], oil, and soaked bread produces ''[[ajoblanco]]''. ''[[Tzatziki]]'', yogurt mixed with garlic and salt, is a common sauce in Eastern Mediterranean cuisines.\n\n===Storage===\n[[File:Allium sativum.

Three women's fraternities were already represented at Boston University in 1888 ([[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Alpha Phi]]). Shaw enlisted the help of Eleanor Dorcas Pond and told her, \"Let us found a society that shall be kind alike to all and think more of a girl's inner self and character than of her personal appearance.\"\n\nThe two young women began the work of creating a new national fraternity. Later Sarah wrote \"...The two enthusiastic friends were unaware of the fact that there was something stupendous about the task they had set hands, heads and hearts to accomplish. They were working for a principle, and it never occurred to them that there could be such a thing as failure. Earnestness of purpose, energy and enthusiasm had brought them both success in college and why should not these same qualities bring assurance of good fortune to the new venture.\"\n\nShaw and Pond wrote the rituals and constitution and designed the emblems. Choosing the name was a mutual decision. Pond suggested a triple letter while Shaw chose the actual letter and developed Greek mottos and passwords. Inspiration came from [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Lore]], [[Hindu|Hindu mysticism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]] and [[Astronomy]], reflecting Shaw's wide and various interests.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Tri Delta as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Who Rules America?]]|last=Domhoff|first=G.

The [[dolphin]] is recognized as an additional symbol as it was considered to be a good omen by the [[ancient Greeks]]. The colors of Tri Delta are silver, gold and [[cerulean blue]], while the [[pearl]] is its jewel. The sorority recognizes the [[pansy]] as its official flower and the [[pine tree]] as its official tree.\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] consists of a quartered shield, first and fourth quarters in blue with a silver [[trident]] on each, second and third quarters in gold with green pine tree on each. The sorority crest is placed above the shield and consists of a [[torse]] with six folds in alternating gold and blue, from which a white, gold and blue pansy rises. Below the shield, the Greek motto ''Asfalos Agapomen Allaylas'' (\"Let us steadfastly love one another\") is inscribed in Greek characters on a scroll.\n\n===Official insignia===\nTri Delta's official badge is the Stars and Crescent, consisting of three golden stars and a crown set with pearls, within a gold crescent of three hundred degrees bearing three deltas in black enamel. An initiate receives a badge with her initials, the Greek letters of her chapter, and her chapter Initiation number engraved on the back. The badge belongs to the sorority and is \"lent\" to each member during her lifetime or as long as she remains a member, with the expectation that the badge will be returned upon the member's death or resignation.\n\nPrior to initiation, new members wear a new member pin, which is a green and silver enamel badge described as an \"inverted Delta surrounded by three Deltas.\" A new member may also display a trident, which symbolizes the first degree of initiation and is returned prior to initiation into the Stars and Crescent degree. A gold trident may be worn as a badge guard.\n\nTri Delta also has various circle pins to celebrate years since the member's initiation. Introduced in 2004, the Silver Circle Pin may be worn by members who have reached the 25-year anniversary of their initiation. It features the anniversary number engraved on the stars and crescent design. The Golden Circle Pin was originally created by Sarah Ida Shaw for the Circle Degree of Initiation, but its current usage to celebrate 50 years since initiation dates to 1962. This pin consists of three deltas made of gold inside a golden circle, surrounded by six spherical triangles in blue. The Diamond Circle Pin honors members who have served for 75 years with the fraternity. While the design is alike to the Golden Circle Pin, this token features a diamond in the center. This pin was introduced in the year 1996 and the first pin was awarded to Mary K. Wise of [[Butler University]].\n\n==Programs==\n===Philanthropy===\nMany chapters observe \"Sleighbell Day\" on the first Tuesday of December, following the tradition of Sleighbell Luncheon, first held in the 1940s by 13 Southern California chapters to benefit a doctor researching blood diseases at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, a national survey established that Tri Delta chapters were interested in children, hospitals, and cancer. At the 1974 Tri Delta Convention, the three were combined to support children's cancer charities as the designated philanthropy.\n\nIn 1999, Tri Delta partnered with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. St. Jude (through the fundraising branch, the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]]) assists Tri Delta chapters in planning philanthropy events that benefit the children and subsidize research costs at St. Jude. Many chapters coordinate fundraising activities such as pancake breakfasts, called Delta House of Pancakes or DHOP,  and football tailgates on their campuses each year. Since 1999, Tri Delta has raised more than $30 million for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\">{{cite web|date=January 11, 2012 |title=St. Jude Fundraising Update |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/news/01_11_2012 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-07}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> In 2002, Tri Deltas committed to raising $1 million to build a Teen Room at the St. Jude Hospital in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], fulfilling the commitment in 2005. In July 2006, Tri Delta committed to raise $10 million in 10 years to build a new patient treatment floor focusing on brain tumor research at St. Jude, instead raising $10.4 million in 4 years. In 2010, a new philanthropic goal was announced to raise $15 million in 5 years.<ref name=\"15in5\">{{cite web|title=$15 Million in 5 years |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/aboutus/st_jude_15in5 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-28}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> On February 1, 2014, it was announced that Tri Delta surpassed the $15 million goal in just 3.5 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tridelta.org/news/$15millionraisedforstjudein35years |title=$15 Million Raised for St. Jude in 3.5 Years |publisher=Tri Delta |accessdate=2014-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314145243/http://www.tridelta.org/news/%2415millionraisedforstjudein35years |archivedate=March 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On July 4, 2014, Tri Delta announced a new philanthropic goal to raise $60 million over 10 years, the largest single commitment by a partner of St. Jude in the history of the hospital.  Only three-and-a-half years into the 10 year commitment to raise $60 million, Tri Delta hit the halfway point and announced $30 million raised for St. Jude in January 2018. Their pledge funded the Tri Delta Place, St. Jude's only on-campus housing facility. It includes 64 hotel-style rooms and 36 suites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/while-here/housing/tri-delta-place.html|title=Tri Delta Place|website=www.stjude.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Tri Delta was also named the St. Jude partner of the year for 2014, making Tri Delta the first non-corporation to receive this honor. As of February 2018, Tri Delta has reached the halfway point of this commitment. Since 1999, Tri Delta members have raised more than $70 million to St. Jude. Tri delta continues every year to increase their philanthropy goals for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\" />\n\nIn addition to the national partnership, Tri Delta continues to raise money for local Children's Cancer Charities, including two Canadian Hospitals, the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at University of Toronto|url = http://utoronto.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = utoronto.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>, the [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario]] in [[Ottawa, Canada]], and local children's cancer charities in various states.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at The University of Ottawa|url = http://ottawa.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = ottawa.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\nEvery year, chapters host a variety of events to raise money for these causes. This includes sporting events such as Greeks at Bat (an inter-fraternity [[baseball]] tournament) and Tri Delta Triple Play ([[kickball]] tournament), pancake breakfasts commonly named \"Delta House of Pancakes,\" \"Delta Diner,\" or \"TriHOP\", and spaghetti dinners. Every Tri Delta member also participates in \"Sincerely Yours\", an international writing campaign to raise money for St Jude. Other St. Jude specific philanthropic endeavors includes a Gold Level National Team participation in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|url = http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR?company_id=2050&pg=national_company|website = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n===''The Trident''===\n''The Trident'' is Tri Delta's official publication, published continuously since 1891. The publication includes news about collegiate and alumni members, chapter events, topics in women's health, editorials, and upcoming events.\n\n==Membership==\n===Leadership===\nActive members of each Tri Delta chapter may join a committee or be slated into an office in order to serve the organization and develop leadership skills. During the slating process, members adhere to the mantra \"The Office Selects the Officer\", and undergo the process of determining the officer that is best suited for each office based on her skills and previous experience.\n\nEach collegiate chapter president oversees chapter business, including membership in every team and committee. Each subsequent office is organized into one of the following teams, each headed by a Vice-President: Administration, Chapter Development, Finance, Public Relations, and Membership. Further committees, assistants, and chair-positions are tailored to each chapter's specific needs.\n\n===Chapter Development Consultants===\nSince 1910, Tri Delta has utilized a consultant program, in which recently graduated alumna members are trained and employed by the executive office to visit chapters to provide resources and advice on their chapter business. Chapter Development Consultants provide constructive feedback in order to align the chapter with standards determined by the executive office. Consultants have gone by many names over the years, including field secretaries and field consultants. In 2015, the name was changed to Chapter Development Consultants.\n\n===Alumnae involvement===\nAfter graduation, alumnae may continue to support Tri Delta and stay active within the Greek community via means such as joining an alumna chapter, attending and hosting philanthropy events, donating to the Tri Delta Foundation's scholarships, contributing to The Trident, writing reference letters for potential new members, and volunteering. Alumnae who wish to stay connected to or make a more direct contribution to a specific collegiate chapter may join its alumna advisory team. Members volunteering on an international level include members of the National Housing Corporation,<ref>{{cite web|title = National House Corporation|url = http://www.tridelta.org/about/executive-office/nhc/|website = Tri Delta|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}</ref> who manage fraternity properties, and members of the Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title = Foundation -

With over 200,000 living initiates, Tri Delta is one of the largest [[National Panhellenic Conference]] sororities.\n\n==History==\n{{Peacock|date=June 2018}}\nDelta Delta Delta was founded by Sarah Ida Shaw, Eleanor Dorcas Pond, Florence Isabelle Stewart, and Isabel Morgan Breed at [[Boston University]]. Three women's fraternities were already represented at Boston University in 1888 ([[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Alpha Phi]]). Shaw enlisted the help of Eleanor Dorcas Pond and told her, \"Let us found a society that shall be kind alike to all and think more of a girl's inner self and character than of her personal appearance.\"\n\nThe two young women began the work of creating a new national fraternity. Later Sarah wrote \"...The two enthusiastic friends were unaware of the fact that there was something stupendous about the task they had set hands, heads and hearts to accomplish. They were working for a principle, and it never occurred to them that there could be such a thing as failure. Earnestness of purpose, energy and enthusiasm had brought them both success in college and why should not these same qualities bring assurance of good fortune to the new venture.\"\n\nShaw and Pond wrote the rituals and constitution and designed the emblems. Choosing the name was a mutual decision. Pond suggested a triple letter while Shaw chose the actual letter and developed Greek mottos and passwords. Inspiration came from [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Lore]], [[Hindu|Hindu mysticism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]] and [[Astronomy]], reflecting Shaw's wide and various interests.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Tri Delta as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Who Rules America?]]|last=Domhoff|first=G.

The [[dolphin]] is recognized as an additional symbol as it was considered to be a good omen by the [[ancient Greeks]]. The colors of Tri Delta are silver, gold and [[cerulean blue]], while the [[pearl]] is its jewel. The sorority recognizes the [[pansy]] as its official flower and the [[pine tree]] as its official tree.\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] consists of a quartered shield, first and fourth quarters in blue with a silver [[trident]] on each, second and third quarters in gold with green pine tree on each. The sorority crest is placed above the shield and consists of a [[torse]] with six folds in alternating gold and blue, from which a white, gold and blue pansy rises. Below the shield, the Greek motto ''Asfalos Agapomen Allaylas'' (\"Let us steadfastly love one another\") is inscribed in Greek characters on a scroll.\n\n===Official insignia===\nTri Delta's official badge is the Stars and Crescent, consisting of three golden stars and a crown set with pearls, within a gold crescent of three hundred degrees bearing three deltas in black enamel. An initiate receives a badge with her initials, the Greek letters of her chapter, and her chapter Initiation number engraved on the back. The badge belongs to the sorority and is \"lent\" to each member during her lifetime or as long as she remains a member, with the expectation that the badge will be returned upon the member's death or resignation.\n\nPrior to initiation, new members wear a new member pin, which is a green and silver enamel badge described as an \"inverted Delta surrounded by three Deltas.\" A new member may also display a trident, which symbolizes the first degree of initiation and is returned prior to initiation into the Stars and Crescent degree. A gold trident may be worn as a badge guard.\n\nTri Delta also has various circle pins to celebrate years since the member's initiation. Introduced in 2004, the Silver Circle Pin may be worn by members who have reached the 25-year anniversary of their initiation. It features the anniversary number engraved on the stars and crescent design. The Golden Circle Pin was originally created by Sarah Ida Shaw for the Circle Degree of Initiation, but its current usage to celebrate 50 years since initiation dates to 1962. This pin consists of three deltas made of gold inside a golden circle, surrounded by six spherical triangles in blue. The Diamond Circle Pin honors members who have served for 75 years with the fraternity. While the design is alike to the Golden Circle Pin, this token features a diamond in the center. This pin was introduced in the year 1996 and the first pin was awarded to Mary K. Wise of [[Butler University]].\n\n==Programs==\n===Philanthropy===\nMany chapters observe \"Sleighbell Day\" on the first Tuesday of December, following the tradition of Sleighbell Luncheon, first held in the 1940s by 13 Southern California chapters to benefit a doctor researching blood diseases at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, a national survey established that Tri Delta chapters were interested in children, hospitals, and cancer. At the 1974 Tri Delta Convention, the three were combined to support children's cancer charities as the designated philanthropy.\n\nIn 1999, Tri Delta partnered with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. St. Jude (through the fundraising branch, the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]]) assists Tri Delta chapters in planning philanthropy events that benefit the children and subsidize research costs at St. Jude. Many chapters coordinate fundraising activities such as pancake breakfasts, called Delta House of Pancakes or DHOP,  and football tailgates on their campuses each year. Since 1999, Tri Delta has raised more than $30 million for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\">{{cite web|date=January 11, 2012 |title=St. Jude Fundraising Update |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/news/01_11_2012 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-07}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> In 2002, Tri Deltas committed to raising $1 million to build a Teen Room at the St. Jude Hospital in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], fulfilling the commitment in 2005. In July 2006, Tri Delta committed to raise $10 million in 10 years to build a new patient treatment floor focusing on brain tumor research at St. Jude, instead raising $10.4 million in 4 years.

Only three-and-a-half years into the 10 year commitment to raise $60 million, Tri Delta hit the halfway point and announced $30 million raised for St. Jude in January 2018. Their pledge funded the Tri Delta Place, St. Jude's only on-campus housing facility. It includes 64 hotel-style rooms and 36 suites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/while-here/housing/tri-delta-place.html|title=Tri Delta Place|website=www.stjude.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Tri Delta was also named the St. Jude partner of the year for 2014, making Tri Delta the first non-corporation to receive this honor. As of February 2018, Tri Delta has reached the halfway point of this commitment. Since 1999, Tri Delta members have raised more than $70 million to St. Jude. Tri delta continues every year to increase their philanthropy goals for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\" />\n\nIn addition to the national partnership, Tri Delta continues to raise money for local Children's Cancer Charities, including two Canadian Hospitals, the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at University of Toronto|url = http://utoronto.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = utoronto.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>, the [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario]] in [[Ottawa, Canada]], and local children's cancer charities in various states.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at The University of Ottawa|url = http://ottawa.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = ottawa.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\nEvery year, chapters host a variety of events to raise money for these causes. This includes sporting events such as Greeks at Bat (an inter-fraternity [[baseball]] tournament) and Tri Delta Triple Play ([[kickball]] tournament), pancake breakfasts commonly named \"Delta House of Pancakes,\" \"Delta Diner,\" or \"TriHOP\", and spaghetti dinners. Every Tri Delta member also participates in \"Sincerely Yours\", an international writing campaign to raise money for St Jude. Other St. Jude specific philanthropic endeavors includes a Gold Level National Team participation in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|url = http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR?company_id=2050&pg=national_company|website = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n===''The Trident''===\n''The Trident'' is Tri Delta's official publication, published continuously since 1891. The publication includes news about collegiate and alumni members, chapter events, topics in women's health, editorials, and upcoming events.\n\n==Membership==\n===Leadership===\nActive members of each Tri Delta chapter may join a committee or be slated into an office in order to serve the organization and develop leadership skills. During the slating process, members adhere to the mantra \"The Office Selects the Officer\", and undergo the process of determining the officer that is best suited for each office based on her skills and previous experience.\n\nEach collegiate chapter president oversees chapter business, including membership in every team and committee. Each subsequent office is organized into one of the following teams, each headed by a Vice-President: Administration, Chapter Development, Finance, Public Relations, and Membership. Further committees, assistants, and chair-positions are tailored to each chapter's specific needs.\n\n===Chapter Development Consultants===\nSince 1910, Tri Delta has utilized a consultant program, in which recently graduated alumna members are trained and employed by the executive office to visit chapters to provide resources and advice on their chapter business. Chapter Development Consultants provide constructive feedback in order to align the chapter with standards determined by the executive office. Consultants have gone by many names over the years, including field secretaries and field consultants. In 2015, the name was changed to Chapter Development Consultants.\n\n===Alumnae involvement===\nAfter graduation, alumnae may continue to support Tri Delta and stay active within the Greek community via means such as joining an alumna chapter, attending and hosting philanthropy events, donating to the Tri Delta Foundation's scholarships, contributing to The Trident, writing reference letters for potential new members, and volunteering. Alumnae who wish to stay connected to or make a more direct contribution to a specific collegiate chapter may join its alumna advisory team.

She happily discovers that she is pregnant (she previously expressed interest in having children) only to learn from the doctor that the baby will be a reptile. Elizabeth becomes paranoid with her baby approaching and with Grainne who now has an enigmatic smile. Elizabeth eventually gives birth to a large black snake while in her bathtub.

She leaves a voicemail for her mom stating how angry she is about lying to her about her father dying. Upon reaching the place hinted at on the tape, she realizes that the tape was recorded when she was with her father as a child. The tape provides instructions on where to go and eventually leads her to a building with a mysterious door. Upon entering, it seems to lead her to another world. It cuts back to Carol's mother trying to call her cell phone, which Carol had left in her car. Carol comes across a figure sitting in a chair.

She is then rescued by her kindhearted coach, Coach Rockwell, whom she has a crush on. Rockwell is suffering from a heart condition. Feeling sorry for Maxine, he leaves a Valentine's letter in her locker. Maxine finds it and becomes euphoric. She then stalks Heidi and chases her to a creek where she hits her in the face with a brick and kills her with a [[box cutter]]. Later that night, Rockwell is preparing for an outing with his wife when he hears the doorbell. Upon answering the door, he is horrified by the appearance of Maxine holding Heidi's ripped-out heart.\n\n===St. Patrick's Day===\n* Written and directed by [[Gary Shore]] \n* Starring [[Ruth Bradley]], Peter Campion, Isolt McCaffrey\n\nSchool teacher Elizabeth Cullen takes an interest in her new, unhappy student Grainne after she leaves a dried grass snake and a note reading \"Only your deepest wish can make me smile\". After a St. Patrick's Day night of drinking, Elizabeth awakens in a green car with snakeskin laying around her. She happily discovers that she is pregnant (she previously expressed interest in having children) only to learn from the doctor that the baby will be a reptile. Elizabeth becomes paranoid with her baby approaching and with Grainne who now has an enigmatic smile. Elizabeth eventually gives birth to a large black snake while in her bathtub. She is then led away by Grainne and a mysterious man, presumably Grainne's father, and joins their pagan cult as the snake's mother. Later a new teacher at the school (a nun) gets the same message from Grainne.\n\n===Easter=== \n* Written and directed by [[Nicholas McCarthy (director)|Nicholas McCarthy]] \n* Starring [[Ava Acres]], Petra Wright, Mark Steger\n\nWhile being tucked into bed at night, a little girl becomes frightened by the coming of the [[Easter Bunny]].

At the advice of her doctor, Kate attends a getaway that is out in the middle of the desert. At first, everything seems fine until one night she is involved in an orgy. The getaway turns out to be home to barren witches who want her to carry their child. Kate becomes catatonic but is groomed and cared for by the witches who cut her off from contacting the outside. Eventually, Kate manages to flee but suddenly goes into labor.

Carol discovers that the package is an old [[Cassette deck|cassette deck player]] with earphones. She plays the tape which is from her father telling her to go to the place they played at when she was a child. She leaves a voicemail for her mom stating how angry she is about lying to her about her father dying. Upon reaching the place hinted at on the tape, she realizes that the tape was recorded when she was with her father as a child. The tape provides instructions on where to go and eventually leads her to a building with a mysterious door. Upon entering, it seems to lead her to another world. It cuts back to Carol's mother trying to call her cell phone, which Carol had left in her car. Carol comes across a figure sitting in a chair. The tape has her father state that he's glad she came \"by [her] own free will\" and, upon calling out to her father several times while crossing a white line to the house, is eventually frightened by a dark mysterious humanoid that roars back at her. The tape recorder and headphones fall to the ground and Carol subsequently disappears as the end of the tape continues saying \"together\" in her father's voice.\n\n===Arbor Day=== \n* Written and directed by [[Kevin Smith]]\n* Starring Ashley Greene, Olivia Roush, [[Harley Quinn Smith]], [[Harley Morenstein]], Shelby Kemper\n\nIan hosts an Internet sex service where he abuses his employees Holly, Bree, and Serena.

The girls send messages to him through the laptop making demands that should he not fulfill them will be subjected to the vibrator. When they ask him to show them his vagina, he is confused. The girls slide a knife under the door and tell him to \"Make it Hollow, Ian\". After he does so, the girls turn up the battery's power and presumably kill him. The girls answer the door to Nancy, who Ian had called earlier, about the job. The girls explain that they are under new management and that Ian is no longer with the company due to \"cutbacks\".\n\n===Christmas===\n* Written and directed by [[Scott Stewart (director)|Scott Stewart]]\n* Starring [[Seth Green]], [[Clare Grant]], Kalos Cluff, John C.

He ran off and on at Onslow for the next four seasons.\n\nIn 1992 he moved on to the Open-Wheel Modified division at [[Scotia Speedworld]] in [[Enfield, Nova Scotia]]. In his rookie season he won the series championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Fraser|url=http://riversidespeedway.ca/about/wall-of-fame/scott-fraser/|website=Riverside International Speedway|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 Fraser ran three [[American Canadian Tour]] races, scoring top fives in all three races, including a win at Scotia Speedworld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===MASCAR===\n\nFraser made his MASCAR debut at the 1991 Moosehead Grand Prix. Fraser was running up front in the event after starting third in the MASCAR Division before being forced out of the race with transmission issues. The next season, he entered the race for the second straight year, this time finishing 2nd.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1998 Fraser won five straight [[IWK 250|Riverside 250's]] at [[Riverside International Speedway]], setting a race record for both most wins and for consecutive wins.\n\nIn 1996 Fraser had what was arguably the best season in the history of Maritime racing, winning 12 of 15 races, including 9 straight, cruising to his first MASCAR championship. He led 58.9% of the total laps run in the 1996 season.\n\nThe next season Fraser ran a limited MASCAR schedule, winning four of the six races he entered.\n\nFraser returned to the series full-time in 1998, putting up an average finish of 2.7, while winning 6 of 13 races on his way to his second career MASCAR championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===King Racing===\n\nAt the end of the 1998 season Fraser decided to partner with [[Rollie MacDonald]] forming King Racing. Scott drove the car, while Rollie served as team owner and car chief.\n\nIn February 1999 the team entered the World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing at [[New Smyrna Speedway]] in [[New Smyrna, Florida]]. The World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing consisted of ten straight nights of races. Fraser set the fast time in five and won two of the ten main events, finishing third in the overall points standings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nThe team also entered the 1999 New Hampshire 100 NASCAR Busch North Series race at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]].

The team started out strong, starting on the outside pole at [[Chicago Motor Speedway]]. Fraser led for 19 laps on his way to an 8th-place finish. They recorded four top tens and two top fives in their first four starts in the series, including a career best 3rd-place finish at the [[Milwaukee Mile]] in August.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Fraser  2000 ASA National Tour Results|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/frasesc01/2000/AS|website=Racing Reference|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref> They raced two more times in 2000, finishing 11th at [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis|Indianapolis Raceway Park]] and 33rd at [[Gateway Motorsports Park]], where the team suffered their first DNF due to a faulty wheel bearing.\n\nWith their initial success the team decided to go full-time in 2001. The season started out great, with three top five finishes in their first four starts. Unfortunately the wheels fell off the campaign after that. Starting at [[Concord Speedway]] a series of five straight DNF's, including three crashes damaged their only car beyond the point where it could be repaired on the road. The final nail in the coffin came in an accident at Chicago Motor Speedway, the track Fraser made his impressive debut. The team returned to Nova Scotia dejected and out of money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nSoon after a friend of Fraser's started the \"Fans of Fraser\" campaign to raise money to get the team back onto the racetrack.

He ran off and on at Onslow for the next four seasons.\n\nIn 1992 he moved on to the Open-Wheel Modified division at [[Scotia Speedworld]] in [[Enfield, Nova Scotia]]. In his rookie season he won the series championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Fraser|url=http://riversidespeedway.ca/about/wall-of-fame/scott-fraser/|website=Riverside International Speedway|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 Fraser ran three [[American Canadian Tour]] races, scoring top fives in all three races, including a win at Scotia Speedworld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===MASCAR===\n\nFraser made his MASCAR debut at the 1991 Moosehead Grand Prix. Fraser was running up front in the event after starting third in the MASCAR Division before being forced out of the race with transmission issues. The next season, he entered the race for the second straight year, this time finishing 2nd.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1998 Fraser won five straight [[IWK 250|Riverside 250's]] at [[Riverside International Speedway]], setting a race record for both most wins and for consecutive wins.\n\nIn 1996 Fraser had what was arguably the best season in the history of Maritime racing, winning 12 of 15 races, including 9 straight, cruising to his first MASCAR championship. He led 58.9% of the total laps run in the 1996 season.\n\nThe next season Fraser ran a limited MASCAR schedule, winning four of the six races he entered.\n\nFraser returned to the series full-time in 1998, putting up an average finish of 2.7, while winning 6 of 13 races on his way to his second career MASCAR championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===King Racing===\n\nAt the end of the 1998 season Fraser decided to partner with [[Rollie MacDonald]] forming King Racing. Scott drove the car, while Rollie served as team owner and car chief.\n\nIn February 1999 the team entered the World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing at [[New Smyrna Speedway]] in [[New Smyrna, Florida]]. The World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing consisted of ten straight nights of races. Fraser set the fast time in five and won two of the ten main events, finishing third in the overall points standings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nThe team also entered the 1999 New Hampshire 100 NASCAR Busch North Series race at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]].

The team started out strong, starting on the outside pole at [[Chicago Motor Speedway]]. Fraser led for 19 laps on his way to an 8th-place finish. They recorded four top tens and two top fives in their first four starts in the series, including a career best 3rd-place finish at the [[Milwaukee Mile]] in August.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Fraser  2000 ASA National Tour Results|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/frasesc01/2000/AS|website=Racing Reference|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref> They raced two more times in 2000, finishing 11th at [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis|Indianapolis Raceway Park]] and 33rd at [[Gateway Motorsports Park]], where the team suffered their first DNF due to a faulty wheel bearing.\n\nWith their initial success the team decided to go full-time in 2001. The season started out great, with three top five finishes in their first four starts. Unfortunately the wheels fell off the campaign after that. Starting at [[Concord Speedway]] a series of five straight DNF's, including three crashes damaged their only car beyond the point where it could be repaired on the road. The final nail in the coffin came in an accident at Chicago Motor Speedway, the track Fraser made his impressive debut. The team returned to Nova Scotia dejected and out of money.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.scottfraseronline.com/biography.html|website=Scott Fraser Online|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nSoon after a friend of Fraser's started the \"Fans of Fraser\" campaign to raise money to get the team back onto the racetrack.

The editorial clarified the separate roles of men and women and claimed that the ERA was unnecessary.

They also compiled and issued reports concerning discrimination against women.<ref name=\":3\" /> The committee later worked to persuade the Utah legislature to ratify the ERA, while committee members made and distributed pro-ERA pamphlets.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nA more conservative pro-ERA coalition was the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), which was organized by [[Betty Friedan]] in 1966.<ref name=\":3\" /> Members of NOW focused on public opinion as they lobbied for political reform.<ref name=\":0\" /> NOW was also one of the groups that picketed the IWY Convention in opposition to LDS church interference. Other pro-ERA organizations at the convention included the [[National Foundation for Women Legislators|Order of Women Legislators]], Women\u2019s Democratic Club, Equal Rights Coalition of Utah, [[League of Women Voters]], Equal Rights Legal Fund, Utah Welfare Rights Organization, and the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome of Utah\u2019s universities instituted programs focused on women\u2019s studies during this period. One faculty member at [[Utah State University]] described this event, stating that despite the university\u2019s conservative background and relationship with the LDS church, by 1976\u201377 around 280 individuals were enrolled in women\u2019s studies courses at USU.<ref name=\":5\" /> These university courses were influential in educating on women's rights and the current ERA issues.\n\n=== Pro-ERA LDS Coalitions ===\nAnother group created in favor of passing the ERA in Utah was [http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv98071 Mormons for ERA]<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://radiowest.kuer.org/post/will-utah-be-38th-state-ratify-era|title=Will Utah Be The 38th State to Ratify the ERA?|last=Fabrizio|first=Doug|date=Sep 20, 2019|website=Radiowest|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Founded in 1978, with [[Sonia Johnson]] as the first elected president and spokesperson, this group lobbied, created forums which hosted public debates for the ERA, and worked on public relations that gave attention to related issues.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv98071#overview|title=Archives West: Mormons for ERA, 1977\u20131983|website=archiveswest.orbiscascade.org|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> Created when just three more states were needed for the ratification of the ERA, Mormons for ERA worked hard within the state of Utah, and Sonia Johnson was even called before the Utah legislation to argue for the amendment. In 1979, when Sonia Johnson was eventually excommunicated from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mormons for ERA received much more national attention. After the failure of the ratification of the ERA, Mormons for ERA lost followers and contributors and drastically decreased in size. However, the organization still exists today after being revived in 2015.<ref name=\":7\" /> <ref name=\":6\" />\n== Modern Implications ==\nOnce the ratification deadline ended in 1982 some still remained hopeful for a future revival of the ERA.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/equal-rights-amendment-96-years-old-and-still-not-part-constitution-heres-why-180973548/|title=The 96-Year-History of the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Thulin|first=Lila|date=Nov 13, 2019|website=SMITHSONIANMAG.COM|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since the 1982 deadline, [[Illinois]] and [[Nevada]] have both ratified the ERA, leaving the nation one state short from the initial ratification requirements. In the 2019 elections, [[Virginia]] elected a majority democratic state congress, and many proponents of the ERA view Virginia as possibly becoming the thirty-eighth state needed to ratify what could become the 28th Amendment to the US Constitution. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/virginia-ratify-equal-rights-amendment.html|title=The Equal Rights Amendment May Pass Now.

What remains in question is how the constitutional conversation around the ERA may proceed if thirty-eight states achieve ratification at some point in their history.<ref name=\":8\" />    \n\nModern pro-ERA advocates are excited about the possibility of Utah being the last state needed to legally ratify the ERA.

While support for the ERA in Utah had initially been about sixty-three percent in November of 1974, the official statement from the Church in 1975 led to a drop in support to thirty-one percent in February of 1975.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Organization of LDS Women ====\nAs the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints increasingly viewed the fight against the ERA as a broader fight against [[second-wave feminism]], the [[International Women's Year|International Women\u2019s Year]] (IWY) state conference provided the opportunity for Mormon women to mobilize against the feminist movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=M|date=1995|title=The Mormon Relief Society and the International Women's Year|url=|journal=Journal of Mormon History|volume=21|pages=106\u2013167|via=}}</ref> Hoping to overwhelm the conference and provide the opinions of many conservative minded women, the church communicated that each ward in the state should send ten conservative women to the conference. The total population for the state conference resulted in 13,867 women.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=D. Michael|date=Fall 1994|title=The LDS Church's Campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment|url=|journal=Journal of Mormon History|volume=20|pages=85\u2013155|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\nCoordinated with the help of men on walkie-talkies, these women voted down any proposal without discussion, even some proposals that their goals could have supported.<ref name=\":5\" /> This same process occurred in other states where LDS women resided.<ref name=\":2\" /> Through these efforts to overwhelm the IWY, and other pushes to fight the ratification of the ERA, the Church became a staunch opponent to the passing of the ERA in Utah, and also on a national scale. \n\n== Pro-ERA Coalitions in Utah ==\nFollowing the example of the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|President\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women]], the Governor\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women in Utah was organized by Governor Clyde in 1964.<ref name=\":5\" /> While the President's Commission on the Status of Women had initially discreetly formed against the ERA, as members worried that the legislation would threaten protections over working women, Utah's all-women committee focused on general women\u2019s issues. They also compiled and issued reports concerning discrimination against women.<ref name=\":3\" /> The committee later worked to persuade the Utah legislature to ratify the ERA, while committee members made and distributed pro-ERA pamphlets.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nA more conservative pro-ERA coalition was the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), which was organized by [[Betty Friedan]] in 1966.<ref name=\":3\" /> Members of NOW focused on public opinion as they lobbied for political reform.<ref name=\":0\" /> NOW was also one of the groups that picketed the IWY Convention in opposition to LDS church interference. Other pro-ERA organizations at the convention included the [[National Foundation for Women Legislators|Order of Women Legislators]], Women\u2019s Democratic Club, Equal Rights Coalition of Utah, [[League of Women Voters]], Equal Rights Legal Fund, Utah Welfare Rights Organization, and the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome of Utah\u2019s universities instituted programs focused on women\u2019s studies during this period. One faculty member at [[Utah State University]] described this event, stating that despite the university\u2019s conservative background and relationship with the LDS church, by 1976-77 around 280 individuals were enrolled in women\u2019s studies courses at USU.<ref name=\":5\" /> These university courses were influential in educating on women's rights and the current ERA issues.\n\n=== Pro-ERA LDS Coalitions ===\nAnother group created in favor of passing the ERA in Utah was [http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv98071 Mormons for ERA]<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://radiowest.kuer.org/post/will-utah-be-38th-state-ratify-era|title=Will Utah Be The 38th State to Ratify the ERA?|last=Fabrizio|first=Doug|date=Sep 20, 2019|website=Radiowest|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Founded in 1978, with [[Sonia Johnson]] as the first elected president and spokesperson, this group lobbied, created forums which hosted public debates for the ERA, and worked on public relations that gave attention to related issues.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv98071#overview|title=Archives West: Mormons for ERA, 1977-1983|website=archiveswest.orbiscascade.org|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> Created when just three more states were needed for the ratification of the ERA, Mormons for ERA worked hard within the state of Utah, and Sonia Johnson was even called before the Utah legislation to argue for the amendment. In 1979, when Sonia Johnson was eventually excommunicated from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mormons for ERA received much more national attention. After the failure of the ratification of the ERA, Mormons for ERA lost followers and contributors and drastically decreased in size. However, the organization still exists today after being revived in 2015.<ref name=\":7\" /> <ref name=\":6\" />\n== Modern Implications ==\nOnce the ratification deadline ended in 1982 some still remained hopeful for a future revival of the ERA.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/equal-rights-amendment-96-years-old-and-still-not-part-constitution-heres-why-180973548/|title=The 96-Year-History of the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Thulin|first=Lila|date=Nov 13, 2019|website=SMITHSONIANMAG.COM|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since the 1982 deadline, [[Illinois]] and [[Nevada]] have both ratified the ERA, leaving the nation one state short from the initial ratification requirements. In the 2019 elections, [[Virginia]] elected a majority democratic state congress, and many proponents of the ERA view Virginia as possibly becoming the thirty-eighth state needed to ratify what could become the 28th Amendment to the US Constitution. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/virginia-ratify-equal-rights-amendment.html|title=The Equal Rights Amendment May Pass Now. It's Only Been 96 Years.|last=Astor|first=Maggie|date=Nov 7, 2019|website=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> While thirty-seven states have ratified the amendment, the five states of [[Nebraska]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[Idaho]], and [[South Dakota]] have each since repealed their ratification. What remains in question is how the constitutional conversation around the ERA may proceed if thirty-eight states achieve ratification at some point in their history.<ref name=\":8\" />    \n\nModern pro-ERA advocates are excited about the possibility of Utah being the last state needed to legally ratify the ERA. Women such as [[Kate Kelly (feminist)|Kate Kelly]], Sara Vranes, and Anissa Rasheta are heavily involved with the Utah Mormons for ERA movement, working on the same initiatives as the organization that was established in 1978.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/08/14/mormon-land-era-is-back/|title='Mormon Land': The ERA is back and female members are pushing for it, with their church no longer fighting against it.|website=The Salt Lake Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> In the past decade, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has remained neutral about ratification of the ERA in Utah.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Equal Rights Amendment and Utah}}\n\n[[Category:Politics of Utah]]\n\n{{catimprove|date=December 2019}}\n", "name_user": "Jerome Kohl", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Equal_Rights_Amendment_and_Utah"}

Of these ''Tsutsutsi'' (''[[Rhododendron subg. Tsutsuji|Tsutsusi]]''), ''[[Pentanthera]]'', ''[[Pogonanthum]]'', ''[[Ponticum]]'' and ''[[Rhodora]]'' are still used, the other sections being ''Lepipherum'', ''Booram'', and ''Chamaecistus''. This structure largely survived till recently (2004), following which the development of molecular phylogeny led to major re-examinations of traditional morphological classifications,<ref name=WIAA/><ref name=Spady/> although other authors such as Candolle, who described six sections,{{sfnp|Candolle |1838 |ref=Candolle}} used slightly different numeration.\n\nSoon, as more species became available in the nineteenth century so did a better understanding of the characteristics necessary for the major divisions. Chief amongst these were [[Maximovicz]]'s ''Rhododendreae Asiae Orientali''<ref name=Maximovicz/> and [[Jules \u00c9mile Planchon|Planchon]]. Maximovicz used flower bud position and its relationship with leaf buds to create eight \"Sections\".{{sfnp|JIN |DING |ZHANG |HONG |2010 |ref=JDZH}} [[Bentham and Hooker]] used a similar scheme, but called the divisions \"Series\".<ref name=BH/> It was not until 1893 that [[Bernhard Adalbert Emil Koehne|Koehne]] appreciated the significance of scaling and hence the separation of lepidote and elepidote species. The large number of species that were available by the early twentieth century prompted a new approach when [[Isaac Bayley Balfour|Balfour]] introduced the concept of grouping species into [[Series (botany)|series]]. ''The Species of Rhododendron''<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stevenson |editor-first=J.B. |title=The Species of Rhododendron |publisher=The Rhododendron Society |location=Edinburgh |date=1930}}</ref> referred to this series concept as the Balfourian system. That system continued up to modern times in Davidian's four volume ''The Rhododendron Species''.{{sfnp|Davidian |ref=Davidian}}\n\n===Modern era===\nThe next major attempt at classification was by [[Sleumer]] who from 1934 began incorporating the Balfourian series into the older hierarchical structure of subgenera and sections, according to the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], culminating in 1949 with his \"Ein System der Gattung ''Rhododendron'' L.\",<ref name=Sleumer49>{{cite journal |last=Sleumer |first=H |year=1949 |title=Ein System der Gattung ''Rhododendron'' L. |journal=Bot.

Sleumer based his system on the relationship of the flower buds to the leaf buds, habitat, flower structure, and whether the leaves were lepidote or non-lepidote. While Sleumer's work was widely accepted, many in the United States and the United Kingdom continued to use the simpler Balfourian system of the Edinburgh group.\n\nSleumer's system underwent many revisions by others, predominantly the Edinburgh group in their continuing [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]] notes. Cullen of the Edinburgh group, placing more emphasis on the lepidote characteristics of the leaves, united all of the lepidote species into subgenus ''Rhododendron'', including four of Sleumer's subgenera (''Rhododendron'', ''Pseudoazalea'', ''Pseudorhodorastrum'', ''Rhodorastrum'').<ref name=Sleumer80/><ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Cullen |title=A revision of Rhododendron I.

Following publication of the studies of Goetsch ''et al.'' (2005) with [[RPB2]],{{sfnp|Goetsch |Eckert |Hall|2005 |ref=Goetsch}} there began an ongoing realignment of species and groups within the genus, based on evolutionary relationships. Their work was more supportive of Sleumer's original system than the later modifications introduced by Chamberlain ''et al.''.{{sfnp|Goetsch |Eckert |Hall|2005 |ref=Goetsch}}<ref name=FSRS>{{cite web |last=Goetsch |first=Loretta A.|last2=Eckert |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Hall |first3=Benjamin D. |date=2005 |url=http://www.flounder.ca/FraserSouth/Goetsch-Eckert-Hall.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227185832/http://www.flounder.ca/FraserSouth/Goetsch-Eckert-Hall.asp |archive-date=27 February 2013 |website=Fraser South Rhododendron Society |title=Excerpts from and comments on a paper published by: Loretta Goetsch, Andrew Eckert and Benjamin Hall, University of Washington}} 2005 Annual ARS Convention</ref>\n\nThe major finding of Goetsch and colleagues was that all species examined (except [[Rhododendron camtschaticum|''R. camtschaticum'']], subgenus ''Therorhodion'') formed three major [[clades]] which they labelled A, B and C, with the subgenera ''Rhododendron'' and ''Hymenanthes'' nested within clades A and B as [[monophyletic]] groups respectively. By contrast subgenera ''Azaleastrum'' and ''Pentanthera'' were [[polyphyletic]], while ''R. camtschaticum'' appeared as a [[Sister group|sister]] to all other rhododendrons. The small polyphyletic subgenera ''Pentanthera'' and ''Azaleastrum'' were divided between two clades. The four sections of ''Pentanthera'' between clades B and C, with two each, while ''Azaleastrum'' had one section in each of A and C.\n\nThus subgenera ''Azaleastrum'' and ''Pentanthera'' needed to be dissassembled, and ''Rhododendron'', ''Hymenanthes'' and ''Tsutsusi'' correspondingly expanded.  In addition to the two separate genera included under ''Rhododendron'' by Chamberlain (''[[Ledum]]'', ''Tsusiophyllum''), Goetsch ''et al.''. added ''[[Menziesia]]'' (Clade C). Despite a degree of [[paraphyly]], the subgenus ''Rhododendron'' was otherwise untouched with regard to its three sections but four other subgenera were eliminated and one new subgenus created, leaving a total of five subgenera in all, from eight in Chamberlain's scheme. The discontinued subgenera are ''Pentanthera'', ''Tsutsusi'', ''Candidastrum'' and ''Mumeazalea'', while a new subgenus was created by elevating subgenus ''Azaleastrum'' section ''Choniastrum'' to subgenus rank.\n\nSubgenus ''Pentanthera'' (deciduous azaleas) with its four sections was dismembered by eliminating two sections and redistributing the other two between the existing subgenera in clades B (''Hymenanthes'') and C (''Azaleastrum''), although the name was retained in section ''Pentanthera'' (14 species) which was moved to subgenus ''Hymenanthes''. Of the remaining three sections, monotypic ''Viscidula'' was discontinued by moving ''[[Rhododendron nipponicum]]'' to ''Tsutsusi'' (C), while ''Rhodora'' (2 species) was itself polyphyletic and was broken up by moving ''[[Rhododendron canadense]]'' to section ''Pentanthera'' (B) and ''[[Rhododendron vaseyi]]''  to section ''Sciadorhodion'', which then became a new section of subgenus ''Azaleastrum'' (C).\n\nSubgenus ''Tsutsusi'' (C) was reduced to section status retaining the name, and included in subgenus ''Azaleastrum''. Of the three minor subgenera, all in C, two were discontinued. The single species of [[monotypic]] subgenus ''Candidastrum '' (''[[Rhododendron albiflorum]]'') was moved to subgenus ''Azaleastrum'', section ''Sciadorhodion''. Similarly the single species in monotypic subgenus ''Mumeazalea'' ''([[Rhododendron semibarbatum]])'' was placed in the new section ''Tsutsusi'', subgenus ''Azaleastrum''.

As new species of what are now considered ''Rhododendron'' were discovered, if they seemed to differ significantly from the type species they were assigned to separate genera.

Of these ''Tsutsutsi'' (''[[Rhododendron subg. Tsutsuji|Tsutsusi]]''), ''[[Pentanthera]]'', ''[[Pogonanthum]]'', ''[[Ponticum]]'' and ''[[Rhodora]]'' are still used, the other sections being ''Lepipherum'', ''Booram'', and ''Chamaecistus''. This structure largely survived till recently (2004), following which the development of molecular phylogeny led to major re-examinations of traditional morphological classifications,<ref name=WIAA/><ref name=Spady/> although other authors such as Candolle, who described six sections,{{sfnp|Candolle |1838 |ref=Candolle}} used slightly different numeration.\n\nSoon, as more species became available in the nineteenth century so did a better understanding of the characteristics necessary for the major divisions. Chief amongst these were [[Maximovicz]]'s ''Rhododendreae Asiae Orientali''<ref name=Maximovicz/> and [[Jules \u00c9mile Planchon|Planchon]]. Maximovicz used flower bud position and its relationship with leaf buds to create eight \"Sections\".{{sfnp|JIN |DING |ZHANG |HONG |2010 |ref=JDZH}} [[Bentham and Hooker]] used a similar scheme, but called the divisions \"Series\".<ref name=BH/> It was not until 1893 that [[Bernhard Adalbert Emil Koehne|Koehne]] appreciated the significance of scaling and hence the separation of lepidote and elepidote species. The large number of species that were available by the early twentieth century prompted a new approach when [[Isaac Bayley Balfour|Balfour]] introduced the concept of grouping species into [[Series (botany)|series]]. ''The Species of Rhododendron''<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Stevenson |editor-first=J.B. |title=The Species of Rhododendron |publisher=The Rhododendron Society |location=Edinburgh |date=1930}}</ref> referred to this series concept as the Balfourian system. That system continued up to modern times in Davidian's four volume ''The Rhododendron Species''.{{sfnp|Davidian |ref=Davidian}}\n\n===Modern era===\nThe next major attempt at classification was by [[Sleumer]] who from 1934 began incorporating the Balfourian series into the older hierarchical structure of subgenera and sections, according to the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], culminating in 1949 with his \"Ein System der Gattung ''Rhododendron'' L.\",<ref name=Sleumer49>{{cite journal |last=Sleumer |first=H |year=1949 |title=Ein System der Gattung ''Rhododendron'' L. |journal=Bot.

Sleumer based his system on the relationship of the flower buds to the leaf buds, habitat, flower structure, and whether the leaves were lepidote or non-lepidote. While Sleumer's work was widely accepted, many in the United States and the United Kingdom continued to use the simpler Balfourian system of the Edinburgh group.\n\nSleumer's system underwent many revisions by others, predominantly the Edinburgh group in their continuing [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]] notes. Cullen of the Edinburgh group, placing more emphasis on the lepidote characteristics of the leaves, united all of the lepidote species into subgenus ''Rhododendron'', including four of Sleumer's subgenera (''Rhododendron'', ''Pseudoazalea'', ''Pseudorhodorastrum'', ''Rhodorastrum'').<ref name=Sleumer80/><ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Cullen |title=A revision of Rhododendron I.

Later Gao ''et al.'' (2002) used [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] sequences<ref name=LianMing/> to determine a [[cladistic]] analysis. They confirmed that the genus ''Rhododendron'' was [[monophyletic]], with subgenus ''Therorhodion'' in the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal position]], consistent with the matK studies. Following publication of the studies of Goetsch ''et al.'' (2005) with [[RPB2]],{{sfnp|Goetsch |Eckert |Hall|2005 |ref=Goetsch}} there began an ongoing realignment of species and groups within the genus, based on evolutionary relationships. Their work was more supportive of Sleumer's original system than the later modifications introduced by Chamberlain ''et al.''.{{sfnp|Goetsch |Eckert |Hall|2005 |ref=Goetsch}}<ref name=FSRS>{{cite web |last=Goetsch |first=Loretta A.|last2=Eckert |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Hall |first3=Benjamin D. |date=2005 |url=http://www.flounder.ca/FraserSouth/Goetsch-Eckert-Hall.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227185832/http://www.flounder.ca/FraserSouth/Goetsch-Eckert-Hall.asp |archive-date=27 February 2013 |website=Fraser South Rhododendron Society |title=Excerpts from and comments on a paper published by: Loretta Goetsch, Andrew Eckert and Benjamin Hall, University of Washington}} 2005 Annual ARS Convention</ref>\n\nThe major finding of Goetsch and colleagues was that all species examined (except [[Rhododendron camtschaticum|''R. camtschaticum'']], subgenus ''Therorhodion'') formed three major [[clades]] which they labelled A, B and C, with the subgenera ''Rhododendron'' and ''Hymenanthes'' nested within clades A and B as [[monophyletic]] groups respectively. By contrast subgenera ''Azaleastrum'' and ''Pentanthera'' were [[polyphyletic]], while ''R. camtschaticum'' appeared as a [[Sister group|sister]] to all other rhododendrons. The small polyphyletic subgenera ''Pentanthera'' and ''Azaleastrum'' were divided between two clades. The four sections of ''Pentanthera'' between clades B and C, with two each, while ''Azaleastrum'' had one section in each of A and C.\n\nThus subgenera ''Azaleastrum'' and ''Pentanthera'' needed to be dissassembled, and ''Rhododendron'', ''Hymenanthes'' and ''Tsutsusi'' correspondingly expanded.  In addition to the two separate genera included under ''Rhododendron'' by Chamberlain (''[[Ledum]]'', ''Tsusiophyllum''), Goetsch ''et al.''. added ''[[Menziesia]]'' (Clade C). Despite a degree of [[paraphyly]], the subgenus ''Rhododendron'' was otherwise untouched with regard to its three sections but four other subgenera were eliminated and one new subgenus created, leaving a total of five subgenera in all, from eight in Chamberlain's scheme. The discontinued subgenera are ''Pentanthera'', ''Tsutsusi'', ''Candidastrum'' and ''Mumeazalea'', while a new subgenus was created by elevating subgenus ''Azaleastrum'' section ''Choniastrum'' to subgenus rank.\n\nSubgenus ''Pentanthera'' (deciduous azaleas) with its four sections was dismembered by eliminating two sections and redistributing the other two between the existing subgenera in clades B (''Hymenanthes'') and C (''Azaleastrum''), although the name was retained in section ''Pentanthera'' (14 species) which was moved to subgenus ''Hymenanthes''. Of the remaining three sections, monotypic ''Viscidula'' was discontinued by moving ''[[Rhododendron nipponicum]]'' to ''Tsutsusi'' (C), while ''Rhodora'' (2 species) was itself polyphyletic and was broken up by moving ''[[Rhododendron canadense]]'' to section ''Pentanthera'' (B) and ''[[Rhododendron vaseyi]]''  to section ''Sciadorhodion'', which then became a new section of subgenus ''Azaleastrum'' (C).\n\nSubgenus ''Tsutsusi'' (C) was reduced to section status retaining the name, and included in subgenus ''Azaleastrum''. Of the three minor subgenera, all in C, two were discontinued. The single species of [[monotypic]] subgenus ''Candidastrum '' (''[[Rhododendron albiflorum]]'') was moved to subgenus ''Azaleastrum'', section ''Sciadorhodion''. Similarly the single species in monotypic subgenus ''Mumeazalea'' ''([[Rhododendron semibarbatum]])'' was placed in the new section ''Tsutsusi'', subgenus ''Azaleastrum''. Genus ''Menziesa'' (9 species) was also added to section ''Sciadorhodion''. The remaining small subgenus ''Therorhodion'' with its two species was left intact.  Thus two subgenera, ''Hymenanthes'' and ''Azaleastrum'' were expanded at the expense of four subgenera that were eliminated, although ''Azaleastrum'' lost one section (''Choniastrum'') as a new subgenus, since it was a distinct subclade in A. In all, ''Hymenanthes'' increased from one to two sections, while ''Azaleastrum'', by losing one section and gaining two increased from two to three sections.{{sfnp|Goetsch |Eckert |Hall|2005 |ref=Goetsch}} (See schemata under '''[[#Subgenera|Subgenera]]''') ('''Table 1.''')<ref name=FSRS/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:500px;\"\n|+ <big>Table 1.: Taxonomic changes within genus ''Rhododendron''</big>\n! style=\"border-right:solid black 2px; background: #ccf\" colspan=4|Chamberlain (1996)||style=\"  background: #ccf\" colspan=2|Goetsch (2005)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf\" |Genus ||style=\"background:#ccf\" |Subgenus ||style=\"background:#ccf\" |Section ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px; background:#ccf\" |Species ||style=\"background:#ccf\" |Subgenus ||style=\"background:#ccf\" |Section\n|-\n| ''Menziesa'' || || ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"| 9 species ||rowspan=4|''Azaleastrum''||rowspan=4|''Sciadorhodion''\n|-\n| rowspan=10| ''Rhododendron'' || ''Candidastrum'' || ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"|''R.&nbsp;albiflorum''\n|-\n| rowspan=5| ''Pentanthera'' || ''Sciadorhodion'' ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"| 4 species\n|-\n| rowspan=2| ''Rhodora'' ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"|''R.&nbsp;vaseyi''\n|-\n| style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"|''R.&nbsp;canadense'' ||rowspan=2|''Hymenanthes''||rowspan=2|''Pentanthera''\n|-\n| ''Pentanthera'' ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"| 14 species\n|-\n| ''Viscidula'' ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"| ''R.&nbsp;nipponicum'' ||rowspan=4|''Azaleastrum''||rowspan=4|''Tsutsusi''\n|-\n| rowspan=2| ''Tsutsusi'' || ''Brachycalyx'' ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"| 15 species\n|-\n| ''Tsutsusi'' ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"| 65 species\n|-\n| ''Mumeazalea'' || ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"|''R.&nbsp;semibarbatum''\n|-\n| ''Azaleastrum'' || ''Choniastrum'' ||style=\"border-right:solid black 2px\"| 11 species ||''Choniastrum''\n|}\n\nSubsequent research has supported the revision by Goetsch, although has largely concentrated on further defining the phylogeny within the subdivisions.{{sfnp|Craven |Goetsch |Hall |Brown |2008 |ref=Craven2008}} In 2011 the two species of ''Diplarche'' were also added to ''Rhododendron'', ''[[incertae sedis]]''.{{sfnp|Craven|2011 |ref=Craven2011}}\n\n===Subdivision===\nThis [[genus]] has been progressively subdivided into a hierarchy of [[subgenus]], [[Section (botany)|section]], [[Subsection (botany)|subsection]], and [[species]].\n\n====Subgenera====\nTerminology from the Sleumer (1949) system is frequently found in older literature, with five subgenera and is as follows;\n* Subgenus ''Lepidorrhodium'' Koehne: Lepidotes. 3 sections\n* Subgenus ''Eurhododendron'' Maxim.: Elipidotes.  \n* Subgenus ''Pseudanthodendron'' Sleumer: Deciduous azaleas. 3 sections\n* Subgenus ''Anthodendron'' Rehder & Wilson: Evergreen azaleas. 3 sections\n* Subgenus ''Azaleastrum'' Planch.: 4 sections\n\nIn the later traditional classification, attributed to Chamberlain (1996), and as used by [[horticulturalists]] and the [[American Rhododendron Society]],{{sfnp|Genus Rhododendron Taxonomic Tree |ref=ARS2}} ''Rhododendron'' has eight [[subgenera]] based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], namely the presence of scales (lepidote), [[deciduousness]] of leaves, and the floral and vegetative branching patterns, after Sleumer (1980).{{sfnp|Goetsch |Eckert |Hall|2005 |ref=Goetsch}}{{sfnp|Brown |Craven |Udovicic |Ladiges |2006 |ref=Brown2006}}<ref name=Sleumer80/> These consist of four large and four small subgenera.
