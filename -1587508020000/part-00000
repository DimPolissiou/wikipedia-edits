The series centers on an ambitious and expressive [[Preadolescence|tween]] [[fly]] named Maggie Pesky and her family and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in a [[landfill|dump]]. While conceptualizing the series, Polsky wanted it to contain a playful aspect at adolescence and director [[Dave Wasson]] formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early [[Walt Disney]] cartoon shorts. ''The Buzz on Maggie'' was Disney's first series to be fully animated in [[Adobe Flash]], a process done by [[Bardel Entertainment]] and [[Future Thought Productions]].\n\n''The Buzz on Maggie'' premiered on June 17, 2005, and aired its final episode on May 27, 2006, concluding its only season. The series received positive reviews from television critics, many of whom praised its humor, voice acting and writing. The theme song \u201cJust the Way I Am\u201d, performed by Canadian singer [[Skye Sweetnam]], was also met with critical praise and a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination in 2006. During its run, ''The Buzz on Maggie'' also received an [[Annie Award]] nomination for its character design.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Maggie and Rayna.jpg|left|220px|The main characters, Maggie (left) and her best friend Rayna (right).|thumb]]\n''The Buzz on Maggie'' follows Maggie Pesky ([[Jessica DiCicco]]), an expressive 13-year-old fly and her family; parents Chauncey ([[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) and Frieda ([[Susan Tolsky]]);<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Faking History| series = The Buzz on Maggie| serieslink =| credits = Stein, Robin J; Grieb, Wendy; Wasson, Dave| network = [[Disney Channel]]| airdate = March 4, 2006| season = 1| number = 17a| time = 3:46 to 4:06| quote = '''Mrs. Pesky''': Oh hello, Mr. Bugspit!

The series centers on an ambitious and expressive [[Preadolescence|tween]] [[fly]] named Maggie Pesky and her family and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in a [[landfill|dump]]. While conceptualizing the series, Polsky wanted it to contain a playful aspect at adolescence and director [[Dave Wasson]] formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early [[Walt Disney]] cartoon shorts. ''The Buzz on Maggie'' was Disney's first series to be fully animated in [[Adobe Flash]], a process done by [[Bardel Entertainment]] and [[Future Thought Productions]].\n\n''The Buzz on Maggie'' premiered on June 17, 2005, and aired its final episode on May 27, 2006, concluding its only season. The series received positive reviews from television critics, many of whom praised its humor, voice acting and writing. The theme song \u201cJust the Way I Am\u201d, performed by Canadian singer [[Skye Sweetnam]], was also met with critical praise and a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination in 2006. During its run, ''The Buzz on Maggie'' also received an [[Annie Award]] nomination for its character design.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Maggie and Rayna.jpg|left|220px|The main characters, Maggie (left) and her best friend Rayna (right).|thumb]]\n''The Buzz on Maggie'' follows Maggie Pesky ([[Jessica DiCicco]]), an expressive 13-year-old fly and her family; parents Chauncey ([[Brian Doyle-Murray]]) and Frieda ([[Susan Tolsky]]);<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Faking History| series = The Buzz on Maggie| serieslink =| credits = Stein, Robin J; Grieb, Wendy; Wasson, Dave| network = [[Disney Channel]]| airdate = March 4, 2006| season = 1| number = 17a| time = 3:46 to 4:06| quote = '''Mrs. Pesky''': Oh hello, Mr. Bugspit!

The catalytic materials are suspended in the washcoat prior to applying to the core. Washcoat materials are selected to form a [[surface roughness|rough]], irregular surface, which greatly increases the surface area compared to the smooth surface of the bare substrate.

Rhodium is used as a [[redox|reduction]] catalyst, palladium is used as an [[redox|oxidation]] catalyst, and platinum is used both for reduction and oxidation. [[Cerium]], [[iron]], [[manganese]], and [[nickel]] are also used, although each has limitations. Nickel is not legal for use in the European Union because of its reaction with carbon monoxide into toxic [[nickel tetracarbonyl]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Copper]] can be used everywhere except [[Japan]].{{Clarify|cummins uses copper|date=October 2015}}\n\nUpon failure, a catalytic converter can be recycled into [[scrap]]. The [[precious metal]]s inside the converter, including [[platinum]], [[palladium]], and [[rhodium]], are extracted.\n\n==Placement of catalytic converters==\nCatalytic converters require a temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit (426&nbsp;\u00b0C) to efficiently convert harmful exhaust gases into inert gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor. Therefore, they are placed as close to the engine as possible.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Two-way===\nA 2-way (or \"oxidation\", sometimes called an \"oxi-cat\") catalytic converter has two simultaneous tasks:\n# [[Oxidation]] of [[carbon monoxide]] to [[carbon dioxide]]: 2 CO + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub>\n# Oxidation of [[unburned hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] (unburnt and partially burned fuel) to carbon dioxide and [[water]]: C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>2x+2</sub> + [(3x+1)/2] O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 x CO<sub>2</sub> + (x+1) H<sub>2</sub>O (a combustion reaction)\n\nThis type of catalytic converter is widely used on [[diesel engine]]s to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. They were also used on gasoline engines in American- and Canadian-market automobiles until 1981. Because of their inability to control [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]], they were superseded by three-way converters.\n\n===Three-way===\nThree-way catalytic converters (TWC) have the additional advantage of controlling the emission of [[nitric oxide|nitric oxide (NO)]] and [[nitrogen dioxide|nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)]] (both together abbreviated with [[NOx|{{NOx}}]] and not to be confused with [[nitrous oxide|nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)]]), which are precursors to [[acid rain]] and [[smog]].<ref name=TWC>{{cite journal|title=Automotive Catalytic Converters: Current Status and Some Perspectives|authors=Kaspar, Jan; Fornasiero, Paolo; Hickey, Neal |journal=Catalysis Today|year=2003|volume=77|issue=4 |pages=419\u2013449|doi=10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00384-X}}</ref>\n\nSince 1981, \"three-way\" (oxidation-reduction) catalytic converters have been used in vehicle emission control systems in the United States and Canada; many other countries have also adopted stringent [[vehicle emissions control|vehicle emission regulations]] that in effect require three-way converters on gasoline-powered vehicles. The reduction and oxidation catalysts are typically contained in a common housing; however, in some instances, they may be housed separately. A three-way catalytic converter has three simultaneous tasks:<ref name=TWC/>\n\n''[[Redox|Reduction]] of nitrogen oxides to [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>)''\n*2 CO + 2 NO \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>\n*hydrocarbon + NO \u2192 CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>\n*2 H<sub>2</sub> + 2 NO \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>\n''[[Redox|Oxidation]] of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide''\n*2 CO + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub>\n''Oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) to carbon dioxide and [[water]],'' in addition to the above NO reaction\n*hydrocarbon + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>\nThese three reactions occur most efficiently when the catalytic converter receives exhaust from an engine running slightly above the [[stoichiometric]] point. For gasoline combustion, this ratio is between 14.6 and 14.8 parts air to one part fuel, by weight. The ratio for [[autogas]] (or [[liquefied petroleum gas]] LPG), [[natural gas]], and [[ethanol]] fuels can be significantly different for each, notably so with [[oxygenate]]d or alcohol based fuels, with [[e85]] requiring approximately 34% more fuel to reach stoic, requiring modified fuel system tuning and components when using those fuels. In general, engines fitted with 3-way catalytic converters are equipped with a [[engine control unit|computerized]] [[Electronic feedback loop|closed-loop]] [[feedback]] [[fuel injection]] system using one or more [[oxygen sensor#Automotive applications|oxygen sensors]],{{Citation needed|reason=Statistical statements, both explicit and implicit alike, need to be sourced|date=September 2016}} though early in the deployment of three-way converters, [[carburetor]]s equipped with feedback mixture control were used.\n\nThree-way converters are effective when the engine is operated within a narrow band of air-fuel ratios near the stoichiometric point, such that the exhaust gas composition oscillates between rich (excess fuel) and lean (excess oxygen). Conversion efficiency falls very rapidly when the engine is operated outside of this band. Under lean engine operation, the exhaust contains excess oxygen, and the reduction of {{NOx}} is not favored. Under rich conditions, the excess fuel consumes all of the available oxygen prior to the catalyst, leaving only oxygen stored in the catalyst available for the oxidation function.\n\nClosed-loop engine control systems are necessary for effective operation of three-way catalytic converters because of the continuous balancing required for effective {{NOx}} reduction and HC oxidation. The control system must prevent the {{NOx}} reduction catalyst from becoming fully oxidized, yet replenish the oxygen storage material so that its function as an oxidation catalyst is maintained.\n\nThree-way catalytic converters can store oxygen from the exhaust gas stream, usually when the [[air\u2013fuel ratio]] goes lean.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1= Brandt|first1= Erich|last2= Wang|first2= Yanying|last3= Grizzle|first3= Jessy|title= Dynamic Modeling of a Three Way Catalyst for SI Engine Exhaust Emission Control|journal= IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology|volume= 8|issue= 5|pages= 767\u2013776|year= 2000|url= http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~grizzle/papers/TWC98.pdf|doi= 10.1109/87.865850}}</ref> When sufficient oxygen is not available from the exhaust stream, the stored oxygen is released and consumed ''(see [[cerium(IV) oxide]])''. A lack of sufficient oxygen occurs either when oxygen derived from {{NOx}} reduction is unavailable or when certain maneuvers such as hard acceleration enrich the mixture beyond the ability of the converter to supply oxygen.\n\n====Unwanted reactions====\nUnwanted reactions can occur in the three-way catalyst, such as the formation of odoriferous [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]]. Formation of each can be limited by modifications to the washcoat and precious metals used. It is difficult to eliminate these byproducts entirely. Sulfur-free or low-sulfur fuels eliminate or reduce hydrogen sulfide.\n\nFor example, when control of hydrogen-sulfide emissions is desired, [[nickel]] or [[manganese]] is added to the washcoat. Both substances act to block the [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of [[sulfur]] by the washcoat. Hydrogen sulfide forms when the washcoat has absorbed sulfur during a low-temperature part of the operating cycle, which is then released during the high-temperature part of the cycle and the sulfur combines with HC.\n\n===Diesel engines {{Anchor|Diesel Oxidation Catalyst|DOC}}===\nFor compression-ignition (i.e., [[diesel engine|diesel]]) engines, the most commonly used catalytic converter is the '''diesel oxidation catalyst''' ('''DOC'''). DOCs contain [[palladium]], [[platinum]], and [[aluminium oxide]], all of which catalytically [[redox|oxidize]] the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.\n:2 CO + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 {{CO2}}\n:C<sub>''x''</sub>H<sub>2''x''+2</sub> + [(3''x''+1)/2] O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 ''x'' CO<sub>2</sub> + (''x''+1) H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThese converters often operate at 90 percent efficiency, virtually eliminating diesel odor and helping reduce visible [[particulates]] ([[soot]]). These catalysts do not reduce {{NOx}} because any reductant present would react first with the high concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in diesel exhaust gas.\n\nReduction in {{NOx}} emissions from compression-ignition engines has previously been addressed by the addition of exhaust gas to incoming air charge, known as [[exhaust gas recirculation]] (EGR).\n\nIn 2010, most light-duty diesel manufacturers in the U.S. added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet new federal emissions requirements. There are two techniques that have been developed for the catalytic reduction of {{NOx}} emissions under lean exhaust conditions: [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) and the lean {{NOx}} trap or [[NOx adsorber|{{NOx}} adsorber]].\n\nInstead of precious metal-containing {{NOx}} absorbers, most manufacturers selected base-metal SCR systems that use a [[reagent]] such as [[ammonia]] to reduce the {{NOx}} into nitrogen. Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of [[urea]] into the exhaust, which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia. The urea solution is also referred to as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).\n\n[[Diesel exhaust]] contains relatively high levels of [[particulate matter]] (PM). Catalytic converters do not remove PM so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or [[diesel particulate filter]] (DPF). In the U.S., all on-road light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after January 1, 2007, must meet diesel particulate emission limits, meaning that they effectively have to be equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. Note that this applies only to the diesel engine used in the vehicle. As long as the engine was manufactured before January 1, 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/otaq/highway-diesel/regs/f00057.pdf |title=Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards and Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements|date=2015-08-19}}&nbsp;{{small|(123&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\n\n===Lean-burn spark-ignition engines===\nFor [[lean-burn]] [[spark-ignition]] engines, an oxidation catalyst is used in the same manner as in a diesel engine. Emissions from lean burn spark ignition engines are very similar to emissions from a diesel compression ignition engine.\n\n==Installation==\nMany vehicles have a close-coupled catalytic converter located near the engine's [[exhaust manifold]]. The converter heats up quickly, due to its exposure to the very hot exhaust gases, enabling it to reduce undesirable emissions during the engine warm-up period. This is achieved by burning off the excess hydrocarbons which result from the extra-rich mixture required for a cold start.\n\nWhen catalytic converters were first introduced, most vehicles used [[carburetor]]s that provided a relatively rich [[air\u2013fuel ratio|air-fuel ratio]]. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels in the exhaust stream were therefore generally insufficient for the catalytic reaction to occur efficiently. Most designs of the time therefore included [[secondary air injection]], which injected air into the exhaust stream. This increased the available oxygen, allowing the catalyst to function as intended.\n\nSome three-way catalytic converter systems have air injection systems with the air injected between the first ({{NOx}} reduction) and second (HC and CO oxidation) stages of the converter. As in two-way converters, this injected air provides oxygen for the oxidation reactions. An upstream air injection point, ahead of the catalytic converter, is also sometimes present to provide additional oxygen only during the engine warm up period. This causes unburned fuel to ignite in the exhaust tract, thereby preventing it reaching the catalytic converter at all. This technique reduces the engine runtime needed for the catalytic converter to reach its \"light-off\" or [[operating temperature]].\n\nMost newer vehicles have [[fuel injection#Supersession of carburetors|electronic fuel injection]] systems, and do not require air injection systems in their exhausts. Instead, they provide a precisely controlled air-fuel mixture that quickly and continually cycles between lean and rich combustion. [[Oxygen sensor]]s monitor the exhaust oxygen content before and after the catalytic converter, and the [[engine control unit]] uses this information to adjust the fuel injection so as to prevent the first ({{NOx}} reduction) catalyst from becoming oxygen-loaded, while simultaneously ensuring the second (HC and CO oxidation) catalyst is sufficiently oxygen-saturated.\n\n==Damage==\n[[Catalyst poisoning]] occurs when the catalytic converter is exposed to exhaust containing substances that coat the working surfaces, so that they cannot contact and react with the exhaust. The most notable contaminant is [[tetraethyllead|lead]], so vehicles equipped with catalytic converters can run only on [[unleaded gasoline|unleaded]] fuel. Other common catalyst poisons include [[sulfur]], [[manganese]] (originating primarily from the gasoline additive [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl|MMT]]), and [[silicon]], which can enter the exhaust stream if the engine has a leak that allows [[antifreeze|coolant]] into the combustion chamber. [[Phosphorus]] is another catalyst contaminant. Although phosphorus is no longer used in gasoline, it (and [[zinc]], another low-level catalyst contaminant) was until recently widely used in engine oil [[AW additive|antiwear additives]] such as [[zinc dithiophosphate]] (ZDDP). Beginning in 2004, a limit of phosphorus concentration in engine oils was adopted in the [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] SM and [[motor oil#ILSAC|ILSAC]] GF-4 specifications.\n\nDepending on the contaminant, catalyst poisoning can sometimes be reversed by running the engine under a very heavy load for an extended period of time. The increased exhaust temperature can sometimes vaporize or sublime the contaminant, removing it from the catalytic surface. However, removal of lead deposits in this manner is usually not possible because of lead's high boiling point.\n\nAny condition that causes abnormally high levels of unburned hydrocarbons\u2014raw or partially burnt fuel\u2014to reach the converter will tend to significantly elevate its temperature, bringing the risk of a meltdown of the substrate and resultant catalytic deactivation and severe exhaust restriction. Usually the upstream components of the exhaust system (manifold/header assembly and associated clamps susceptible to rust/corrosion and/or fatigue e.g. the exhaust manifold splintering after repeated heat cycling), ignition system e.g. coil packs and/or primary ignition components (e.g. distributor cap, wires, ignition coil and spark plugs) and/or damaged fuel system components (fuel injectors, fuel pressure regulator, and associated sensors) - since 2006 [[ethanol]] has been used frequently with fuel blends where fuel system components which are not ethanol compatible can damage a catalytic converter - this also includes using a thicker oil viscosity not recommended by the manufacturer (especially with [[ZDDP]] content - this includes \"high mileage\" blends regardless if its conventional or synthetic oil), oil and/or coolant leaks (e.g. blown head gasket inclusive of engine overheating). Vehicles equipped with [[OBD-II]] diagnostic systems are designed to alert the driver to a misfire condition by means of illuminating the \"check engine\" light on the dashboard, or flashing it if the current misfire conditions are severe enough to potentially damage the catalytic converter.\n\n==Regulations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nEmissions regulations vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Most automobile spark-ignition engines in North America have been fitted with catalytic converters since 1975,<ref name=Palucka/><ref name=Petersen/><ref name=GM_advert/><ref name=Sentinel_1974/> and the technology used in non-automotive applications is generally based on automotive technology.\n\nRegulations for diesel engines are similarly varied, with some jurisdictions focusing on {{NOx}} (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions and others focusing on particulate (soot) emissions. This regulatory diversity is challenging for manufacturers of engines, as it may not be economical to design an engine to meet two sets of regulations.\n\nRegulations of fuel quality vary across jurisdictions. In North America, Europe, Japan, and [[Hong Kong]], gasoline and diesel fuel are highly regulated, and [[compressed natural gas]] and LPG (autogas) are being reviewed for regulation. In most of Asia and Africa, the regulations are often lax: in some places [[sulfur]] content of the fuel can reach 20,000 parts per million (2%). Any sulfur in the fuel can be oxidized to SO<sub>2</sub> ([[sulfur dioxide]]) or even SO<sub>3</sub> ([[sulfur trioxide]]) in the [[combustion chamber]]. If sulfur passes over a catalyst, it may be further oxidized in the catalyst, i.e., SO<sub>2</sub> may be further oxidized to SO<sub>3</sub>. Sulfur oxides are precursors to [[sulfuric acid]], a major component of [[acid rain]]. While it is possible to add substances such as [[vanadium]] to the catalyst washcoat to combat sulfur-oxide formation, such addition will reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst. The most effective solution is to further refine fuel at the refinery to produce [[ultra-low-sulfur diesel]]. Regulations in Japan, Europe, and North America tightly restrict the amount of sulfur permitted in motor fuels. However, the direct financial expense of producing such clean fuel may make it impractical for use in developing countries.

On-board diagnostic systems take several forms.\n\nTemperature [[sensor]]s are used for two purposes. The first is as a warning system, typically on two-way catalytic converters such as are still sometimes used on LPG forklifts. The function of the sensor is to warn of catalytic converter temperature above the safe limit of {{convert|750|C|F}}. More-recent catalytic-converter designs are not as susceptible to temperature damage and can withstand sustained temperatures of {{convert|900|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Temperature sensors are also used to monitor catalyst functioning: usually two sensors will be fitted, with one before the catalyst and one after to monitor the temperature rise over the catalytic-converter core.\n\nThe [[oxygen sensor#Automotive applications|oxygen sensor]] is the basis of the [[feedback|closed-loop]] control system on a spark-ignited rich-burn engine; however, it is also used for diagnostics. In vehicles with [[OBD II]], a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O<sub>2</sub> levels. The O<sub>2</sub> levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. The readings are taken by voltage measurements. If both sensors show the same output or the rear O<sub>2</sub> is \"switching\", the computer recognizes that the catalytic converter either is not functioning or has been removed, and will operate a malfunction indicator lamp and affect engine performance. Simple \"oxygen sensor simulators\" have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre-assembled devices available on the Internet. Although these are not legal for on-road use, they have been used with mixed results.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eponline.com/articles/2007/07/01/settlement-involves-illegal-emission-control-defeat-devices-sold-for-autos.aspx|title=Settlement Involves Illegal Emission Control 'Defeat Devices' Sold for Autos|date=1 June 2007}}</ref> Similar devices apply an offset to the sensor signals, allowing the engine to run a more fuel-economical lean burn that may, however, damage the engine or the catalytic converter.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Concord Monitor]]|title=Check Engine Lights Come on for a Reason|date=12 January 2003}}</ref>\n\n{{NOx}} sensors are extremely expensive and are in general used only when a compression-ignition engine is fitted with a selective catalytic-reduction (SCR) converter, or a {{NOx}} absorber catalyst in a feedback system. When fitted to an SCR system, there may be one or two sensors. When one sensor is fitted it will be pre-catalyst; when two are fitted, the second one will be post-catalyst.

The [[precious metal]]s inside the converter, including [[platinum]], [[palladium]], and [[rhodium]], are extracted.\n\n==Placement of catalytic converters==\nCatalytic converters require a temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit (426&nbsp;\u00b0C) to efficiently convert harmful exhaust gases into inert gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor. Therefore, they are placed as close to the engine as possible.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Two-way===\nA 2-way (or \"oxidation\", sometimes called an \"oxi-cat\") catalytic converter has two simultaneous tasks:\n# [[Oxidation]] of [[carbon monoxide]] to [[carbon dioxide]]: 2 CO + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub>\n# Oxidation of [[unburned hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] (unburnt and partially burned fuel) to carbon dioxide and [[water]]: C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>2x+2</sub> + [(3x+1)/2] O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 x CO<sub>2</sub> + (x+1) H<sub>2</sub>O (a combustion reaction)\n\nThis type of catalytic converter is widely used on [[diesel engine]]s to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. They were also used on gasoline engines in American- and Canadian-market automobiles until 1981. Because of their inability to control [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]], they were superseded by three-way converters.\n\n===Three-way===\nThree-way catalytic converters (TWC) have the additional advantage of controlling the emission of [[nitric oxide|nitric oxide (NO)]] and [[nitrogen dioxide|nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)]] (both together abbreviated with [[NOx|{{NOx}}]] and not to be confused with [[nitrous oxide|nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)]]), which are precursors to [[acid rain]] and [[smog]].<ref name=TWC>{{cite journal|title=Automotive Catalytic Converters: Current Status and Some Perspectives|authors=Kaspar, Jan; Fornasiero, Paolo; Hickey, Neal |journal=Catalysis Today|year=2003|volume=77|issue=4 |pages=419\u2013449|doi=10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00384-X}}</ref>\n\nSince 1981, \"three-way\" (oxidation-reduction) catalytic converters have been used in vehicle emission control systems in the United States and Canada; many other countries have also adopted stringent [[vehicle emissions control|vehicle emission regulations]] that in effect require three-way converters on gasoline-powered vehicles. The reduction and oxidation catalysts are typically contained in a common housing; however, in some instances, they may be housed separately. A three-way catalytic converter has three simultaneous tasks:<ref name=TWC/>\n\n''[[Redox|Reduction]] of nitrogen oxides to [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>)''\n*2 CO + 2 NO \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>\n*hydrocarbon + NO \u2192 CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>\n*2 H<sub>2</sub> + 2 NO \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>\n''[[Redox|Oxidation]] of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide''\n*2 CO + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub>\n''Oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) to carbon dioxide and [[water]],'' in addition to the above NO reaction\n*hydrocarbon + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>\nThese three reactions occur most efficiently when the catalytic converter receives exhaust from an engine running slightly above the [[stoichiometric]] point. For gasoline combustion, this ratio is between 14.6 and 14.8 parts air to one part fuel, by weight. The ratio for [[autogas]] (or [[liquefied petroleum gas]] LPG), [[natural gas]], and [[ethanol]] fuels can be significantly different for each, notably so with [[oxygenate]]d or alcohol based fuels, with [[e85]] requiring approximately 34% more fuel to reach stoic, requiring modified fuel system tuning and components when using those fuels. In general, engines fitted with 3-way catalytic converters are equipped with a [[engine control unit|computerized]] [[Electronic feedback loop|closed-loop]] [[feedback]] [[fuel injection]] system using one or more [[oxygen sensor#Automotive applications|oxygen sensors]],{{Citation needed|reason=Statistical statements, both explicit and implicit alike, need to be sourced|date=September 2016}} though early in the deployment of three-way converters, [[carburetor]]s equipped with feedback mixture control were used.\n\nThree-way converters are effective when the engine is operated within a narrow band of air-fuel ratios near the stoichiometric point, such that the exhaust gas composition oscillates between rich (excess fuel) and lean (excess oxygen). Conversion efficiency falls very rapidly when the engine is operated outside of this band. Under lean engine operation, the exhaust contains excess oxygen, and the reduction of {{NOx}} is not favored. Under rich conditions, the excess fuel consumes all of the available oxygen prior to the catalyst, leaving only oxygen stored in the catalyst available for the oxidation function.\n\nClosed-loop engine control systems are necessary for effective operation of three-way catalytic converters because of the continuous balancing required for effective {{NOx}} reduction and HC oxidation. The control system must prevent the {{NOx}} reduction catalyst from becoming fully oxidized, yet replenish the oxygen storage material so that its function as an oxidation catalyst is maintained.\n\nThree-way catalytic converters can store oxygen from the exhaust gas stream, usually when the [[air\u2013fuel ratio]] goes lean.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1= Brandt|first1= Erich|last2= Wang|first2= Yanying|last3= Grizzle|first3= Jessy|title= Dynamic Modeling of a Three Way Catalyst for SI Engine Exhaust Emission Control|journal= IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology|volume= 8|issue= 5|pages= 767\u2013776|year= 2000|url= http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~grizzle/papers/TWC98.pdf|doi= 10.1109/87.865850}}</ref> When sufficient oxygen is not available from the exhaust stream, the stored oxygen is released and consumed ''(see [[cerium(IV) oxide]])''. A lack of sufficient oxygen occurs either when oxygen derived from {{NOx}} reduction is unavailable or when certain maneuvers such as hard acceleration enrich the mixture beyond the ability of the converter to supply oxygen.\n\n====Unwanted reactions====\nUnwanted reactions can occur in the three-way catalyst, such as the formation of odoriferous [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]]. Formation of each can be limited by modifications to the washcoat and precious metals used. It is difficult to eliminate these byproducts entirely. Sulfur-free or low-sulfur fuels eliminate or reduce hydrogen sulfide.\n\nFor example, when control of hydrogen-sulfide emissions is desired, [[nickel]] or [[manganese]] is added to the washcoat. Both substances act to block the [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of [[sulfur]] by the washcoat. Hydrogen sulfide forms when the washcoat has absorbed sulfur during a low-temperature part of the operating cycle, which is then released during the high-temperature part of the cycle and the sulfur combines with HC.\n\n===Diesel engines {{Anchor|Diesel Oxidation Catalyst|DOC}}===\nFor compression-ignition (i.e., [[diesel engine|diesel]]) engines, the most commonly used catalytic converter is the '''diesel oxidation catalyst''' ('''DOC'''). DOCs contain [[palladium]], [[platinum]], and [[aluminium oxide]], all of which catalytically [[redox|oxidize]] the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.\n:2 CO + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 {{CO2}}\n:C<sub>''x''</sub>H<sub>2''x''+2</sub> + [(3''x''+1)/2] O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 ''x'' CO<sub>2</sub> + (''x''+1) H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThese converters often operate at 90 percent efficiency, virtually eliminating diesel odor and helping reduce visible [[particulates]] ([[soot]]). These catalysts do not reduce {{NOx}} because any reductant present would react first with the high concentration of O<sub>2</sub> in diesel exhaust gas.\n\nReduction in {{NOx}} emissions from compression-ignition engines has previously been addressed by the addition of exhaust gas to incoming air charge, known as [[exhaust gas recirculation]] (EGR).\n\nIn 2010, most light-duty diesel manufacturers in the U.S. added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet new federal emissions requirements. There are two techniques that have been developed for the catalytic reduction of {{NOx}} emissions under lean exhaust conditions: [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) and the lean {{NOx}} trap or [[NOx adsorber|{{NOx}} adsorber]].\n\nInstead of precious metal-containing {{NOx}} absorbers, most manufacturers selected base-metal SCR systems that use a [[reagent]] such as [[ammonia]] to reduce the {{NOx}} into nitrogen. Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of [[urea]] into the exhaust, which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia. The urea solution is also referred to as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).\n\n[[Diesel exhaust]] contains relatively high levels of [[particulate matter]] (PM). Catalytic converters do not remove PM so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or [[diesel particulate filter]] (DPF). In the U.S., all on-road light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after January 1, 2007, must meet diesel particulate emission limits, meaning that they effectively have to be equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. Note that this applies only to the diesel engine used in the vehicle. As long as the engine was manufactured before January 1, 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/otaq/highway-diesel/regs/f00057.pdf |title=Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards and Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements|date=2015-08-19}}&nbsp;{{small|(123&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\n\n===Lean-burn spark-ignition engines===\nFor [[lean-burn]] [[spark-ignition]] engines, an oxidation catalyst is used in the same manner as in a diesel engine. Emissions from lean burn spark ignition engines are very similar to emissions from a diesel compression ignition engine.\n\n==Installation==\nMany vehicles have a close-coupled catalytic converter located near the engine's [[exhaust manifold]]. The converter heats up quickly, due to its exposure to the very hot exhaust gases, enabling it to reduce undesirable emissions during the engine warm-up period. This is achieved by burning off the excess hydrocarbons which result from the extra-rich mixture required for a cold start.\n\nWhen catalytic converters were first introduced, most vehicles used [[carburetor]]s that provided a relatively rich [[air\u2013fuel ratio|air-fuel ratio]]. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels in the exhaust stream were therefore generally insufficient for the catalytic reaction to occur efficiently. Most designs of the time therefore included [[secondary air injection]], which injected air into the exhaust stream. This increased the available oxygen, allowing the catalyst to function as intended.\n\nSome three-way catalytic converter systems have air injection systems with the air injected between the first ({{NOx}} reduction) and second (HC and CO oxidation) stages of the converter. As in two-way converters, this injected air provides oxygen for the oxidation reactions. An upstream air injection point, ahead of the catalytic converter, is also sometimes present to provide additional oxygen only during the engine warm up period. This causes unburned fuel to ignite in the exhaust tract, thereby preventing it reaching the catalytic converter at all. This technique reduces the engine runtime needed for the catalytic converter to reach its \"light-off\" or [[operating temperature]].\n\nMost newer vehicles have [[fuel injection#Supersession of carburetors|electronic fuel injection]] systems, and do not require air injection systems in their exhausts. Instead, they provide a precisely controlled air-fuel mixture that quickly and continually cycles between lean and rich combustion. [[Oxygen sensor]]s monitor the exhaust oxygen content before and after the catalytic converter, and the [[engine control unit]] uses this information to adjust the fuel injection so as to prevent the first ({{NOx}} reduction) catalyst from becoming oxygen-loaded, while simultaneously ensuring the second (HC and CO oxidation) catalyst is sufficiently oxygen-saturated.\n\n==Damage==\n[[Catalyst poisoning]] occurs when the catalytic converter is exposed to exhaust containing substances that coat the working surfaces, so that they cannot contact and react with the exhaust. The most notable contaminant is [[tetraethyllead|lead]], so vehicles equipped with catalytic converters can run only on [[unleaded gasoline|unleaded]] fuel. Other common catalyst poisons include [[sulfur]], [[manganese]] (originating primarily from the gasoline additive [[methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl|MMT]]), and [[silicon]], which can enter the exhaust stream if the engine has a leak that allows [[antifreeze|coolant]] into the combustion chamber. [[Phosphorus]] is another catalyst contaminant. Although phosphorus is no longer used in gasoline, it (and [[zinc]], another low-level catalyst contaminant) was until recently widely used in engine oil [[AW additive|antiwear additives]] such as [[zinc dithiophosphate]] (ZDDP). Beginning in 2004, a limit of phosphorus concentration in engine oils was adopted in the [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] SM and [[motor oil#ILSAC|ILSAC]] GF-4 specifications.\n\nDepending on the contaminant, catalyst poisoning can sometimes be reversed by running the engine under a very heavy load for an extended period of time. The increased exhaust temperature can sometimes vaporize or sublime the contaminant, removing it from the catalytic surface. However, removal of lead deposits in this manner is usually not possible because of lead's high boiling point.\n\nAny condition that causes abnormally high levels of unburned hydrocarbons\u2014raw or partially burnt fuel\u2014to reach the converter will tend to significantly elevate its temperature, bringing the risk of a meltdown of the substrate and resultant catalytic deactivation and severe exhaust restriction. Usually the upstream components of the exhaust system (manifold/header assembly and associated clamps susceptible to rust/corrosion and/or fatigue e.g. the exhaust manifold splintering after repeated heat cycling), ignition system e.g. coil packs and/or primary ignition components (e.g. distributor cap, wires, ignition coil and spark plugs) and/or damaged fuel system components (fuel injectors, fuel pressure regulator, and associated sensors) - since 2006 [[ethanol]] has been used frequently with fuel blends where fuel system components which are not ethanol compatible can damage a catalytic converter - this also includes using a thicker oil viscosity not recommended by the manufacturer (especially with [[ZDDP]] content - this includes \"high mileage\" blends regardless if its conventional or synthetic oil), oil and/or coolant leaks (e.g. blown head gasket inclusive of engine overheating). Vehicles equipped with [[OBD-II]] diagnostic systems are designed to alert the driver to a misfire condition by means of illuminating the \"check engine\" light on the dashboard, or flashing it if the current misfire conditions are severe enough to potentially damage the catalytic converter.\n\n==Regulations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nEmissions regulations vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Most automobile spark-ignition engines in North America have been fitted with catalytic converters since 1975,<ref name=Palucka/><ref name=Petersen/><ref name=GM_advert/><ref name=Sentinel_1974/> and the technology used in non-automotive applications is generally based on automotive technology.\n\nRegulations for diesel engines are similarly varied, with some jurisdictions focusing on {{NOx}} (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions and others focusing on particulate (soot) emissions. This regulatory diversity is challenging for manufacturers of engines, as it may not be economical to design an engine to meet two sets of regulations.\n\nRegulations of fuel quality vary across jurisdictions. In North America, Europe, Japan, and [[Hong Kong]], gasoline and diesel fuel are highly regulated, and [[compressed natural gas]] and LPG (autogas) are being reviewed for regulation. In most of Asia and Africa, the regulations are often lax: in some places [[sulfur]] content of the fuel can reach 20,000 parts per million (2%). Any sulfur in the fuel can be oxidized to SO<sub>2</sub> ([[sulfur dioxide]]) or even SO<sub>3</sub> ([[sulfur trioxide]]) in the [[combustion chamber]]. If sulfur passes over a catalyst, it may be further oxidized in the catalyst, i.e., SO<sub>2</sub> may be further oxidized to SO<sub>3</sub>. Sulfur oxides are precursors to [[sulfuric acid]], a major component of [[acid rain]]. While it is possible to add substances such as [[vanadium]] to the catalyst washcoat to combat sulfur-oxide formation, such addition will reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst. The most effective solution is to further refine fuel at the refinery to produce [[ultra-low-sulfur diesel]]. Regulations in Japan, Europe, and North America tightly restrict the amount of sulfur permitted in motor fuels. However, the direct financial expense of producing such clean fuel may make it impractical for use in developing countries. As a result, cities in these countries with high levels of vehicular traffic suffer from acid rain,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} which damages stone and woodwork of buildings, poisons humans and other animals, and damages local [[ecosystem]]s, at a very high financial cost.\n\n==Negative aspects==\nCatalytic converters restrict the free flow of exhaust, which negatively affects vehicle performance and fuel economy, especially in older cars.<ref name=\"gaisun\">{{Cite news|title=Kits to Foil Auto Pollution Control Are Selling Well|author=Crutsinger, Martin|work=[[The Gainesville Sun]]|date=29 September 1982}}</ref> Because early cars' carburetors were incapable of precise fuel-air mixture control, the cars' catalytic converters could overheat and ignite flammable materials under the car.<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=The Bulletin{{Clarify|date=December 2010|reason=which one? there are several such named publications}}|date=14 June 1976|title=Catalytic Converter Still Controversial after Two Years of Use|author=Ullman, Owen}}</ref> A 2006 test on a 1999 Honda Civic showed that removing the stock catalytic converter netted a 3% increase in horsepower; a new metallic core converter only cost the car 1% horsepower, compared to no converter.<ref name=\"imptune\">{{cite web |url=http://www.importtuner.com/features/0610impp_catalytic_converter_removal/viewall.html |title=Beat the Law |date=1 October 2006 |website=Import Tuner |access-date=9 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228203151/http://www.importtuner.com/features/0610impp_catalytic_converter_removal/viewall.html |archivedate=28 February 2014}}</ref> To some performance enthusiasts, this modest increase in power for very little or no cost encourages the removal or \"gutting\" of the catalytic converter.<ref name=\"gaisun\"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Some of Us Can Only Afford a Clunker|work=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=23 February 1996}}</ref> In such cases, the converter may be replaced by a welded-in section of ordinary pipe or a flanged \"test pipe\", ostensibly meant to check if the converter is clogged, by comparing how the engine runs with and without the converter. This facilitates temporary reinstallation of the converter in order to pass an emission test.<ref name=\"imptune\"/> In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to remove or disable a catalytic converter for any reason other than its direct and immediate replacement. In the United States, for example, it is a violation of Section 203(a)(3)(A) of the 1990 amended [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] for a vehicle repair shop to remove a converter from a vehicle, or cause a converter to be removed from a vehicle, except in order to replace it with another converter,<ref name=51FR150>[http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/civil/caa/mobile/amccpolicy.pdf Sale and Use of Aftermarket Catalytic Converters], US Environmental Protection Agency, US Federal Register Volume 51</ref> and Section 203(a)(3)(B) makes it illegal for any person to sell or to install any part that would bypass, defeat, or render inoperative any emission control system, device, or design element. Vehicles without functioning catalytic converters generally fail emission inspections.

On-board diagnostic systems take several forms.\n\nTemperature [[sensor]]s are used for two purposes. The first is as a warning system, typically on two-way catalytic converters such as are still sometimes used on LPG forklifts. The function of the sensor is to warn of catalytic converter temperature above the safe limit of {{convert|750|C|F}}. More-recent catalytic-converter designs are not as susceptible to temperature damage and can withstand sustained temperatures of {{convert|900|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Temperature sensors are also used to monitor catalyst functioning: usually two sensors will be fitted, with one before the catalyst and one after to monitor the temperature rise over the catalytic-converter core.\n\nThe [[oxygen sensor#Automotive applications|oxygen sensor]] is the basis of the [[feedback|closed-loop]] control system on a spark-ignited rich-burn engine; however, it is also used for diagnostics. In vehicles with [[OBD II]], a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O<sub>2</sub> levels. The O<sub>2</sub> levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. The readings are taken by voltage measurements. If both sensors show the same output or the rear O<sub>2</sub> is \"switching\", the computer recognizes that the catalytic converter either is not functioning or has been removed, and will operate a malfunction indicator lamp and affect engine performance. Simple \"oxygen sensor simulators\" have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre-assembled devices available on the Internet.

They are used for the same reasons and in the same manner as an oxygen sensor; the only difference is the substance being monitored.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catalytic heater]]\n*[[Cerium(III) oxide]]\n*[[NOx adsorber|{{NOx}} adsorber]]\n*[[Roadway air dispersion modeling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Keith, C.

In its first year, a new, unbranched stem (\"[[primocane]]\") grows vigorously to its full height of 1.5\u20132.5 m (5.0\u20138.3 feet), bearing large [[pinnately compound]] [[leaves]] with five or seven leaflets, but usually no flowers. In its second year (as a \"[[floricane]]\"), a stem does not grow taller, but produces several side shoots, which bear smaller leaves with three or five leaflets. The [[flower]]s are produced in late spring on short [[raceme]]s on the tips of these side shoots, each flower about 1&nbsp;cm (0.4 inches) diameter with five white [[petal]]s. The [[fruit]] is red, edible, and sweet but tart-flavoured, produced in summer or early autumn; in [[botanical]] terminology, it is not a [[Berry (botany)|berry]] at all, but an [[aggregate fruit]] of numerous [[drupelet]]s around a central core. In raspberries (various species of [[Rubus subg. Idaeobatus|''Rubus'' subgenus ''Idaeobatus'']]), the drupelets separate from the core when picked, leaving a hollow fruit, whereas in [[blackberry|blackberries]] and most other species of ''Rubus,'' the drupelets stay attached to the core.<ref name=fnwe>{{cite web |website=Flora of NW Europe |url=http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&menuentry=soorten&id=2609 |title=''Rubus idaeus''}}</ref><ref name=foc>{{eFloras|2|200011446|Rubus idaeus |family=Rosaceae |last1=Lu |first1=Lingdi<!-- surname given first? --> |first2=David E. |last2=Boufford}}</ref><ref name=blamey>{{cite book |last1=Blamey |first1=M. |last2=Grey-Wilson |first2=C. |date=1989 |title=Flora of Britain and Northern Europe |isbn=0-340-40170-2}}.</ref><ref name=rhs>{{cite book |editor-last=Huxley |editor-first=A. |date=1992 |title=New RHS Dictionary of Gardening |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-47494-5}}.</ref>\n\n==Biotope==\nAs a wild plant, ''R. idaeus'' typically grows in forests, forming open stands under a tree canopy, and denser stands in clearings.

In its first year, a new, unbranched stem (\"[[primocane]]\") grows vigorously to its full height of 1.5\u20132.5 m (5.0\u20138.3 feet), bearing large [[pinnately compound]] [[leaves]] with five or seven leaflets, but usually no flowers. In its second year (as a \"[[floricane]]\"), a stem does not grow taller, but produces several side shoots, which bear smaller leaves with three or five leaflets. The [[flower]]s are produced in late spring on short [[raceme]]s on the tips of these side shoots, each flower about 1&nbsp;cm (0.4 inches) diameter with five white [[petal]]s. The [[fruit]] is red, edible, and sweet but tart-flavoured, produced in summer or early autumn; in [[botanical]] terminology, it is not a [[Berry (botany)|berry]] at all, but an [[aggregate fruit]] of numerous [[drupelet]]s around a central core. In raspberries (various species of [[Rubus subg. Idaeobatus|''Rubus'' subgenus ''Idaeobatus'']]), the drupelets separate from the core when picked, leaving a hollow fruit, whereas in [[blackberry|blackberries]] and most other species of ''Rubus,'' the drupelets stay attached to the core.<ref name=fnwe>{{cite web |website=Flora of NW Europe |url=http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/BIS/flora.php?selected=beschrijving&menuentry=soorten&id=2609 |title=''Rubus idaeus''}}</ref><ref name=foc>{{eFloras|2|200011446|Rubus idaeus |family=Rosaceae |last1=Lu |first1=Lingdi<!-- surname given first? --> |first2=David E. |last2=Boufford}}</ref><ref name=blamey>{{cite book |last1=Blamey |first1=M. |last2=Grey-Wilson |first2=C. |date=1989 |title=Flora of Britain and Northern Europe |isbn=0-340-40170-2}}.</ref><ref name=rhs>{{cite book |editor-last=Huxley |editor-first=A. |date=1992 |title=New RHS Dictionary of Gardening |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-333-47494-5}}.</ref>\n\n==Biotope==\nAs a wild plant, ''R. idaeus'' typically grows in forests, forming open stands under a tree canopy, and denser stands in clearings.

Known for most of its length as the Maybank Highway, the state highway runs {{convert|20.38|mi|km}} from a [[Dead end (street)|dead end]] in [[Rockville, South Carolina|Rockville]] east to [[U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina|U.S. Highway 17]] (US 17) in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. SC 700 connects Charleston with [[James Island (South Carolina)|James Island]], [[Johns Island, South Carolina|Johns Island]], and [[Wadmalaw Island]] in southwestern [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston County]].\n\n==Route description==\nSC 700 begins at a dead end in the town of Rockville on Wadmalaw Island. The terminus is on the north side of Bohicket Creek, which separates Wadmalaw Island from [[Seabrook Island]], a short distance east of Bohicket Creek's mouth on the [[Edisto River|North Edisto River]]. The state highway heads northeast as Maybank Highway, a two-lane road that passes by the [[Charleston Tea Plantation]], the only working tea plantation in the United States, and near the [[Firefly Distillery]], which is on Bear Bluff Road on the portion of the island north of Leadenwah Creek. SR 700 crosses Church Creek onto Johns Island, enters an outlying section of the city of Charleston, and arrives at the main crossroads of the island near the site of the venerable [[Angel Oak]]. Main Road heads north from the junction through the northern part of the island before crossing the [[Stono River]] on the [[John F. Limehouse Memorial Bridge]] to meet US 17 between [[Rantowles, South Carolina|Rantowles]] and Charleston. Bohicket Road heads south toward Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. SC 700 continues east and near the eastern end of the island intersects River Road, which leads south to [[Charleston Executive Airport]].<ref name=\"SCDOT County Maps\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps SC 700\"/>\n\nSC 700 expands to four lanes and crosses Pennys Creek and the Stono River on the high-level [[Paul Gelegotis Bridge]] and enters James Island. The highway passes through a golf course and along the south side of the historic [[Riverland Terrace]] neighborhood. SC 700 continues into a commercial area where the highway has a [[wye (rail)|wye]]-type junction with [[South Carolina Highway 171|SC 171]] (Folly Road) west of the [[McLeod Plantation]] and Charleston Country Club. Old Folly Road is used for the movements from eastbound SC 700 to southbound SC 171 and from northbound SC 171 to westbound SC 700. SC 700 and SC 171 head north concurrently on Folly Road, which has two lanes northbound and three lanes southbound. The highways enter the [[West Ashley]] section of Charleston by crossing Wappoo Creek, part of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], on a [[Wappoo Creek Bridge|drawbridge]] named for [[Burnet R. Maybank]]. SC 700 and SC 171 diverge at a directional intersection that does not allow access from southbound SR 171 to eastbound SC 700. SC 171 heads north as Wesley Drive and is used to access southbound US 17 (Savannah Highway) and [[South Carolina Highway 61|SC 61]] (St. Andrews Boulevard). SC 700 heads northeast as five-lane Folly Road (three lanes westbound and two lanes eastbound) to its eastern terminus at a partial interchange with US 17 just west of the U.S. Highway's interchange with SC 61 and its bridges over the [[Ashley River (South Carolina)|Ashley River]].
