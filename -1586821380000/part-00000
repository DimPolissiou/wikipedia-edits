She is voiced by [[Jodi Benson]] and was designed by [[Glen Keane]]. [[Auli'i Cravalho]] plays her in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]''. Ariel is the seventh-born and the youngest daughter of King Triton and the late Queen Athena of the merfolk, and over the course of the original film becomes human and marries Eric, a human prince. She is the only Disney Princess to reach parenthood in Disney's animated film canon.

Prince Eric is the only prince in the \"Disney Princess\" franchise not to sing in an original movie.\n\nEric is a human prince rescued by Ariel when he almost drowns in a storm at sea. She drags him to shore and sings to him, leaving Eric haunted by her voice. He searches the kingdom for her to no avail. When he crosses paths with Ariel again, he is unable to identify her, as she has given her voice to Ursula in exchange for legs. However, he brings her back to his palace and they spend time together. Eric develops feelings for Ariel, but before he can approach her about them, Ursula, disguised as a human girl named Vanessa, hypnotizes Eric, forcing him to forget about Ariel and believe that Vanessa is the one who saved his life. He nearly marries Vanessa, but Ariel and her friends intervene, breaking Ursula's spell and restoring Ariel's voice to her. Eric realizes that Ariel is the girl he has been looking for, but before they can kiss, the sun sets and Ursula claims Ariel. Eric dives into the sea to help Ariel, and in the battle that follows, climbs onto a ship and plows it into Ursula impaling her on the prow.\n\nEric makes cameo appearances in three episodes of the prequel television series: ''Thingamajigger'' (a non-speaking appearance) ''Scuttle'' and ''Ariel's Treasures''.\n\nIn the 2000 [[direct-to-video]] sequel, Eric is a supporting character. Although he and Ariel are happily married and they become king and queen of his land, they are attacked by Ursula's sister [[#Morgana|Morgana]], who wishes to avenge Ursula. He and Ariel raise their new daughter [[#Melody|Melody]] away from the sea, keeping her mermaid heritage secret.\n\nIn the 2007 Broadway musical, the role of Eric was originated by [[Sean Palmer]]. It is explained through dialogue that Eric's father has died, and it is Grimsby's duty to help Eric find a bride so he can return to the throne properly, despite Eric's affinity for exploring the seas. Eric contributes singing vocals to the opening song \"Fathoms Below\", and performs two solo songs: \"Her Voice\", a song about Eric's obsession with Ariel's voice that had been written for the original film but discarded, and \"One Step Closer\", a new song where Eric helps Ariel express herself through dance. Eric also provides vocals in the quartet \"If Only\", where he expresses confusion over his attraction to Ariel, and his fear that if he finds the girl with the right voice, he might lose Ariel. A new subplot in the stage musical is a singing competition where the eligible princesses in all the land are invited to sing for Eric. The princesses perform in the song \"The Contest\", which is set to the tune of Ariel's song \"[[Part of Your World]]\". At the end of the performance, Ariel dances for Eric, and he chooses her. The role was also performed by [[Drew Seeley]].\n\nPrince Eric appears in [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|season three]] of the ABC series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon A Time]]'', where he is played by actor [[Gil McKinney]]. He first appears in the episode \"[[Ariel (Once Upon a Time)|Ariel]]\" in which he was rescued by Ariel from drowning, and Ariel has used her once-in-a-year ability to gain legs to see him at his ball. Eric is enchanted by Ariel at the ball, commenting that she appears familiar to him. Eric invites Ariel to join him on an expedition around the world which is leaving the following morning. He waits for her as long as he is able, but she doesn't come to him due to events beyond her control. It is later revealed that Eric was transported to the town of Storybrooke after [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Primary characters|The Evil Queen/Regina Mills]] cast a curse over his land. Ariel, who now has the ability to become human whenever she wants, later finds Eric working as a fisherman in Storybrooke and the two of them reunite.\n\nEric appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]]. In [[Rob Marshall]]'s upcoming live-action film adaptation, [[Jonah Hauer-King]] will portray Eric.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2019/11/little-mermaid-jonah-hauer-king-wins-roles-of-prince-eric-1202784503/|title=\u2018Little Mermaid\u2019: Jonah Hauer-King Wins Role Of Prince Eric|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony D'Alessandro|date=November 12, 2019|work=Deadline Hollywood|language=en|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sebastian===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Sebastian \n| series      =\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n| creator     = [[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (story)\n| voice = [[Samuel E.

Early on in the writing and development of the film, the character was originally an English-butler lobster named Clarence; songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] proposed changing Clarence to a Jamaican [[Rastafari]] crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\">(2006) Audio Commentary by John Musker, Ron Clements, and Alan Menken Bonus material from ''The Little Mermaid: Platinum Edition'' [DVD].

The second, released in October 1991 is ''[[Sebastian: Party Gras!]]'' This album consists of reggae covers of classic songs such as \"[[Iko Iko]]\", \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\", \"[[Twist and Shout]]\", and \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\", as well as a few original tunes.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316128,00.html Entertainment Weekly article about Sebastian's second album]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', Sebastian makes a brief cameo. When the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] looks for \"Royal Recipes\" to transform Aladdin into a prince, he glimpses at a recipe for \"[[Alaskan king crab]].\" Sebastian comes out of the book, pinches the Genie's finger, and a few seconds of \"Under the Sea\" is played.\n\nSebastian made an appearance in three titles of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of video games, voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in the English version and [[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] in the Japanese version. He also appears in the ''Little Mermaid'' Broadway musical, where he was originally played by [[Tituss Burgess]], and has also been performed by Alan Mingo Jr. and Rodgelio Douglas Jr.\n\nSebastian appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]].\n\nSebastian is slated to appear in the live-action remake of ''The Little Mermaid''.

Flounder scares easily, and is prone to panicking under stressful situations like a single [[shark]] breaching the sunken ship, but when Ariel is in trouble, he comes through for her without hesitation. In the film he is the only character to support Ariel's fascination with human things, and at one point gives Ariel a statue of Eric as a gift.\n\nFlounder appears in all the episodes of the prequel television series, sharing constant adventures with Ariel and in the episode \"The Evil Manta\", shown how he first met Ariel when they were children. According to the television series, Flounder's real name is \"Guppy Number 35\". In the series, he is voiced by [[Edan Gross]] and [[Bradley Pierce]].\n\nFlounder also appears in [[Jim Henson]]'s ''Little Mermaid's Island'' where he has a twin sister named Sandy and is voiced by [[Veronica Taylor]].\n\nFlounder has a small role in ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'', where he is reunited with a grown-up Ariel and takes part in the search for Ariel and Eric's daughter [[Characters of Disney's The Little Mermaid#Melody|Melody]]. He grew up and became a father himself, with five children of his own and he first meets Melody in Morgana's lair. In this film, he is voiced by [[Cam Clarke]].\n\nHe has a larger role in ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', which shows an alternate version of how he first meets Ariel and later unknowingly leads her to the Catfish Club. He [[beatbox]]es and initiates a reprise of \"[[Jump In The Line (Shake, Senora)]]\" when he, Ariel, Sebastian and the Catfish Club Band are on the run from Atlantica. In this film, he is voiced by [[Parker Goris]].\n\nFlounder appears in the [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]], where his role as Ariel's friend remains. His biggest role in the series is in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', where Ursula kidnapped him to force Ariel to give her the trident. He also sings his part in the song called \"A New Day is Dawning\". He also appears in ''[[Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey]]'' as Ariel's sidekick and is voiced by Anthony Skillman. He is also a remote-controlled playable character in the same game seen holding a big [[conch shell]] on his head with your help to catch the voice orbs.\n\nAt the Disney theme parks, Flounder makes cameo appearances in the [[Mickey's Philharmagic]] 3D show and in the [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] version of \"[[It's a Small World]]\". He has also appeared in the parks as a walk-around character, but mostly in parades, shows and special events such as \"[[Disney Princesses#Mickey's Pirate and Princess Party|Mickey's Pirate & Princess Party]]\".\n\nFlounder appears in the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|stage adaptation]] of ''The Little Mermaid''. His supporting role is similar as in the film, but he does not give Ariel the statue of Eric, and does not help Ariel reach Eric's wedding barge, as the Vanessa subplot has been removed. However, Flounder performs a new song titled \"She's in Love\", which he sings with Ariel's sisters when they notice that Ariel has been acting \"fishy lately\". The stage role was originated by Cody Hanford and J.J. Singleton, but the two actors had to leave the show when their height overshot that of Sierra Boggess, who originated Ariel. The role was taken over by Trevor Braun and Brian D'Addario. On the [[Disney's The Little Mermaid (2008 album)|Original Broadway Cast Recording]], Brian D'Addario performs as Flounder.\n\nFlounder also appears as a puppet in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]''.\n\nChild actor [[Jacob Tremblay]] will voice Flounder in the upcoming live-action remake of the film.\n\n===Scuttle===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Scuttle\n| image       =\n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n| creator     = Ron Clements and John Musker\n| voice       = [[Buddy Hackett]] (film, sequel & ''The Little Mermaid: Songs from the Sea'')<br>[[Maurice LaMarche]] (all other appearances except ride)<br>[[Chris Edgerly]] ([[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure]])\n}}\nScuttle (scully) is a [[seagull]] and friend of Ariel, voiced by [[Buddy Hackett]] in the 1989 film and 2000 sequel. He presents himself as an expert on human objects, with whom Ariel consults about items she salvages. He refers to a [[fork]] as a \"dinglehopper,\" and a [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]] as a \"snarfblatt.\" He also provides support and advice when he learns that Ariel has to win Eric's heart in three days. On the third day, Scuttle discovers that Vanessa is actually Ursula, and immediately tells Ariel.\n\nScuttle appears in a small role in ''The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea'', in which he helps Ariel find her daughter Melody, who has run away.\n\nScuttle appears in two episodes of the third season of the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|prequel television series]] in which he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. The episodes he appears in are \"Scuttle\", where Ariel, Flounder and Sebastian meet him for the first time (in which he claims his name was originally \"Scuttlebutt\" but he changed it \"for obvious reasons\"), and \"Island of Fear\". In these episodes, Scuttle's explanation of human things is a mixture of correct and erroneous. Scuttle also made a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Quack Pack]]''.\n\nIn ''[[The Little Mermaid: Songs from the Sea]]'', Scuttle performs a song called \"The Scuttle Strut\" on track 3.\n\nScuttle appears in the stage adaptation of the original film, where he sings two songs: \"Human Stuff\" and \"Positivity.\" The role is originated by [[Eddie Korbich]]. In the stage musical, Scuttle has a group of seagull friends, and together they perform a tap dance during the \"Positoovity\" number.\n\nScuttle has a non-speaking cameo in ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', appearing when Marina is on a rock at the surface (animated the same way with Ariel when she sings a reprise for \"[[Part of Your World]]\") and is splashed by a wave.\n\nA female version of Scuttle is set to appear in the [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)#Live-action remake|upcoming live-action adaptation of ''The Little Mermaid'']].<ref name=\"Awkwafina\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-little-mermaid-eyes-jacob-tremblay-awkwafina-1221947|title=Jacob Tremblay, Awkwafina in Talks for Disney's Live-Action 'Little Mermaid'|last=Kit|first=Borys|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 1, 2019|access-date=July 1, 2019}}</ref> This version will be portrayed as a [[diving bird]], in order for the character to be featured in underwater scenes.<ref name=\"Remake\">{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2019/04/15/brand-new-production-details-for-disneys-live-action-the-little-mermaid-revealed/|title=Brand New Production Details For Disney\u2019s Live-Action \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019 Revealed\n|last=Shuler|first=Skyler|website=The DisInsider|date=April 15, 2019|access-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref> [[Awkwafina]] is in negotiations to voice the character in the film.<ref name=\"Awkwafina\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Ursula===\n{{Main|Ursula (The Little Mermaid)}}\nUrsula appears in the 1989 film. She is voiced by [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], who also provides her vocals for all the canonical animated media. [[Queen Latifah]] plays her in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]''. Ursula is based on the \"sea witch/sorceress\" character in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s story \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\".\n\n{{anchor|Triton}}\n\n===King Triton===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Triton\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' (2000)<br>''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n| creator = [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (original story)<br>[[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (adaptation)\n| voice = [[Kenneth Mars]] ([[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|1989 film]], [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|TV series]], [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea|sequel]], [[Kingdom Hearts|Kingdom Hearts series]])<br>[[Jim Cummings]] ([[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning|prequel film]])\n| alias = King Triton<br>Sea King<br>Red\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nTriton is the king of Atlantica and the father of Ariel and her sisters. The sea king is unnamed in the Hans Christian Andersen version. In the first two films, the TV series and the ''Kingdom Hearts'' games, he was voiced by [[Kenneth Mars]]; in the prequel film, he is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. Triton wields a powerful trident; the source of his apparently unlimited power. The character is inspired by the son of the Greek sea god [[Poseidon]], although the actual [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] is from Greek mythology and has two finned feet.\n\nIn ''The Little Mermaid'', Triton shows severe distaste for humans, and Ariel's fascination with them strains their relationship. Because of this, Triton orders his servant, [[Sebastian (Disney)|Sebastian]], to look after Ariel. When Triton discovers that Ariel has fallen in love with a human, he destroys her grotto and collection of human artifacts. Triton subsequently orders a search for Ariel to apologize, not knowing that she has accepted Ursula's deal and become a human. When Sebastian arrives with news of Ursula's scheme, he offers to take his daughter's place. Ursula transforms into a [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]], but is restored to his original form when Eric kills her.\n\nTriton is a regular character in the prequel television series, in which he is called by the son of [[Poseidon]]. A number of episodes show conflict between him and Ariel.\n\nTriton appears in the sequel, ''The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea'', at the end of which he defeats and traps the film's villain, Morgana, in an ice cube.\n\nIn the 2008 direct-to-DVD prequel ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', Triton bans music from Atlantica after his wife Athena is crushed to death by a pirate ship. He forces everyone and the city to follow a strict daily schedule, straining his relationship with free-spirited Ariel. He eventually lifts the ban on music and appoints Sebastian as his court composer. Jim Cummings replaces Kenneth Mars as the voice of King Triton, due to Mars' pancreatic cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|stage musical]], Triton is Ursula's older brother, and the two are each given equal share of the sea and one magical item each. When Ursula began to abuse her power, Triton exiled her, though he did not take away her Nautilus shell. This stage role is originated by [[Norm Lewis]].\n\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of video games, Triton still plays the role of over-protective father and king of Atlantica. In the first game, his relationship with Ariel becomes strained due to his daughter's desire to see other worlds, and he initially distrusts Sora, [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Goofy]] when they first arrive in Atlantica, having somehow heard of the negative part of the Keyblade legend, but eventually respects Sora when Ursula is defeated and locks the world's keyhole. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Triton's relationship with Ariel is strained, this time thanks to Ariel's fascination with the human world. He asks Sora, Donald and Goofy to take part in the music concert with Ariel, but Sora ignores Triton's request and helps Ariel become human to find and fall in love with Eric. He is also part of the song called \"A New Day is Dawning\". After Ursula is defeated once again, he respectfully bids a final farewell to Sora. He also appears in ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' as a [[Float (parade)|parade float]].\n\nKing Triton is set to appear in the upcoming live-action adaptation of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. [[Javier Bardem]] is currently in negotiations to play the character.\n\n===Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista and Andrina===\n{{Infobox character\n|colour = #59E\n|name =  Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista and Andrina\n|image =\n|caption = \n|first = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n|last = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n|creator = [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (original story)<br>[[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (adaptation)\n|voice = '''Attina:'''<br>[[Caroline Vasicek]] (first film)<br>[[Kath Soucie]] (TV episodes)<br>Christie Houser (Kingdom Hearts II)<br>[[Kari Wahlgren]] (prequel film)<br>'''Alana:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (TV episodes and first film)<br>[[Jennifer Hale]] (prequel film)<br>'''Adella:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (first film)<br>[[Sherry Lynn]] (TV episodes)<br>[[Tara Strong]] (prequel film)<br>'''Aquata:'''<br>[[Caroline Vasicek]] (first film)<br>[[Mona Marshall]] (TV episodes)<br>[[Grey DeLisle]] (prequel film)<br>'''Arista:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (first film)<br>[[Mary Kay Bergman]] (TV episodes)<br>[[Grey DeLisle]] (prequel film)<br>'''Andrina:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (first film)<br>[[Cathy Cavadini|Catherine Cavadini]] (TV episodes)<br>Susan Stevens Logan (Kingdom Hearts II)<br>[[Tara Strong]] (prequel film)\n|alias = Mersisters\n|noinfo = yes\n}}\nAriel has six older sisters named Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista and Andrina. In the 1989 film, they are voiced by [[Kimmy Robertson]] and [[Caroline Vasicek]], and perform the song \"Daughters of Triton\". Later on in the film, Attina, Andrina, Adella and Aquata make a brief appearance together with Ariel, in what appears to be the palace dressing room. In this scene, Ariel emerges from behind a curtain of seaweed swimming dreamily and hums a few lines from \"Part of Your World\". The sisters notice a change in Ariel's mood and conclude that Ariel is in love. All six sisters appear again in the end of the film together with Triton, smiling and waving to Ariel after she gets married to Eric.\n\nIn the second film, the sisters play a minor role with only Attina, Andrina, Aquata and Adella having dialogue.\n\n===Glut===\nGlut is a ferocious [[great white shark]] and a minor antagonist of the film. He first appears where Ariel and Flounder are exploring the Sunken Ship are collecting human artifacts and pursues them trying to kill them, but somehow gets his head stuck in an anchor and was not seen again for the entire film afterwards. He makes minor appearances in the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|television series]] and also appears as a boss in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' where Sora and company at first can escape fighting him, but he must be defeated later to enter Ursula's lair.\n\n===Flotsam and Jetsam===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Flotsam and Jetsam\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| creator = [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (original story)<br>[[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (film adaptation)\n| voice = [[Paddi Edwards]] (original)<br>[[Corey Burton]] (''Kingdom Hearts'' series and Disney parks)\n}}\nFlotsam and Jetsam are Ursula's [[green moray|green moray eel]] minions, voiced by [[Paddi Edwards]] in the 1989 film. They do Ursula's bidding and act as her spies, keeping their eye on the events unfolding in and around Atlantica. They are tasked with following Ariel and reporting her actions back to Ursula. They eventually manipulate Ariel into visiting Ursula to attain human legs. They are ultimately killed by Ursula inadvertently in the film's climax, and Ursula subsequently mourns for them.\n\nFlotsam and Jetsam appear in the prequel television series alongside Ursula. They also appear in the Broadway stage musical, where the roles were originated by [[Tyler Maynard]] and [[Derrick Baskin]]. The eels also appear as puppets in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]''.\n\n===Grimsby===\n{{Infobox character\n|colour      = #59E\n|name        = Grimsby\n|image       =\n|caption     = Grimsby, as seen in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''\n|first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n|last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' (2000)\n|creator = \n|portrayer   = \n|voice = [[Ben Wright (actor)|Ben Wright]] ([[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|1989 film]])<br>[[Brian Cummings]] ([[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|TV series]])<br>[[Kay E. Kuter]] (''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'')\n|nationality = \n|alias = Grim\n}}\nGrimsby is Eric's [[majordomo]] and [[confidant]]. He is voiced by [[Ben Wright (actor)|Ben Wright]] in the original film. In the opening scene, Grimsby is shown as not having the stomach for the sea, and dismisses the sailors' stories about merpeople living under the sea. Through dialogue, Grimsby reveals that he worries for Eric, and has been hoping that the prince will settle down with the right girl. For Eric's birthday, Grimsby presents a statue he had commissioned of Eric in a dramatic pose. Though Eric and Max disapprove of the statue, Grimsby is proud of it. Later, when Ariel has become human, Grimsby grows fond of her and encourages Eric to give up his dream girl for one \"of flesh and blood\".\n\nGrimsby appears briefly in the sequel, in which he is voiced by [[Kay E. Kuter]].\n\nIn the 2007 stage musical adaptation, Grimsby says that the reason he wants Eric to marry is because he (Grimsby) had made a promise to Eric's late father to ensure it. Though Grimsby is reluctant to believe Eric's story of being saved from drowning by a girl, he comes up with the idea of holding a contest in which the princesses of the land are to sing for Eric, in the hopes that one of them will be the right girl. In the stage musical, the role is originated by [[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]].\n\nGrimsby also appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by Dominique Kelley.\n\n===Max===\nMax is an [[Old English Sheepdog]] and Eric's pet. Unlike all the other animals in the film, Max is minimally [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and does not speak in the human language. Max's barking and growling is provided by [[Frank Welker]] throughout his animated incarnations.\n\nDuring Eric's birthday celebration, Max catches Ariel's scent and tracks her down, licking her on the cheek in an apparent show of affection. When the ship catches fire, the sailors escape safely, but Max is left behind. Seeing this, Eric dives out of his lifeboat and climbs back on board, grabbing Max and tossing him to safety. Later, when Eric is brought to shore safely by Ariel, Max smells out his master and rushes out to greet him. Max is also able to smell Ariel who is hidden off-shore behind rocks, but Eric does not understand his barking. After Ariel has made her deal with Ursula and is brought to shore as a human, Max leads Eric to her, recognizing her as the same person, though Eric cannot. Eventually, Ursula herself appears in the guise of a human girl named Vanessa to distract Eric from kissing Ariel before the third day is up, but Max is the only character in the human world who can fully see Vanessa for who she really is and is seen growling furiously at her, and during her and Eric's wedding, she kicks him directly in the face. When Scuttle and the sea animals try to stop the wedding, Max assists.\n\nMax makes a few brief appearances in the prequel television series and the direct-to-video sequel, and is the only named character of the original film (other than Vanessa) who does not appear in the 2007 stage musical. Max does however appear in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by Bagel the sheepdog.\n\n===Chef Louis===\nLouis is the chef in Eric's castle, voiced by [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois (actor)|Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]. His accent implies that he is French, and he performs the song \"Les Poissons\" in which he happily cooks seafood in the castle kitchen. According to dialogue by Carlotta the house maid, Louis' specialty is stuffed crab. This puts him at odds with Sebastian, who accidentally ends up in his kitchen and frantically tries to get away from him. This rivalry is extended to the wedding in the finale, where the chef again chases Sebastian in an attempt to cut him up.  The rivalry is shown again in the sequel ''The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea'', with no change between the two.\n\nHe also stars in one of the episodes of ''Disney's Marsupilami'' and ''Raw Toonage'' as a noise hating hotel guest with his victim, Sebastian as the hotel manager. Louis also makes an appearance in the episode \"Ariel's Treasures\" where he accidentally steps on a [[whisk]] called a \"whirly twirly\" by Ariel and it slips into the water when he is making recipes.\n\nIn the 2007 stage musical, Louis is head of a group of chefs that work in Eric's castle. He performs the song \"Les Poissons\" from the original movie. A reprise is performed by Louis and all the other chefs as they present their fish masterpieces to Ariel, Eric and Grimsby.\n\nChef Louis appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by [[John Stamos]].\n{{-}}\n\n===Carlotta===\nCarlotta works in Eric's castle in a role suggested to be similar to a housekeeper, though it is not stated outright. She reappears in the sequel, apparently continuing her role after Eric and Ariel are married and have a daughter of their own. She is voiced by [[Edie McClurg]].\n\nIn the 2007 stage musical, Carlotta develops an affectionate maternal relationship with Ariel. Carlotta sings in the musical number \"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\", where she berates the other servants who gossip about Ariel. Near the end of the musical there is a contest where the princesses of the land are to sing for Eric, in the hope that one of them will have the voice of the girl who saved his life.\n\n==Television series==\n===Urchin===\nUrchin is an orphaned merboy with an olive-green tail and is one of the main characters of the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|prequel television series]], in which he is a close friend of Ariel, Sebastian and Flounder, and often goes on adventures with them. He is voiced by [[Danny Cooksey]].\n\nUrchin first appears in the fourth episode of the series, \"Urchin\". In it, Urchin is seen to be an orphan who lives by himself and wants badly to have friends. He is approached by small-time villains [[American lobster|Lobster]] Mobster and Da [[Shrimp]], who bring him into their gang and use him to steal food for them. Urchin manages to steal food from the palace, but in doing so is confronted by Ariel. Ariel tries to befriend Urchin, who at first rebuffs her. Urchin shows his true colors when he helps Ariel escape after she is kidnapped by Lobster Mobster and Da Shrimp. He even stops Crab Louie from stealing from the royal treasury. This earns him a kiss from Ariel. A friendship is forged when Urchin follows Ariel's advice and apologises to King Triton for his behavior. In the episode \"Trident True\", Urchin plays pranks on Ariel's sisters Arista, Attina, Andrina and Adella and buys a Father's Day present for King Triton, implying his closeness with the royal family, and Ariel's sisters admit that they look on him as their own little brother.\n\n===Gabriella===\nGabriella is one of Ariel's friends. She is a [[deaf]] mermaid with a pink tail and matching shells who communicates with [[sign language]]. She appears in two episodes: \"Wish Upon A Starfish\" and \"Ariel's Treasures\".\n\nIn her first appearance, before she meets Ariel, she sees her singing the first part of a song called \"Daring To Dance\" and sees her twirling about a [[music box]] with a figure of a [[Ballet dancer|ballerina]] on top of it. Ariel stops abruptly upon seeing her, but Gabriella encourages her to continue. She wishes to be able to sing as beautifully as Ariel, and she identifies with Ariel's desire to dance. She decides to journey with Ariel to visit the Magical Wishing Starfish, passing through many dangers along the way. She is saddened when the Magical Wishing Starfish proves to be a fraud, but Ariel reassures her that she can express her feelings just as well through sign language. She joins Ariel in the second part of \"Daring to Dance\". In her second appearance, she returns to Atlantica for a visit. She and Ariel gush over Ariel's new additions to her collection of human objects, as well as the music box that Ariel found when they first met. Unbeknownst to either of them, Ursula has launched another scheme to take over Atlantica, this time casting a spell that causes Ariel's treasures to come to life and terrorize people. She is confused and shocked when the treasures come alive, but she works with Ariel to break Ursula's spell.\n\n===Ollie===\nOllie is a [[blue]] vocal [[octopus]] who appears in two episodes: \"Wish Upon A Starfish\" and \"Ariel's Treasures\". He is the close friend and interpreter of Gabriella, a mute mermaid. He has spots on the sides of his head and a patch on his left eye. In his first appearance, he is shown with Gabriella, watching Ariel sing. After Ariel notices them, he explains Gabriella's disability and introduces himself. He is also the one to tell the tale of the Magical Wishing Starfish, and he accompanies them along the way. In his second appearance, he is visiting Atlantica with Gabriella and helps her stop Ursula's plot to take over the kingdom. He is voiced by [[Gabriel Damon]].\n\n===Pearl===\nPearl is a fun-loving mermaid with a blue tail and matching shells who is familiar with Ariel and Alana. She is blonde, with a blue tail and blue, ruffle-edged shells. She makes her first appearance in episode \"Red\" at a party held by Ariel, arriving with a crowd of friends on \"squid-cycles\". She is apparently very popular and seems friendly, if a bit snobbish. She comments that the party is a bit dull, and Ariel requests that the live band play louder, against her father's instructions. She leaves with the other guests when Triton puts a halt to the party.\n\nIn her second appearance in episode \"Eel-ectric City\", she shows up at the palace to pick up Alana, who has been invited to a party at her house. Ariel is shocked and impressed when Pearl comments that her parents allow her to do as she pleases, and is invited to join them. As they are leaving, Pearl spies Triton's new chariot and coerces Ariel into driving the three mermaids in it while she gives directions. After a few minutes, Alana notes that they are not heading for Pearl's house; they are instead going to Eel-ectric City, a party town reminiscent of Las Vegas, where Pearl is going to meet a few friends. They arrive and are having a fairly good time until a gang known as the \"Orange Roughies\" shows up. Pearl taunts them, then challenges them to a chariot race. Ariel and Alana try to reason with Pearl, but she wants to see the race through to the end. They start the race, but quickly lose control of the chariot in the rush of the current. It is only Ariel's quick thinking and the timely appearance of Triton that saves them. Pearl is shocked that her parents bothered coming, but happy that they cared about her. Her mother states that she will be keeping a closer eye on her daughter from now on.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Cree Summer]].\n\n===Spot===\nSpot is a fun loving [[killer whale]] calf whose name is based on a single [[white]] spot which is [[birthmark]]ed on his tail. In the episode called \"Whale Of A Tale\", when the human poachers get nearby, he frightenedly swims away from his real family until Ariel encounters him with a little love. She cares for him until she lets him go to be with his real family. He returns in \"Save The Whale\" as a grown-up whale and, as Sebastian announces him, he excitedly begins to perform for the citizens of Atlantica until he gets caught.\n\n===Simon===\nSimon is a sea dragon.\n\nImprisoned in cave and looking to be rescued. Simon writes a message and puts it in a bottle and with some luck, Ariel, Sebastian, and Flounder find the letter, brave danger en route to the cave, and then they face a giant sea dragon. The dragon turns out to be Simon himself, the writer of the message, who's looking to have a party with some new friends. Bringing Simon home to King Triton poses another challenge until Simon helps King Triton to save Atlantica and its merpeople from an invasion of evil sea anemones.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Brian Cummings]].\n\n===Dudley===\nDudley is an elderly sea turtle who also serves somewhat of an assistant to King Triton besides Sebastian. Dudley mumbles when he speaks and does not swim like other sea turtles in this show, instead he walks slowly along the sea floor like a land turtle and keeps important documents within his shell when he retracts his head. His conversation is always interrupted by his employer as he understands what the former is about to say.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Dave Coulier]].\n\n===Archimedes===\nArchimedes is a merman scholar, explorer and adventurer who is fascinated with humans, particularly human objects, like Ariel, he wants to know as much about the human world as possible, because of his fascination with humans, he is ostracized and disliked by his own people, as his only friend is Ariel. Because Archimedes goes to the surface very often, his knowledge on human culture is far more accurate than Ariel's; prior to the latter becoming human herself and her marriage to Eric.\n\nDue to Archimedes being ostracized by the merpeople, he lives in an abandoned sunken ship, in the wilderness outside of [[Atlantica]], is also where he keeps his collection of human objects, initially, unlike Ariel, he has directly met humans, he has even interacted with them.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Rod McKuen]].\n\n===Hans Christian Andersen===\nA character based on [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the author of the original [[The Little Mermaid|''Little Mermaid'' fairy tale]] appears in the episode \"Metal Fish\". He is voiced by [[Mark Hamill]].\n\nBased on rumors he hears from other sailors about the existence of merfolk, he attempts verify these claims by exploring the undersea world with the invention of his primitive submarine. While exploring the undersea world, his sub springs a leak and his steering controls are affected causing his sub to lose control and eventually sink to the bottom. However, to his surprise he encounters Ariel, to which his claims are verified. Later on, Archimedes, Sebastian, Flounder, The Crabscouts, and even King Triton appear to assist Andersen's damaged vessel back to the surface. At the end of this episode, the character is inspired by the encounter to \"write\" the story of ''The Little Mermaid''. This encounter contradicts the idea that Ariel's first face to face contact with humans is with Prince Eric, and forces Ariel to confront her father with the fact that she, Triton, and all merfolk are half human when she appeals to Triton for help in saving Andersen's life.\n\n===Lobster Mobster and Da Shrimp===\nLobster Mobster and Da Shrimp are a lobster and shrimp duo who are bumbling con-artists and constantly antagonize Ariel and her friends and are recurring antagonists from the television series. They are modeled after the stereotypes of the gangsters from the 1920s. Lobster Mobster is voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]] and Da Shrimp is voiced by [[David Lander]].\n\n===Manta===\nManta is a recurring villain in the TV series. Although his exact age is unknown, he appears to be potentially ageless as an individual is referenced in a legend as nearly destroying Atlantica who was imprisoned in an undersea volcano many years before the time of the series. The character is freed from an undersea volcano by a well-meaning Ariel. He then became a recurring character, intent on taking control of Atlantica for himself. He later has a son, \"Little Evil\" who becomes a friend of Ariel's, resulting in his father's redemption.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Tim Curry]].\n\n===Howling Hairfish===\nHowling Hairfish are monstrous fish, analogous to a [[werewolf]]. Flounder is the only Howling Hairfish that speaks.\n\n==''The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea''==\n===Melody===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Melody\n| first              = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''\n| creator            = Elizabeth Anderson & Temple Mathews (screenplay)\n| voice              = [[Tara Strong]]\n| data1              = \n| alias              = \n| noinfo             = yes\n| family             = \n}}\nMelody is the daughter of Eric and Ariel, the niece of Ariel's sisters and the granddaughter of King Triton and Queen Athena.\n\nThe film opens to the celebration of her birth; her parents sail out to sea to present Melody to King Triton and the merfolk. As Triton gives her the locket, the celebration is interrupted by Morgana, who threatens to hurt Melody if Triton does not hand over the trident. Eric and Ariel manage to save Melody, but Morgana escapes. Ariel vows to keep all knowledge of the sea from Melody until Morgana is found.\n\nBy her 12th birthday, Melody has been regularly sneaking out of the palace to swim. She finds a locket with her name on it (intended by as a gift for her when she was born), and questions Ariel about it. Ariel and Melody argue, and before Ariel can apologize and explain, Melody runs away from the castle in a boat. Melody is discovered by Undertow and convinced to meet Morgana, who uses Melody's love of the sea against her. Morgana transforms Melody into a mermaid, promising that the transformation will last forever if she retrieves the trident from Triton.\n\nMelody succeeds in stealing the trident and gives it to Morgana, who subsequently traps her in a cave. Soon afterward, Morgana's spell on Melody wears off, causing her to revert into a human and nearly drown. Melody sneaks up behind Morgana and stabs her with the trident, before giving it to Triton, who encases Morgana in ice.\n\nIn the wake of their victory, Triton offers Melody the option of becoming a mermaid permanently but Melody declines.\n\nMelody performs one song in the film, \"For a Moment\", in which Ariel, voiced by Jodi Benson, also provides vocals.\n\nShe is also a playable character in the PlayStation game, ''The Little Mermaid 2'', based on the two movies.\n\nShe is voiced by Tara Strong.\n\n===Morgana===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Morgana\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''\n| creator = Elizabeth Anderson & Temple Mathews (screenplay)\n| voice = [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]\n| alias =\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nMorgana is the younger sister of [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]].

Tip and Dash join Melody on her journey to retrieve the trident for Morgana.

Her speaking voice is provided by Lorelei Hill Butters, and her singing voice is provided by [[Andrea Robinson (singer)|Andrea Robinson]]. She appears in the opening prologue of the prequel, in which she is at first shown singing her and Triton's special song (Athena's song) to the girls before bedtime. She is then seen relaxing in a cove on the ocean surface with her husband, children and other merfolk. Triton gives her a music box that plays their song as an anniversary present. The fun ceases when a pirate ship appears and attacks the merpeople, during which Athena is crushed to death by the ship, whilst trying to save the music box. Triton responds to this tragedy by banning music from Atlantica. Prior to this film, Ariel's mother had been mentioned before in the prequel television series, but had then remained nameless. It is never actually stated, but it is quite likely that it was Athena's death, at the hands of humans, that caused Triton's prejudice towards them.\n\nThe character will reportedly appear in the [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)#Live-action adaptation|upcoming live-action adaptation]] of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', with the film also focusing on Ariel and her mother's relationship.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476693/disneys-live-action-little-mermaid-has-found-its-king-triton</ref>\n\n===Marina Del Rey===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Marina Del Rey\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]''\n| creator = \n| voice = [[Sally Field]] as Marina Del Rey\n| alias =\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nMarina Del Rey, voiced by [[Sally Field]], is a mermaid and the [[governess]] of King Triton's seven daughters, in charge of enforcing Triton's distant and formal parenting style and is the main antagonist.

She temporarily succeeds after getting Sebastian, Flounder, and their secret music band sent to prison (as music was forbidden from Atlantica at the time) but upon learning of the gang's escape with Ariel, Marina resolves to kill them all by sending her electric eels after them.

Prince Eric is the only prince in the \"Disney Princess\" franchise not to sing in an original movie.\n\nEric is a human prince rescued by Ariel when he almost drowns in a storm at sea. She drags him to shore and sings to him, leaving Eric haunted by her voice. He searches the kingdom for her to no avail. When he crosses paths with Ariel again, he is unable to identify her, as she has given her voice to Ursula in exchange for legs. However, he brings her back to his palace and they spend time together. Eric develops feelings for Ariel, but before he can approach her about them, Ursula, disguised as a human girl named Vanessa, hypnotizes Eric, forcing him to forget about Ariel and believe that Vanessa is the one who saved his life. He nearly marries Vanessa, but Ariel and her friends intervene, breaking Ursula's spell and restoring Ariel's voice to her. Eric realizes that Ariel is the girl he has been looking for, but before they can kiss, the sun sets and Ursula claims Ariel. Eric dives into the sea to help Ariel, and in the battle that follows, climbs onto a ship and plows it into Ursula impaling her on the prow.\n\nEric makes cameo appearances in three episodes of the prequel television series: ''Thingamajigger'' (a non-speaking appearance) ''Scuttle'' and ''Ariel's Treasures''.\n\nIn the 2000 [[direct-to-video]] sequel, Eric is a supporting character. Although he and Ariel are happily married and they become king and queen of his land, they are attacked by Ursula's sister [[#Morgana|Morgana]], who wishes to avenge Ursula. He and Ariel raise their new daughter [[#Melody|Melody]] away from the sea, keeping her mermaid heritage secret.\n\nIn the 2007 Broadway musical, the role of Eric was originated by [[Sean Palmer]]. It is explained through dialogue that Eric's father has died, and it is Grimsby's duty to help Eric find a bride so he can return to the throne properly, despite Eric's affinity for exploring the seas. Eric contributes singing vocals to the opening song \"Fathoms Below\", and performs two solo songs: \"Her Voice\", a song about Eric's obsession with Ariel's voice that had been written for the original film but discarded, and \"One Step Closer\", a new song where Eric helps Ariel express herself through dance. Eric also provides vocals in the quartet \"If Only\", where he expresses confusion over his attraction to Ariel, and his fear that if he finds the girl with the right voice, he might lose Ariel. A new subplot in the stage musical is a singing competition where the eligible princesses in all the land are invited to sing for Eric. The princesses perform in the song \"The Contest\", which is set to the tune of Ariel's song \"[[Part of Your World]]\". At the end of the performance, Ariel dances for Eric, and he chooses her. The role was also performed by [[Drew Seeley]].\n\nPrince Eric appears in [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|season three]] of the ABC series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon A Time]]'', where he is played by actor [[Gil McKinney]]. He first appears in the episode \"[[Ariel (Once Upon a Time)|Ariel]]\" in which he was rescued by Ariel from drowning, and Ariel has used her once-in-a-year ability to gain legs to see him at his ball. Eric is enchanted by Ariel at the ball, commenting that she appears familiar to him. Eric invites Ariel to join him on an expedition around the world which is leaving the following morning. He waits for her as long as he is able, but she doesn't come to him due to events beyond her control. It is later revealed that Eric was transported to the town of Storybrooke after [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Primary characters|The Evil Queen/Regina Mills]] cast a curse over his land. Ariel, who now has the ability to become human whenever she wants, later finds Eric working as a fisherman in Storybrooke and the two of them reunite.\n\nEric appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]]. In [[Rob Marshall]]'s upcoming live-action film adaptation, [[Jonah Hauer-King]] will portray Eric.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2019/11/little-mermaid-jonah-hauer-king-wins-roles-of-prince-eric-1202784503/|title=\u2018Little Mermaid\u2019: Jonah Hauer-King Wins Role Of Prince Eric|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony D'Alessandro|date=November 12, 2019|work=Deadline Hollywood|language=en|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sebastian===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Sebastian \n| series      =\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n| creator     = [[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (story)\n| voice = [[Samuel E.

His main song is \"[[Under the Sea]]\". He is voiced by [[Samuel E. Wright]] in both the films and the TV series.\n\nThe character was developed solely for the Disney film, and is not derived from the original [[Hans Christian Andersen]] story. Early on in the writing and development of the film, the character was originally an English-butler lobster named Clarence; songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] proposed changing Clarence to a Jamaican [[Rastafari]] crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\">(2006) Audio Commentary by John Musker, Ron Clements, and Alan Menken Bonus material from ''The Little Mermaid: Platinum Edition'' [DVD].

The second, released in October 1991 is ''[[Sebastian: Party Gras!]]'' This album consists of reggae covers of classic songs such as \"[[Iko Iko]]\", \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\", \"[[Twist and Shout]]\", and \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\", as well as a few original tunes.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316128,00.html Entertainment Weekly article about Sebastian's second album]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', Sebastian makes a brief cameo. When the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] looks for \"Royal Recipes\" to transform Aladdin into a prince, he glimpses at a recipe for \"[[Alaskan king crab]].\" Sebastian comes out of the book, pinches the Genie's finger, and a few seconds of \"Under the Sea\" is played.\n\nSebastian made an appearance in three titles of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of video games, voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in the English version and [[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] in the Japanese version. He also appears in the ''Little Mermaid'' Broadway musical, where he was originally played by [[Tituss Burgess]], and has also been performed by Alan Mingo Jr. and Rodgelio Douglas Jr.\n\nSebastian appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]].\n\nSebastian is slated to appear in the live-action remake of ''The Little Mermaid''.

Flounder scares easily, and is prone to panicking under stressful situations like a single [[shark]] breaching the sunken ship, but when Ariel is in trouble, he comes through for her without hesitation. In the film he is the only character to support Ariel's fascination with human things, and at one point gives Ariel a statue of Eric as a gift.\n\nFlounder appears in all the episodes of the prequel television series, sharing constant adventures with Ariel and in the episode \"The Evil Manta\", shown how he first met Ariel when they were children. According to the television series, Flounder's real name is \"Guppy Number 35\". In the series, he is voiced by [[Edan Gross]] and [[Bradley Pierce]].\n\nFlounder also appears in [[Jim Henson]]'s ''Little Mermaid's Island'' where he has a twin sister named Sandy and is voiced by [[Veronica Taylor]].\n\nFlounder has a small role in ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'', where he is reunited with a grown-up Ariel and takes part in the search for Ariel and Eric's daughter [[Characters of Disney's The Little Mermaid#Melody|Melody]]. He grew up and became a father himself, with five children of his own and he first meets Melody in Morgana's lair. In this film, he is voiced by [[Cam Clarke]].\n\nHe has a larger role in ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', which shows an alternate version of how he first meets Ariel and later unknowingly leads her to the Catfish Club. He [[beatbox]]es and initiates a reprise of \"[[Jump In The Line (Shake, Senora)]]\" when he, Ariel, Sebastian and the Catfish Club Band are on the run from Atlantica. In this film, he is voiced by [[Parker Goris]].\n\nFlounder appears in the [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' series]], where his role as Ariel's friend remains. His biggest role in the series is in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', where Ursula kidnapped him to force Ariel to give her the trident. He also sings his part in the song called \"A New Day is Dawning\". He also appears in ''[[Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey]]'' as Ariel's sidekick and is voiced by Anthony Skillman. He is also a remote-controlled playable character in the same game seen holding a big [[conch shell]] on his head with your help to catch the voice orbs.\n\nAt the Disney theme parks, Flounder makes cameo appearances in the [[Mickey's Philharmagic]] 3D show and in the [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] version of \"[[It's a Small World]]\". He has also appeared in the parks as a walk-around character, but mostly in parades, shows and special events such as \"[[Disney Princesses#Mickey's Pirate and Princess Party|Mickey's Pirate & Princess Party]]\".\n\nFlounder appears in the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|stage adaptation]] of ''The Little Mermaid''. His supporting role is similar as in the film, but he does not give Ariel the statue of Eric, and does not help Ariel reach Eric's wedding barge, as the Vanessa subplot has been removed. However, Flounder performs a new song titled \"She's in Love\", which he sings with Ariel's sisters when they notice that Ariel has been acting \"fishy lately\". The stage role was originated by Cody Hanford and J.J. Singleton, but the two actors had to leave the show when their height overshot that of Sierra Boggess, who originated Ariel. The role was taken over by Trevor Braun and Brian D'Addario. On the [[Disney's The Little Mermaid (2008 album)|Original Broadway Cast Recording]], Brian D'Addario performs as Flounder.\n\nFlounder also appears as a puppet in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]''.\n\nChild actor [[Jacob Tremblay]] will voice Flounder in the upcoming live-action remake of the film.\n\n===Scuttle===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Scuttle\n| image       =\n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n| creator     = Ron Clements and John Musker\n| voice       = [[Buddy Hackett]] (film, sequel & ''The Little Mermaid: Songs from the Sea'')<br>[[Maurice LaMarche]] (all other appearances except ride)<br>[[Chris Edgerly]] ([[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure]])\n}}\nScuttle (scully) is a [[seagull]] and friend of Ariel, voiced by [[Buddy Hackett]] in the 1989 film and 2000 sequel. He presents himself as an expert on human objects, with whom Ariel consults about items she salvages. He refers to a [[fork]] as a \"dinglehopper,\" and a [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]] as a \"snarfblatt.\" He also provides support and advice when he learns that Ariel has to win Eric's heart in three days. On the third day, Scuttle discovers that Vanessa is actually Ursula, and immediately tells Ariel.\n\nScuttle appears in a small role in ''The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea'', in which he helps Ariel find her daughter Melody, who has run away.\n\nScuttle appears in two episodes of the third season of the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|prequel television series]] in which he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. The episodes he appears in are \"Scuttle\", where Ariel, Flounder and Sebastian meet him for the first time (in which he claims his name was originally \"Scuttlebutt\" but he changed it \"for obvious reasons\"), and \"Island of Fear\". In these episodes, Scuttle's explanation of human things is a mixture of correct and erroneous. Scuttle also made a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Quack Pack]]''.\n\nIn ''[[The Little Mermaid: Songs from the Sea]]'', Scuttle performs a song called \"The Scuttle Strut\" on track 3.\n\nScuttle appears in the stage adaptation of the original film, where he sings two songs: \"Human Stuff\" and \"Positivity.\" The role is originated by [[Eddie Korbich]]. In the stage musical, Scuttle has a group of seagull friends, and together they perform a tap dance during the \"Positoovity\" number.\n\nScuttle has a non-speaking cameo in ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', appearing when Marina is on a rock at the surface (animated the same way with Ariel when she sings a reprise for \"[[Part of Your World]]\") and is splashed by a wave.\n\nA female version of Scuttle is set to appear in the [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)#Live-action remake|upcoming live-action adaptation of ''The Little Mermaid'']].<ref name=\"Awkwafina\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-little-mermaid-eyes-jacob-tremblay-awkwafina-1221947|title=Jacob Tremblay, Awkwafina in Talks for Disney's Live-Action 'Little Mermaid'|last=Kit|first=Borys|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 1, 2019|access-date=July 1, 2019}}</ref> This version will be portrayed as a [[diving bird]], in order for the character to be featured in underwater scenes.<ref name=\"Remake\">{{cite web|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2019/04/15/brand-new-production-details-for-disneys-live-action-the-little-mermaid-revealed/|title=Brand New Production Details For Disney\u2019s Live-Action \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019 Revealed\n|last=Shuler|first=Skyler|website=The DisInsider|date=April 15, 2019|access-date=April 29, 2019}}</ref> [[Awkwafina]] is in negotiations to voice the character in the film.<ref name=\"Awkwafina\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Ursula===\n{{Main|Ursula (The Little Mermaid)}}\nUrsula appears in the 1989 film. She is voiced by [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], who also provides her vocals for all the canonical animated media. [[Queen Latifah]] plays her in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]''. Ursula is based on the \"sea witch/sorceress\" character in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s story \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\".\n\n{{anchor|Triton}}\n\n===King Triton===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Triton\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' (2000)<br>''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n| creator = [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (original story)<br>[[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (adaptation)\n| voice = [[Kenneth Mars]] ([[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|1989 film]], [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|TV series]], [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea|sequel]], [[Kingdom Hearts|Kingdom Hearts series]])<br>[[Jim Cummings]] ([[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning|prequel film]])\n| alias = King Triton<br>Sea King<br>Red\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nTriton is the king of Atlantica and the father of Ariel and her sisters. The sea king is unnamed in the Hans Christian Andersen version. In the first two films, the TV series and the ''Kingdom Hearts'' games, he was voiced by [[Kenneth Mars]]; in the prequel film, he is voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. Triton wields a powerful trident; the source of his apparently unlimited power. The character is inspired by the son of the Greek sea god [[Poseidon]], although the actual [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] is from Greek mythology and has two finned feet.\n\nIn ''The Little Mermaid'', Triton shows severe distaste for humans, and Ariel's fascination with them strains their relationship. Because of this, Triton orders his servant, [[Sebastian (Disney)|Sebastian]], to look after Ariel. When Triton discovers that Ariel has fallen in love with a human, he destroys her grotto and collection of human artifacts. Triton subsequently orders a search for Ariel to apologize, not knowing that she has accepted Ursula's deal and become a human. When Sebastian arrives with news of Ursula's scheme, he offers to take his daughter's place. Ursula transforms into a [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]], but is restored to his original form when Eric kills her.\n\nTriton is a regular character in the prequel television series, in which he is called by the son of [[Poseidon]]. A number of episodes show conflict between him and Ariel.\n\nTriton appears in the sequel, ''The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea'', at the end of which he defeats and traps the film's villain, Morgana, in an ice cube.\n\nIn the 2008 direct-to-DVD prequel ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', Triton bans music from Atlantica after his wife Athena is crushed to death by a pirate ship. He forces everyone and the city to follow a strict daily schedule, straining his relationship with free-spirited Ariel. He eventually lifts the ban on music and appoints Sebastian as his court composer. Jim Cummings replaces Kenneth Mars as the voice of King Triton, due to Mars' pancreatic cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|stage musical]], Triton is Ursula's older brother, and the two are each given equal share of the sea and one magical item each. When Ursula began to abuse her power, Triton exiled her, though he did not take away her Nautilus shell. This stage role is originated by [[Norm Lewis]].\n\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of video games, Triton still plays the role of over-protective father and king of Atlantica. In the first game, his relationship with Ariel becomes strained due to his daughter's desire to see other worlds, and he initially distrusts Sora, [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Goofy]] when they first arrive in Atlantica, having somehow heard of the negative part of the Keyblade legend, but eventually respects Sora when Ursula is defeated and locks the world's keyhole. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Triton's relationship with Ariel is strained, this time thanks to Ariel's fascination with the human world. He asks Sora, Donald and Goofy to take part in the music concert with Ariel, but Sora ignores Triton's request and helps Ariel become human to find and fall in love with Eric. He is also part of the song called \"A New Day is Dawning\". After Ursula is defeated once again, he respectfully bids a final farewell to Sora. He also appears in ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' as a [[Float (parade)|parade float]].\n\nKing Triton is set to appear in the upcoming live-action adaptation of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. [[Javier Bardem]] is currently in negotiations to play the character.\n\n===Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista and Andrina===\n{{Infobox character\n|colour = #59E\n|name =  Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista and Andrina\n|image =\n|caption = \n|first = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n|last = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'' (2008)\n|creator = [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (original story)<br>[[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (adaptation)\n|voice = '''Attina:'''<br>[[Caroline Vasicek]] (first film)<br>[[Kath Soucie]] (TV episodes)<br>Christie Houser (Kingdom Hearts II)<br>[[Kari Wahlgren]] (prequel film)<br>'''Alana:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (TV episodes and first film)<br>[[Jennifer Hale]] (prequel film)<br>'''Adella:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (first film)<br>[[Sherry Lynn]] (TV episodes)<br>[[Tara Strong]] (prequel film)<br>'''Aquata:'''<br>[[Caroline Vasicek]] (first film)<br>[[Mona Marshall]] (TV episodes)<br>[[Grey DeLisle]] (prequel film)<br>'''Arista:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (first film)<br>[[Mary Kay Bergman]] (TV episodes)<br>[[Grey DeLisle]] (prequel film)<br>'''Andrina:'''<br>[[Kimmy Robertson]] (first film)<br>[[Cathy Cavadini|Catherine Cavadini]] (TV episodes)<br>Susan Stevens Logan (Kingdom Hearts II)<br>[[Tara Strong]] (prequel film)\n|alias = Mersisters\n|noinfo = yes\n}}\nAriel has six older sisters named Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista and Andrina. In the 1989 film, they are voiced by [[Kimmy Robertson]] and [[Caroline Vasicek]], and perform the song \"Daughters of Triton\". Later on in the film, Attina, Andrina, Adella and Aquata make a brief appearance together with Ariel, in what appears to be the palace dressing room. In this scene, Ariel emerges from behind a curtain of seaweed swimming dreamily and hums a few lines from \"Part of Your World\". The sisters notice a change in Ariel's mood and conclude that Ariel is in love. All six sisters appear again in the end of the film together with Triton, smiling and waving to Ariel after she gets married to Eric.\n\nIn the second film, the sisters play a minor role with only Attina, Andrina, Aquata and Adella having dialogue.\n\n===Glut===\nGlut is a ferocious [[great white shark]] and a minor antagonist of the film. He first appears where Ariel and Flounder are exploring the Sunken Ship are collecting human artifacts and pursues them trying to kill them, but somehow gets his head stuck in an anchor and was not seen again for the entire film afterwards. He makes minor appearances in the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|television series]] and also appears as a boss in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' where Sora and company at first can escape fighting him, but he must be defeated later to enter Ursula's lair.\n\n===Flotsam and Jetsam===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Flotsam and Jetsam\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n| creator = [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (original story)<br>[[Ron Clements]] & [[John Musker]] (film adaptation)\n| voice = [[Paddi Edwards]] (original)<br>[[Corey Burton]] (''Kingdom Hearts'' series and Disney parks)\n}}\nFlotsam and Jetsam are Ursula's [[green moray|green moray eel]] minions, voiced by [[Paddi Edwards]] in the 1989 film. They do Ursula's bidding and act as her spies, keeping their eye on the events unfolding in and around Atlantica. They are tasked with following Ariel and reporting her actions back to Ursula. They eventually manipulate Ariel into visiting Ursula to attain human legs. They are ultimately killed by Ursula inadvertently in the film's climax, and Ursula subsequently mourns for them.\n\nFlotsam and Jetsam appear in the prequel television series alongside Ursula. They also appear in the Broadway stage musical, where the roles were originated by [[Tyler Maynard]] and [[Derrick Baskin]]. The eels also appear as puppets in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]''.\n\n===Grimsby===\n{{Infobox character\n|colour      = #59E\n|name        = Grimsby\n|image       =\n|caption     = Grimsby, as seen in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''\n|first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989)\n|last        = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' (2000)\n|creator = \n|portrayer   = \n|voice = [[Ben Wright (actor)|Ben Wright]] ([[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|1989 film]])<br>[[Brian Cummings]] ([[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|TV series]])<br>[[Kay E.

He is voiced by [[Ben Wright (actor)|Ben Wright]] in the original film. In the opening scene, Grimsby is shown as not having the stomach for the sea, and dismisses the sailors' stories about merpeople living under the sea. Through dialogue, Grimsby reveals that he worries for Eric, and has been hoping that the prince will settle down with the right girl. For Eric's birthday, Grimsby presents a statue he had commissioned of Eric in a dramatic pose. Though Eric and Max disapprove of the statue, Grimsby is proud of it. Later, when Ariel has become human, Grimsby grows fond of her and encourages Eric to give up his dream girl for one \"of flesh and blood\".\n\nGrimsby appears briefly in the sequel, in which he is voiced by [[Kay E. Kuter]].\n\nIn the 2007 stage musical adaptation, Grimsby says that the reason he wants Eric to marry is because he (Grimsby) had made a promise to Eric's late father to ensure it. Though Grimsby is reluctant to believe Eric's story of being saved from drowning by a girl, he comes up with the idea of holding a contest in which the princesses of the land are to sing for Eric, in the hopes that one of them will be the right girl. In the stage musical, the role is originated by [[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]].\n\nGrimsby also appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by Dominique Kelley.\n\n===Max===\nMax is an [[Old English Sheepdog]] and Eric's pet. Unlike all the other animals in the film, Max is minimally [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and does not speak in the human language. Max's barking and growling is provided by [[Frank Welker]] throughout his animated incarnations.\n\nDuring Eric's birthday celebration, Max catches Ariel's scent and tracks her down, licking her on the cheek in an apparent show of affection. When the ship catches fire, the sailors escape safely, but Max is left behind. Seeing this, Eric dives out of his lifeboat and climbs back on board, grabbing Max and tossing him to safety. Later, when Eric is brought to shore safely by Ariel, Max smells out his master and rushes out to greet him. Max is also able to smell Ariel who is hidden off-shore behind rocks, but Eric does not understand his barking. After Ariel has made her deal with Ursula and is brought to shore as a human, Max leads Eric to her, recognizing her as the same person, though Eric cannot. Eventually, Ursula herself appears in the guise of a human girl named Vanessa to distract Eric from kissing Ariel before the third day is up, but Max is the only character in the human world who can fully see Vanessa for who she really is and is seen growling furiously at her, and during her and Eric's wedding, she kicks him directly in the face. When Scuttle and the sea animals try to stop the wedding, Max assists.\n\nMax makes a few brief appearances in the prequel television series and the direct-to-video sequel, and is the only named character of the original film (other than Vanessa) who does not appear in the 2007 stage musical. Max does however appear in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by Bagel the sheepdog.\n\n===Chef Louis===\nLouis is the chef in Eric's castle, voiced by [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois (actor)|Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]. His accent implies that he is French, and he performs the song \"Les Poissons\" in which he happily cooks seafood in the castle kitchen. According to dialogue by Carlotta the house maid, Louis' specialty is stuffed crab. This puts him at odds with Sebastian, who accidentally ends up in his kitchen and frantically tries to get away from him. This rivalry is extended to the wedding in the finale, where the chef again chases Sebastian in an attempt to cut him up.  The rivalry is shown again in the sequel ''The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea'', with no change between the two.\n\nHe also stars in one of the episodes of ''Disney's Marsupilami'' and ''Raw Toonage'' as a noise hating hotel guest with his victim, Sebastian as the hotel manager. Louis also makes an appearance in the episode \"Ariel's Treasures\" where he accidentally steps on a [[whisk]] called a \"whirly twirly\" by Ariel and it slips into the water when he is making recipes.\n\nIn the 2007 stage musical, Louis is head of a group of chefs that work in Eric's castle. He performs the song \"Les Poissons\" from the original movie. A reprise is performed by Louis and all the other chefs as they present their fish masterpieces to Ariel, Eric and Grimsby.\n\nChef Louis appears in ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'', played by [[John Stamos]].\n{{-}}\n\n===Carlotta===\nCarlotta works in Eric's castle in a role suggested to be similar to a housekeeper, though it is not stated outright. She reappears in the sequel, apparently continuing her role after Eric and Ariel are married and have a daughter of their own. She is voiced by [[Edie McClurg]].\n\nIn the 2007 stage musical, Carlotta develops an affectionate maternal relationship with Ariel. Carlotta sings in the musical number \"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\", where she berates the other servants who gossip about Ariel. Near the end of the musical there is a contest where the princesses of the land are to sing for Eric, in the hope that one of them will have the voice of the girl who saved his life.\n\n==Television series==\n===Urchin===\nUrchin is an orphaned merboy with an olive-green tail and is one of the main characters of the [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|prequel television series]], in which he is a close friend of Ariel, Sebastian and Flounder, and often goes on adventures with them. He is voiced by [[Danny Cooksey]].\n\nUrchin first appears in the fourth episode of the series, \"Urchin\". In it, Urchin is seen to be an orphan who lives by himself and wants badly to have friends. He is approached by small-time villains [[American lobster|Lobster]] Mobster and Da [[Shrimp]], who bring him into their gang and use him to steal food for them. Urchin manages to steal food from the palace, but in doing so is confronted by Ariel. Ariel tries to befriend Urchin, who at first rebuffs her. Urchin shows his true colors when he helps Ariel escape after she is kidnapped by Lobster Mobster and Da Shrimp. He even stops Crab Louie from stealing from the royal treasury. This earns him a kiss from Ariel. A friendship is forged when Urchin follows Ariel's advice and apologises to King Triton for his behavior. In the episode \"Trident True\", Urchin plays pranks on Ariel's sisters Arista, Attina, Andrina and Adella and buys a Father's Day present for King Triton, implying his closeness with the royal family, and Ariel's sisters admit that they look on him as their own little brother.\n\n===Gabriella===\nGabriella is one of Ariel's friends. She is a [[deaf]] mermaid with a pink tail and matching shells who communicates with [[sign language]]. She appears in two episodes: \"Wish Upon A Starfish\" and \"Ariel's Treasures\".\n\nIn her first appearance, before she meets Ariel, she sees her singing the first part of a song called \"Daring To Dance\" and sees her twirling about a [[music box]] with a figure of a [[Ballet dancer|ballerina]] on top of it. Ariel stops abruptly upon seeing her, but Gabriella encourages her to continue. She wishes to be able to sing as beautifully as Ariel, and she identifies with Ariel's desire to dance. She decides to journey with Ariel to visit the Magical Wishing Starfish, passing through many dangers along the way. She is saddened when the Magical Wishing Starfish proves to be a fraud, but Ariel reassures her that she can express her feelings just as well through sign language. She joins Ariel in the second part of \"Daring to Dance\". In her second appearance, she returns to Atlantica for a visit. She and Ariel gush over Ariel's new additions to her collection of human objects, as well as the music box that Ariel found when they first met. Unbeknownst to either of them, Ursula has launched another scheme to take over Atlantica, this time casting a spell that causes Ariel's treasures to come to life and terrorize people. She is confused and shocked when the treasures come alive, but she works with Ariel to break Ursula's spell.\n\n===Ollie===\nOllie is a [[blue]] vocal [[octopus]] who appears in two episodes: \"Wish Upon A Starfish\" and \"Ariel's Treasures\". He is the close friend and interpreter of Gabriella, a mute mermaid. He has spots on the sides of his head and a patch on his left eye. In his first appearance, he is shown with Gabriella, watching Ariel sing. After Ariel notices them, he explains Gabriella's disability and introduces himself. He is also the one to tell the tale of the Magical Wishing Starfish, and he accompanies them along the way. In his second appearance, he is visiting Atlantica with Gabriella and helps her stop Ursula's plot to take over the kingdom. He is voiced by [[Gabriel Damon]].\n\n===Pearl===\nPearl is a fun-loving mermaid with a blue tail and matching shells who is familiar with Ariel and Alana. She is blonde, with a blue tail and blue, ruffle-edged shells. She makes her first appearance in episode \"Red\" at a party held by Ariel, arriving with a crowd of friends on \"squid-cycles\". She is apparently very popular and seems friendly, if a bit snobbish. She comments that the party is a bit dull, and Ariel requests that the live band play louder, against her father's instructions. She leaves with the other guests when Triton puts a halt to the party.\n\nIn her second appearance in episode \"Eel-ectric City\", she shows up at the palace to pick up Alana, who has been invited to a party at her house. Ariel is shocked and impressed when Pearl comments that her parents allow her to do as she pleases, and is invited to join them. As they are leaving, Pearl spies Triton's new chariot and coerces Ariel into driving the three mermaids in it while she gives directions. After a few minutes, Alana notes that they are not heading for Pearl's house; they are instead going to Eel-ectric City, a party town reminiscent of Las Vegas, where Pearl is going to meet a few friends. They arrive and are having a fairly good time until a gang known as the \"Orange Roughies\" shows up. Pearl taunts them, then challenges them to a chariot race. Ariel and Alana try to reason with Pearl, but she wants to see the race through to the end. They start the race, but quickly lose control of the chariot in the rush of the current. It is only Ariel's quick thinking and the timely appearance of Triton that saves them. Pearl is shocked that her parents bothered coming, but happy that they cared about her. Her mother states that she will be keeping a closer eye on her daughter from now on.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Cree Summer]].\n\n===Spot===\nSpot is a fun loving [[killer whale]] calf whose name is based on a single [[white]] spot which is [[birthmark]]ed on his tail. In the episode called \"Whale Of A Tale\", when the human poachers get nearby, he frightenedly swims away from his real family until Ariel encounters him with a little love. She cares for him until she lets him go to be with his real family. He returns in \"Save The Whale\" as a grown-up whale and, as Sebastian announces him, he excitedly begins to perform for the citizens of Atlantica until he gets caught.\n\n===Simon===\nSimon is a sea dragon.\n\nImprisoned in cave and looking to be rescued. Simon writes a message and puts it in a bottle and with some luck, Ariel, Sebastian, and Flounder find the letter, brave danger en route to the cave, and then they face a giant sea dragon. The dragon turns out to be Simon himself, the writer of the message, who's looking to have a party with some new friends. Bringing Simon home to King Triton poses another challenge until Simon helps King Triton to save Atlantica and its merpeople from an invasion of evil sea anemones.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Brian Cummings]].\n\n===Dudley===\nDudley is an elderly sea turtle who also serves somewhat of an assistant to King Triton besides Sebastian. Dudley mumbles when he speaks and does not swim like other sea turtles in this show, instead he walks slowly along the sea floor like a land turtle and keeps important documents within his shell when he retracts his head. His conversation is always interrupted by his employer as he understands what the former is about to say.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Dave Coulier]].\n\n===Archimedes===\nArchimedes is a merman scholar, explorer and adventurer who is fascinated with humans, particularly human objects, like Ariel, he wants to know as much about the human world as possible, because of his fascination with humans, he is ostracized and disliked by his own people, as his only friend is Ariel. Because Archimedes goes to the surface very often, his knowledge on human culture is far more accurate than Ariel's; prior to the latter becoming human herself and her marriage to Eric.\n\nDue to Archimedes being ostracized by the merpeople, he lives in an abandoned sunken ship, in the wilderness outside of [[Atlantica]], is also where he keeps his collection of human objects, initially, unlike Ariel, he has directly met humans, he has even interacted with them.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Rod McKuen]].\n\n===Hans Christian Andersen===\nA character based on [[Hans Christian Andersen]], the author of the original [[The Little Mermaid|''Little Mermaid'' fairy tale]] appears in the episode \"Metal Fish\". He is voiced by [[Mark Hamill]].\n\nBased on rumors he hears from other sailors about the existence of merfolk, he attempts verify these claims by exploring the undersea world with the invention of his primitive submarine. While exploring the undersea world, his sub springs a leak and his steering controls are affected causing his sub to lose control and eventually sink to the bottom. However, to his surprise he encounters Ariel, to which his claims are verified. Later on, Archimedes, Sebastian, Flounder, The Crabscouts, and even King Triton appear to assist Andersen's damaged vessel back to the surface. At the end of this episode, the character is inspired by the encounter to \"write\" the story of ''The Little Mermaid''. This encounter contradicts the idea that Ariel's first face to face contact with humans is with Prince Eric, and forces Ariel to confront her father with the fact that she, Triton, and all merfolk are half human when she appeals to Triton for help in saving Andersen's life.\n\n===Lobster Mobster and Da Shrimp===\nLobster Mobster and Da Shrimp are a lobster and shrimp duo who are bumbling con-artists and constantly antagonize Ariel and her friends and are recurring antagonists from the television series. They are modeled after the stereotypes of the gangsters from the 1920s. Lobster Mobster is voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]] and Da Shrimp is voiced by [[David Lander]].\n\n===Manta===\nManta is a recurring villain in the TV series. Although his exact age is unknown, he appears to be potentially ageless as an individual is referenced in a legend as nearly destroying Atlantica who was imprisoned in an undersea volcano many years before the time of the series. The character is freed from an undersea volcano by a well-meaning Ariel. He then became a recurring character, intent on taking control of Atlantica for himself. He later has a son, \"Little Evil\" who becomes a friend of Ariel's, resulting in his father's redemption.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Tim Curry]].\n\n===Howling Hairfish===\nHowling Hairfish are monstrous fish, analogous to a [[werewolf]]. Flounder is the only Howling Hairfish that speaks.\n\n==''The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea''==\n===Melody===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #59E\n| name               = Melody\n| first              = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''\n| creator            = Elizabeth Anderson & Temple Mathews (screenplay)\n| voice              = [[Tara Strong]]\n| data1              = \n| alias              = \n| noinfo             = yes\n| family             = \n}}\nMelody is the daughter of Eric and Ariel, the niece of Ariel's sisters and the granddaughter of King Triton and Queen Athena.\n\nThe film opens to the celebration of her birth; her parents sail out to sea to present Melody to King Triton and the merfolk. As Triton gives her the locket, the celebration is interrupted by Morgana, who threatens to hurt Melody if Triton does not hand over the trident. Eric and Ariel manage to save Melody, but Morgana escapes. Ariel vows to keep all knowledge of the sea from Melody until Morgana is found.\n\nBy her 12th birthday, Melody has been regularly sneaking out of the palace to swim. She finds a locket with her name on it (intended by as a gift for her when she was born), and questions Ariel about it. Ariel and Melody argue, and before Ariel can apologize and explain, Melody runs away from the castle in a boat. Melody is discovered by Undertow and convinced to meet Morgana, who uses Melody's love of the sea against her. Morgana transforms Melody into a mermaid, promising that the transformation will last forever if she retrieves the trident from Triton.\n\nMelody succeeds in stealing the trident and gives it to Morgana, who subsequently traps her in a cave. Soon afterward, Morgana's spell on Melody wears off, causing her to revert into a human and nearly drown. Melody sneaks up behind Morgana and stabs her with the trident, before giving it to Triton, who encases Morgana in ice.\n\nIn the wake of their victory, Triton offers Melody the option of becoming a mermaid permanently but Melody declines.\n\nMelody performs one song in the film, \"For a Moment\", in which Ariel, voiced by Jodi Benson, also provides vocals.\n\nShe is also a playable character in the PlayStation game, ''The Little Mermaid 2'', based on the two movies.\n\nShe is voiced by Tara Strong.\n\n===Morgana===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Morgana\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]''\n| creator = Elizabeth Anderson & Temple Mathews (screenplay)\n| voice = [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]\n| alias =\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nMorgana is the younger sister of [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]].

Tip and Dash join Melody on her journey to retrieve the trident for Morgana.

She appears in the opening prologue of the prequel, in which she is at first shown singing her and Triton's special song (Athena's song) to the girls before bedtime. She is then seen relaxing in a cove on the ocean surface with her husband, children and other merfolk. Triton gives her a music box that plays their song as an anniversary present. The fun ceases when a pirate ship appears and attacks the merpeople, during which Athena is crushed to death by the ship, whilst trying to save the music box. Triton responds to this tragedy by banning music from Atlantica. Prior to this film, Ariel's mother had been mentioned before in the prequel television series, but had then remained nameless. It is never actually stated, but it is quite likely that it was Athena's death, at the hands of humans, that caused Triton's prejudice towards them.\n\nThe character will reportedly appear in the [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)#Live-action adaptation|upcoming live-action adaptation]] of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', with the film also focusing on Ariel and her mother's relationship.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476693/disneys-live-action-little-mermaid-has-found-its-king-triton</ref>\n\n===Marina Del Rey===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #59E\n| name        = Marina Del Rey\n| image       =\n| caption     =\n| first       = ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]''\n| creator = \n| voice = [[Sally Field]] as Marina Del Rey\n| alias =\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\nMarina Del Rey, voiced by [[Sally Field]], is a mermaid and the [[governess]] of King Triton's seven daughters, in charge of enforcing Triton's distant and formal parenting style and is the main antagonist.

Each compound also has many livestock structures for their flocks of several thousand sheep and goats. The community makes its living from shepherding and settled in the present location in 1982 having left the Hebron area and migrated across the Jordan Valley as they searched for pastureland. On 21 May 2014, the southern compound was demolished by five Israeli Civil Administration bulldozers supported by IDF soldiers and Border Police on the basis that the families did not have building permits.<ref name=b20140529>{{cite web|title=Civil Administration demolishes nearly half the homes in community of Id\u2019eis, the Jordan Valley|url=http://www.btselem.org/planning_and_building/20140529_demolition_in_ideis_community|publisher=B'tselem|date=29 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.palestinecrops.ps/articleen.aspx?ano=9 Photo of dates grown at Al-Jiftlik on the Palestine Crops website]\n*[http://vprofile.arij.org/jericho/pdfs/factsheet/Al%20Jiftlik_FS_EN.pdf Al Jiftlik Village (Fact Sheet)],(Fact Sheet)],  [[Applied Research Institute - Jerusalem]] (ARIJ)\n*[http://vprofile.arij.org/jericho/pdfs/vprofile/Al%20Jiftlik_en_FINAL.pdf Al Jiftlik Village Profile], ARIJ\n*[http://vprofile.arij.org/jericho/images/english/Al-jiftlik_ap_en.jpg Al Jiftlik Arial photo], ARIJ\n*[http://vprofile.arij.org/jericho/pdfs/needsfordevelopment/Jiftlik_N_EN.pdf Locality Development Priorities and Needs in Jiftlik], ARIJ\n*Survey of Western Palestine, Map 15:   [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&type_id=6&id=8377  IAA], [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Survey_of_Western_Palestine_1880.15.jpg Wikimedia commons]\n\n{{Jericho Governorate}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jiftlik, Al-}}\n[[Category:Jericho Governorate]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1950]]\n[[Category:Villages in the West Bank]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of the State of Palestine]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Al-Jiftlik\n| translit_lang1          = Arabic\n| translit_lang1_type     = [[Arabic script|Arabic]]\n| translit_lang1_info     = \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u062a\u0644\u0643\n| translit_lang1_type1    = [[Latin script|Latin]]\n| translit_lang1_info1    = Al-Jeftlik (official)<br />El-Jeftlak (unofficial)\n| type                    = [[Village council (Palestinian Authority)|Municipality type D (Village council)]]\n| image_skyline           = UNRWA's Ghor El Far'a school in Al-Jiftlik 143 - Aug 2011.jpg\n| image_caption           = UNRWA school in al-Jiftlik, 2011\n| pushpin_map             = Palestine\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location of Al-Jiftlik within [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]\n| image_map               = \n| map_caption             = \n| coordinates             = {{coord|32|08|39|N|35|29|36|E|region:PS|display=inline,title}}\n| grid_name               = [[Palestine grid|Palestine&nbsp;grid]]\n| grid_position           = 196/172\n| subdivision_type        = State\n| subdivision_name        = [[State of Palestine]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[Governorates of the Palestinian National Authority|Governorate]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Jericho Governorate|Jericho]]\n| established_title       = Founded\n| established_date        = \n| government_footnotes    = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| government_type         = [[Village council (Palestinian Authority)|Village council]] \n| leader_title            = Head of Municipality\n| leader_name             = Muhammad Omar [[Jahalin Bedouin|Jahalin]]<ref>[http://www.elections.ps/pdf/Municipal_Elections_Results_EN_(2).pdf West Bank] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630094514/http://www.elections.ps/pdf/Municipal_Elections_Results_EN_%282%29.pdf |date=2007-06-30 }} Local Elections ( Round two)- Successful candidates by local authority, gender and No. of votes obtained, al-Jftalak p 23</ref>\n| unit_pref               = dunam\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_total_km2          = 185.0\n| area_total_dunam        = 185032\n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| elevation_min_m         = \n| elevation_max_m         = \n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_total        = 3,546\n| population_as_of        = 2007\n| population_note         = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n\n'''Al-Jiftlik''' ({{lang-ar|<big>\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u062a\u0644\u0643</big>}}) is a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village in the [[Jericho Governorate]] in the [[West Bank]], located 33 kilometers north of [[Jericho]].
