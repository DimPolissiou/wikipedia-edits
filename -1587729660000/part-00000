It is not necessary for the host to follow any special protocols. All handling of data, as it relates to the shingled nature of the storage, is managed by the device.  In addition, the host is unaware that the storage is shingled.<ref name=\"snia-smr\" />\n\nThis type of SMR drives are often not labelled by the manufacturer.  Its firmware-controlled shingle translation layer operation can be compared to [[solid state drive]]s, as LBA addresses do not correlate much to on-disk structure.  The append-only zones are very slow for random writing, so writes are first sent to a PMR (CMR) cache, and the disk moves these data to SMR parts when idle.  RAID [[resilvering]] tends to overload the cache, sending SMR drives into minutes-long pauses. Faulty firmware (such as WD40EFAX) may also throw an error when asked to read an address never written to. Both behaviors tend to be interpreted as drive failure by the RAID controller.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mellor |first1=Chris |title=Shingled hard drives have non-shingled zones for caching writes |url=https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/04/15/shingled-drives-have-non-shingled-zones-for-caching-writes/ |website=Blocks and Files |date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe zoned nature of SMR also means that the disk suffers from [[write amplification]] when [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collecting]],<ref name=fast16>{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Eric |last2=Ying |first2=Lawrence |last3=Greenfield |first3=Lawrence |last4=Cypher |first4=Robert |last5=T'so |first5=Theodore |title=Disks for Data Centers |journal=Proceedings of USENIX FAST 2016 |date=2016 |url=https://research.google/pubs/pub44830/ |language=en}}</ref> although for hard drives the main problem with writes is speed instead of longevity.

Since the host manages the shingled nature of the storage, it is required to write sequentially so as to not destroy existing data. The drive will refuse to execute commands which violate this protocol.<ref name=\"snia-smr\" />\n\nTwo set of specialized commands, ZBC (Zoned Block Commands) for [[SCSI]] and ZAC (Zoned ATA Commands) for [[SATA]] are available for host-managed and host-aware devices. They tell the host about whether each zone is PMR or SMR and allow them to address these zones directly.<ref name=\"tom\">{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611164138/http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/shingled-magnetic-recoding-smr-101-basics,2-933.html|archivedate=2017-06-11|url=http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/shingled-magnetic-recoding-smr-101-basics,2-933.html|title=SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) 101|accessdate=2018-03-03|publisher=Tom's IT Pro|language=en}}</ref> The equivalent of TRIM in this command set is the ''zone write pointer reset'', which marks an entire zone as containing no valid data.\n\n===Host aware===\nHost Aware is a combination of Drive Managed and Host Managed. The drive is capable of managing the shingled nature of the storage and will execute any command the host gives it, regardless of if it is sequential or not. However, the host is aware that the drive is shingled, and able to query the drive for fill levels.  This allows the host to optimize writes for the shingled nature, while also allowing the drive to be flexible and backwards-compatible.<ref name=\"snia-smr\" />\n\n== Software and application ==\nThe higher density of SMR drives, combined with its random-read nature, fills a niche between the sequential-access [[tape storage]] and the random-access conventional hard drive storage. They are suited to storing data that are unlikely to be modified, but need to be read from any point efficiently. One example of the use case is [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]'s ''Magic Storage'' system, which runs the on-disk ''extents'' in an append-only way.<ref name=dbsmr>{{Cite web|url=https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/extending-magic-pocket-innovation-with-the-first-petabyte-scale-smr-drive-deployment|title=Extending Magic Pocket Innovation with the first petabyte scale SMR drive deployment|author=Magic Pocket Hardware Engineering Teams|website=dropbox.tech}}</ref> Device-managed SMR disks have also been marketed as \"Archive HDDs\" due to this property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/hdd-fam/seagate-archive-hdd/en-us/docs/archive-hdd-ds1834-5c-1508us.pdf|title=Archive HDD|publisher=Seagate|accessdate=2018-03-03|format=PDF|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA number of [[file system]]s in [[Linux]] are or can be tuned for SMR drives:<ref>{{cite web |title=File Systems|url=https://zonedstorage.io/linux/fs/ |website=ZonedStorage.io}}</ref>\n* [[F2FS]], originally designed for flash media, has a Zoned Block Device (ZBD) mode.

Ted Ts'o and Abutalib Aghayev gave a talk in 2017 on their ''ext4-lazy''.

Other SMR devices are ''host-managed'' and depend on the operating system to know how to handle the drive, and only write sequentially to certain regions of the drive. <ref name=\"snia-smr\" />{{rp|11 ff.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/591782/ |title=Support for shingled magnetic recording devices |author=Jake Edge |publisher=[[LWN.net]] |date=March 26, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] has been shipping device-managed SMR hard drives since September 2013, while referring to an increase in overall hard disk drive capacity of about 25%, compared to non-shingled storage.<ref name=\"anandtech-7290\" /> In September 2014, [[HGST]] announced a 10&nbsp;TB drive filled with [[helium]] that uses host-managed shingled magnetic recording,<ref>{{Cite news |title= Shingled platters breathe helium inside HGST's 10TB hard drive |author= Geoff Gasior |date= September 9, 2014|work= The Tech Report |url= http://techreport.com/news/27031/shingled-platters-breathe-helium-inside-hgst-10tb-hard-drive |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref> although in December 2015 it followed this with a 10&nbsp;TB helium-filled drive that uses conventional non-shingled perpendicular recording.<ref>{{cite news |title=HGST releases helium-filled 10TB hard drive; Seagate twiddles shingled fingers |author=Sebastian Anthony |date=3 December 2015 |work=Ars Technica |url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2015/12/hgst-releases-helium-filled-10tb-hard-drive-seagate-twiddles-shingled-fingers/ |accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref> In November 2018, HGST introduced 14- and 15-TB drives.<ref>{{cite web |title=15TB and 14TB SMR Hard Drives Ultrastar DC HC620 |url=https://www.hgst.com/products/hard-drives/ultrastar-dc-hc620 |website=www.hgst.com |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Western Digital]], Seagate and [[Toshiba]] have begun selling SMR drives without labeling them as such, thus revealing a large controversy, as SMR drives are much slower in some circumstances than [[Perpendicular recording|PMR]] drives.<ref name=Alcorn>{{cite news |last=Alcorn |first=Paul |date= |title=Sneaky Marketing Redux: Toshiba, Seagate Shipping Slower SMR Drives Without Disclosure, Too |url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sneaky-marketing-toshiba-seagate-wd-smr-drives-without-disclosure |work=Tom\u2019s Hardware  |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> These practices were used to be in both data storage-dedicated (for servers, NASes and cold storage) and consumer-centric HDDs.\n\n==Data management==\nThere are three different ways that data can be managed on an SMR drive:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.t10.org/cgi-bin/ac.pl?t=f&f=zbc-r05.pdf |title=Zoned Block Commands (ZBC) |website=t10.org |publisher=ANSI T10 Committee |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SDC15_presentations/smr/JorgeCampello_SMR_Next_Generation_Storage_Technology.pdf |title=SMR: The Next Generation of Storage Technology |first=Jorge |last=Campello |date=24 September 2015 |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n* Device Managed\n* Host Managed\n* Host Aware\n\n===Device managed===\nA Device Managed drive appears to the host identically to a non-shingled drive.  It is not necessary for the host to follow any special protocols. All handling of data, as it relates to the shingled nature of the storage, is managed by the device.  In addition, the host is unaware that the storage is shingled.<ref name=\"snia-smr\" />\n\nThis type of SMR drives are often not labelled by the manufacturer.  Its firmware-controlled shingle translation layer operation can be compared to [[solid state drive]]s, as LBA addresses do not correlate much to on-disk structure.  The append-only zones are very slow for random writing, so writes are first sent to a PMR (CMR) cache, and the disk moves these data to SMR parts when idle.  RAID [[resilvering]] tends to overload the cache, sending SMR drives into minutes-long pauses. Faulty firmware (such as WD40EFAX) may also throw an error when asked to read an address never written to. Both behaviors tend to be interpreted as drive failure by the RAID controller.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mellor |first1=Chris |title=Shingled hard drives have non-shingled zones for caching writes |url=https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/04/15/shingled-drives-have-non-shingled-zones-for-caching-writes/ |website=Blocks and Files |date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe zoned nature of SMR also means that the disk suffers from [[write amplification]] when [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collecting]],<ref name=fast16>{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=Eric |last2=Ying |first2=Lawrence |last3=Greenfield |first3=Lawrence |last4=Cypher |first4=Robert |last5=T'so |first5=Theodore |title=Disks for Data Centers |journal=Proceedings of USENIX FAST 2016 |date=2016 |url=https://research.google/pubs/pub44830/ |language=en}}</ref> although for hard drives the main problem with writes is speed instead of longevity.

Since the host manages the shingled nature of the storage, it is required to write sequentially so as to not destroy existing data. The drive will refuse to execute commands which violate this protocol.<ref name=\"snia-smr\" />\n\nTwo set of specialized commands, ZBC (Zoned Block Commands) for [[SCSI]] and ZAC (Zoned ATA Commands) for [[SATA]] are available for host-managed and host-aware devices. They tell the host about whether each zone is PMR or SMR and allow them to address these zones directly.<ref name=\"tom\">{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611164138/http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/shingled-magnetic-recoding-smr-101-basics,2-933.html|archivedate=2017-06-11|url=http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/shingled-magnetic-recoding-smr-101-basics,2-933.html|title=SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) 101|accessdate=2018-03-03|publisher=Tom's IT Pro|language=en}}</ref> The equivalent of TRIM in this command set is the ''zone write pointer reset'', which marks an entire zone as containing no valid data.\n\n===Host aware===\nHost Aware is a combination of Drive Managed and Host Managed. The drive is capable of managing the shingled nature of the storage and will execute any command the host gives it, regardless of if it is sequential or not. However, the host is aware that the drive is shingled, and able to query the drive for fill levels.  This allows the host to optimize writes for the shingled nature, while also allowing the drive to be flexible and backwards-compatible.<ref name=\"snia-smr\" />\n\n== Software and application ==\nThe higher density of SMR drives, combined with its random-read nature, fills a niche between the sequential-access [[tape storage]] and the random-access conventional hard drive storage. They are suited to storing data that are unlikely to be modified, but need to be read from any point efficiently. One example of the use case is [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]'s ''Magic Storage'' system, which runs the on-disk ''extents'' in an append-only way.<ref name=dbsmr>{{Cite web|url=https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/extending-magic-pocket-innovation-with-the-first-petabyte-scale-smr-drive-deployment|title=Extending Magic Pocket Innovation with the first petabyte scale SMR drive deployment|author=Magic Pocket Hardware Engineering Teams|website=dropbox.tech}}</ref> Device-managed SMR disks have also been marketed as \"Archive HDDs\" due to this property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/hdd-fam/seagate-archive-hdd/en-us/docs/archive-hdd-ds1834-5c-1508us.pdf|title=Archive HDD|publisher=Seagate|accessdate=2018-03-03|format=PDF|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA number of [[file system]]s in [[Linux]] are or can be tuned for SMR drives:<ref>{{cite web |title=File Systems|url=https://zonedstorage.io/linux/fs/ |website=ZonedStorage.io}}</ref>\n* [[F2FS]], originally designed for flash media, has a Zoned Block Device (ZBD) mode. It can be used on host-managed drives with conventional zones for metadata. \n* [[Btrfs]] ZBD support is in progress, but it already writes mostly sequentially due to the CoW nature.\n* [[ext4]] can be experimentally tuned to write more sequentially. Ted Ts'o and Abutalib Aghayev gave a talk in 2017 on the topic. Seagate also has a more radical \"SMRFFS\" extension from 2015 that makes use of the ZBC/ZAC commands.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seagate/SMR_FS-EXT4: an addition to the popular EXT4 to enable support for devices that use the ZBC or ZAC standards |url=https://github.com/Seagate/SMR_FS-EXT4 |publisher=Seagate Technology |date=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n* For other filesystems, the Linux device mapper has a ''dm-zoned'' target that maps a host-managed drive into a random-writable drive.

Born in Lisbon, Portugal, he has been designing sailing and motor [[yachts]] since about 1980, with more than 8,000 boats launched, ranging from custom boats and [[one-design]] production models to [[superyacht]]s. His design firm is based in [[Hamble-le-Rice]], England.\n\n==Career==\nAs a [[Chartered Engineer]], his first job came about when it was discovered that Denis Doyle's yacht ''Moonduster'' was floating above her 'marks', having been built less heavily than had been intended her designer, [[Germ\u00e1n Frers]]. Castro advised that lead be attached to the underside of the coachroof and had a hole drilled in the keel to reduce her stability, which gave the vessel an exceptionally good handicap for a boat of her size. ''Moonduster'' held the Round Ireland monohull record from Wicklow to Wicklow for nearly 15 years until the record was broken by a Whitbread around the World yacht. Her fastest elapsed time for the race came in 1984, when she took only 88h, 15m and 43s to complete the course.\n\nAfter leaving [[Ron Holland]]\u2019s design team in 1980, Castro's first significant racing yacht design was ''Justine III'', for Frank Woods of the National Yacht Club in Ireland. She was the first and only yacht to win the [[One Ton Cup]] with five straight first place victories. The same owner then built ''Justine IV'', which was crowned best Offshore Admiral's Cupper in 1983.\n\nThen followed ''Iztanother Purla'', a 43 footer which missed being chosen for the British Admiral's Cup Team, but then went on to win all 7 races in Cowes Week, beating all the Admiral's Cuppers, helmed by the late Sir [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]] and his NZ crew from ''Steinlager''. A boat full of innovative ideas, including praddle steering, a method of steering using a vertical arm rising from below the cockpit floor.<ref>Seen at Wicklow Sailing Club before competing in Round Ireland Yacht Race as 'The Famous Grouse'.</ref>  {{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nLater successes included the two-time Quarter-Ton Cup winner ''McDonald's'', the [[Half Ton Cup]] winner ''Balthazar'', and the 6mR World Championship and Coupe de France winner ''Thisbe''.\n\nHe was appointed by a member of Royal Cork Yacht Club to redesign the J24, with the aim of producing an exciting sports boat. The client expected a bigger mainsail, a new deck moulding and an effective keel to give greater stability. The result was the 1720 sportsboat. A new era in Sportsboat racing had started: The boats were built in Co. Kerry, and about 100 were built starting with sail number 1720, and although successful, it was considered that the 1720 had shortcomings, namely too powerful a rig, which meant that the boat required too many crew. The [[SB20]], elected Boat of the Year Overall 2008, addressed all of these shortcomings and is now to be seen worldwide.\n\nCastro's designers work with many boatyards internationally, including the [[Royal Huisman]], [[Jongert]], [[Palmer Johnson]], [[Neptunus]], [[CS Yachts]], [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]], and [[Jeanneau]].\n\nMost recently during the global pandemic has gone into administration however he has said that he will push through this.\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Major achievements===\nHis designs have won Yacht of the Year awards, a Superyacht Design award and several World championships.

Born in Lisbon, Portugal, he has been designing sailing and motor [[yachts]] since about 1980, with more than 8,000 boats launched, ranging from custom boats and [[one-design]] production models to [[superyacht]]s. His design firm is based in [[Hamble-le-Rice]], England.\n\n==Career==\nAs a [[Chartered Engineer]], his first job came about when it was discovered that Denis Doyle's yacht ''Moonduster'' was floating above her 'marks', having been built less heavily than had been intended her designer, [[Germ\u00e1n Frers]]. Castro advised that lead be attached to the underside of the coachroof and had a hole drilled in the keel to reduce her stability, which gave the vessel an exceptionally good handicap for a boat of her size. ''Moonduster'' held the Round Ireland monohull record from Wicklow to Wicklow for nearly 15 years until the record was broken by a Whitbread around the World yacht. Her fastest elapsed time for the race came in 1984, when she took only 88h, 15m and 43s to complete the course.\n\nAfter leaving [[Ron Holland]]\u2019s design team in 1980, Castro's first significant racing yacht design was ''Justine III'', for Frank Woods of the National Yacht Club in Ireland. She was the first and only yacht to win the [[One Ton Cup]] with five straight first place victories. The same owner then built ''Justine IV'', which was crowned best Offshore Admiral's Cupper in 1983.\n\nThen followed ''Iztanother Purla'', a 43 footer which missed being chosen for the British Admiral's Cup Team, but then went on to win all 7 races in Cowes Week, beating all the Admiral's Cuppers, helmed by the late Sir [[Peter Blake (sailor)|Peter Blake]] and his NZ crew from ''Steinlager''. A boat full of innovative ideas, including praddle steering, a method of steering using a vertical arm rising from below the cockpit floor.<ref>Seen at Wicklow Sailing Club before competing in Round Ireland Yacht Race as 'The Famous Grouse'.</ref>  {{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nLater successes included the two-time Quarter-Ton Cup winner ''McDonald's'', the [[Half Ton Cup]] winner ''Balthazar'', and the 6mR World Championship and Coupe de France winner ''Thisbe''.\n\nHe was appointed by a member of Royal Cork Yacht Club to redesign the J24, with the aim of producing an exciting sports boat. The client expected a bigger mainsail, a new deck moulding and an effective keel to give greater stability. The result was the 1720 sportsboat. A new era in Sportsboat racing had started: The boats were built in Co. Kerry, and about 100 were built starting with sail number 1720, and although successful, it was considered that the 1720 had shortcomings, namely too powerful a rig, which meant that the boat required too many crew. The [[SB20]], elected Boat of the Year Overall 2008, addressed all of these shortcomings and is now to be seen worldwide.\n\nCastro's designers work with many boatyards internationally, including the [[Royal Huisman]], [[Jongert]], [[Palmer Johnson]], [[Neptunus]], [[CS Yachts]], [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]], and [[Jeanneau]].\n\n==Achievements==\n\n===Major achievements===\nHis designs have won Yacht of the Year awards, a Superyacht Design award and several World championships.

Camps are run on broadly [[anarchist]] principles - free to attend, supported by donations and with input from everyone in the community for the day-to-day operation of the camp. Initiated in the [[UK]], camps have taken place in [[England]] at [[Drax power station]], [[Heathrow Airport]], [[Kingsnorth power station]] in [[Kent]], the [[City of London]] and [[The Royal Bank of Scotland]] Headquarters, near [[Edinburgh]]. During 2009 camps also took place in [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands]]/[[Belgium]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Australia]].\n\nThe Camp for Climate Action, first came into being in 2006, after activists at the [[31st G8 summit#Activism|2005 G8 conference]] in Stirling in Scotland mooted the idea.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zee |first1=Bibi van der |title=Climate Camp disbanded |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/02/climate-camp-disbanded |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=2 March 2011 |language=en |quote=One activist remembers: \"We built a camp up in Scotland, and had about 4,000-5,000 people there, and after we pulled that off, we realised that actually, now we had the infrastructure to try something like this.

Daily consensus-based meetings are held in each neighbourhood, with spokespeople sent to a central meeting.\n\nPower for lighting, radios, mobile phones, sound equipment and laptop computers was supplied by [[solar power|solar panels]] and a [[wind power|wind turbine]].
