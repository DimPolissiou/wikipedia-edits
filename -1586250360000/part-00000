It was first announced by [[Bill Gates]] on August 1, 1988, at [[COMDEX]] in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an [[office suite]] (bundled set of productivity [[application software|applications]]), the first version of Office contained [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] data integration and [[Visual Basic for Applications]] scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the [[Office Business Applications]] brand. On July 10, 2012, [[Softpedia]] reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-s-Office-Has-Over-One-Billion-Users-280426.shtml |title=Microsoft\u2019s Office Has over One Billion Users |work=[[Softpedia]] |publisher=SoftNews |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOffice is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the [[desktop computer|desktop]] version, available for [[personal computer|PCs]] running the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] [[operating system]]s. Office in a browser, previously known as [[Office Online]], is a version of the software that runs within a [[web browser]], while Microsoft also maintains Office [[mobile app|apps]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].\n\nSince [[Office 2013]], Microsoft has promoted [[Office 365]] as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a [[subscription business model]], and users receive free feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and [[cloud computing]] integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales.\n\nThe current on-premises, desktop version of Office is [[Microsoft Office 2019|Office 2019]], released on September 24, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-office-2019-for-windows-and-mac/|title=Microsoft starts rolling out Office 2019 for Windows and Mac|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|List of Microsoft Office programs}}\n\n===Desktop applications===\nUnless stated otherwise, desktop applications are available for Windows and macOS.\n* '''[[Microsoft Word]]:''' a [[word processor]] included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued [[Microsoft Works]]. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and introduced the [[computer mouse]] to more users. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of [[LisaWrite]] and [[MacWrite]], Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer [[WYSIWYG]] features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of [[Office Open XML]], which was later standardized by [[Ecma International]] as an [[open format]]. Support for [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[OpenDocument]] (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with [[Service Pack]] 2 for Word 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501133844/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n* '''[[Microsoft Excel]]:''' a [[spreadsheet]] editor that originally competed with the dominant [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and eventually outsold it.

On the Mac OS, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]].

This app combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single app and introduces new capabilities as making quick notes, signing PDFs, scanning QR codes, and transferring files.<ref>{{cite web|title=The new Office app now generally available for Android and iOS|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/02/19/new-office-app-android-ios-available/|work=Microsoft 365 team|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=February 19, 2020|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Common features==\nMost versions of Microsoft Office (including Office 97 and later) use their own [[widget toolkit|widget]] set and do not exactly match the native operating system. This is most apparent in Microsoft Office XP and 2003, where the standard [[Menu (computing)|menus]] were replaced with a colored, flat-looking, shadowed menu style. The user interface of a particular version of Microsoft Office often heavily influences a subsequent version of Microsoft Windows. For example, the [[toolbar]], colored [[Button (computing)|buttons]] and the gray-colored 3D look of Office 4.3 were added to Windows 95, and the [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon]], introduced in Office 2007, has been incorporated into several programs bundled with [[Windows 7]] and later. In 2012, Office 2013 replicated the flat, box-like design of [[Windows 8]].\n\nUsers of Microsoft Office may access external data via connection-specifications saved in Office Data Connection (.odc) files.<ref>{{cite book|last=DeMarco|first=Jim|authorlink=|title=Pro Excel 2007 VBA|date=February 1, 2008|publisher=Apress|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-59059-957-0|page=361|quote= External data is accessed through a connection file, such as an Office Data Connection (ODC) file (.odc)}}</ref>\n\nBoth Windows and Office use [[service pack]]s to update software. Office had non-cumulative [[Patch (computing)|service release]]s, which were discontinued after Office 2000 Service Release 1.\n\nPast versions of Office [[Easter eggs in Microsoft products|often contained Easter eggs]]. For example, Excel 97 contained a reasonably functional flight-simulator.\n\n==File formats and metadata==\nMicrosoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats based on the OLE [[Compound File Binary Format]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Office File Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc313118.aspx|work=[[MSDN#Library|MSDN Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html | title=We Can Put an End to Word Attachments | last=Stallman | first = Richard M. | publisher=Free Software Foundation | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available for download and granted any possible patents rights for use or implementations of those binary format for free under the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise|Open Specification Promise]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spolsky|first1=Joel|title=Why are the Microsoft Office file formats so complicated?

Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Windows platform ([[LibreOffice]], all platforms), macOS platform ([[iWork]] '08, [[NeoOffice]], [[LibreOffice]]) and [[Linux]] ([[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] 3.0). In addition, Office 2010, Service Pack 2 for Office 2007, and Office 2016 for Mac supports the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for opening and saving documents - only the old [[OpenDocument|ODF]] 1.0 (2006 ISO/IEC standard) is supported, not the 1.2 version (2015 ISO/IEC standard).\n\nMicrosoft provides the ability to [[metadata removal tool|remove metadata]] from Office documents. This was in response to highly publicized incidents where sensitive data about a document was leaked via its metadata.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/02/02/microsoft_releases_metadata_removal_tool/ | title=Microsoft releases metadata removal tool | first=Jan | last=Libbenga | work=The Register | date=February 2, 2004 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> Metadata removal was first available in 2004, when Microsoft released a tool called ''Remove Hidden Data Add-in for Office 2003/XP'' for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8446 | title=Office 2003/XP Add-in: Remove Hidden Data |work=Download Center | publisher=Microsoft | date=July 8, 2008}}</ref> It was directly integrated into Office 2007 in a feature called the ''Document Inspector''.\n\n==Extensibility==\nA major feature of the Office suite is the ability for users and third party companies to write add-ins ([[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]) that extend the capabilities of an application by adding custom commands and specialized features.

The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus [[Microsoft Access]] 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in [[CD-ROM]] form, it also included [[Microsoft Bookshelf|Bookshelf]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP.

Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]].\n\n====Microsoft Office 2000 to 2003====\n'''[[Microsoft Office 2000]]''' (Office 9.0) introduced [[adaptive]] menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user.

Office 2000 automatically trusts [[macro (computer science)|macros]] (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. The Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]], remained in Brazil and was also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.\n\n'''[[Microsoft Office XP]]''' (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the [[Safe Mode]] feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted [[Windows registry|registry]] or a faulty add-in. [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]] is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010. Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as [[handwriting recognition]].

It was first announced by [[Bill Gates]] on August 1, 1988, at [[COMDEX]] in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an [[office suite]] (bundled set of productivity [[application software|applications]]), the first version of Office contained [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] data integration and [[Visual Basic for Applications]] scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the [[Office Business Applications]] brand. On July 10, 2012, [[Softpedia]] reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-s-Office-Has-Over-One-Billion-Users-280426.shtml |title=Microsoft\u2019s Office Has over One Billion Users |work=[[Softpedia]] |publisher=SoftNews |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOffice is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the [[desktop computer|desktop]] version, available for [[personal computer|PCs]] running the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] [[operating system]]s. Office in a browser, previously known as [[Office Online]], is a version of the software that runs within a [[web browser]], while Microsoft also maintains Office [[mobile app|apps]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].\n\nSince [[Office 2013]], Microsoft has promoted [[Office 365]] as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a [[subscription business model]], and users receive free feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and [[cloud computing]] integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales.\n\nThe current on-premises, desktop version of Office is [[Microsoft Office 2019|Office 2019]], released on September 24, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-office-2019-for-windows-and-mac/|title=Microsoft starts rolling out Office 2019 for Windows and Mac|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|List of Microsoft Office programs}}\n\n===Desktop applications===\nUnless stated otherwise, desktop applications are available for Windows and macOS.\n* '''[[Microsoft Word]]:''' a [[word processor]] included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued [[Microsoft Works]]. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and introduced the [[computer mouse]] to more users. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of [[LisaWrite]] and [[MacWrite]], Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer [[WYSIWYG]] features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of [[Office Open XML]], which was later standardized by [[Ecma International]] as an [[open format]]. Support for [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[OpenDocument]] (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with [[Service Pack]] 2 for Word 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501133844/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n* '''[[Microsoft Excel]]:''' a [[spreadsheet]] editor that originally competed with the dominant [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and eventually outsold it.

In addition, the company does not provide users of its (Office) software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company. Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and \"sends home\" is diagnostics. Researchers also observed that Microsoft \"seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU\".

The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus [[Microsoft Access]] 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in [[CD-ROM]] form, it also included [[Microsoft Bookshelf|Bookshelf]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP.

Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]].\n\n====Microsoft Office 2000 to 2003====\n'''[[Microsoft Office 2000]]''' (Office 9.0) introduced [[adaptive]] menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user.

The Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]], remained in Brazil and was also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.\n\n'''[[Microsoft Office XP]]''' (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the [[Safe Mode]] feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted [[Windows registry|registry]] or a faulty add-in. [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]] is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010. Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as [[handwriting recognition]].

They cut \"galleries\" into the wood grain to provide passageways to allow for movement between different sections of the nest. Certain parts of a house, such as around and under windows, roof eaves, decks and porches, are more likely to be infested by carpenter ants because these areas are most vulnerable to moisture.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n[[File:Carpenter ants carrying a dead bee.jpg|thumb|Carpenter ants carrying a dead [[bee]]]]\nCarpenter ants have been known to construct extensive underground tunneling systems. These systems often lead to an end at some food source&nbsp;\u2013 often aphid colonies, where the ants extract and feed on honeydew. These tunneling systems also often exist in trees. The colonies typically include a central \"parent\" colony surrounded and supplemented by smaller satellite colonies.<ref name=\"Carpenter Ants 1994 pp. 1\u20139\">Colony Size and Polygyny in Carpenter Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Roger D.

These ants are foragers that typically eat parts of other dead insects or substances derived from other insects. Common foods for them include insect parts, \"honeydew\" produced by aphids, or [[Extrafloral nectary|extrafloral nectar]] from plants. They are also known for eating other sugary liquids such as honey, syrup, or juices. Carpenter ants can increase the survivability of [[aphids]] when they tend them. They tend many aphid species but can also express preference for specific ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMost species of carpenter ants forage at night. When foraging, they usually collect and consume dead insects. Some species less commonly collect live insects. When they discover a dead insect, workers surround it and extract its bodily fluids to be carried back to the nest. The remaining chitin-based shell is left behind. Occasionally, the ants bring the chitinous head of the insect back to the nest, where they also extract its inner tissue.<ref>Pricer, John. The Life History of the Carpenter Ant. Biological Bulletin , Vol. 14, No. 3 (Feb., 1908), pp. 177-218</ref>  The ants can forage individually or in small or large groups, though they often opt to do so individually. Different colonies in close proximity may have overlapping foraging regions, although they typically do not assist each other in foraging. Their main food sources normally include [[proteins]] and [[carbohydrates]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yamamoto |first1=Marcela |last2=Del-Claro |first2=Kleber |last-author-amp=yes |title=Natural history and foraging behavior of the carpenter ant ''Camponotus sericeiventris'' Gu\u00e9rin, 1838 (Formicinae, Campotonini) in the Brazilian tropical savanna |journal=Acta Ethologica |date=2008 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=55\u201365 |doi=10.1007/s10211-008-0041-6}}</ref>\nInstances of carpenter ants bleeding Chinese elm trees for the sap have been observed in the northern Arizona region.

They use biochemical [[pheromones]] to mark the shortest path that can be taken from the nest to the source. When a sizable number of workers follows this trail, the strength of the cue increases and a foraging trail is established. This ends when the food source is depleted. The workers will then feed the queen and the larvae by consuming the food they have found, and regurgitating the food at the nest. Foraging trails can either be under or above ground.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dreisig |first1=H. |title=Defense by exploitation in the Florida carpenter ant, ''Camponotus floridanus'', at an extrafloral nectar resource |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=2000 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=274\u2013279 |doi=10.1007/s002650050666}}</ref>\n\nAlthough carpenter ants do not tend to be extremely aggressive, they have developed mechanisms to maximize their provision from a food source when that same food source is visited by a competing organism. This is accomplished in different ways. Sometimes they colonize an area near a relatively static food supply. More often, they develop a systemic way to visit the food source with alternating trips by different individual ants or groups.  This allows them to decrease the gains of intruders because the intruders tend to visit in a scattered, random, and unorganized manner. The ants, however, visit the sources systematically such that they lower the mean standing crop. They tend to visit more resource-dense food areas in an attempt to minimize resource availability for others. That is, the more systematic the foraging behavior of the ants, the more random that of its competitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pesthqtownsville.com.au/carpenter-ants-systematic-foraging/|title=Carpenter Ants: 3 Consistent Patterns That Make Their Competition's Foraging More Unpredictable|last=|first=|date=1999|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915015311/http://pesthqtownsville.com.au/carpenter-ants-systematic-foraging/|archive-date=2016-09-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nContrary to popular belief, carpenter ants do not actually eat wood because they are unable to digest [[cellulose]].

These nests are called primary nests. Satellite nests are constructed once the primary nest is established and has begun to mature. Residents of satellite nests include older [[larvae]], pupae, and some winged individuals. Only eggs, the newly hatched [[larvae]], workers, and the queen reside in the primary nests. As satellite nests do not have environmentally sensitive eggs, the ants can construct them in rather diverse locations that can actually be relatively dry.<ref name=\"Paras\"/> Some species, like ''[[Camponotus vagus]]'', builds the nest in a dry place, usually in wood.\n\n====Nuptial flight====\nWhen conditions are warm and humid, winged males and females participate in a [[nuptial flight]]. They emerge from their satellite nests and females mate with a number of males while in flight. The males die after mating. These newly fertilized queens discard their wings and search for new areas to establish primary nests. The queens build new nests and deposit around 20 eggs, nurturing them as they grow until worker ants emerge. The worker ants eventually assist her in caring for the brood as she lays more eggs. After a few years, reproductive winged ants are born, allowing for the making of new colonies. Again, satellite nests will be established and the process will repeat itself.<ref name=\"Paras\">Pararas&nbsp;\u2014 Carayannis, Carolyn. \"Carpenter Ants\". Colony Behaviors of Carpenter Ants. Web. October 1, 2013.</ref>\n\n===Relatedness===\n[[Relatedness]] is the probability that a gene in one individual is an identical copy, by descent, of a gene in another individual. It is essentially a measure of how closely related two individuals are with respect to a gene. It is quantified by the coefficient of relatedness, which is a number between zero and one. The larger the value, the more two individuals are \"related\". Carpenter ants are social hymenopteran insects. This means the relatedness between offspring and parents is disproportionate. Females are more closely related to their sisters than they are to their offspring. Between full sisters, the coefficient of relatedness is ''r'' > 0.75 (due to their [[haplodiploid]] genetic system).<!-- <ref>{{cite journal|jstor=671994|title=Journey to Horseshoe Bend by T. G. H. Strehlow}}</ref> This ref has nothing to do with relatedness-->{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Between parent and offspring, the coefficient of relatedness is ''r'' = 0.5, because, given the event in meiosis,  a certain gene has a 50% chance of  being passed on to the offspring. The level of relatedness is an important dictator of individual interactions.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Kin recognition===\nAccording to [[Hamilton's rule]] for relatedness, for relative-specific interactions to occur, such as kin [[altruism]], a high level of relatedness is necessary between two individuals. Carpenter ants, like many social insect species, have mechanisms by which individuals determine whether others are nestmates or not. They are useful because they explain the presence or absence of altruistic behavior between individuals. They also act as evolutionary strategies to help prevent [[incest]] and promote kin selection.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-1053-2_11|isbn=978-1-4612-8311-9|chapter=Kin Recognition Using Innate Labels: A Central Role for Piggybacking?|title=Invertebrate Historecognition|year=1988|last1=Crozier|first1=Ross H.|pages=143\u2013156}}</ref> Social carpenter ants recognize their kin in many ways. These methods of recognition are largely chemical in nature, and include environmental odors, pheromones, \"transferable labels\", and labels from the queen that are distributed to and among nest members.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Carlin|first1=Norman F.|last2=Schwartz|first2=Peter H.|title=Pre-imaginal experience and nestmate brood recognition in the carpenter ant, ''Camponotus floridanus''|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=July 1989|volume=38|issue=1|pages=89\u201395|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(89)80068-5}}</ref> Because they have a chemical basis for emission and recognition, odors are useful because many ants can detect such changes in their environment through their antennae.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carlin |first1=N.

First, a cue must be present on a \"donor animal\". These cues are called \"labels\". Next, the receiving animal must be able to recognize and process the cue. In order for an individual carpenter ant to be recognized as a nestmate, it must, as an adult, go through specific interactions with older members of the nest.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\" /> This process is also necessary in order for the ant to recognize and distinguish other individuals. If these interactions do not occur in the beginning of adult life, the ant will be unable to be distinguished as a nestmate and unable to distinguish nestmates.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ontogeny of nestmate recognition cues in the red carpenter ant (''Camponotus floridanus'') |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=22|issue=3|page=175|doi=10.1007/BF00300567|year=1988|last1=Morel|first1=Laurence|last2=Vander Meer|first2=Robert K.|last3=Lavine|first3=Barry K.}}</ref>\n\n===Kin altruism===\nRecognition allows for the presence of kin-specific interactions, such as kin altruism. Altruistic individuals increase other individuals' fitness at the expense of their own fitness. Carpenter ants perform altruistic actions toward their nestmates so that their shared genes are propagated more readily or more often. In many social insect species like these ants, many worker animals are sterile and do not have the ability to reproduce. As a result, they forgo reproduction to donate energy and help the fertile individuals reproduce.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Pheromones===\nAs in most other social insect species, individual interaction is heavily influenced by the queen. The queen can influence individuals with odors called [[pheromones]], which can have different effects. Some pheromones have been known to calm workers, while others have been known to excite them. Pheromonal cues from ovipositing queens have a stronger effect on worker ants than those of virgin queens.<ref>H.G. Fowler and R. B. Roberts Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, Vol. 55, No. 3 (July 1982), pp. 568\u2013570</ref>\n\n===Social immunity===\nIn many social insect species, social behavior can increase the disease resistance of animals. This phenomenon, called [[social immunity]], exists in carpenter ants. It is mediated through the feeding of other individuals by regurgitation. The regurgitate can have antimicrobial activity, which would be spread amongst members of the colony. Some [[proteases]] with antimicrobial activity have been found to exist in regurgitated material. Communal sharing of immune response capability is likely to play a large role in colonial maintenance during highly pathogenic periods.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20591850|pmc=3030872|title=Trophallaxis and prophylaxis: social immunity in the carpenter ant ''Camponotus pennsylvanicus''|journal=Biology Letters|volume=7|issue=1|pages=89\u201392|year=2011|last1=Hamilton|first1=C|last2=Lejeune|first2=B.

B.|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2010.0466}}</ref>\n\n===Polygyny===\n[[Polygyny]] often is associated with many social insect species, and usually is characterized by limited mating flights, small queen size, and other characteristics.  However, carpenter ants have \"extensive\" mating flights and relatively large queens, distinguishing them from polygynous species. Carpenter ants are described as oligogynous because they have a number of fertile queens which are intolerant of each other and must therefore spread to different areas of the nest. Some aggressive interactions have been known to take place between queens, but not necessarily through workers. Queens become aggressive mainly to other queens if they trespass on a marked territory. Queens in a given colony can work together in brood care<ref name=\"Carpenter Ants 1994 pp. 1\u20139\" /> and the workers tend to experience higher rates of survival in colonies with multiple queens. Some researchers still subscribe to the notion that carpenter ant colonies are only monogynous.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Oligogyny by unrelated queens in the carpenter ant, ''Camponotus ligniperdus''|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=44|pages=23\u201333|doi=10.1007/s002650050511|jstor=4601542|year=1998|last1=Gadau|first1=J\u00fcrgen|last2=Gertsch|first2=Pia J.|last3=Heinze|first3=J\u00fcrgen|last4=Pamilo|first4=Pekka|last5=H\u00f6lldobler|first5=Bert|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n==Exploding ants==\nIn at least nine [[Southeast Asia]]n species of the ''[[Camponotus cylindricus|Cylindricus]]'' complex, including ''[[Camponotus saundersi]]'', workers feature greatly enlarged mandibular glands that run the entire length of the ant's body.

They can leave behind a [[sawdust]]-like material called [[frass]] that provides clues to their nesting location. Carpenter ant galleries are smooth and very different from [[termite]]-damaged areas, which have mud packed into the hollowed-out areas. Carpenter ants can be identified by the general presence of one upward protruding node, looking like a spike, at the \"waist\" attachment between the thorax and abdomen (petiole). Control involves application of insecticides in various forms including dusts and liquids. The dusts are injected directly into galleries and voids where the carpenter ants are living. The liquids are applied in areas where foraging ants are likely to pick the material up and spread the poison to the colony upon returning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.backedbybayer.com/~/media/BackedByBayer/Product%20Labels%20-%20pdf/Maxforce%20Carpenter%20Ant%20Bait%20Gel.ashx|title=Maxforce Carpenter Ant Bait Gel Directions for Use|access-date=14 Aug 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814200959/https://www.backedbybayer.com/~/media/BackedByBayer/Product%20Labels%20-%20pdf/Maxforce%20Carpenter%20Ant%20Bait%20Gel.ashx|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===As food===\n[[File:Honey Ants (7344580116).jpg|thumb|Honeypot ants in [[Northern Territory]], Australia]]\nCarpenter ants and their larvae are eaten in various parts of the world.

They cut \"galleries\" into the wood grain to provide passageways to allow for movement between different sections of the nest. Certain parts of a house, such as around and under windows, roof eaves, decks and porches, are more likely to be infested by carpenter ants because these areas are most vulnerable to moisture.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n[[File:Carpenter ants carrying a dead bee.jpg|thumb|Carpenter ants carrying a dead [[bee]]]]\nCarpenter ants have been known to construct extensive underground tunneling systems. These systems often lead to an end at some food source&nbsp;\u2013 often aphid colonies, where the ants extract and feed on honeydew. These tunneling systems also often exist in trees. The colonies typically include a central \"parent\" colony surrounded and supplemented by smaller satellite colonies.<ref name=\"Carpenter Ants 1994 pp. 1\u20139\">Colony Size and Polygyny in Carpenter Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Roger D.

These ants are foragers that typically eat parts of other dead insects or substances derived from other insects. Common foods for them include insect parts, \"honeydew\" produced by aphids, or [[Extrafloral nectary|extrafloral nectar]] from plants. They are also known for eating other sugary liquids such as honey, syrup, or juices. Carpenter ants can increase the survivability of [[aphids]] when they tend them. They tend many aphid species but can also express preference for specific ones.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMost species of carpenter ants forage at night. When foraging, they usually collect and consume dead insects. Some species less commonly collect live insects. When they discover a dead insect, workers surround it and extract its bodily fluids to be carried back to the nest. The remaining chitin-based shell is left behind. Occasionally, the ants bring the chitinous head of the insect back to the nest, where they also extract its inner tissue.<ref>Pricer, John. The Life History of the Carpenter Ant. Biological Bulletin , Vol. 14, No. 3 (Feb., 1908), pp. 177-218</ref>  The ants can forage individually or in small or large groups, though they often opt to do so individually. Different colonies in close proximity may have overlapping foraging regions, although they typically do not assist each other in foraging.

They use biochemical [[pheromones]] to mark the shortest path that can be taken from the nest to the source. When a sizable number of workers follows this trail, the strength of the cue increases and a foraging trail is established. This ends when the food source is depleted. The workers will then feed the queen and the larvae by consuming the food they have found, and regurgitating the food at the nest. Foraging trails can either be under or above ground.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dreisig |first1=H. |title=Defense by exploitation in the Florida carpenter ant, ''Camponotus floridanus'', at an extrafloral nectar resource |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=2000 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=274\u2013279 |doi=10.1007/s002650050666}}</ref>\n\nAlthough carpenter ants do not tend to be extremely aggressive, they have developed mechanisms to maximize their provision from a food source when that same food source is visited by a competing organism. This is accomplished in different ways. Sometimes they colonize an area near a relatively static food supply. More often, they develop a systemic way to visit the food source with alternating trips by different individual ants or groups.  This allows them to decrease the gains of intruders because the intruders tend to visit in a scattered, random, and unorganized manner. The ants, however, visit the sources systematically such that they lower the mean standing crop. They tend to visit more resource-dense food areas in an attempt to minimize resource availability for others. That is, the more systematic the foraging behavior of the ants, the more random that of its competitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pesthqtownsville.com.au/carpenter-ants-systematic-foraging/|title=Carpenter Ants: 3 Consistent Patterns That Make Their Competition's Foraging More Unpredictable|last=|first=|date=1999|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915015311/http://pesthqtownsville.com.au/carpenter-ants-systematic-foraging/|archive-date=2016-09-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nContrary to popular belief, carpenter ants do not actually eat wood because they are unable to digest [[cellulose]].

These nests are called primary nests. Satellite nests are constructed once the primary nest is established and has begun to mature. Residents of satellite nests include older [[larvae]], pupae, and some winged individuals. Only eggs, the newly hatched [[larvae]], workers, and the queen reside in the primary nests. As satellite nests do not have environmentally sensitive eggs, the ants can construct them in rather diverse locations that can actually be relatively dry.<ref name=\"Paras\"/> Some species, like ''[[Camponotus vagus]]'', builds the nest in a dry place, usually in wood.\n\n====Nuptial flight====\nWhen conditions are warm and humid, winged males and females participate in a [[nuptial flight]]. They emerge from their satellite nests and females mate with a number of males while in flight. The males die after mating. These newly fertilized queens discard their wings and search for new areas to establish primary nests. The queens build new nests and deposit around 20 eggs, nurturing them as they grow until worker ants emerge. The worker ants eventually assist her in caring for the brood as she lays more eggs. After a few years, reproductive winged ants are born, allowing for the making of new colonies. Again, satellite nests will be established and the process will repeat itself.<ref name=\"Paras\">Pararas&nbsp;\u2014 Carayannis, Carolyn. \"Carpenter Ants\". Colony Behaviors of Carpenter Ants. Web. October 1, 2013.</ref>\n\n===Relatedness===\n[[Relatedness]] is the probability that a gene in one individual is an identical copy, by descent, of a gene in another individual. It is essentially a measure of how closely related two individuals are with respect to a gene. It is quantified by the coefficient of relatedness, which is a number between zero and one. The larger the value, the more two individuals are \"related\". Carpenter ants are social hymenopteran insects. This means the relatedness between offspring and parents is disproportionate. Females are more closely related to their sisters than they are to their offspring. Between full sisters, the coefficient of relatedness is ''r'' > 0.75 (due to their [[haplodiploid]] genetic system).<!-- <ref>{{cite journal|jstor=671994|title=Journey to Horseshoe Bend by T. G. H. Strehlow}}</ref> This ref has nothing to do with relatedness-->{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Between parent and offspring, the coefficient of relatedness is ''r'' = 0.5, because, given the event in meiosis,  a certain gene has a 50% chance of  being passed on to the offspring. The level of relatedness is an important dictator of individual interactions.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Kin recognition===\nAccording to [[Hamilton's rule]] for relatedness, for relative-specific interactions to occur, such as kin [[altruism]], a high level of relatedness is necessary between two individuals. Carpenter ants, like many social insect species, have mechanisms by which individuals determine whether others are nestmates or not. They are useful because they explain the presence or absence of altruistic behavior between individuals. They also act as evolutionary strategies to help prevent [[incest]] and promote kin selection.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-1053-2_11|isbn=978-1-4612-8311-9|chapter=Kin Recognition Using Innate Labels: A Central Role for Piggybacking?|title=Invertebrate Historecognition|year=1988|last1=Crozier|first1=Ross H.|pages=143\u2013156}}</ref> Social carpenter ants recognize their kin in many ways.

First, a cue must be present on a \"donor animal\". These cues are called \"labels\". Next, the receiving animal must be able to recognize and process the cue. In order for an individual carpenter ant to be recognized as a nestmate, it must, as an adult, go through specific interactions with older members of the nest.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\" /> This process is also necessary in order for the ant to recognize and distinguish other individuals. If these interactions do not occur in the beginning of adult life, the ant will be unable to be distinguished as a nestmate and unable to distinguish nestmates.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ontogeny of nestmate recognition cues in the red carpenter ant (''Camponotus floridanus'') |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=22|issue=3|page=175|doi=10.1007/BF00300567|year=1988|last1=Morel|first1=Laurence|last2=Vander Meer|first2=Robert K.|last3=Lavine|first3=Barry K.}}</ref>\n\n===Kin altruism===\nRecognition allows for the presence of kin-specific interactions, such as kin altruism. Altruistic individuals increase other individuals' fitness at the expense of their own fitness. Carpenter ants perform altruistic actions toward their nestmates so that their shared genes are propagated more readily or more often. In many social insect species like these ants, many worker animals are sterile and do not have the ability to reproduce. As a result, they forgo reproduction to donate energy and help the fertile individuals reproduce.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Pheromones===\nAs in most other social insect species, individual interaction is heavily influenced by the queen. The queen can influence individuals with odors called [[pheromones]], which can have different effects. Some pheromones have been known to calm workers, while others have been known to excite them. Pheromonal cues from ovipositing queens have a stronger effect on worker ants than those of virgin queens.<ref>H.G. Fowler and R. B. Roberts Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, Vol. 55, No. 3 (July 1982), pp. 568\u2013570</ref>\n\n===Social immunity===\nIn many social insect species, social behavior can increase the disease resistance of animals. This phenomenon, called [[social immunity]], exists in carpenter ants. It is mediated through the feeding of other individuals by regurgitation. The regurgitate can have antimicrobial activity, which would be spread amongst members of the colony. Some [[proteases]] with antimicrobial activity have been found to exist in regurgitated material. Communal sharing of immune response capability is likely to play a large role in colonial maintenance during highly pathogenic periods.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=20591850|pmc=3030872|title=Trophallaxis and prophylaxis: social immunity in the carpenter ant ''Camponotus pennsylvanicus''|journal=Biology Letters|volume=7|issue=1|pages=89\u201392|year=2011|last1=Hamilton|first1=C|last2=Lejeune|first2=B.

B.|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2010.0466}}</ref>\n\n===Polygyny===\n[[Polygyny]] often is associated with many social insect species, and usually is characterized by limited mating flights, small queen size, and other characteristics.  However, carpenter ants have \"extensive\" mating flights and relatively large queens, distinguishing them from polygynous species. Carpenter ants are described as oligogynous because they have a number of fertile queens which are intolerant of each other and must therefore spread to different areas of the nest. Some aggressive interactions have been known to take place between queens, but not necessarily through workers. Queens become aggressive mainly to other queens if they trespass on a marked territory.

They can leave behind a [[sawdust]]-like material called [[frass]] that provides clues to their nesting location. Carpenter ant galleries are smooth and very different from [[termite]]-damaged areas, which have mud packed into the hollowed-out areas. Carpenter ants can be identified by the general presence of one upward protruding node, looking like a spike, at the \"waist\" attachment between the thorax and abdomen (petiole). Control involves application of insecticides in various forms including dusts and liquids. The dusts are injected directly into galleries and voids where the carpenter ants are living. The liquids are applied in areas where foraging ants are likely to pick the material up and spread the poison to the colony upon returning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.backedbybayer.com/~/media/BackedByBayer/Product%20Labels%20-%20pdf/Maxforce%20Carpenter%20Ant%20Bait%20Gel.ashx|title=Maxforce Carpenter Ant Bait Gel Directions for Use|access-date=14 Aug 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814200959/https://www.backedbybayer.com/~/media/BackedByBayer/Product%20Labels%20-%20pdf/Maxforce%20Carpenter%20Ant%20Bait%20Gel.ashx|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===As food===\n[[File:Honey Ants (7344580116).jpg|thumb|Honeypot ants in [[Northern Territory]], Australia]]\nCarpenter ants and their larvae are eaten in various parts of the world.

Williams'' ===\nThe inevitable discovery doctrine was first adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\":3\">Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984).</ref> <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=LaFave|first=Wayne|title=Criminal Procedure|publisher=West|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=636}}</ref> In that case, Williams, the defendant, challenged the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] of evidence about the location and condition of the victim's body, given that it had been obtained from him in violation of his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to counsel. The Court held that the evidence was admissible because law enforcement would \"inevitably\" have discovered the body even without Williams' statements, because a massive search had been underway in the very location where the body was ultimately found.<ref name=\":4\">Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 436-44.</ref> Prior to ''Nix v. Williams'', an inevitable discovery rule had been recognized in the \"vast majority\" of both state and federal courts.<ref name=\":4\" /> In its opinion, the Court formally adopt the rule as part of its own jurisprudence.\n\n=== Rationale for the Doctrine ===\nIn adopting the inevitable discovery doctrine in ''Nix'', the Supreme Court discussed the basic reasoning underlying the doctrine. The rationale behind the inevitable discovery exception is the flip side to that underlying the [[exclusionary rule]]\u2014the exclusionary rule's purpose is to deter police from violating constitutional and statutory rights. In other words, it functions to make sure the police should not be put in a ''better'' place than they would have been had they refrained from illegal conduct. At the same time, there are countervailing interests on the other side of the balance\u2014most importantly, the public interest in having access to all [[probative]] evidence of a crime and not allowing guilty individuals to go free. The inevitable discovery doctrine gives force to that other side of the balance by rendering evidence admissible when it would simply put police in the ''same'' position they would have been in had they exclusively used lawful means.<ref name=\":3\" /> If the government can establish that the illegal act was irrelevant to its ability to ultimately obtain the evidence, then \"the deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be received.\"<ref name=\":5\">Nix v. Williams, 700 F.2d 1164, 1166, 1169 n.5 (8th Cir. 1983).</ref>\n\n== Applicability of and Limitations on the Inevitable Discovery Doctrine ==\n\n=== Burden and Standard of Proof ===\nIn ''Nix,'' the Court established that the prosecution bears the burden of establishing, by a [[preponderance of the evidence]], that discovery of the evidence would have been inevitable.\n\nThe defendant had argued for the higher [[clear and convincing evidence]] standard, but the Court explained that preponderance of the evidence is the normal burden of proof applied when it comes to admissibility of evidence, and there was no reason to depart from that for inevitable discovery.<ref>Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 444 & n.5.</ref>\n\nIn [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]], Justice Brennan argued that even though only a preponderance of the evidence is required for the [[Independent source doctrine|independent source rule]] to apply, that the government should have to present clear and convincing evidence to avail itself of the inevitable discovery exception. He pointed out that when the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] seeks to use the independent source exception, they have in fact, obtained the evidence by lawful means after having obtained it first by unlawful means. Meanwhile, with inevitable discovery, it is merely ''hypothetical'' whether the officers could have obtained the evidence by lawful means. Given the inherently speculative nature of inevitable discovery, Justice Brennan would have demanded that the prosecution satisfy a clear and convincing standard before being allowed to use the evidence.<ref>Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 458-60.</ref> (See below for a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the inevitable discovery and independent source doctrines.)\n\n=== Relevance of Good/Bad Faith ===\nThe Court also took ''Nix'' as an opportunity to resolve a point of contention with regard to the relevance of [[bad faith]] to applicability of the inevitable discovery doctrine.\n\nIn the lower court proceedings in ''Nix,'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] had adopted a version of the rule that would require the state to not only show that the evidence would inevitably have been discovered, but also that the police did not act in bad faith, i.e., with the intention of committing misconduct. It reasoned that without an absence-of-bad-faith requirement (in other words, a \"good faith\" requirement), \"the temptation to risk deliberate violations of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] would be too great.\"<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe Court rejected that view, holding that no showing of good faith is required for the state to take advantage of the inevitable discovery exception. The Court reasoned that it is unrealistic to think that a police officer faced with the possibility of obtaining evidence illegally would, in the moment, make the calculation of whether a court would conclude that the evidence would have been inevitably discovered; it also noted that the risk of [[civil liability]] and departmental discipline would also disincentivize police from engaging in such misconduct.<ref>Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 445-46.</ref>\n\n=== Applicability to Primary vs. Derivative Evidence ===\n''Nix'' itself concerned the admissibility of \"derivative evidence,\" or evidence that was not the ''direct'' result of an illegal act, but that was the product of a chain of events beginning with the illegal act\u2014also known as \"[[fruit of the poisonous tree]].\" Evidence that was directly obtained via the illegal act is referred to as \"primary evidence.\"\n\nThe Court in ''Nix'' did not make explicit whether the inevitable discovery doctrine applied to just derivative evidence or primary evidence as well, and in the years immediately following ''Nix'', the lower courts diverged greatly on this issue.<ref>Jessica Forbes, ''The Inevitable Discovery Exception, Primary Evidence, and the Emasculation of the Fourth Amendment'', 55 Ford. L. Rev. 1221, 1224-25 (1987).</ref> In 1988, however, the Supreme Court held in ''[[Murray v. United States]]'' that the related [[Independent source doctrine|independent source exception]] applies to not only derivative, but also primary, evidence.<ref>Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533, 540-41 (1988).</ref> Since then, most lower courts have held that the inevitable discovery doctrine also applies to both primary and derivative evidence.<ref>''See, e.g.'', United States v. Ochoa, 667 F.3d 643 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. White, 326 F.3d 1135 (10th Cir. 2003); United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971 (1st Cir. 1994).</ref><ref name=\":7\">Troy E. Golden, ''The Inevitable Discovery Doctrine Today: The Demands of the Fourth Amendment'', Nix, ''and'' Murray, ''and the Disagreement Among the Federal Circuits'', 13 BYU J. Pub. L. 97 (1998).</ref> A few, however, have maintained that the inevitable discovery doctrine does not extend to evidence obtained directly as a result of the unconstitutional act\u2014for example, in ''United States v. Polanco'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] interpreted ''Nix'' as implying that the inevitable discovery doctrine does not \"allow admission of the unconstitutional inculpatory statement itself.\"<ref>United States v. Polanco, 93 F.3d 555, 561 (9th Cir. 1996).</ref>\n\n=== Debate over Active Pursuit Requirement ===\nThere is a split among the lower federal courts as to whether the inevitable discovery doctrine can only be applied when the investigation that inevitably would have led to the discovery was already underway when the illegality had occurred, or whether the government's claim that they ''would have'' initiated such an investigation is sufficient.<ref>68 Am. Jur. 2d Searches and Seizures \u00a7 174</ref><ref>Stephen E. Hessler, ''Establishing Inevitability Without Active Pursuit: Defining the Inevitable Discovery Exception to the Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule'', 99 Mich. L. Rev. 238, 244-45 (2000).</ref> For instance, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] has required that \"the government was actively pursuing a substantial, alternative line of investigation at the time of the constitutional violation\" for the exception to apply.<ref>United States v. Conner, 127 F.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir. 1997).</ref><ref>''See also'' United States v. Satterfield, 743 F.2d 827 (11th Cir. 1984) (Eleventh Circuit applying the active pursuit rule).</ref> Meanwhile, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit]] has established that \"the inevitable discovery exception applies whenever an independent investigation inevitably would have led to discovery of the evidence, whether or not the investigation was ongoing at the time of the illegal police conduct.\"<ref>United States v. Larsen, 127 F.3d 984, 986 (10th Cir. 1997).</ref><ref>''See also'' United States v. Kennedy, 61 F.3d 494 (6th Cir. 1995) (Sixth Circuit rejecting the active pursuit rule).</ref> In the Tenth Circuit case of ''United States v. Cunningham'', the defendant objected that evidence obtained from his house indicating that he was guilty of counterfeit check-writing should be suppressed because the police had no [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] and his consent to the search was coerced. Even though the police were not in the process of getting a warrant at the time of the search (they had abandoned plans to obtain a warrant in favor of continuing surveillance), the court held that the officers inevitably would have been able to obtain a warrant to search the house, and thus, were entitled to the exception.<ref>United States v. Cunningham, 413 F.3d 1199, 1203-05 (10th Cir. 2005).</ref>\n\n=== Routine vs. Non-Routine Investigatory Procedures ===\nLower federal courts have most readily applied the inevitable discovery doctrine in cases where the means the police claim would have inevitably led to the evidence are routine procedures, like an [[inventory search]].<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, in ''United States v. Almeida,'' the defendant objected that the counterfeit bills seized from his wallet were the product of an illegal search; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit]] concluded that the bills would inevitably have been discovered according to routine procedure, as the defendant had already been arrested for presenting false identification and it was the jail's standard practice to remove and fully search any arrestee's possessions.<ref>United States v. Almeida, 748 F.3d 41, 49 (1st Cir. 2014).</ref> And in ''United States v. Melgar'', the Fourth Circuit held that even though the defendant had revealed his illegal alien status in an interrogation that violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the government would inevitably have discovered his illegal status via a routine computer check on his false identification card.<ref>United States v. Melgar, 139 F.3d 1005, 1016 n.3 (4th Cir. 1998).</ref>\n\nMore difficult cases arise when law enforcement claim that they would have come across the evidence via a non-routine investigatory procedure.<ref name=\":1\" /> For instance, in ''United States v. Infante-Ruiz'', the defendant sought to suppress evidence of a firearm that officers had found while searching a briefcase in the trunk of a rental car he was a passenger in, after arresting him on outstanding, unrelated narcotics charges. The First Circuit held that the police would not have inevitably discovered the firearm because there was no routine or policy of seizing and searching a rental car in which the arrestee was merely a passenger.<ref>United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 503-04 (1st Cir. 1994).</ref>\n\n=== Applicability Across Amendments ===\nMost commonly, the inevitable discovery doctrine is used to bring in evidence despite an illegal search or seizure in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].<ref>U.S. Const. amend. IV.</ref> But it also may apply to unconstitutional conduct in violation of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination<ref>U.S. Const. amend.

John E. Fennelly, ''Refinement of the Inevitable Discovery Exception: The Need for a Good Faith Requirement'', 17 Wm. Mitchell L.

Williams'' ===\nThe inevitable discovery doctrine was first adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\":3\">Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984).</ref> <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=LaFave|first=Wayne|title=Criminal Procedure|publisher=West|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=636}}</ref> In that case, Williams, the defendant, challenged the [[Admissible evidence|admissibility]] of evidence about the location and condition of the victim's body, given that it had been obtained from him in violation of his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to counsel. The Court held that the evidence was admissible because law enforcement would \"inevitably\" have discovered the body even without Williams' statements, because a massive search had been underway in the very location where the body was ultimately found.<ref name=\":4\">Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 436-44.</ref> Prior to ''Nix v. Williams'', an inevitable discovery rule had been recognized in the \"vast majority\" of both state and federal courts.<ref name=\":4\" /> In its opinion, the Court formally adopt the rule as part of its own jurisprudence.\n\n=== Rationale for the Doctrine ===\nIn adopting the inevitable discovery doctrine in ''Nix'', the Supreme Court discussed the basic reasoning underlying the doctrine. The rationale behind the inevitable discovery exception is the flip side to that underlying the [[exclusionary rule]]\u2014the exclusionary rule's purpose is to deter police from violating constitutional and statutory rights. In other words, it functions to make sure the police should not be put in a ''better'' place than they would have been had they refrained from illegal conduct. At the same time, there are countervailing interests on the other side of the balance\u2014most importantly, the public interest in having access to all [[probative]] evidence of a crime and not allowing guilty individuals to go free. The inevitable discovery doctrine gives force to that other side of the balance by rendering evidence admissible when it would simply put police in the ''same'' position they would have been in had they exclusively used lawful means.<ref name=\":3\" /> If the government can establish that the illegal act was irrelevant to its ability to ultimately obtain the evidence, then \"the deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be received.\"<ref name=\":5\">Nix v. Williams, 700 F.2d 1164, 1166, 1169 n.5 (8th Cir. 1983).</ref>\n\n== Applicability of and Limitations on the Inevitable Discovery Doctrine ==\n\n=== Burden and Standard of Proof ===\nIn ''Nix,'' the Court established that the prosecution bears the burden of establishing, by a [[preponderance of the evidence]], that discovery of the evidence would have been inevitable.\n\nThe defendant had argued for the higher [[clear and convincing evidence]] standard, but the Court explained that preponderance of the evidence is the normal burden of proof applied when it comes to admissibility of evidence, and there was no reason to depart from that for inevitable discovery.<ref>Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 444 & n.5.</ref>\n\nIn [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]], Justice Brennan argued that even though only a preponderance of the evidence is required for the [[Independent source doctrine|independent source rule]] to apply, that the government should have to present clear and convincing evidence to avail itself of the inevitable discovery exception. He pointed out that when the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] seeks to use the independent source exception, they have in fact, obtained the evidence by lawful means after having obtained it first by unlawful means. Meanwhile, with inevitable discovery, it is merely ''hypothetical'' whether the officers could have obtained the evidence by lawful means. Given the inherently speculative nature of inevitable discovery, Justice Brennan would have demanded that the prosecution satisfy a clear and convincing standard before being allowed to use the evidence.<ref>Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 458-60.</ref> (See below for a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the inevitable discovery and independent source doctrines.)\n\n=== Relevance of Good/Bad Faith ===\nThe Court also took ''Nix'' as an opportunity to resolve a point of contention with regard to the relevance of [[bad faith]] to applicability of the inevitable discovery doctrine.\n\nIn the lower court proceedings in ''Nix,'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] had adopted a version of the rule that would require the state to not only show that the evidence would inevitably have been discovered, but also that the police did not act in bad faith, i.e., with the intention of committing misconduct. It reasoned that without an absence-of-bad-faith requirement (in other words, a \"good faith\" requirement), \"the temptation to risk deliberate violations of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] would be too great.\"<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe Court rejected that view, holding that no showing of good faith is required for the state to take advantage of the inevitable discovery exception. The Court reasoned that it is unrealistic to think that a police officer faced with the possibility of obtaining evidence illegally would, in the moment, make the calculation of whether a court would conclude that the evidence would have been inevitably discovered; it also noted that the risk of [[civil liability]] and departmental discipline would also disincentivize police from engaging in such misconduct.<ref>Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. at 445-46.</ref>\n\n=== Applicability to Primary vs. Derivative Evidence ===\n''Nix'' itself concerned the admissibility of \"derivative evidence,\" or evidence that was not the ''direct'' result of an illegal act, but that was the product of a chain of events beginning with the illegal act\u2014also known as \"[[fruit of the poisonous tree]].\" Evidence that was directly obtained via the illegal act is referred to as \"primary evidence.\"\n\nThe Court in ''Nix'' did not make explicit whether the inevitable discovery doctrine applied to just derivative evidence or primary evidence as well, and in the years immediately following ''Nix'', the lower courts diverged greatly on this issue.<ref>Jessica Forbes, ''The Inevitable Discovery Exception, Primary Evidence, and the Emasculation of the Fourth Amendment'', 55 Ford. L. Rev. 1221, 1224-25 (1987).</ref> In 1988, however, the Supreme Court held in ''[[Murray v. United States]]'' that the related [[Independent source doctrine|independent source exception]] applies to not only derivative, but also primary, evidence.<ref>Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533, 540-41 (1988).</ref> Since then, most lower courts have held that the inevitable discovery doctrine also applies to both primary and derivative evidence.<ref>''See, e.g.'', United States v. Ochoa, 667 F.3d 643 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. White, 326 F.3d 1135 (10th Cir. 2003); United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971 (1st Cir. 1994).</ref><ref name=\":7\">Troy E.

L. 97 (1998).</ref> A few, however, have maintained that the inevitable discovery doctrine does not extend to evidence obtained directly as a result of the unconstitutional act\u2014for example, in ''United States v. Polanco'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] interpreted ''Nix'' as implying that the inevitable discovery doctrine does not \"allow admission of the unconstitutional inculpatory statement itself.\"<ref>United States v. Polanco, 93 F.3d 555, 561 (9th Cir. 1996).</ref>\n\n=== Debate over Active Pursuit Requirement ===\nThere is a split among the lower federal courts as to whether the inevitable discovery doctrine can only be applied when the investigation that inevitably would have led to the discovery was already underway when the illegality had occurred, or whether the government's claim that they ''would have'' initiated such an investigation is sufficient.<ref>68 Am. Jur. 2d Searches and Seizures \u00a7 174</ref><ref>Stephen E. Hessler, ''Establishing Inevitability Without Active Pursuit: Defining the Inevitable Discovery Exception to the Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule'', 99 Mich. L. Rev. 238, 244-45 (2000).</ref> For instance, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] has required that \"the government was actively pursuing a substantial, alternative line of investigation at the time of the constitutional violation\" for the exception to apply.<ref>United States v. Conner, 127 F.3d 663, 667 (8th Cir. 1997).</ref><ref>''See also'' United States v. Satterfield, 743 F.2d 827 (11th Cir. 1984) (Eleventh Circuit applying the active pursuit rule).</ref> Meanwhile, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit]] has established that \"the inevitable discovery exception applies whenever an independent investigation inevitably would have led to discovery of the evidence, whether or not the investigation was ongoing at the time of the illegal police conduct.\"<ref>United States v. Larsen, 127 F.3d 984, 986 (10th Cir. 1997).</ref><ref>''See also'' United States v. Kennedy, 61 F.3d 494 (6th Cir. 1995) (Sixth Circuit rejecting the active pursuit rule).</ref> In the Tenth Circuit case of ''United States v. Cunningham'', the defendant objected that evidence obtained from his house indicating that he was guilty of counterfeit check-writing should be suppressed because the police had no [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] and his consent to the search was coerced. Even though the police were not in the process of getting a warrant at the time of the search (they had abandoned plans to obtain a warrant in favor of continuing surveillance), the court held that the officers inevitably would have been able to obtain a warrant to search the house, and thus, were entitled to the exception.<ref>United States v. Cunningham, 413 F.3d 1199, 1203-05 (10th Cir. 2005).</ref>\n\n=== Routine vs. Non-Routine Investigatory Procedures ===\nLower federal courts have most readily applied the inevitable discovery doctrine in cases where the means the police claim would have inevitably led to the evidence are routine procedures, like an [[inventory search]].<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, in ''United States v. Almeida,'' the defendant objected that the counterfeit bills seized from his wallet were the product of an illegal search; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit]] concluded that the bills would inevitably have been discovered according to routine procedure, as the defendant had already been arrested for presenting false identification and it was the jail's standard practice to remove and fully search any arrestee's possessions.<ref>United States v. Almeida, 748 F.3d 41, 49 (1st Cir. 2014).</ref> And in ''United States v. Melgar'', the Fourth Circuit held that even though the defendant had revealed his illegal alien status in an interrogation that violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the government would inevitably have discovered his illegal status via a routine computer check on his false identification card.<ref>United States v. Melgar, 139 F.3d 1005, 1016 n.3 (4th Cir. 1998).</ref>\n\nMore difficult cases arise when law enforcement claim that they would have come across the evidence via a non-routine investigatory procedure.<ref name=\":1\" /> For instance, in ''United States v. Infante-Ruiz'', the defendant sought to suppress evidence of a firearm that officers had found while searching a briefcase in the trunk of a rental car he was a passenger in, after arresting him on outstanding, unrelated narcotics charges. The First Circuit held that the police would not have inevitably discovered the firearm because there was no routine or policy of seizing and searching a rental car in which the arrestee was merely a passenger.<ref>United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 503-04 (1st Cir. 1994).</ref>\n\n=== Applicability Across Amendments ===\nMost commonly, the inevitable discovery doctrine is used to bring in evidence despite an illegal search or seizure in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].<ref>U.S. Const. amend. IV.</ref> But it also may apply to unconstitutional conduct in violation of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination<ref>U.S. Const. amend.

The Georgia Supreme Court held that the police violated the Fourth Amendment by failing to get a warrant before accessing the vehicle's data and that the inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply: it reasoned that the police had not shown any indication of plans to get a warrant before the data was removed and that the police department had no policy or practice of obtaining such data after a fatal crash.<ref>Mobley v.

The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a '''heart\u2013lung machine''' or \"the pump\". Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by [[perfusionist]]s.  CPB is a form of [[extracorporeal]] circulation. [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] is generally used for longer-term treatment.\n\nCPB mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart\u2013lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a [[cannula]] in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. Venous blood is removed from the body by the cannula and then filtered, cooled or warmed, and oxygenated before it is returned to the body by a mechanical pump. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery, axillary artery, or brachiocephalic artery (among others).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiac surgery in the adult|others=Cohn, Lawrence H., 1937-2016|isbn=978-0-07-184487-1|edition=Fifth|location=New York|oclc=930496902|date = 2017-08-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe patient is administered [[heparin]] to prevent clotting, and [[protamine sulfate]] is given after to reverse effects of heparin.

The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Blausen 0468 Heart-Lung Machine.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of one typical way that a heart-lung machine may be connected to the veins and arteries near the heart.

The technique allows the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient's blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate on the heart.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many operations, such as [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG), the heart is arrested (i.e., stopped) because of the difficulty of operating on the beating heart. Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart, for example, [[mitral valve repair]] or [[Mitral valve replacement|replacement]], requires the use of CPB to avoid engulfing air systemically and to provide a bloodless field to increase visibility for the surgeon. The machine pumps the blood and, using an oxygenator, allows red blood cells to pick up oxygen, as well as allowing carbon dioxide levels to decrease.<ref name=\":2\" /> This mimics the function of the heart and the lungs, respectively.\n\nCPB can be used for the induction of total body [[therapeutic hypothermia|hypothermia]], a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without [[perfusion]] (blood flow).<ref name=\":3\" /> If blood flow is stopped at normal [[body temperature]], permanent [[brain damage]] normally occurs in three to four minutes \u2013 death may follow shortly afterward.

As a consequence, CPB is only used during the several hours a cardiac surgery may take. CPB is known to activate the coagulation cascade and stimulate inflammatory mediators. leading to hemolysis and coagulopathies. This problem worsens as complement proteins build on the membrane oxygenators.<ref name=\":4\" /> For this reason, most oxygenators come with a manufacturer's recommendation that they are only used for a maximum of six hours, although they are sometimes used for up to ten hours, with care being taken to ensure they do not clot off and stop working. For longer periods than this, an [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation|ECMO]] (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is used, which can be in operation for up to 31 days \u2013 such as in a Taiwanese case, for 16 days, after which the patient received a heart transplant.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news126460484.html Man survives 16 days without a heart] United Press International.

The heart-lung blood circulation system and the connection surgery itself release a variety of debris into the bloodstream, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaque. For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli may block blood flow and cause mini strokes.

By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by [[centrifugal force]]. This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to prevent overpressurization, clamping or kinking of lines, and produce less damage to blood products ([[hemolysis]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Roller pump====\nThe pump console usually comprises several rotating motor-driven pumps that [[peristalsis|peristaltically]] \"massage\" tubing.  This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or [[peristaltic pump]]. The pumps are more affordable than their centrifugal counterparts, but are susceptible to overpressurization if the lines become clamped or kinked.<ref name=\":0\" /> They are also more likely to cause a massive air embolism and require constant, close supervision by the perfusionist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Oxygenator===\nThe [[oxygenator]] is designed to add [[oxygen]] to infused [[blood]] and remove some of the [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[venous blood]].  Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using [[bubble oxygenator]]s, but [[membrane oxygenator]]s have supplanted bubble oxygenators since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are that [[membrane oxygenator]]s tend to generate many fewer micro-bubbles, referred to as gaseous microemboli, which is generally considered harmful to the patient <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15\u201326|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> and reduce damage to blood cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: haemocompatibility|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=81\u201398|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> compared to [[bubble oxygenator]]s. More recently, the use of hollow-fiber oxygenators has become more widespread. These derivatives of membrane oxygenators further reduce the occurrence of microemboli by reducing the direct air-blood interface while simultaneously providing adequate gas exchange.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother type of oxygenator gaining favour recently is the heparin-coated blood oxygenator which is believed to produce less systemic inflammation and decrease the propensity for blood to clot in the CPB circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Heat exchangers ===\nBecause hypothermia is frequently used in CPB to reduce metabolic demands (including that of the heart), heat exchangers are implemented to warm and cool blood within the circuit.

A separate heat exchanger is required for the cardiopledgia line.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Cannulae===\nMultiple [[cannula]]e are sewn into the patient's body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery. A venous cannula removes oxygen depleted venous blood from a patient's body. An arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system. The main determinants of cannula size selection is determined by the patient's size and weight, anticipated flow rate, and the size of the vessel being cannulated.<ref name=\":3\" /> A [[cardioplegia]] cannula delivers a cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.\n\nSome commonly used cannulation sites:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Cardiopledgia solution protects the heart by arresting (i.e. stopping) the heart, thereby decreasing its metabolic demand. There are multiple types of cardiopledgia solutions, but most work by inhibiting [[Sodium channel|fast sodium currents]] in the heart, thereby preventing conduction of the [[action potential]].

Once the cannulation site has been deemed safe, two concentric, diamond-shaped [[Purse string|pursestring]] sutures are placed in the distal ascending aorta. A stab incision with a [[scalpel]] is made within the pursestrings and the arterial cannula is passed through the incision. It is important the cannula is passed perpendicular to the aorta to avoid creating an [[aortic dissection]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The pursestrings sutures are cinched around the cannula using a tourniquet and secured to the cannula.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this point, the perfusionist advances the arterial line of the CPB circuit and the surgeon connects the arterial line coming from the patient to the arterial line coming from the CPB machine. Care must be taken to ensure no air is in the circuit when the two are connected, or else the patient could suffer from an [[air embolism]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Other sites for arterial cannulation include the [[axillary artery]], [[brachiocephalic artery]], or [[femoral artery]].\n\nAside from the differences in location, [[Vein|venous]] cannulation is performed similarly to arterial cannulation. Since calcification of the [[Vein|venous system]] is less common, the inspection or use of an ultrasound for calcification at the cannulation sites is unnecessary. Also, because the venous system is under much less pressure than the arterial system, only a single suture is required to hold the cannula in place.<ref name=\":1\" /> If only a single cannula is to be used (dual-stage cannulation), it is passed though the [[right atrial appendage]], through the tricuspid valve, and into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> If two cannula are required (single-stage cannulation), the first one is typically passed through the superior vena cava and the second through the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[femoral vein]] may also be cannulated in select patients.\n\nIf the heart must be stopped for the operation, [[cardioplegia]] cannulas are also required. Antegrade cardiopledgia (forward flowing, through the heart's arteries), retrograde cardiopledgia (backwards flowing, through the heart's veins), or both types may be used depending on the operation and surgeon preference. For antegrade cardiopledgia, a small incision is made in the aorta proximal to the arterial cannulation site (between the heart and arterial cannulation site) and the cannula is placed through this to deliver cardiopledgia to the [[coronary arteries]]. For retrograde cardiopledgia, an incision is made on the posterior (back) surface of the heart through the [[right ventricle]]. The cannula is placed in this incision, passed through the tricuspid valve, and into the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The cardiopledgia lines are connected to the CPB machine.\n\nAt this point, the patient is ready to go on bypass. Blood from the venous cannula(s) enters the CPB machine by gravity where it is oxygenated and cooled (if necessary) before returning to the body through the arterial cannula. Cardiopledgia can now be administered to stop the heart, and a cross-clamp is placed across the aorta between the arterial cannula and cardiopledgia cannula to prevent the arterial blood from flowing backwards into the heart.\n\nOnce the patient is ready to come off of bypass support, the cross-clamp and cannulas are removed and [[protamine sulfate]] is administered to reverse the anticoagulative effects of heparin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1955 heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|right|A heart lung machine used in London's [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1958.

The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a '''heart\u2013lung machine''' or \"the pump\". Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by [[perfusionist]]s.  CPB is a form of [[extracorporeal]] circulation. [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] is generally used for longer-term treatment.\n\nCPB mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart\u2013lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a [[cannula]] in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. Venous blood is removed from the body by the cannula and then filtered, cooled or warmed, and oxygenated before it is returned to the body by a mechanical pump. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery, axillary artery, or brachiocephalic artery (among others).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiac surgery in the adult|others=Cohn, Lawrence H., 1937-2016|isbn=978-0-07-184487-1|edition=Fifth|location=New York|oclc=930496902|date = 2017-08-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe patient is administered [[heparin]] to prevent clotting, and [[protamine sulfate]] is given after to reverse effects of heparin. During the procedure, hypothermia may be maintained; body temperature is usually kept at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C (82.4\u201389.6&nbsp;\u00b0F). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Blausen 0468 Heart-Lung Machine.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of one typical way that a heart-lung machine may be connected to the veins and arteries near the heart. The three implements on the left represent (''from top to bottom'') the pump, the oxygenator, and the reservoir.]]\nCardiopulmonary bypass is commonly used in operations involving the heart. The technique allows the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient's blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate on the heart.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many operations, such as [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG), the heart is arrested (i.e., stopped) because of the difficulty of operating on the beating heart. Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart, for example, [[mitral valve repair]] or [[Mitral valve replacement|replacement]], requires the use of CPB to avoid engulfing air systemically and to provide a bloodless field to increase visibility for the surgeon. The machine pumps the blood and, using an oxygenator, allows red blood cells to pick up oxygen, as well as allowing carbon dioxide levels to decrease.<ref name=\":2\" /> This mimics the function of the heart and the lungs, respectively.\n\nCPB can be used for the induction of total body [[therapeutic hypothermia|hypothermia]], a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without [[perfusion]] (blood flow).<ref name=\":3\" /> If blood flow is stopped at normal [[body temperature]], permanent [[brain damage]] normally occurs in three to four minutes \u2013 death may follow shortly afterward.

It is important that all components of the circuit are coated internally by [[heparin]] or another anticoagulant to prevent clotting within the circuit.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Perfusionist opearting heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|250px|Perfusionist operating a modern heart lung machine]]\n\n===Tubing===\nThe components of the CPB circuit are interconnected by a series of tubes made of [[silicone rubber]] or [[PVC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebme.co.uk/articles/clinical-engineering/cardiopulmonary-bypass-machine-cpb|title=Cardiopulmonary bypass machine - CPB|last=Davies|first=Huw|website=www.ebme.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Pumps===\n\n====Centrifugal pump====\nMany CPB circuits now employ a [[centrifugal pump]] for the maintenance and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by [[centrifugal force]]. This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to prevent overpressurization, clamping or kinking of lines, and produce less damage to blood products ([[hemolysis]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Roller pump====\nThe pump console usually comprises several rotating motor-driven pumps that [[peristalsis|peristaltically]] \"massage\" tubing.  This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or [[peristaltic pump]]. The pumps are more affordable than their centrifugal counterparts, but are susceptible to overpressurization if the lines become clamped or kinked.<ref name=\":0\" /> They are also more likely to cause a massive air embolism and require constant, close supervision by the perfusionist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Oxygenator===\nThe [[oxygenator]] is designed to add [[oxygen]] to infused [[blood]] and remove some of the [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[venous blood]].  Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using [[bubble oxygenator]]s, but [[membrane oxygenator]]s have supplanted bubble oxygenators since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are that [[membrane oxygenator]]s tend to generate many fewer micro-bubbles, referred to as gaseous microemboli, which is generally considered harmful to the patient <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15\u201326|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> and reduce damage to blood cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: haemocompatibility|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=81\u201398|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> compared to [[bubble oxygenator]]s. More recently, the use of hollow-fiber oxygenators has become more widespread. These derivatives of membrane oxygenators further reduce the occurrence of microemboli by reducing the direct air-blood interface while simultaneously providing adequate gas exchange.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother type of oxygenator gaining favour recently is the heparin-coated blood oxygenator which is believed to produce less systemic inflammation and decrease the propensity for blood to clot in the CPB circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Heat Exchangers ===\nBecause hypothermia is frequently used in CPB to reduce metabolic demands (including that of the heart), heat exchangers are implemented to warm and cool blood within the circuit. The heating and cooling is accomplished by passing the line through a warm or ice water bath. A separate heat exchanger is required for the cardiopledgia line.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Cannulae===\nMultiple [[cannula]]e are sewn into the patient's body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery. A venous cannula removes oxygen depleted venous blood from a patient's body. An arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system. The main determinants of cannula size selection is determined by the patient's size and weight, anticipated flow rate, and the size of the vessel being cannulated.<ref name=\":3\" /> A [[cardioplegia]] cannula delivers a cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.\n\nSome commonly used cannulation sites:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is delivered via a cannula to the opening of the coronary arteries (usually by way of the aortic root) and/or to the cardiac veins (by way of the coronary sinus).<ref name=\":0\" /> These delivery methods are referred to antegrade and retrograde, respectively. Cardiopledgia solution protects the heart by arresting (i.e. stopping) the heart, thereby decreasing its metabolic demand. There are multiple types of cardiopledgia solutions, but most work by inhibiting [[Sodium channel|fast sodium currents]] in the heart, thereby preventing conduction of the [[action potential]]. Other types of solutions act by inhibiting calcium's actions on [[myocyte]]s.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Technique==\n\n===Pre-operative planning===\nCPB requires significant forethought before surgery. In particular, the cannulation, cooling, and cardio-protective strategies must be coordinated between the [[surgeon]], [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]], [[perfusionist]], and [[Nursing|nursing staff]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiopulmonary bypass : a primer|last=Mokadam, Nahush A., author, editor.|oclc=922073684}}</ref>\n\n==== Cannulation strategy ====\nThe cannulation strategy varies on several operation-specific and patient-specific details. The typical arterial cannulation involves the placement of a single cannulation within distal [[Aorta|ascending aorta]]. The most simple form on involves placement of a single cannula (known as a dual-stage cannula) passed through the [[right atrium]] and into the [[inferior vena cava]]. In some operations, such as those involving the [[Tricuspid valve|tricuspid]] or [[mitral valve]], two cannula are used\u2014one is passed though the inferior vena cava and one through the [[superior vena cava]]. This is known as single-stage cannulation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=TSRA Primer of Cardiothoracic Surgery|last=Youssef|first=Samuel J.|last2=Williams|first2=Jason A.|publisher=TSRA/TSDA|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9894023-0-9|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Cooling strategy ====\n\n==== Cardio-protective strategy ====\n\n=== Intra-operative technique ===\nA CPB circuit must be primed with fluid and all air expunged from the arterial line/cannula before connection to the patient. The circuit is primed with a [[intravenous therapy|crystalloid]] solution and sometimes blood products are also added. Prior to cannulation (typically after opening the pericardium when using central cannulation), [[heparin]] or another [[anticoagulant]] is administered until the [[activated clotting time]] is above 480 seconds.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Kirklin/Barratt-Boyes cardiac surgery : morphology, diagnostic criteria, natural history, techniques, results, and indications|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|others=Kouchoukos, Nicholas T., Kirklin, John W. (John Webster).|isbn=978-1-4557-4605-7|edition=4th|location=Philadelphia|oclc=812289395}}</ref>\n\nThe arterial cannulation site is inspected for [[calcification]] or other disease. Preoperative imaging or an [[ultrasound]] probe may be used to help identify aortic calcifications that could potentially become dislodged and cause an occlusion or [[stroke]]. Once the cannulation site has been deemed safe, two concentric, diamond-shaped [[Purse string|pursestring]] sutures are placed in the distal ascending aorta. A stab incision with a [[scalpel]] is made within the pursestrings and the arterial cannula is passed through the incision. It is important the cannula is passed perpendicular to the aorta to avoid creating an [[aortic dissection]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The pursestrings sutures are cinched around the cannula using a tourniquet and secured to the cannula.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this point, the perfusionist advances the arterial line of the CPB circuit and the surgeon connects the arterial line coming from the patient to the arterial line coming from the CPB machine. Care must be taken to ensure no air is in the circuit when the two are connected, or else the patient could suffer from an [[air embolism]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Other sites for arterial cannulation include the [[axillary artery]], [[brachiocephalic artery]], or [[femoral artery]].\n\nAside from the differences in location, [[Vein|venous]] cannulation is performed similarly to arterial cannulation. Since calcification of the [[Vein|venous system]] is less common, the inspection or use of an ultrasound for calcification at the cannulation sites is unnecessary. Also, because the venous system is under much less pressure than the arterial system, only a single suture is required to hold the cannula in place.<ref name=\":1\" /> If only a single cannula is to be used (dual-stage cannulation), it is passed though the [[right atrial appendage]], through the tricuspid valve, and into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> If two cannula are required (single-stage cannulation), the first one is typically passed through the superior vena cava and the second through the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[femoral vein]] may also be cannulated in select patients.\n\nIf the heart must be stopped for the operation, [[cardioplegia]] cannulas are also required. Antegrade cardiopledgia (forward flowing, through the heart's arteries), retrograde cardiopledgia (backwards flowing, through the heart's veins), or both types may be used depending on the operation and surgeon preference. For antegrade cardiopledgia, a small incision is made in the aorta proximal to the arterial cannulation site (between the heart and arterial cannulation site) and the cannula is placed through this to deliver cardiopledgia to the [[coronary arteries]]. For retrograde cardiopledgia, an incision is made on the posterior (back) surface of the heart through the [[right ventricle]]. The cannula is placed in this incision, passed through the tricuspid valve, and into the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The cardiopledgia lines are connected to the CPB machine.\n\nAt this point, the patient is ready to go on bypass. Blood from the venous cannula(s) enters the CPB machine by gravity where it is oxygenated and cooled (if necessary) before returning to the body through the arterial cannula. Cardiopledgia can now be administered to stop the heart, and a cross-clamp is placed across the aorta between the arterial cannula and cardiopledgia cannula to prevent the arterial blood from flowing backwards into the heart.\n\nOnce the patient is ready to come off of bypass support, the cross-clamp and cannulas are removed and [[protamine sulfate]] is administered to reverse the anticoagulative effects of heparin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1955 heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|right|A heart lung machine used in London's [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1958.

They were the division's lowest scoring team with just 34 goals, but reached the semi-finals of both cup competitions. They also finished fourth from bottom in the Premiership, which \u2013 due to the streamlining of the division to 20 clubs \u2013 cost them their top flight status. Manager [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]] was sacked just days afterwards, with [[Steve Coppell]] returning to the manager's seat two years after handing the reins over to his former assistant Smith.\n\nThe aftermath of Palace's relegation saw the sale of numerous players including [[Richard Shaw (footballer)|Richard Shaw]], [[John Salako]], [[Chris Armstrong (footballer born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] and [[Gareth Southgate]]. A barely recognisable Palace squad would kick off the [[Football League First Division|Endsleigh League Division One]] campaign with one of the youngest-ever squads to be faced with a challenge for

[[FA Premier League]].\n\n==Season summary==\nCrystal Palace returned to the Premiership a year after leaving it, and, over the next few months, they would experience one of the most unusual seasons in their history. They were the division's lowest scoring team with just 34 goals, but reached the semi-finals of both cup competitions. They also finished fourth from bottom in the Premiership, which \u2013 due to the streamlining of the division to 20 clubs \u2013 cost them their top flight status. Manager [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]] was sacked just days afterwards, with [[Steve Coppell]] returning to the manager's seat two years after handing the reins over to his former assistant Smith.\n\nThe aftermath of Palace's relegation saw the sale of numerous players including [[Richard Shaw (footballer)|Richard Shaw]], [[John Salako]], [[Chris Armstrong (footballer born 1971)|Chris Armstrong]] and [[Gareth Southgate]]. A barely recognisable Palace squad would kick off the [[Football League First Division|Endsleigh League Division One]] campaign with one of the youngest-ever squads to be faced with a challenge for promotion to the Premiership.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1994\u201395 FA Premier League}}\n{{:1994\u201395 FA Premier League|showteam=CRY}}\n;Results
