He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}</ref> most particularly the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C.

Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = <!--Sally J.

Taylor--> | title=Stalin's Apologist | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1990}}</ref> A story Duranty filed about the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] gained him wider notice as a journalist. He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

(Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the [[Metro-Vickers Affair|arrest of engineers]] from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda. The food shortage, however, which has affected the whole population in the last year and particularly in the grain-producing provinces&nbsp;\u2014 the Ukraine, [[North Caucasus Krai|North Caucasus]] [i.e. Kuban Region], and the [[Volga region|Lower Volga]]&nbsp;\u2014 has, however, caused heavy loss of life.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty concluded \"it is conservative to suppose\" that, in certain provinces with a total population of over 40 million, mortality had \"at least trebled.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&pg=PA573&dq=The+food+shortage+which+has+affected+almost+the+whole+population+in+the+last+year,+and+particularly+in+the+grain-producing+provinces&lr=#v=onepage&q=The%20food%20shortage%20which%20has%20affected%20almost%20the%20whole%20population%20in%20the%20last%20year%2C%20and%20particularly%20in%20the%20grain-producing%20provinces&f=false ''Assignment in Utopia'' By Eugene Lyons].</ref> The duel in the press over the famine stories did not damage esteem for Duranty. ''[[The Nation]]'' then described his reporting as \"the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world.\"<ref name=ConqRav>Conquest, R. ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard</ref> In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990).

Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

He was criticized for his subsequent denial of [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|widespread famine (1932\u20131933) in the USSR]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Choma|first1=Lidia|title=Holodomor Facts and History|url=http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html|ref=Uncovering the Truth}}</ref> most particularly the [[Holodomor|famine in Ukraine]]. Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer. In 1990, ''The New York Times'', which submitted his works for the prize in 1932, wrote that his later articles denying the famine constituted \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Meyer |first=Karl E. |authorlink=Karl E.

His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead on the Wirral from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business there in which his father worked. He studied at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], one of Britain's most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]]. Nevertheless, he then gained a scholarship to study at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a first-class degree.<ref>Elizabeth A. Brennan and Elizabeth C.

Duranty's biographer, Sally J. Taylor, said that Duranty met [[Aleister Crowley]] and participated in magic rituals with him during this period. According to Taylor, Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley's mistress Jane Cheron, and eventually married her.<ref>{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Sally J. | author-link = <!--Sally J.

He then moved to [[Riga]], the capital of [[Latvia]], to cover events in the newly independent [[Baltic States]].\n\n==Career in Moscow, 1922\u20131934==\nDuranty moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921.\n\nOn holiday in France in 1924, Duranty's left leg was injured in a train wreck. After an operation, the surgeon discovered [[gangrene]]; and the leg was amputated. Once he had recovered, Duranty resumed his career as a [[journalist]] in the Soviet Union. During the [[New Economic Policy]] with its mixed economy, Duranty's articles from Moscow did not draw wide attention. It was after the advent of the [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131933), which aimed to transform Soviet industry and agriculture, that Duranty made his mark.\n\nIn 1929, he was granted an exclusive interview with [[Joseph Stalin]] that greatly enhanced his reputation as a journalist. Duranty was to remain in Moscow for twelve years, settling in the United States in 1934. Thereafter, he remained on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which required him to spend several months a year in [[Moscow]]. It was in this capacity that Duranty reported on the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] of Stalin's political opponents in 1936\u20131938.\n\n===Views on the Soviet Union, 1931 and after===\nIn the 1931 series of reports for which he received the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence]], Duranty argued that the Russian people were \"[[Culture of Asia|Asiatic]]\" in thought: they valued communal effort and required [[Autocracy|autocratic government]]. [[Individualism|Individuality]] and [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] were alien concepts to the Russian people, which only led to social disruption and were unacceptable to them just as [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[Communism]] were unacceptable to the [[Western world]].\n\nFailed attempts, since the time of [[Peter the Great]], to apply Western ideals in [[Russia]] were a form of European [[colonialism]], he wrote, that had been finally swept away by the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[New Economic Policy]] were both failures tainted by Western thought. Duranty felt that Stalin scrapped the [[New Economic Policy]] because he had no political competition. The famine in [[Ukraine]] demonstrated the lack of organized opposition to Stalin, because his position was never truly threatened by the catastrophe; Stalin's purges surely contributed to this political vacuum. Stalin succeeded in doing what Lenin could only attempt to do, i.e., he \"re-established a dictator of the [[Imperialism|imperial]] idea and put himself in charge\" by means of intimidation. \"Stalin didn't look upon himself as a dictator, but as a 'guardian of a sacred flame' that he called [[Stalinism]] for lack of a better name.\"<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: [[Viking Press]], 1934)</ref> [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's five-year plan]] was an attempt to effect a new way of life for the Russian people.\n\nDuranty argued that the Soviet Union's mentality in 1931 greatly differed from the perception created by [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Duranty claimed: \"It would be more proper to refer to the principle present during the period of Stalin's reign as 'Stalinism'\",<ref>Walter Duranty, ''Duranty Reports Russia'' (New York: Viking Press, 1934), 238.</ref> which Duranty viewed as a progression and integration of [[Marxism]] combined with [[Leninism]]. In one of the articles submitted for the Pulitzer Prize (\"Stalinism smashes foes in Marx's name\", 24 June 1931) Duranty gives his views of the Soviet actions in the countryside that eventually led to the famine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duranty |first=Walter |url=http://www.garethjones.org/soviet_articles/duranty_1931_8.htm |title=Stalinism Smashes Foes in Marx's Name |publisher=The New York Times |website=Garethjones.org |date=June 24, 1931 |access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>what is happening now to the Kulaks is leading to the same result\u2014the kulaks who, under Leninism were an almost privileged class, encouraged to work and prosper (did not Bukharin then Leninism's chief spokesman, ... once say to the peasants, \"Enrich yourselves,\" that is, become kulaks better than\u2014or a different class from\u2014your fellows by individual, self\u2014helping effort?) \"The liquidation of the kulak as a class\" runs the present slogan whose meaning in terms of reality is that 5,000,000 human beings, 1,000,000 families of the best and most energetic farmers are to be dispossessed, dispersed, demolished, to be literally melted or \"liquidated\" into the rising flood of classless proletarians.\n\nHere, when you get right down to it, is the supreme justification from the Bolshevik angle of the cruel and often bloody pressure upon \"the former People\" or class enemies from Czar to kulak. Where Marxism theorized Stalin acts. Marxism says, \"Eliminate class distinctions\" and Stalinism does so by the simple and effective process of destructions, as Tamerlane destroyed his enemies or the Hebrew prophet [Samuel] slew for the glory of Jehovah.</blockquote>\n\nDuranty sometimes claimed that individuals being sent to the [[labor camp]]s in the Russian North, Siberia or Kazakhstan were given a choice between rejoining [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] society or becoming underprivileged outsiders. However, he also said that, for those who could not accept the system, \"the final fate of such enemies is death\". Though describing the system as cruel, he said he has \"no brief for or against it, nor any purpose save to try to tell the truth\". He ends the article with the claim that the brutal collectivization campaign was motivated by the \"hope or promise of a subsequent raising up\" of Asian-minded masses in the Soviet Union which only history could judge.\n\nRather than just repeating the Stalinist viewpoint, Duranty often admitted the brutality of the Stalinist system then proceeded to both explain and defend why dictatorship or brutality were necessary. In addition, he repeated Soviet views as his own opinion, as if his 'observations' from Moscow had given him deeper insights into the country as a whole.\n\nDuranty's motivations have been hotly debated and his reporting is faulted for being too uncritical of the USSR, presenting Soviet propaganda as legitimate reporting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Jacques|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/23/us/times-should-lose-pulitzer-from-30-s-consultant-says.html|title=Times Should Lose Pulitzer From 30's, Consultant Says|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2003|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his praise of Joseph Stalin as an imperial, national, \"authentically Russian\" dictator to be compared to [[Ivan the Terrible]], Duranty was expressing views similar to those of some [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White (Russian) \u00e9migr\u00e9s]] during the same period,<ref>[https://www.mit.edu/people/fjk/Rogovin/volume6/xiii.html \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d, \u0412.\u0417. \u00ab\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u00bb. \u0422\u043e\u043c 6.

(Jones' release was itself immediately preceded by three unsigned articles describing the famine in the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''.)<ref>Malcolm Muggeridge, ''Chronicles of Wasted Time. Vol 1, The Green Stick'', London: Fontana (pbk), p. 286. The articles appeared on 25, 27 and 28 March 1933.</ref>\n\nUnder the title \"Russians Hungry, But Not Starving\" Duranty's article described the situation as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the middle of the diplomatic duel between Great Britain and the Soviet Union over the accused British engineers, there appears from a British source a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union, with \"thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation\".</blockquote>\n\nThe \"diplomatic duel\" was a reference to the arrest of engineers from the [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company who were working in the USSR. Accused with Soviet citizens of \"wrecking\" (sabotaging) the plant they were building, they were the subjects of one in a series of show trials presided over by [[Andrey Vyshinsky]]<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, ''Britain confronts the Stalin Revolution: the Metro-Vickers crisis'', Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995.</ref> during the First Five Year Plan.\n\nFive months later (23 August 1933), in another ''New York Times'' article, Duranty wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda.

''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'', Oxford University Press, New York. 1986, p. 320.</ref>\n\nFollowing sensitive negotiations in November 1933 that resulted in the establishment of relations between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]], a dinner was given for Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] in New York City's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Each of the attendees' names was read in turn, politely applauded by the guests, until Duranty's. Whereupon, [[Alexander Woollcott]] wrote, \"the one really prolonged pandemonium was evoked ... Indeed, one quite got the impression that America, in a spasm of discernment, was recognizing both Russia and Walter Duranty.\"<ref name=\"ConqRav\" />\n\nSally J. Taylor, author of the critical Duranty biography ''Stalin's Apologist'', argues that his reporting from the USSR was a key factor in U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 decision to grant official recognition to the Soviet Union.<ref name=Taylor />\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1934, Duranty left Moscow and visited the [[White House]] in the company of Soviet officials, including Litvinov. He continued as a Special Correspondent for ''The New York Times'' until 1940.\n\nHe wrote several books on the Soviet Union after 1940. His name was on a [[Orwell's list|list maintained by writer George Orwell]] of those Orwell considered to be unsuitable as possible writers for the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s [[Information Research Department]] owing to the possibility of them being too sympathetic to communism or possibly paid communist agents.<ref>John Ezard [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities ''Blair's babe: Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge?''] ''The Guardian'', June 21, 2003]</ref>\n\n==Death==\nDuranty died in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida in 1957 and is interred at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\n==Scholarship on Duranty's work==\nDuranty was reporting at a time when opinions were strongly divided on the Soviet Union and its leadership.\n\nThe admission of the USSR to the [[League of Nations]] in 1934 was viewed optimistically by some. Others saw an inevitable confrontation between [[fascism]] and [[communism]] as requiring individuals to take one side or the other. After [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], [[Joseph E. Davies]], former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1936\u20131938), wrote positively about \"Russia and its people in their gallant struggle to preserve the peace until ruthless aggression made war inevitable\". In the same book he referred to Stalin as a \"decent and clean-living\" man and \"a great leader.\"<ref>Davies, Joseph E. ''Mission to Moscow''. Garden City Publishing, Garden City, NY, 1941</ref>\n\nMany reporters of Duranty's time slanted their coverage in favour of the Soviet Union. Some drew a contrast with the capitalist world, sinking under the weight of the [[Great Depression]]; others wrote out of a true belief in Communism; some acted out of fear of being expelled from [[Moscow]], which would result in a loss of livelihood. At home many of their editors found it hard to believe a state would deliberately starve millions of its own people. Duranty's reports for ''The New York Times'' were a source of much frustration for the paper's readers in 1932, because they directly contradicted the line taken on the paper's own [[editorial]] page.<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" />\n\n===The Holodomor (1932-1933) and the 1938 Moscow Show Trials===\nDuranty has been criticized for deferring to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]'s official [[propaganda]] rather than reporting news, both when he was living in Moscow and later. For example, he later defended Stalin's [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trials of 1938]], which were staged to eliminate potential challengers to Stalin's authority.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 1968, p. //.</ref>\n\nThe major controversy regarding his work remains his reporting on the great famine of 1932\u201333 that struck certain parts of the USSR after agriculture was forcibly and rapidly \"collectivised\". He published reports stating \"there is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be\" and \"any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda\".<ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/pulitzer-winning-lies/article/4040 Pulitzer-Winning Lies] the Weekly Standard</ref> In Ukraine, the region most affected, this man-made disaster is today known as the [[Holodomor]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Duranty's work has come increasingly under fire for failing to report the famine. [[Robert Conquest]] was critical of Duranty's reporting in ''The Great Terror'' (1968), ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]'' (1986) and, most recently, in ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (1990). [[Joseph Alsop]] and Andrew Stuttaford spoke out against Duranty during the Pulitzer Prize controversy.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Andrew|last=Stuttaford|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|title=Prize Specimen \u2013 The campaign to revoke Walter Duranty's Pulitzer|magazine=[[National Review]]|date=7 May 2003|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519230426/http://www.nationalreview.com/stuttaford/stuttaford050703.asp|archivedate=19 May 2003}}</ref> \"Lying was Duranty's stock in trade,\" commented Alsop.

In 1934 he privately reported to the British embassy in Moscow that as many as 10 million people may have died, directly or indirectly, from famine in the Soviet Union in the previous year.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/05/fellow-travellers-and-useful-idiots \"Fellow travelers and useful idiots\", ''The New Statesman'', 8 May 2017].</ref>\n\nBoth [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jQcPAQAAMAAJ ''The Foreign Office and the famine: British documents on Ukraine and the Great Famine of 1932\u20131933''] (Studies in East European nationalisms). \"Duranty&nbsp;... manipulated the official palaver so successfully that it was possible to interpret his article in several ways\", p. xxx.</ref> and American engineer Zara Witkin (1900\u20131940),<ref>{{cite web|first=Joyce |last=Ingraham |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9951419 |title=Zara Witkin |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=November 23, 2004 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> who worked in the USSR from 1932 to 1934,<ref>''An American Engineer in Stalin's Russia: The Memoirs of Zara Witkin, 1932\u20131934'', University of California Press.</ref> confirmed that Duranty knowingly misrepresented information about the nature and scale of the famine.\n\nThere are some indications that Duranty's deliberate misdirection concerning the famine may have been the result of duress. Conquest believed Duranty was being blackmailed over his sexual proclivities.<ref>P. Murphy, ''The Collective Imagination: The Creative Spirit of Free Societies'', Ashgate Publishing, 2012, p. 25.</ref>\n\nIn his 1944 book, Duranty wrote in a chastened tone about his 1932\u201334 reporting, but he offered only a Stalinist defense of it.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\">{{Harvnb|Duranty|1944|pp=188\u2013199}}</ref> He admits that people starved, including not just \"class enemies\" but also loyal communists,<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> but he says that Stalin was forced to order the requisitions to equip the Red Army enough to deter an imminent Japanese invasion<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> (a reprise of the [[Siberian Intervention]] of a decade earlier)\u2014in other words, to save the Soviet Union from impending military doom, not because Stalin wanted to collectivize the population at gunpoint, on pain of death.<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/> Although it is likely that Stalin ''did'' expect a Japanese invasion (expecting foreign attacks all the time), most historians today do not accept the view that it was his ''sole'' motivation and that Stalin did not intend any cruel and ruthless political dominance of the Soviet population. Of the notion that Stalin did intend the latter, Duranty said, \"What a misconception!\"<ref name=\"Duranty_1944_pp188-199\"/>\n\n==Calls for revocation of Pulitzer Prize, 1990\u20132003==\nThe concern over Duranty's reporting on the famine in Soviet Ukraine led to a move to posthumously and symbolically strip him of the Pulitzer Prize he received in 1932.\n\nIn response to ''Stalin's Apologist'' (1990), the critical biography by Sally J. Taylor,<ref name=Taylor /> ''The New York Times'' assigned a member of its editorial board, Karl Meyer, to write a signed editorial about Duranty's work for the ''Times''. In a scathing piece, Meyer said (24 June 1990) that Duranty's articles were \"some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.\" Duranty, Meyer said, had bet his career on Stalin's rise and \"strove to preserve it by ignoring or excusing Stalin's crimes.\"<ref name=\"TimesEditorial\" /> The Pulitzer Board in 1990 reconsidered the prize but decided to preserve it as awarded.<ref>anon, ''[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm N.Y.

Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[propaganda]]. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of ''The New York Times''{{'}} honor, they should take the prize away.\"<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-10-22-ny-times-pulitzer_x.htm \"N.Y. Times urged to rescind 1932 Pulitzer\"], retrieved February 2, 2008</ref> The ''Times'' sent Von Hagen's report to the Pulitzer Board and left it to the Board to take whatever action they considered appropriate.<ref>Reported in ''The Washington Times'' \"National\" section, October 22, 2003.</ref> In a letter accompanying the report, ''The New York Times'' publisher [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] called Duranty's work \"slovenly\" and said it \"should have been recognized for what it was by his editors and by his Pulitzer judges seven decades ago.\"\n\nUltimately, Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prize board, declined to revoke the award. In a press release of November 21, 2003, he stated that with regard to the 13 articles by Duranty from 1931 submitted for the award \"there was not clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception, the relevant standard in this case.\"<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-walter-duranty \"Statement on Walter Duranty's 1932 Prize\"]</ref>\n\n==Literary awards==\n(''other than Pulitzer'')\n* O.

It was a key cabinet position since Mexico was in dire financial circumstances following the presidency of [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]], who as a desperate measure had nationalized the banks in Mexico and expropriated dollar-denominated savings accounts. The country held no hard currency reserves, exhaustion of foreign credit, and soaring interest rates. the Ministries of Finance and Planning and Budget became the most powerful positions to deal with the economic crisis. In the cabinet, Salinas's main rival was [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]], Minister of Finance.  In the internecine politics that would decide who would succeed De la Madrid as president, Salinas sought to destroy the reputation of Silva Herzog. Another key figure in the cabinet was [[Manuel Bartlett]], Minister of the Interior, with whom Salinas forged a non-compete alliance. Salinas also forged other alliances within the circles of power and did not directly compete with De la Madrid for public attention. Silva Herzog made missteps in his ministry, which Salinas capitalized on, forcing his resignation.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 63-68</ref>\n\n==Presidential election 1988==\n{{Main|1988 Mexican general election}}\n\n\"Not in their worst nightmares could the lords of the PRI have imagined what would happen to them on the sixth of July 1988. As they had done six years before, the electorate came out to vote, but not in support of the official candidate. They came to the voting booths to punish him.\"<ref>[[Enrique Krauze]], ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, p. 770.</ref>  Carlos Salinas had become presidential candidate in a difficult time for the PRI which for the first time was faced by significant opposition from the left ([[National Democratic Front (Mexico)|National Democratic Front]]) and from the right ([[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], PAN). The candidate of the PAN was [[Manuel Clouthier]].\n\n[[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas Sol\u00f3rzano]], son of President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], registered as an opposing candidate from a left-wing coalition called ''Frente Democr\u00e1tico Nacional''. He rapidly became a popular figure, and became the first opposing candidate to fill the ''[[Z\u00f3calo]]'' with sympathizers and to seriously threaten the PRI, which had won all presidential elections since its inception in 1929. The Ministry of the Interior ([[Secretar\u00eda de Gobernaci\u00f3n]]), through its Federal Electoral Commission, was the institution in charge of the electoral process, and installed a modern computing system to count the votes. On election day July 6, 1988, the system \"crashed\", and when it was finally restored, Carlos Salinas was declared the official winner.

When the PRI candidate in the 1994 elections, [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] was assassinated in March 1994, new restrictions barring cabinet ministers who had not resigned in the six months previous to the election date from being candidates for the presidency meant that Salinas had a small pool of eligible choices.\n\n===Domestic issues===\nIn his inaugural address in December 1988, he outlined an ambitious and important goal of \"modernizing\" Mexico.\"<ref>Roberto Blancarte, \"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach\".

Vargas 1998\"/>\n\n====First steps====\nImmediately upon his inauguration, he arrested prominent union leaders, many of whom were his opponents in the PRI, among other measures to demonstrate his determination to set his own course. His government privatized state-run companies, including Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico, sold to PRI-insider [[Carlos Slim]], as well as re-privatizing banks that President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] had nationalized at the end of his term. The funds from these sales of state assets helped pay off Mexico's internal debt.  However, there were also bailouts for banks and the Mexican toll roads that became scandals.<ref>Bussey, \"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\", p. 1331</ref>\n\n====Economic policy====\nSalinas continued with the [[neoliberal]] economic policy of his predecessor [[Miguel de la Madrid]] and converted Mexico into a regulatory state.<ref>Remonda Bensabat Kleinberg,  \"Strategic Alliances: State\u2010Business Relations in Mexico Under Neo\u2010Liberalism and Crisis.\" ''Bulletin of Latin American Research'' 18.1 (1999): 71-87.</ref> During his presidential term,  he aggressively privatized hundreds of state-run companies, including telecommunications, steel, and mining.

Shortly after leaving office, due to the so-called [[Mexican peso crisis|December Mistake]], inflation rose again to 51%.\n\nDuring his term, the peso devalued from 2.65 MXP to 3.60 [[MXN]] per U.S. dollar by November 30, 1994, the last day of his term; thus the peso devalued far less than it had in the two previous terms. (The peso was later devalued from 4 per dollar to 7.2 in a single week due to the \"December Mistake.\")\n\n====Poverty alleviation====\nSalinas established the National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL), a [[Social Welfare in Mexico|social welfare program]], as a way to directly aid poor Mexicans, but also create a network of support for Salinas.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"Social spending and political support: The\" lessons\" of the National Solidarity Program in Mexico.\" Comparative Politics (1996): 151-177.</ref>  It was his first official act as president.  The program channeled public funds, which the administration said came largely from privatization of  state-owned companies, into impoverished areas to improve roads, the electrical grid, schools, and clinics in order to raise levels of education and health and link remote areas, with lack of oversight in its spending.<ref>Paul Lawrence Haber, \"Neoliberalism\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

Salinas's Harvard doctoral dissertation had examined the relationship between social programs and political support for the government. Given the Salinas's questionable legitimacy as the winner of the 1988 election, PRONASOL was seen as a way for Salinas to deliver immediate benefits to the poor and avert their turning to other political parties or worse. It did not prioritize funding for Mexico's poorest states, but rather to states with middle-income populations where elections were most contested and where the PRI had lost. Politically, the program sought to undermine the appeal of leftists, especially [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]].<ref>Haber, \"Neoliberalism\", p. 1016.</ref> In Chiapas, PRONASOL channeled increased funds in 1993 and 1994, but it did not prevent the [[Zapatista uprising]], which showed that the program had only a limited impact.<ref>Jonathan Fox, \"Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, (PRONASOL)\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1360-1362</ref><ref>Cornelius, Wayne, Ann Craig, and Jonathan Fox, eds.

In the 1980s, the church saw electoral participation reform and fighting electoral fraud as an issue. Sometime during the presidential campaign, the PRI had indicated to the Church that a Salinas victory would be beneficial to the Church. It has been considered a quid pro quo agreement.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'', see esp. chapter 5, \"Salinismo, the Church, and Quid Pro Quo\".</ref>\nA delegation of the leadership of the episcopal hierarchy attended the inauguration of Salinas on December 1, 1988.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'' p. 71-72.</ref> After the 1988 election the Mexican bishops did not make public statements about the election results. Behind the scenes the apostolic delegate to Mexico, the Vatican's representative, Mexican bishops, and government officials had a series of secret meetings that hammered out the outlines of a new Church-State relationship. In his inaugural address, Salinas de Gortari announced a program to \"modernize\" Mexico via structural transformation. \"The modern state is a state which ... maintains transparency and updates its relation with political parties, entrepreneurial groups, and the church.\"<ref>Salinas, quoted in Roberto Blancarte, \"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach.\" ''Journal of Church & State'', Autumn 1993, vol. 35.

A major change was the creation of the [[Instituto Nacional Electoral|Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE) in October 1990, taking elections out of the hands of the Ministry of the Interior to create an independent entity.\n\nThe [[1994 Mexican general election|1994 elections]] were the first to have international observers, and were considered, at that time, the fairest elections in the century, although not free of controversy.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/world/mexico-invites-un-to-attend-election-to-observe-the-observers.html |title= Mexico Invites U.N. to Attend Election to Observe the Observers|author= Tim Golden|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date = May 13, 1994}}</ref>  For the first time, the PRI lost its two-thirds majority in Congress, which is necessary to conduct constitutional reforms.<ref name=\"Rivera Ayala 2008 388\">{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=388}}</ref>\n\n====Human rights====\nIn 1990, the [[National Human Rights Commission (Mexico)|National Human Rights Commission]] (''Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos'') was created.<ref name=\"Delgado de Cant\u00fa 2003 484\">{{cite book|last=Delgado de Cant\u00fa|first=Gloria M.|title=M\u00e9xico, estructuras pol\u00edtica, econ\u00f3mica y social|year=2003|publisher=Pearson Educaci\u00f3n|pages=484}}</ref>  Initially a government agency, it became a separate entity,\n\n====Education====\nIn 1992, Salinas and his Secretary of Education, [[Ernesto Zedillo]] introduced new compulsory history texts in Mexican schools, part of the Mexican Free-Textbook Program. Authored by [[:es:Enrique Florescano|Enrique Florescano]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Aguilar Cam\u00edn]], the new textbooks set off a storm of controversy. Shifts in emphasis concerned the [[Porfiriato]] and the role of foreign investment, [[Emiliano Zapata]], lauding him as a hero despite his having opposed every government in power; [[U.S.-Mexico relations]], avoiding negative treatment of the history; and the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]], treating it dispassionately.  The government was compelled to withdraw them in January 1993.  According to one assessment, \"While the 1992 textbook controversy disclosed new support for the regime from the right, it also revealed an erosion of support and discipline within officialdom.\"<ref>Dennis Gilbert, \"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\" ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'' 13(2), summer 1997 p. 295.</ref>\n\n===North American Free Trade Agreement===\n{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}\n{{See also|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}\n[[File:Nafta.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Carlos Salinas (left), [[George H.&nbsp;W.

The agreement was a reversal of Mexico's longstanding policies of economic nationalism and anti-Americanism and was intended to create a single market. Mexican proponents of NAFTA saw it in a way to secure markets for its exports and attract foreign investment, and create jobs, help the government to be able to service its foreign debt, and overall, promote economic recovery. In Mexico, the reversal was controversial, opposed by organized labor, many academics, and nongovernmental organizations.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1021-22.</ref>\n\n===Drug trafficking and corruption===\n{{Main|Mexican Drug War}}\nAn issue of importance both domestic and foreign policy is drug trafficking. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Mexico was a transit country for [[cocaine]] produced in Colombia and destined for consumers in the United States. President De la Madrid considered drug trafficking a national security issue and devoted government funding to it. Salinas expanded this funding, but neither president stemmed the growth of trafficking and its impact on Mexico. Drug trafficking is highly lucrative for those involved with it, and Mexico's weak law enforcement and judicial system could not prevent the wide-scale involvement of Mexico's poorly-paid police from being corrupted. The Mexican military to a lesser extent was corrupted, along with politicians, and some journalists. Such corruption undermined the possibility of rule of law and it prevented Mexicans from having trust in the state.

Salinas also renegotiated Mexico's foreign debt. In 1990, Salinas had traveled to Europe to attract non-North American capital investment, but dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc opened them to foreign investment; Mexico was less attractive to them and Salinas turned to North America.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\", p. 1021.</ref> Critics say that  NAFTA has had mixed results for Mexico: while there has been huge increase in commerce and foreign investment, this has not been at all the case for employment and salaries.<ref name=\"eluniversal.com.mx\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Mexico hosted the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a venue where the parties in the civil war in El Salvador signed an accord ending the long conflict.<ref>Diana Negroponte, \"Implementation of the Chapultepec Peace Accords\" in ''Seeking Peace in El Salvador: The Struggle to Reconstruct a Nation at the End of the Cold War''. New York: Palgrave MacMillan 2012</ref>\n\nMexico reestablished diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Moreover, Mexico became member of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). The First [[Ibero-American Summit]] was held and the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a peace agreement for El Salvador, were signed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=393}}</ref>\n\nSalinas in 1991 visited United States to help convince the Illinois Governor, [[James R. Thompson]] to pardon four Mexican citizens from a quadruple murder known as the Milwaukee Ave Massacre, that took place in 1981 in Chicago, Illinois. With the help of Carlos Salinas de Gortari the four men, Joaquin Varela, Rogelio Arroyo, Ignacio Varela, and Isauro Sanchez, had their sentences commuted, later pardoned by Governor [[Jim Edgar]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==1994 Election year==\nAs the 1994 presidential election approached, Salinas had the crucial decision to designate the candidate for the PRI; that person had always gone on to win the presidential election. \"The shipwreck of the 1988 succession should have sufficed to teach Salinas to prevent another disaster from befalling the system he had inherited.\"<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 89.</ref> At the time Salinas made the choice, popularity and credibility was high over the course of his presidency,<ref>Villarreal, Andres. \u201cPublic Opinion of the Economy and the President among Mexico City Residents: The Salinas Sexenio.\u201d Latin American Research Review, vol. 34, no. 2, 1999, p. 131 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2503915 accessed 21 March 2019</ref> but a series of events in the final year of his presidency changed that.\n\n===Choosing the PRI Nominee===\n\nThe \"unveiling\" of the PRI candidate for the presidency was on 28 November 1993, with Salinas choosing [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]]. Those considered for the position were [[Manuel Camacho Solis|Manuel Camacho]] and Colosio, with earlier contenders, such as [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]] and [[Pedro Aspe]] being eliminated. Aspe, a graduate of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] had a high international profile, but was considered unlikely to actually attract voters.  The changed circumstances of the Mexican political system, as demonstrated by Salinas's own election to the presidency, meant that being designated the PRI did not guarantee election. Aspe was not a charismatic prospect as a candidate who could energize and charm voters.  With the potential that Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas was likely to run again for the presidency, the PRI needed to field someone who could garner votes.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 92-96.</ref>\n\n===Zapatista rebellion===\n{{Main|Zapatista Army of National Liberation}}\n[[File:Flag of the EZLN.jpg|thumb|Flag of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)]]\nThe uprising in Chiapas on 1 January 1994 coincided with the date that the NAFTA came into effect. The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', EZLN) issued their first declaration from the state of [[Chiapas]] in southern Mexico. Salinas's immediate response was to find for a peaceful solution: offering pardon to deposed arms; ordering a cease fire; appointing a peace negotiator, and sending Mexican Congress a General Amnesty Law. Salinas's presidential successor took a harder line when he was inaugurated. But Salinas's more peaceful solution [[1995 Zapatista Crisis|Zapatista uprising]] was legal and politically pragmatic, likely saving many lives in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&article=12183|title=La \u00danica l\u00ednea es que no tenemos l\u00ednea|website=Enlineadirecta.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf|format=PDF|title=Buzos|website=Buzos.com.mx|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&rl=wh&#93; |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825194625/https://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958 |archive-date=August 25, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Zapatista rebellion did not spread regionally or nationwide, but the fact that it happened and that international attention was drawn to this poor region of Mexico just as NAFTA was implemented meant that Salinas's careful plans for a peaceful political transition with his legacy intact were obliterated.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 106</ref> Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho, Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the government's peace mediator. For Salinas, this had political benefits, since Camacho, having been passed over as the PRI presidential candidate, could have bolted from the party.

The Zapatista uprising had ruined Salinas's plans for a peaceful transition of Mexico in the elections.  There is evidence that Salinas and Colosio began to disagree, not unusual after the electoral transfer, but this occurred prior to it. His campaign languished with lack of funding, Colosio had problems getting media coverage, given the high-profile events in Chiapas. Salinas prevented Colosio from going to Chiapas, while the explanation that his presence there would complicate the situation. Increasingly there was the impression that Salinas would reverse his decision for Colosio, substituting someone else, perhaps [[Manuel Camacho]]. Camacho was a politically savvy former [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Head of Government of Mexico City]] as well as Peace Commissioner in Chiapas.  Salinas made a public statement on 17 January 1994, affirming his choice as candidate, but this was at the insistence of Colosio. Salinas extracted a pledge from Camacho that he had no designs on the presidency, which he renounced the day before Colosio's assassination in Tijuana 23 March 1994.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 108- 109</ref>  After a few days of weighing his options, Salinas chose Colosio's campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, former Minister of Education, as the new PRI candidate for the presidency. Zedillo had been Secretary of Education, a relatively unimportant ministry; he had resigned to run the campaign of Colosio. Zedillo had never held elective office, sharing that trait with De la Madrid and Salinas, but Zedillo was not otherwise experienced politically. He was perceived as a weak candidate. There are speculation that Salinas wished to perpetuate his power as [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] had in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], controlling successor presidents.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1641</ref>\n\n===1994 General Election===\n{{See|1994 Mexican general election}}\nAfter considering whether to postpone the general election scheduled for 21 August 1994, Salinas chose Zedillo to run as the PRI candidate for the presidency and the elections took place as scheduled. Voters came out in large numbers to choose between three main candidates, Zedillo for the PRI, C\u00e1rdenas for the Party of Democratic Revolution, and [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] for the PAN. Zedillo won a clear victory, in what were considered by foreign observers as free and fair. In results published by the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), Zedillo got 48.7%, Cevallos 25.9%, and C\u00e1rdenas 16.6%.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20061115072642/http://www.ife.org.mx/documentos/RESELEC/nuevo_1994/pres_94/nac_edo/nac_pre_94.html accessed 25 March 2019</ref>\n\n===Another political assassination===\nFollowing the election in September 1994, Secretary General of the PRI [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], Salinas' former brother-in-law, was assassinated in downtown Mexico City in broad daylight. The murder was not solved during Salinas's presidency, even when [[:es:Mario Ruiz Massieu|Mario Ruiz Massieu]] (Francisco's brother) was the [[Attorney General of Mexico|attorney general]] and in charge of the investigation.\n\n===Economic issues===\nThe economic bubble gave Mexico a prosperity not seen in a generation. This period of rapid growth coupled with low inflation prompted some political thinkers and the media to state that Mexico was on the verge of becoming a \"First World nation\". In fact, it was the first of the \"newly industrialized nations\" to be admitted into the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in May 1994. It was known that the peso was overvalued, but the extent of the Mexican economy's vulnerability was either not well known or downplayed by both the Salinas administration and the media.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This vulnerability was further aggravated by several unexpected events and macroeconomic mistakes made in the last year of his administration.\n\nSeveral economists and historians have analyzed some of the events and policy mistakes that precipitated the crisis of December 1994.<ref>Hufbauer and Schoot, (2005)</ref> In keeping with the PRI election-year practices, Salinas launched a spending spree to finance popular projects, which translated into a historically high deficit. This budget deficit was coupled with a current account deficit, fueled by excessive consumer spending as allowed by the overvalued peso. In order to finance this deficit, the Salinas administration issued ''tesobonos'', an attractive debt instrument that insured payment in dollars instead of pesos.\n\nIncreasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (''tesobono'') investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9&nbsp;billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, in order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves.<ref>Hufbauer & Schott, 2005</ref> Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the [[Bank of Mexico]] decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.\n\n==Successor first days crises==\n===Peso devaluation===\n{{See also|1994 economic crisis in Mexico}}\nSoon after taking office, Zedillo announced that his government would let the fixed exchange rate band increase 15 percent (up to 4 pesos per US$), by stopping the unorthodox measures employed by the previous administration to keep it at the previous fixed level (e.g.,&nbsp;by selling dollars, assuming debt, and so on). This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While experts agree that devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects. Whether the effects were aggravated further or not, the result was that the peso crashed under a floating regime from four pesos to the dollar (with the previous increase of 15%) to 7.2 to the dollar in the space of a week.\n\nMexican businesses with debts to be paid in dollars, or that relied on supplies bought from the United States, suffered an immediate hit, with mass industrial lay-offs and several suicides.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} To make matters worse, the devaluation announcement was made mid-week, on a Wednesday, and for the remainder of the week foreign investors fled the Mexican market without any government action to prevent or discourage the flight until the following Monday, when it was too late.\n\nSalinas faced widespread criticism in Mexico. He was widely blamed for the collapse of the economy and his privatization of several government-run businesses such as Telmex.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} With respect to the collapse of the economy, he rapidly responded by blaming Zedillo's \"inept\" handling of the situation, coining the term \"December mistake\" to refer to the crisis and Zedillo's mistakes. He then argued that he had talked to Zedillo of a possibility of \"sharing the burden\" of the devaluation by allowing the peso to devaluate a certain percent before his term was over, and the rest of the necessary devaluation would have been done during Zedillo's administration.\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\nInitially the Zedillo administration followed Salinas's policies regarding the negotiations with the Zapatistas, pledging to reach a peaceful resolution to the Chiapas crisis. Zedillo then reversed course and on February 9, 1995, identifying [[Subcomandante Marcos]] to be [[Subcomandante Marcos|Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n Vicente]], and pursued military intervention. He abandoned that unsuccessful strategy and peace talks were subsequently re-established. Zedillo's zigzag policies in Chiapas were consistent with some others of his administration.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997 p. 1641</ref>\n\n===Break with Zedillo, Ra\u00fal Salinas arrest and self-exile===\nErnesto Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who had no political experience or independent base of power. There was a perception that Salinas wanted to follow the precedent of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] who wielded tremendous power over three successor presidents following the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]].<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" p. 1640</ref> However, this changed when by order of [[Ernesto Zedillo|president Zedillo]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siempre.mx/2019/04/la-corte-y-los-calzones-del-presidente/|title=La corte y los calzones del presidente|date=2019-04-11|website=Siempre!|language=es|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Salinas's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] was arrested on 28 February 1995 under charges of orchestrating the assassination of Ruiz Massieu; the arrest dramatically shifted the political situation. Since 1940 when president [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] left the presidency and turned power over to his successor, Mexican former presidents had not directly intervened in politics. After the arrest of his brother, Salinas went on television, expressing his outrage at Zedillo. In the broadcast he placed the blame for the December peso crisis on Zedillo, resulting in the loss of Mexican jobs, bankruptcies, and the tarnishing of Mexico's image.<ref>Andres Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos: Guerrillas, Stockbrokers, Politicians, and Mexico's Road to Prosperity''. Boston: Little Brown and Company 2000, p. 1996.</ref>\n\nSalinas abandoned his campaign -which had been backed by the United States- to become the Director-General of the [[World Trade Organization]] and left Mexico City, going to Monterrey where he staged a publicized hunger strike in the home of a PRI supporter. [[Arturo Warman]], Minister of Agrarian Reform, was sent to Monterrey to persuade Salinas to return to Mexico City. Salinas demanded that the government issue a statement clearing him of responsibility for the Colosio case and the December 20 devaluation. Salinas returned to Mexico City and he and Zedillo met. Zedillo's government issued a statement absolving Salinas of the Colosio murder and tempered his criticism of Salinas in the peso crisis.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 207-08</ref>  Salinas left Mexico for self-imposed exile and settled in Ireland for a period.\n\n==Post-Presidential years==\nSalinas's reputation was to be further clouded by a series of controversies involving close family members. His brother Ra\u00fal had been arrested in February 1995. In November 1995, Ra\u00fal's wife, [[:es:Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n|Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], were arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], after attempting to withdraw US$84 million from an account owned by Ra\u00fal Salinas under an alias. Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast fortune spread around the world and amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, even though Ra\u00fal Salinas had never officially received an annual income of more than $190,000. A report by the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] indicated that Ra\u00fal Salinas had transferred over $90 million out of Mexico into private bank accounts in London and Switzerland through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/os99001.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRIVATE BANKING : Raul Salinas, Citibank, and Alleged Money Laundering|website=Gao.gov|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million, out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Ra\u00fal Salinas, to the government of Mexico. The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico. The Salinas family would not receive back any of the frozen funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Salinas_funds_finally_head_back_to_Mexico.html?cid=6740256 |title=Switzerland will return blocked Salinas funds to Mexico \u2013 swissinfo |website=Swissinfo.ch |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, while Salinas was in exile and his brother Ra\u00fal in jail, their father, Ra\u00fal Salinas Lozano was accused in a U.S court of being connected to drug dealing by a convicted Mexican trafficker, Magdalena Ruiz Pelayo; the senior Salinas denied the charges.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/31/world/scandal-pushes-powerful-family-from-pinnacle-in-mexico.html</ref>\n\nSalinas divorced his first wife, Cecilia Occelli Gonz\u00e1lez, in 1995 soon after leaving office. That same year he married his second wife, Ana Paula Gerard.<ref name=cg/>\n\nIn January 1999, after a four-year trial, Salinas' older brother Ra\u00fal was convicted of ordering the murder of the PRI official (and Salinas' brother-in-law) [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]] and sentenced to 50 years in prison. In July 1999, an appeals court cut the sentence to 27 1/2 years. In June 2005, the conviction was overturned, and Ra\u00fal Salinas was freed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4079372.stm|title=Mexico frees ex-leader's brother|date=June 10, 2005|accessdate=December 2, 2018|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn December 6, 2004, Salinas's youngest brother, [[Enrique Salinas|Enrique]], was found dead in [[Huixquilucan]], [[Estado de M\u00e9xico]], inside his car with a plastic bag strapped around his head.

Salinas's father served as President [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]]'s minister of industry and commerce, but was passed over as the PRI's presidential candidate in favor of [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] (1964\u201370). When Carlos Salinas was chosen the PRI's presidential candidate for the 1988 election, he told his father, \"It took us more than 20 years, but we made it.\"<ref>quoted in  Jane Bussey, \"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1330.</ref>\n\nA tragedy occurred early in Carlos Salinas's life. On 18 December 1951, when he was three years old, he was playing with his older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas de Gortari|Ra\u00fal]], then five, and an eight-year-old friend when they found a loaded rifle, and one of them shot and killed the Salinas family's twelve-year-old maid, Manuela.

It was a key cabinet position since Mexico was in dire financial circumstances following the presidency of [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]], who as a desperate measure had nationalized the banks in Mexico and expropriated dollar-denominated savings accounts. The country held no hard currency reserves, exhaustion of foreign credit, and soaring interest rates. the Ministries of Finance and Planning and Budget became the most powerful positions to deal with the economic crisis. In the cabinet, Salinas's main rival was [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]], Minister of Finance.  In the internecine politics that would decide who would succeed De la Madrid as president, Salinas sought to destroy the reputation of Silva Herzog. Another key figure in the cabinet was [[Manuel Bartlett]], Minister of the Interior, with whom Salinas forged a non-compete alliance. Salinas also forged other alliances within the circles of power and did not directly compete with De la Madrid for public attention. Silva Herzog made missteps in his ministry, which Salinas capitalized on, forcing his resignation.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 63-68</ref>\n\n==Presidential election 1988==\n{{Main|1988 Mexican general election}}\n\n\"Not in their worst nightmares could the lords of the PRI have imagined what would happen to them on the sixth of July 1988. As they had done six years before, the electorate came out to vote, but not in support of the official candidate. They came to the voting booths to punish him.\"<ref>[[Enrique Krauze]], ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, p. 770.</ref>  Carlos Salinas had become presidential candidate in a difficult time for the PRI which for the first time was faced by significant opposition from the left ([[National Democratic Front (Mexico)|National Democratic Front]]) and from the right ([[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], PAN). The candidate of the PAN was [[Manuel Clouthier]].\n\n[[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas Sol\u00f3rzano]], son of President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], registered as an opposing candidate from a left-wing coalition called ''Frente Democr\u00e1tico Nacional''. He rapidly became a popular figure, and became the first opposing candidate to fill the ''[[Z\u00f3calo]]'' with sympathizers and to seriously threaten the PRI, which had won all presidential elections since its inception in 1929. The Ministry of the Interior ([[Secretar\u00eda de Gobernaci\u00f3n]]), through its Federal Electoral Commission, was the institution in charge of the electoral process, and installed a modern computing system to count the votes. On election day July 6, 1988, the system \"crashed\", and when it was finally restored, Carlos Salinas was declared the official winner. Even though the elections are extremely controversial, and some maintain that Salinas won legally, the expression ''se cay\u00f3 el sistema'' (\"the system crashed\") became a colloquial euphemism for electoral fraud. As one observer put it, \"For the ordinary citizen, it was not the computer network but the Mexican political system that had crashed.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. p. 770.</ref>\n\nThe process involved two suspicious shutdowns of the computer system used to keep track of the number of votes.<ref name=\"july6book\">{{cite book|last=Vald\u00e9s|first=Leonardo|author2=Piekarewicz Sigal, Mina|title=M\u00e9xico, el 6 de julio de 1988 : segundo informe sobre la democracia|editor=Gonz\u00e1lez Casanova, Pablo |publisher=Siglo Vientiuno Editores : Centro de Investigaciones Interdisciplinarias en Humanidades, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico|location=Mexico City|year=1990|chapter=La organizaci\u00f3n de las elecciones|isbn=978-968-23-1651-7 |oclc=23953244 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTdvt22y08QC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76|accessdate=2009-04-19|language=Spanish}}</ref> Suspicions later grew as [[Congress of the Union|Congress]] voted (with support from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Revolutionary Institutional]] and [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action]] parties)<ref name=\"aguayo-boletas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sergioaguayo.org/articulos/2008/ART08-01-16.pdf |title=Las boletas |last=Aguayo Quezada |first=Sergio |date=2008-01-16 |publisher=Reforma |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-04-19 |quote=El 88 termin\u00f3 siendo un detonante de la transici\u00f3n y cal\u00f3 muy hondo la ignominiosa quema de las boletas electorales de 1988 aprobada por el PRI y el PAN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003064650/http://www.sergioaguayo.org/articulos/2008/ART08-01-16.pdf |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> to destroy without opening the electoral documentation.

When the PRI candidate in the 1994 elections, [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] was assassinated in March 1994, new restrictions barring cabinet ministers who had not resigned in the six months previous to the election date from being candidates for the presidency meant that Salinas had a small pool of eligible choices.\n\n===Domestic issues===\nIn his inaugural address in December 1988, he outlined an ambitious and important goal of \"modernizing\" Mexico.\"<ref>Roberto Blancarte, \"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach\".

Article 6, fn. 40.</ref>\n\nDuring his six-year term in office (''sexenio'') major changes were made to the [[Constitution of 1917]] that affected political reform; church-state relations, ending many aspects of [[anticlericalism]] restricting the Catholic Church and other religious organizations; agrarian reform, ending redistribution of land under Article 27; and policy changes on \"indigenous peoples, human rights, economic activities of the state, [and] criminal due process.\"<ref name=\"Jorge A. Vargas 1998\"/>\n\n====First steps====\nImmediately upon his inauguration, he arrested prominent union leaders, many of whom were his opponents in the PRI, among other measures to demonstrate his determination to set his own course. His government privatized state-run companies, including Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico, sold to PRI-insider [[Carlos Slim]], as well as re-privatizing banks that President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] had nationalized at the end of his term. The funds from these sales of state assets helped pay off Mexico's internal debt.  However, there were also bailouts for banks and the Mexican toll roads that became scandals.<ref>Bussey, \"Carlos Salinas de Gortari\", p. 1331</ref>\n\n====Economic policy====\nSalinas continued with the [[neoliberal]] economic policy of his predecessor [[Miguel de la Madrid]] and converted Mexico into a regulatory state.<ref>Remonda Bensabat Kleinberg,  \"Strategic Alliances: State\u2010Business Relations in Mexico Under Neo\u2010Liberalism and Crisis.\" ''Bulletin of Latin American Research'' 18.1 (1999): 71-87.</ref> During his presidential term,  he aggressively privatized hundreds of state-run companies, including telecommunications, steel, and mining.

Shortly after leaving office, due to the so-called [[Mexican peso crisis|December Mistake]], inflation rose again to 51%.\n\nDuring his term, the peso devalued from 2.65 MXP to 3.60 [[MXN]] per U.S. dollar by November 30, 1994, the last day of his term; thus the peso devalued far less than it had in the two previous terms. (The peso was later devalued from 4 per dollar to 7.2 in a single week due to the \"December Mistake.\")\n\n====Poverty alleviation====\nSalinas established the National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL), a [[Social Welfare in Mexico|social welfare program]], as a way to directly aid poor Mexicans, but also create a network of support for Salinas.<ref>Bruhn, Kathleen. \"Social spending and political support: The\" lessons\" of the National Solidarity Program in Mexico.\" Comparative Politics (1996): 151-177.</ref>  It was his first official act as president.  The program channeled public funds, which the administration said came largely from privatization of  state-owned companies, into impoverished areas to improve roads, the electrical grid, schools, and clinics in order to raise levels of education and health and link remote areas, with lack of oversight in its spending.<ref>Paul Lawrence Haber, \"Neoliberalism\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

Salinas's Harvard doctoral dissertation had examined the relationship between social programs and political support for the government. Given the Salinas's questionable legitimacy as the winner of the 1988 election, PRONASOL was seen as a way for Salinas to deliver immediate benefits to the poor and avert their turning to other political parties or worse. It did not prioritize funding for Mexico's poorest states, but rather to states with middle-income populations where elections were most contested and where the PRI had lost. Politically, the program sought to undermine the appeal of leftists, especially [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]].<ref>Haber, \"Neoliberalism\", p. 1016.</ref> In Chiapas, PRONASOL channeled increased funds in 1993 and 1994, but it did not prevent the [[Zapatista uprising]], which showed that the program had only a limited impact.<ref>Jonathan Fox, \"Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, (PRONASOL)\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1360-1362</ref><ref>Cornelius, Wayne, Ann Craig, and Jonathan Fox, eds.

In the 1980s, the church saw electoral participation reform and fighting electoral fraud as an issue. Sometime during the presidential campaign, the PRI had indicated to the Church that a Salinas victory would be beneficial to the Church. It has been considered a quid pro quo agreement.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'', see esp. chapter 5, \"Salinismo, the Church, and Quid Pro Quo\".</ref>\nA delegation of the leadership of the episcopal hierarchy attended the inauguration of Salinas on December 1, 1988.<ref>Tangeman, ''Mexico at the Crossroads'' p. 71-72.</ref> After the 1988 election the Mexican bishops did not make public statements about the election results. Behind the scenes the apostolic delegate to Mexico, the Vatican's representative, Mexican bishops, and government officials had a series of secret meetings that hammered out the outlines of a new Church-State relationship. In his inaugural address, Salinas de Gortari announced a program to \"modernize\" Mexico via structural transformation. \"The modern state is a state which ... maintains transparency and updates its relation with political parties, entrepreneurial groups, and the church.\"<ref>Salinas, quoted in Roberto Blancarte, \"Recent Changes in Church-State Relations in Mexico: An Historical Approach.\" ''Journal of Church & State'', Autumn 1993, vol. 35.

A major change was the creation of the [[Instituto Nacional Electoral|Federal Electoral Institute]] (IFE) in October 1990, taking elections out of the hands of the Ministry of the Interior to create an independent entity.\n\nThe [[1994 Mexican general election|1994 elections]] were the first to have international observers, and were considered, at that time, the fairest elections in the century, although not free of controversy.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/world/mexico-invites-un-to-attend-election-to-observe-the-observers.html |title= Mexico Invites U.N. to Attend Election to Observe the Observers|author= Tim Golden|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date = May 13, 1994}}</ref>  For the first time, the PRI lost its two-thirds majority in Congress, which is necessary to conduct constitutional reforms.<ref name=\"Rivera Ayala 2008 388\">{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=388}}</ref>\n\n====Human rights====\nIn 1990, the [[National Human Rights Commission (Mexico)|National Human Rights Commission]] (''Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos'') was created.<ref name=\"Delgado de Cant\u00fa 2003 484\">{{cite book|last=Delgado de Cant\u00fa|first=Gloria M.|title=M\u00e9xico, estructuras pol\u00edtica, econ\u00f3mica y social|year=2003|publisher=Pearson Educaci\u00f3n|pages=484}}</ref>  Initially a government agency, it became a separate entity,\n\n====Education====\nIn 1992, Salinas and his Secretary of Education, [[Ernesto Zedillo]] introduced new compulsory history texts in Mexican schools, part of the Mexican Free-Textbook Program. Authored by [[:es:Enrique Florescano|Enrique Florescano]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Aguilar Cam\u00edn]], the new textbooks set off a storm of controversy. Shifts in emphasis concerned the [[Porfiriato]] and the role of foreign investment, [[Emiliano Zapata]], lauding him as a hero despite his having opposed every government in power; [[U.S.-Mexico relations]], avoiding negative treatment of the history; and the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]], treating it dispassionately.  The government was compelled to withdraw them in January 1993.  According to one assessment, \"While the 1992 textbook controversy disclosed new support for the regime from the right, it also revealed an erosion of support and discipline within officialdom.\"<ref>Dennis Gilbert, \"Rewriting History: Salinas, Zedillo and the 1992 Textbook Controversy.\" ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'' 13(2), summer 1997 p. 295.</ref>\n\n===North American Free Trade Agreement===\n{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}\n{{See also|Effects of NAFTA on Mexico}}\n[[File:Nafta.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Carlos Salinas (left), [[George H.&nbsp;W.

The agreement was a reversal of Mexico's longstanding policies of economic nationalism and anti-Americanism and was intended to create a single market. Mexican proponents of NAFTA saw it in a way to secure markets for its exports and attract foreign investment, and create jobs, help the government to be able to service its foreign debt, and overall, promote economic recovery. In Mexico, the reversal was controversial, opposed by organized labor, many academics, and nongovernmental organizations.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 1021-22.</ref>\n\n===Drug trafficking and corruption===\n{{Main|Mexican Drug War}}\nAn issue of importance both domestic and foreign policy is drug trafficking. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Mexico was a transit country for [[cocaine]] produced in Colombia and destined for consumers in the United States. President De la Madrid considered drug trafficking a national security issue and devoted government funding to it. Salinas expanded this funding, but neither president stemmed the growth of trafficking and its impact on Mexico. Drug trafficking is highly lucrative for those involved with it, and Mexico's weak law enforcement and judicial system could not prevent the wide-scale involvement of Mexico's poorly-paid police from being corrupted. The Mexican military to a lesser extent was corrupted, along with politicians, and some journalists. Such corruption undermined the possibility of rule of law and it prevented Mexicans from having trust in the state. A rising level of violence by drug traffickers against the state, witnesses, journalists, and bystanders.<ref>Maria Celila Toro, \"Drug Trade\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 419-20.</ref>  The Mexican government did capture and jail some high-level drug mafia leaders, including [[Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo]] in 1989, whose arrest made visible the extent of law enforcement collusion.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/world/in-mexico-drug-roots-run-deep.html?pagewanted=1 accessed 24 March 2019.</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nSalinas negotiated the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), with the United States and Canada.  Salinas also renegotiated Mexico's foreign debt. In 1990, Salinas had traveled to Europe to attract non-North American capital investment, but dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc opened them to foreign investment; Mexico was less attractive to them and Salinas turned to North America.<ref>Luz Mar\u00eda de la Mora, \"North American Free Trade Agreement\", p. 1021.</ref> Critics say that  NAFTA has had mixed results for Mexico: while there has been huge increase in commerce and foreign investment, this has not been at all the case for employment and salaries.<ref name=\"eluniversal.com.mx\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Mexico hosted the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a venue where the parties in the civil war in El Salvador signed an accord ending the long conflict.<ref>Diana Negroponte, \"Implementation of the Chapultepec Peace Accords\" in ''Seeking Peace in El Salvador: The Struggle to Reconstruct a Nation at the End of the Cold War''. New York: Palgrave MacMillan 2012</ref>\n\nMexico reestablished diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Moreover, Mexico became member of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). The First [[Ibero-American Summit]] was held and the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], a peace agreement for El Salvador, were signed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rivera Ayala|first=Clara|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico II|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning Editores|pages=393}}</ref>\n\nSalinas in 1991 visited United States to help convince the Illinois Governor, [[James R. Thompson]] to pardon four Mexican citizens from a quadruple murder known as the Milwaukee Ave Massacre, that took place in 1981 in Chicago, Illinois. With the help of Carlos Salinas de Gortari the four men, Joaquin Varela, Rogelio Arroyo, Ignacio Varela, and Isauro Sanchez, had their sentences commuted, later pardoned by Governor [[Jim Edgar]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==1994 Election year==\nAs the 1994 presidential election approached, Salinas had the crucial decision to designate the candidate for the PRI; that person had always gone on to win the presidential election. \"The shipwreck of the 1988 succession should have sufficed to teach Salinas to prevent another disaster from befalling the system he had inherited.\"<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 89.</ref> At the time Salinas made the choice, popularity and credibility was high over the course of his presidency,<ref>Villarreal, Andres. \u201cPublic Opinion of the Economy and the President among Mexico City Residents: The Salinas Sexenio.\u201d Latin American Research Review, vol. 34, no. 2, 1999, p. 131 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2503915 accessed 21 March 2019</ref> but a series of events in the final year of his presidency changed that.\n\n===Choosing the PRI Nominee===\n\nThe \"unveiling\" of the PRI candidate for the presidency was on 28 November 1993, with Salinas choosing [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]]. Those considered for the position were [[Manuel Camacho Solis|Manuel Camacho]] and Colosio, with earlier contenders, such as [[Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog Flores|Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog]] and [[Pedro Aspe]] being eliminated. Aspe, a graduate of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] had a high international profile, but was considered unlikely to actually attract voters.  The changed circumstances of the Mexican political system, as demonstrated by Salinas's own election to the presidency, meant that being designated the PRI did not guarantee election. Aspe was not a charismatic prospect as a candidate who could energize and charm voters.  With the potential that Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas was likely to run again for the presidency, the PRI needed to field someone who could garner votes.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 92-96.</ref>\n\n===Zapatista rebellion===\n{{Main|Zapatista Army of National Liberation}}\n[[File:Flag of the EZLN.jpg|thumb|Flag of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN)]]\nThe uprising in Chiapas on 1 January 1994 coincided with the date that the NAFTA came into effect. The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', EZLN) issued their first declaration from the state of [[Chiapas]] in southern Mexico. Salinas's immediate response was to find for a peaceful solution: offering pardon to deposed arms; ordering a cease fire; appointing a peace negotiator, and sending Mexican Congress a General Amnesty Law. Salinas's presidential successor took a harder line when he was inaugurated. But Salinas's more peaceful solution [[1995 Zapatista Crisis|Zapatista uprising]] was legal and politically pragmatic, likely saving many lives in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&article=12183|title=La \u00danica l\u00ednea es que no tenemos l\u00ednea|website=Enlineadirecta.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf|format=PDF|title=Buzos|website=Buzos.com.mx|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&rl=wh&#93; |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825194625/https://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958 |archive-date=August 25, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Zapatista rebellion did not spread regionally or nationwide, but the fact that it happened and that international attention was drawn to this poor region of Mexico just as NAFTA was implemented meant that Salinas's careful plans for a peaceful political transition with his legacy intact were obliterated.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 106</ref> Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho, Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the government's peace mediator. For Salinas, this had political benefits, since Camacho, having been passed over as the PRI presidential candidate, could have bolted from the party. With this important appointment, he was in the public limelight again.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', p. 107.</ref>\n\n===Assassination of Colosio and the new PRI Candidate===\n[[File:Luis Donaldo Colosio Los Pinos Mexico 2018.jpg|thumb|Bust of Colosio at Los Pinos]]\nA spectacular political event of 1994 was the assassination of Salinas's handpicked PRI presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]] in March 1994, upending the already complex electoral situation with elections scheduled for August 1994. The Zapatista uprising had ruined Salinas's plans for a peaceful transition of Mexico in the elections.  There is evidence that Salinas and Colosio began to disagree, not unusual after the electoral transfer, but this occurred prior to it. His campaign languished with lack of funding, Colosio had problems getting media coverage, given the high-profile events in Chiapas. Salinas prevented Colosio from going to Chiapas, while the explanation that his presence there would complicate the situation. Increasingly there was the impression that Salinas would reverse his decision for Colosio, substituting someone else, perhaps [[Manuel Camacho]]. Camacho was a politically savvy former [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Head of Government of Mexico City]] as well as Peace Commissioner in Chiapas.  Salinas made a public statement on 17 January 1994, affirming his choice as candidate, but this was at the insistence of Colosio. Salinas extracted a pledge from Camacho that he had no designs on the presidency, which he renounced the day before Colosio's assassination in Tijuana 23 March 1994.<ref>Casta\u00f1eda, ''Perpetuating Power'', pp. 108- 109</ref>  After a few days of weighing his options, Salinas chose Colosio's campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, former Minister of Education, as the new PRI candidate for the presidency. Zedillo had been Secretary of Education, a relatively unimportant ministry; he had resigned to run the campaign of Colosio. Zedillo had never held elective office, sharing that trait with De la Madrid and Salinas, but Zedillo was not otherwise experienced politically. He was perceived as a weak candidate. There are speculation that Salinas wished to perpetuate his power as [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] had in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], controlling successor presidents.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1641</ref>\n\n===1994 General Election===\n{{See|1994 Mexican general election}}\nAfter considering whether to postpone the general election scheduled for 21 August 1994, Salinas chose Zedillo to run as the PRI candidate for the presidency and the elections took place as scheduled. Voters came out in large numbers to choose between three main candidates, Zedillo for the PRI, C\u00e1rdenas for the Party of Democratic Revolution, and [[Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos]] for the PAN. Zedillo won a clear victory, in what were considered by foreign observers as free and fair. In results published by the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), Zedillo got 48.7%, Cevallos 25.9%, and C\u00e1rdenas 16.6%.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20061115072642/http://www.ife.org.mx/documentos/RESELEC/nuevo_1994/pres_94/nac_edo/nac_pre_94.html accessed 25 March 2019</ref>\n\n===Another political assassination===\nFollowing the election in September 1994, Secretary General of the PRI [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], Salinas' former brother-in-law, was assassinated in downtown Mexico City in broad daylight. The murder was not solved during Salinas's presidency, even when [[:es:Mario Ruiz Massieu|Mario Ruiz Massieu]] (Francisco's brother) was the [[Attorney General of Mexico|attorney general]] and in charge of the investigation.\n\n===Economic issues===\nThe economic bubble gave Mexico a prosperity not seen in a generation. This period of rapid growth coupled with low inflation prompted some political thinkers and the media to state that Mexico was on the verge of becoming a \"First World nation\". In fact, it was the first of the \"newly industrialized nations\" to be admitted into the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in May 1994. It was known that the peso was overvalued, but the extent of the Mexican economy's vulnerability was either not well known or downplayed by both the Salinas administration and the media.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This vulnerability was further aggravated by several unexpected events and macroeconomic mistakes made in the last year of his administration.\n\nSeveral economists and historians have analyzed some of the events and policy mistakes that precipitated the crisis of December 1994.<ref>Hufbauer and Schoot, (2005)</ref> In keeping with the PRI election-year practices, Salinas launched a spending spree to finance popular projects, which translated into a historically high deficit. This budget deficit was coupled with a current account deficit, fueled by excessive consumer spending as allowed by the overvalued peso. In order to finance this deficit, the Salinas administration issued ''tesobonos'', an attractive debt instrument that insured payment in dollars instead of pesos.\n\nIncreasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (''tesobono'') investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9&nbsp;billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, in order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves.<ref>Hufbauer & Schott, 2005</ref> Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the [[Bank of Mexico]] decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.\n\n==Successor first days crises==\n===Peso devaluation===\n{{See also|1994 economic crisis in Mexico}}\nSoon after taking office, Zedillo announced that his government would let the fixed exchange rate band increase 15 percent (up to 4 pesos per US$), by stopping the unorthodox measures employed by the previous administration to keep it at the previous fixed level (e.g.,&nbsp;by selling dollars, assuming debt, and so on). This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While experts agree that devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects. Whether the effects were aggravated further or not, the result was that the peso crashed under a floating regime from four pesos to the dollar (with the previous increase of 15%) to 7.2 to the dollar in the space of a week.\n\nMexican businesses with debts to be paid in dollars, or that relied on supplies bought from the United States, suffered an immediate hit, with mass industrial lay-offs and several suicides.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} To make matters worse, the devaluation announcement was made mid-week, on a Wednesday, and for the remainder of the week foreign investors fled the Mexican market without any government action to prevent or discourage the flight until the following Monday, when it was too late.\n\nSalinas faced widespread criticism in Mexico. He was widely blamed for the collapse of the economy and his privatization of several government-run businesses such as Telmex.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} With respect to the collapse of the economy, he rapidly responded by blaming Zedillo's \"inept\" handling of the situation, coining the term \"December mistake\" to refer to the crisis and Zedillo's mistakes. He then argued that he had talked to Zedillo of a possibility of \"sharing the burden\" of the devaluation by allowing the peso to devaluate a certain percent before his term was over, and the rest of the necessary devaluation would have been done during Zedillo's administration.\n\n===Zapatista Crisis===\nInitially the Zedillo administration followed Salinas's policies regarding the negotiations with the Zapatistas, pledging to reach a peaceful resolution to the Chiapas crisis. Zedillo then reversed course and on February 9, 1995, identifying [[Subcomandante Marcos]] to be [[Subcomandante Marcos|Rafael Sebasti\u00e1n Guill\u00e9n Vicente]], and pursued military intervention. He abandoned that unsuccessful strategy and peace talks were subsequently re-established. Zedillo's zigzag policies in Chiapas were consistent with some others of his administration.<ref>Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997 p. 1641</ref>\n\n===Break with Zedillo, Ra\u00fal Salinas arrest and self-exile===\nErnesto Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who had no political experience or independent base of power. There was a perception that Salinas wanted to follow the precedent of [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] who wielded tremendous power over three successor presidents following the 1928 assassination of president-elect [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]].<ref>Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" p. 1640</ref> However, this changed when by order of [[Ernesto Zedillo|president Zedillo]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siempre.mx/2019/04/la-corte-y-los-calzones-del-presidente/|title=La corte y los calzones del presidente|date=2019-04-11|website=Siempre!|language=es|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> Salinas's older brother [[Ra\u00fal Salinas]] was arrested on 28 February 1995 under charges of orchestrating the assasination of Ruiz Massieu; the arrest dramatically shifted the political situation. Since 1940 when president [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] left the presidency and turned power over to his successor, Mexican former presidents had not directly intervened in politics. After the arrest of his brother, Salinas went on television, expressing his outrage at Zedillo. In the broadcast he placed the blame for the December peso crisis on Zedillo, resulting in the loss of Mexican jobs, bankruptcies, and the tarnishing of Mexico's image.<ref>Andres Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos: Guerrillas, Stockbrokers, Politicians, and Mexico's Road to Prosperity''. Boston: Little Brown and Company 2000, p. 1996.</ref>\n\nSalinas abandoned his campaign -which had been backed by the United States- to become the Director-General of the [[World Trade Organization]] and left Mexico City, going to Monterrey where he staged a publicized hunger strike in the home of a PRI supporter. [[Arturo Warman]], Minister of Agrarian Reform, was sent to Monterrey to persuade Salinas to return to Mexico City. Salinas demanded that the government issue a statement clearing him of responsibility for the Colosio case and the December 20 devaluation. Salinas returned to Mexico City and he and Zedillo met. Zedillo's government issued a statement absolving Salinas of the Colosio murder and tempered his criticism of Salinas in the peso crisis.<ref>Oppenheimer, ''Bordering on Chaos'', pp. 207-08</ref>  Salinas left Mexico for self-imposed exile and settled in Ireland for a period.\n\n==Post-Presidential years==\nSalinas's reputation was to be further clouded by a series of controversies involving close family members. His brother Ra\u00fal had been arrested in February 1995. In November 1995, Ra\u00fal's wife, [[:es:Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n|Paulina Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Casta\u00f1\u00f3n]], were arrested in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], after attempting to withdraw US$84 million from an account owned by Ra\u00fal Salinas under an alias. Their capture led to the unveiling of a vast fortune spread around the world and amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, even though Ra\u00fal Salinas had never officially received an annual income of more than $190,000. A report by the U.S. [[General Accounting Office]] indicated that Ra\u00fal Salinas had transferred over $90 million out of Mexico into private bank accounts in London and Switzerland through a complex set of transactions between 1992 and 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/os99001.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRIVATE BANKING : Raul Salinas, Citibank, and Alleged Money Laundering|website=Gao.gov|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> In 2008, the government of Switzerland turned over $74 million, out of the $110 million in frozen bank accounts held by Ra\u00fal Salinas, to the government of Mexico. The Swiss Justice Ministry indicated that the Mexican government had demonstrated that $66 million of the funds had been misappropriated, and the funds, with interest, were returned to Mexico. The Salinas family would not receive back any of the frozen funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Salinas_funds_finally_head_back_to_Mexico.html?cid=6740256 |title=Switzerland will return blocked Salinas funds to Mexico \u2013 swissinfo |website=Swissinfo.ch |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, while Salinas was in exile and his brother Ra\u00fal in jail, their father, Ra\u00fal Salinas Lozano was accused in a U.S court of being connected to drug dealing by a convicted Mexican trafficker, Magdalena Ruiz Pelayo; the senior Salinas denied the charges.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/31/world/scandal-pushes-powerful-family-from-pinnacle-in-mexico.html</ref>\n\nSalinas divorced his first wife, Cecilia Occelli Gonz\u00e1lez, in 1995 soon after leaving office. That same year he married his second wife, Ana Paula Gerard.<ref name=cg/>\n\nIn January 1999, after a four-year trial, Salinas' older brother Ra\u00fal was convicted of ordering the murder of the PRI official (and Salinas' brother-in-law) [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz Massieu]] and sentenced to 50 years in prison. In July 1999, an appeals court cut the sentence to 27 1/2 years. In June 2005, the conviction was overturned, and Ra\u00fal Salinas was freed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4079372.stm|title=Mexico frees ex-leader's brother|date=June 10, 2005|accessdate=December 2, 2018|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn December 6, 2004, Salinas's youngest brother, [[Enrique Salinas|Enrique]], was found dead in [[Huixquilucan]], [[Estado de M\u00e9xico]], inside his car with a plastic bag strapped around his head.

The show aired from September 10, 2005 to October 14, 2006. In 2008, after a hiatus, the show was renewed for season 2. The show is about four female teenagers who run their own [[teen magazine]].\n\nThe voice actors are [[Olivia Hack]], [[Soleil Moon Frye]], [[Tia Mowry]], [[Dionne Quan]], [[Wendie Malick]], [[Lacey Chabert]], and [[Kaley Cuoco]]. In season 2, not only the voice actors were different, but replaced with Canadian voice actors as well, [[Britt McKillip]], [[Britt Irvin]], Dorla Bell, [[Maryke Hendrikse]], [[Ellie Harvie]], [[Kelly Sheridan]], and [[Ashleigh Ball]] all star in season 2. Other Bratz shows such as ''[[Bratzillaz (web series)|Bratzillaz]]'' and ''[[Bratz: C.I.Y. Shoppe Webseries]]'' have a different plot and they serve as reboots. ''Bratz'' also had a lot of films. Some of them had the Bratz Babyz and Bratz Kidz characters or the Bratz in their original style. They featured different voice actors for both seasons. The show also spawned video games based on the films.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the fictional city of Stylesville, the show revolves around four teenagers (Cloe, Jade, Sasha, Yasmin) running their own [[teen magazine]], titled \"Bratz\", while struggling school life at Stiles High School. Their rival magazine is \"Your Thing\", owned and run by the proud and demanding self-proclaimed \"Reigning Queen of Fashion\" Burdine Maxwell, and her mean identical twin interns Kirstee and Kaycee, known infamously as \"the Tweevils\". Accompanied by their friends Dylan, Cameron and Eitan, the girls' issues are exploited throughout the series, both in and outside of Stylesville.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n====Bratz Magazine====\n'''Cloe''' (Angel) (voiced by [[Olivia Hack]] in season 1; [[Britt McKillip]] in season 2): Cloe is charge of the \"Dear Cloe\" column in the magazine, where readers write to her for teen advice. She is characterised by her romantic, dreamy and outgoing attitude, as well as her highly dramatic tendencies, hence specialising in acting and debating. Although she enjoys shopping and fashion, she plays in a tomboy side through skateboarding and riding a motorcycle. Her love interest is Cameron.\n\n'''Sasha''' (Bunny Boo) (voiced by [[Tia Mowry]] in season 1; Dorla Bell in season 2): Sasha is the music editor of the group and specializes in hip-hop dancing and creating songs. She is described by her bold and sassy attitude, although this can sometimes backfire and make her become perfectionistic and controlling. Like Cloe, she can be a tomboy sometimes, which is reflected in her fashion of dressing.\n\n'''Jade''' (Kool Kat) (voiced by [[Soleil Moon Frye]] in season 1; [[Britt Irvin]] in season 2): Jade is the fashion editor of the group with a bubbly, open and sensitive personality. After she gets unreasonably fired from an internship at \"Your Thing\" magazine by Burdine, the girls decided to make their own magazine. \n\n'''Yasmin''' (Pretty Princess) (voiced by [[Dionne Quan]] in season 1; [[Maryke Hendrikse]] in season 2): Yasmin is  the leader of Bratz and the main journalist for the magazine due to her passion for literature. Known for her sensitive, sweet and intelligent personality, she has a strong philanthropic side, owning her own animal shelter. Her love interest is Eitan.\n\n====Your Thing Magazine====\n'''Burdine Maxwell''' (voiced by [[Wendie Malick]] in season 1; [[Ellie Harvie]] in season 2): Burdine is the head of \"Your Thing\" magazine. She is, in reality, unintentionally responsible for the creation of Bratz magazine after firing Jade unreasonably during the latter's internship. Quick to anger, impatient and bossy, she proclaims herself the \"Reigning Queen of Fashion\", choosing to uphold this title by dressing constantly in same pink suits and owning over 50 pairs of old-fashioned pink pumps. She dotes on her [[Miniature Pinscher]] Royale and has an almost identical-looking sister named Burnice.\n\n'''Kirstee''' (voiced by [[Kaley Cuoco]] in season 1; [[Ashleigh Ball]] in season 2): Kirstee the oldest of the Tweevils who does her bun with a crown-shaped hair tie.

The show aired from September 10, 2005 to October 14, 2006. In 2008, after a hiatus, the show was renewed for season 2. The show is about four female teenagers who run their own [[teen magazine]].\n\nThe voice actors are [[Olivia Hack]], [[Soleil Moon Frye]], [[Tia Mowry]], [[Dionne Quan]], [[Wendie Malick]], [[Lacey Chabert]], and [[Kaley Cuoco]]. In season 2, not only the voice actors were different, but replaced with Canadian voice actors as well, [[Britt McKillip]], [[Britt Irvin]], Dorla Bell, [[Maryke Hendrikse]], [[Ellie Harvie]], [[Kelly Sheridan]], and [[Ashleigh Ball]] all star in season 2. Other Bratz shows such as ''[[Bratzillaz (web series)|Bratzillaz]]'' and ''[[Bratz: C.I.Y. Shoppe Webseries]]'' have a different plot and they serve as reboots. ''Bratz'' also had a lot of films. Some of them had the Bratz Babyz and Bratz Kidz characters or the Bratz in their original style. They featured different voice actors for both seasons. The show also spawned video games based on the films.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the fictional city of Stylesville, the show revolves around four teenagers (Cloe, Jade, Sasha, Yasmin) running their own [[teen magazine]], titled \"Bratz\", while struggling school life at Stiles High School. Their rival magazine is \"Your Thing\", owned and run by the proud and demanding self-proclaimed \"Reigning Queen of Fashion\" Burdine Maxwell, and her mean identical twin interns Kirstee and Kaycee, known infamously as \"the Tweevils\". Accompanied by their friends Dylan, Cameron and Ethan, the girls' issues are exploited throughout the series, both in and outside of Stylesville.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n====Bratz Magazine====\n'''Cloe''' (Angel) (voiced by [[Olivia Hack]] in season 1; [[Britt McKillip]] in season 2): Cloe is charge of the \"Dear Cloe\" column in the magazine, where readers write to her for teen advice. She is characterised by her romantic, dreamy and outgoing attitude, as well as her highly dramatic tendencies, hence specialising in acting and debating. Although she enjoys shopping and fashion, she plays in a tomboy side through skateboarding and riding a motorcycle. Her love interest is Cameron.\n\n'''Sasha''' (Bunny Boo) (voiced by [[Tia Mowry]] in season 1; Dorla Bell in season 2): Sasha is the music editor of the group and specializes in hip-hop dancing and creating songs. She is described by her bold and sassy attitude, although this can sometimes backfire and make her become perfectionistic and controlling. Like Cloe, she can be a tomboy sometimes, which is reflected in her fashion of dressing.\n\n'''Jade''' (Kool Kat) (voiced by [[Soleil Moon Frye]] in season 1; [[Britt Irvin]] in season 2): Jade is the fashion editor of the group with a bubbly, open and sensitive personality. After she gets unreasonably fired from an internship at \"Your Thing\" magazine by Burdine, the girls decided to make their own magazine. \n\n'''Yasmin''' (Pretty Princess) (voiced by [[Dionne Quan]] in season 1; [[Maryke Hendrikse]] in season 2): Yasmin is  the leader of Bratz and the main journalist for the magazine due to her passion for literature.

She dotes on her [[Miniature Pinscher]] Royale and has an almost identical-looking sister named Burnice.\n\n'''Kirstee''' (voiced by [[Kaley Cuoco]] in season 1; [[Ashleigh Ball]] in season 2): Kirstee the oldest of the Tweevils who does her bun with a crown-shaped hair tie.

His ideas, including support for a [[Economic liberalism|liberal economy]], free and equal public instruction, [[constitutionalism|constitutional]] government, and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for women and people of all races, have been said to embody the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and Enlightenment [[rationalism]]. He died in prison after a period of flight from French Revolutionary authorities.\n\n==Early years==\nCondorcet was born in [[Ribemont]] (in present-day [[Aisne]]), descended from the ancient family of Caritat, who took their title from the town of [[Condorcet, Dr\u00f4me|Condorcet]] in [[Dauphin\u00e9]], of which they were long-time residents. Fatherless at a young age, he was raised by his devoutly religious mother. He was educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College in [[Reims]] and at the ''[[Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre]]'' in Paris, where he quickly showed his intellectual ability and gained his first public distinctions in [[mathematics]]. When he was sixteen, his analytical abilities gained the praise of [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Alexis Clairaut]]; soon, Condorcet would study under d'Alembert.\n\nFrom 1765 to 1774, he focused on science. In 1765, he published his first work on mathematics, entitled ''Essai sur le [[integral calculus|calcul int\u00e9gral]]'', which was well received, launching his career as a mathematician. He went on to publish more papers, and on 25 February 1769, he was elected to the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Acad\u00e9mie royale des Sciences]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ellen Judy Wilson|author2=Peter Hanns Reill|title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&pg=PA124|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=124\u201325|isbn=9781438110219}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anne Robert Jacques Turgot.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Jacques Turgot was Condorcet's mentor and longtime friend]]\nIn 1772, he published another paper on [[integral calculus]]. Soon after, he met [[Jacques Turgot]], a French economist, and the two became friends. Turgot became an administrator under [[King of France|King]] [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1772 and [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finance]] under [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1774.\n\nCondorcet worked with [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. He soon became an honorary member of many foreign academies and philosophic societies, including the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (1785), the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1792)<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\nand also in Prussia and Russia.\n\nHis political ideas, many in congruity with Turgot's, were criticized heavily in the English-speaking world, however, most notably by [[John Adams]] who wrote two of his principal works of political philosophy to oppose Turgot's and Condorcet's unicameral legislature and radical democracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldstreicher|first=David|title=A Companion to John Adams and John Quincy Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82lNLcxLL5sC&pg=PT64|year=2013|publisher=Wiley|page=64|isbn=9781118524299}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nIn 1774, Condorcet was appointed inspector general of the [[Monnaie de Paris|Paris mint]] by Turgot.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Efrosini Gregory|title=Freedom in French Enlightenment Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poya_r2az2sC&pg=PA148|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=148|isbn=9781433109393}}</ref> From this point on, Condorcet shifted his focus from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political matters. In the following years, he took up the defense of [[human rights]] in general, and of [[Women's rights|women's]] and [[Black (people)|Blacks']] rights in particular (an [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]], he became active in the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] in the 1780s). He supported the ideals embodied by the newly formed United States, and proposed projects of political, administrative and economic reforms intended to transform France.\n\nIn 1776, Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. Consequently, Condorcet submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the ''[[Monnaie de Paris|Monnaie]]'', but the request was refused, and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later wrote ''Vie de M. Turgot'' (1786), a biography which spoke fondly of Turgot and advocated Turgot's economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious appointments: in 1777, he became Permanent Secretary of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]], holding the post until the abolition of the Acad\u00e9mie in 1793; and, in 1782, secretary of the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Daston|first=Lorraine|title=Classical Probability in the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oq8XNbKyUewC&pg=PA104|year=1995|publisher=Princeton UP|page=104|isbn=9780691006444}}</ref>\n\n==Condorcet's paradox and the Condorcet method==\n{{main|Condorcet method}}\n\nIn 1785, Condorcet published his ''Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions'',<ref>{{cite book| url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k417181\n| title=Essai sur l'application de l'analyse \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions rendues \u00e0 la pluralit\u00e9 des voix | format=PNG | language=French | accessdate=2008-03-10 | author=Marquis de Condorcet | authorlink=Marquis de Condorcet| year=1785 }}</ref> one of his most important works.  This work described several now famous results, including [[Condorcet's jury theorem]], which states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases as the number of members of the group increases, and [[Condorcet's paradox]], which shows that majority preferences can become [[intransitivity|intransitive]] with three or more options \u2013 it is possible for a certain electorate to express a preference for A over B, a preference for B over C, and a preference for C over A, all from the same set of ballots.<ref>{{cite book|author=Douglas J.

He disagreed strongly with the alternative method of aggregating preferences put forth by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (based on summed [[Non-parametric statistics|rankings of alternatives]]). Condorcet was one of the first to systematically apply mathematics in the [[social sciences]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Other works==\nIn 1781, Condorcet wrote a pamphlet, ''Reflections on Negro Slavery'', in which he denounced [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Sociological Analysis|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsociolo0000bott|chapter-url-access=registration|last=Bierstedt|first=Robert|publisher=Basic Books|year=1978|isbn=0-465-03023-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofsociolo0000bott/page/19 19]|chapter=Sociological Thought in the Eighteenth Century|editor1-last=Bottomore|editor1-first=Tom|editor2-first=Robert|editor2-last=Nisbet}}</ref>  In 1786, Condorcet worked on ideas for the [[Derivative|differential]] and [[integral calculus]], giving a new treatment of [[infinitesimal]]s \u2013 a work which apparently was never published. In 1789, he published ''Vie de Voltaire (1789)'', which agreed with [[Voltaire]] in his opposition to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. In 1791, Condorcet, along with Sophie de Grouchy, [[Thomas Paine]], [[Pierre \u00c9tienne Louis Dumont|Etienne Dumont]], [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Jacques-Pierre Brissot]], and Achilles Duchastellet published a brief journal titled ''Le R\u00e9publicain'', its main goal being the promotion of republicanism and the rejection of constitutional monarchy. The journal's theme was that any sort of monarchy is a threat to freedom no matter who is leading and that liberty is freedom from domination.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berges|first=Sandrine|year=2015|title=Sophie de Grouchy on the Cost of Domination in the Letters on Sympathy and Two Anonymous Articles in Le R\u00e9publicain|url=|journal=Monist|volume=98|pages=102\u201312|via=Florida International University|doi=10.1093/monist/onu011|hdl=11693/12519}}</ref>\n\nIn 1795, Condorcet had a book published called ''[[Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind]]''.

As a result, in 1791 he was elected as a Paris representative in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and then became the secretary of the Assembly.\n\nIn April 1792 Condorcet presented a project for the reformation of the education system, aiming to create a hierarchical system, under the authority of experts, who would work as the guardians of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and who, independent of power, would be the guarantors of public liberties. The project was judged to be contrary to the republican and egalitarian virtues, giving the education of the Nation over to an aristocracy of savants. The institution adopted Condorcet's design for the state education system, and he drafted a proposed [[Constitutional monarchy|Bourbon Constitution]] for the new France.\n\nHe advocated [[women's suffrage]] for the new government, writing an article for ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1789'', and by publishing ''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cit\u00e9'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060616060257/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/condorcet4.html (\"For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women\")] in 1790.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert William Dimand|last2=Nyland|first2=Chris|title=The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moR__vx9scMC&pg=PA133|year=2003|publisher=Edward Elgar|page=133|isbn=9781781956854}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet was not affiliated with any political party but counted many friends among the Girondins. He distanced himself from them during the [[National Convention]], however, due to his distaste for their factionalism.\n\nAt the [[Trial of Louis XVI]], Condorcet, who opposed the death penalty albeit supporting the [[Trial of Louis XVI|trial]] itself, spoke out against the execution of the King during the public vote at the Convention \u2013 he proposed to send the king to the galleys.\n\nCondorcet was on the Constitution Committee and was the main author of the [[Girondin constitutional project]]. The constitution was not put to vote. When the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] gained control of the Convention, they wrote their own, the [[French Constitution of 1793]]. Condorcet criticized the new work, and as a result, he was branded a traitor. On 3 October 1793, a warrant was issued for Condorcet's arrest.<ref>{{cite book|author=William E.

He hid for five (or eight) months in the house of Mme. Vernet, on Rue Servandoni, in Paris. It was there that he wrote ''Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progr\u00e8s de l'esprit humain'' (''[[Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit]]''), which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought.

The most widely accepted theory is that his friend, [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis]], gave him a poison which he eventually used. However, some historians believe that he may have been murdered (perhaps because he was too loved and respected to be executed). Jean-Pierre Brancourt (in his work ''L'\u00e9lite, la mort et la r\u00e9volution'') claims that Condorcet was killed with a mixture of ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and opium.\n\nCondorcet was symbolically interred in the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]] in 1989, in honour of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcet's role as a central figure in the Enlightenment.  His coffin, however, was empty as his remains, originally interred in the common cemetery of [[Bourg-la-Reine]], were lost during the nineteenth century.\n\n==Family==\nIn 1786 Condorcet married [[Sophie de Condorcet|Sophie de Grouchy]], who was more than twenty years his junior. Sophie, reckoned one of the most beautiful women of the day, became an accomplished [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] hostess as Madame de Condorcet, and also an accomplished translator of [[Thomas Paine]] and [[Adam Smith]]. She was intelligent and well educated, fluent in both English and Italian. The marriage was a strong one, and Sophie visited her husband regularly while he remained in hiding. Although she began proceedings for divorce in January 1794, it was at the insistence of Condorcet and Cabanis, who wished to protect their property from expropriation and to provide financially for Sophie and their young daughter, Louise 'Eliza' Alexandrine.\n\nCondorcet was survived by his widow and four-year-old Eliza. Sophie died in 1822, never having remarried, and having published all her husband's works between 1801 and 1804. Her work was carried on by Eliza, wife of former United Irishman [[Arthur O'Connor (United Irishman)|Arthur O'Connor]].  The Condorcet-O'Connors published a revised edition between 1847 and 1849.\n\n== Gender equality ==\n\nCondorcet's work was mainly focused on a quest for a more egalitarian society. This path led him to think and write about gender equality in the Revolutionary context. In 1790, he published \"''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cit\u00e9''\" (\"On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship\") in which he strongly advocated for women's suffrage in the new Republic as well as the enlargement of basic political and social rights to include women. One of the most famous [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers at the time, he was one of the first to make such a radical proposal. A visionary, he identified gender as a social construction based on perceived differences in sex and rejected [[biological determinism]] as being able to explain gender relations in society. He denounced patriarchal norms of oppression, present at every institutional level, and continuously subjugating and marginalising women. Like fellow [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinker [[Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his book ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]] ou De l'Education'' (1762), Condorcet identified education as crucial to the emancipation of individuals. He stated: \"I believe that all other differences between men and women are simply the result of education\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Social Choice and Political Theory|date=1994|publisher=Edward Edgard Publishing|last1=and Iain McLean|first1=Fiona Hewitt}}</ref> He saw it as the only solution for women to deconstruct gender roles and promote another kind of masculinity, not based on violence, virility and the subjugation of women but rather on shared attributes such as reason and intelligence. In her book ''Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism'', Hooks calls this new concept \"feminine masculinity\", \"new models of self\u2013assertion that do not require the construction of an enemy 'other,' be it a woman or the symbolic feminine, for them to define themselves against\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Feminism is for Everybody|url=https://archive.org/details/feminismisforeve00hook|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=South End Press|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet's whole plea for gender equality is founded on the recognition that the attribution of rights and authority comes from the false assumption that men possess reason and women do not. This is, according to Nall{{Who|date=February 2020}}, an obvious example of an individual practising and advocating this feminist masculinity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Condorcet and Feminist Masculinity|date=2010|publisher=Men's Studies Press, LLC|location=Florida Atlantic University|last1=Nall|first1=Jeff}}</ref> As such, women should enjoy the same fundamental \"[[natural right]]\".\n\nScholars{{Who|date=January 2018}} often disagree on the true impact that Condorcet's work had on pre-modern feminist thinking. His detractors{{Who|date=January 2018}} point out that, when he was eventually given some responsibilities in the constitutional drafting process, his convictions did not translate into concrete political action and he made limited efforts to push these issues on the agenda.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: le seul et premier f\u00e9ministe du 18\u00e8me si\u00e8cle?|last=Pappas|first=John|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=430\u2013441}}</ref> Some scholars{{Who|date=January 2018}} on the other hand, believe that this lack of action is not due to the weakness of his commitment but rather to the political atmosphere at the time and the absence of political appetite for gender equality on the part of decision-makers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Le Feminisme pendant la Revolution Francaise|date=2007|page=341 |last1=Devance|first1=Louis}}</ref> Along with authors such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] or [[Olympe de Gouges]], Condorcet made a lasting contribution to the pre-feminist debate.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}\n\n== The Idea of Progress ==\n{{main|Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit}}\nCondorcet's ''Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit'' (1795) was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the [[Idea of Progress]] a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's \"present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind\"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences \"no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions\"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink1=Keith Michael Baker|first=Keith Michael|last=Baker|title=On Condorcet's 'Sketch'|journal=[[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]]|volume=133|issue=3 |date=Summer 2004|pages=56\u201364|doi=10.1162/0011526041504506}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding. None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly [[utopian]] society. He believed in the great potential towards growth that man possessed.\n\nHowever, Condorcet stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender.<ref name=\"Williams 2004\">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=David|title=Condorcet and Modernity|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84139-9}}</ref>  To this end, he became a member of the French [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks)]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glawe|first=Eddie|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707124424/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=71563|archivedate=2014-07-07|url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=71563|title=Benjamin Banneker|journal=Professional Surveyor Magazine|date=June 2014|volume=39|issue=6|publisher=Flatdog Media, Inc.|accessdate=2017-03-11}}</ref> He wrote a set of rules for the Society of the Friends of the Blacks which detailed the reasoning and goals behind the organization along with describing the injustice of slavery and put in a statement calling for the abolition of the slave trade as the first step to true abolition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: Political Writings|last=Steven Lukes|first=Nadia Urbinati|publisher=Cambridge University Press, New York|year=2012|isbn=9781107021013|location=United States of America|pages=148\u201355}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet was also a strong proponent of women's civil rights. He claimed that women were equal to men in nearly every aspect and asked why then should they be debarred from their fundamental civil rights; the few differences that existed were due to the fact that women were limited by their lack of rights. Condorcet even mentioned several women who were more capable than average men, such as [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Maria Theresa|Maria-Theresa]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: Political Writings|last=Steven Lukes|first=Nadia Urbinati|publisher=Cambridge University, New York|year=2012|isbn=9781107021013|location=United States of America|pages=156\u201362}}</ref>\n\n==Civic duty==\nFor Condorcet's [[republicanism]] the nation needed enlightened citizens and education needed democracy to become truly public. Democracy implied free citizens, and ignorance was the source of servitude. Citizens had to be provided with the necessary knowledge to exercise their freedom and understand the rights and laws that guaranteed their enjoyment. Although education could not eliminate disparities in talent, all citizens, including women, had the right to free education. In opposition to those who relied on revolutionary enthusiasm to form the new citizens, Condorcet maintained that revolution was not made to last and that revolutionary institutions were not intended to prolong the revolutionary experience but to establish political rules and legal mechanisms that would insure future changes without revolution. In a democratic city there would be no Bastille to be seized. Public education would form free and responsible citizens, not revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Keith Michael|title=Condorcet: From Natural Philosophy to Social Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1975|isbn=0-226-03532-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/condorcetfromnat0000bake}}</ref>\n\n==Evaluation==\nRothschild (2001) argues that Condorcet has been seen since the 1790s as the embodiment of the cold, rational Enlightenment. However she suggests his writings on economic policy, voting, and public instruction indicate different views both of Condorcet and of the Enlightenment. Condorcet was concerned with individual diversity; he was opposed to [[proto-utilitarian]] theories; he considered individual independence, which he described as the characteristic liberty of the moderns, to be of central political importance; and he opposed the imposition of universal and eternal principles. His efforts to reconcile the universality of some values with the diversity of individual opinions are of continuing interest. He emphasizes the institutions of civilized or constitutional conflict, recognizes conflicts or inconsistencies within individuals, and sees moral sentiments as the foundation of universal values. His difficulties call into question some familiar distinctions, for example between French, German, and English-Scottish thought, and between the Enlightenment and the counter-Enlightenment. There was substantial continuity between Condorcet's criticism of the economic ideas of the 1760s and the liberal thought of the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Williams 2004\"/>\n\nThe [[Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet]] in the rue du Havre, in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], is named in his honour, as are streets in many French cities.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Condorcet: Political Writings'' (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought) edited by Steven Lukes, and Nadia Urbinati (2012)\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the metre]]\n*[[Seconds pendulum]]\n*[[Society of the Friends of Truth]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baker, Keith.

His ideas, including support for a [[Economic liberalism|liberal economy]], free and equal public instruction, [[constitutionalism|constitutional]] government, and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for women and people of all races, have been said to embody the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and Enlightenment [[rationalism]]. He died in prison after a period of flight from French Revolutionary authorities.\n\n==Early years==\nCondorcet was born in [[Ribemont]] (in present-day [[Aisne]]), descended from the ancient family of Caritat, who took their title from the town of [[Condorcet, Dr\u00f4me|Condorcet]] in [[Dauphin\u00e9]], of which they were long-time residents. Fatherless at a young age, he was raised by his devoutly religious mother. He was educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College in [[Reims]] and at the ''[[Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre]]'' in Paris, where he quickly showed his intellectual ability and gained his first public distinctions in [[mathematics]]. When he was sixteen, his analytical abilities gained the praise of [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Alexis Clairaut]]; soon, Condorcet would study under d'Alembert.\n\nFrom 1765 to 1774, he focused on science. In 1765, he published his first work on mathematics, entitled ''Essai sur le [[integral calculus|calcul int\u00e9gral]]'', which was well received, launching his career as a mathematician. He went on to publish more papers, and on 25 February 1769, he was elected to the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Acad\u00e9mie royale des Sciences]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ellen Judy Wilson|author2=Peter Hanns Reill|title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&pg=PA124|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=124\u201325|isbn=9781438110219}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anne Robert Jacques Turgot.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Jacques Turgot was Condorcet's mentor and longtime friend]]\nIn 1772, he published another paper on [[integral calculus]].

Turgot became an administrator under [[King of France|King]] [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1772 and [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finance]] under [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1774.\n\nCondorcet worked with [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. He soon became an honorary member of many foreign academies and philosophic societies, including the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (1785), the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1792)<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\nand also in Prussia and Russia.\n\nHis political ideas, many in congruity with Turgot's, were criticized heavily in the English-speaking world, however, most notably by [[John Adams]] who wrote two of his principal works of political philosophy to oppose Turgot's and Condorcet's unicameral legislature and radical democracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldstreicher|first=David|title=A Companion to John Adams and John Quincy Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82lNLcxLL5sC&pg=PT64|year=2013|publisher=Wiley|page=64|isbn=9781118524299}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nIn 1774, Condorcet was appointed inspector general of the [[Monnaie de Paris|Paris mint]] by Turgot.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Efrosini Gregory|title=Freedom in French Enlightenment Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poya_r2az2sC&pg=PA148|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=148|isbn=9781433109393}}</ref> From this point on, Condorcet shifted his focus from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political matters. In the following years, he took up the defense of [[human rights]] in general, and of [[Women's rights|women's]] and [[Black (people)|Blacks']] rights in particular (an [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]], he became active in the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] in the 1780s). He supported the ideals embodied by the newly formed United States, and proposed projects of political, administrative and economic reforms intended to transform France.\n\nIn 1776, Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. Consequently, Condorcet submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the ''[[Monnaie de Paris|Monnaie]]'', but the request was refused, and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later wrote ''Vie de M. Turgot'' (1786), a biography which spoke fondly of Turgot and advocated Turgot's economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious appointments: in 1777, he became Permanent Secretary of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]], holding the post until the abolition of the Acad\u00e9mie in 1793; and, in 1782, secretary of the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Daston|first=Lorraine|title=Classical Probability in the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oq8XNbKyUewC&pg=PA104|year=1995|publisher=Princeton UP|page=104|isbn=9780691006444}}</ref>\n\n==Condorcet's paradox and the Condorcet method==\n{{main|Condorcet method}}\n\nIn 1785, Condorcet published his ''Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions'',<ref>{{cite book| url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k417181\n| title=Essai sur l'application de l'analyse \u00e0 la probabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions rendues \u00e0 la pluralit\u00e9 des voix | format=PNG | language=French | accessdate=2008-03-10 | author=Marquis de Condorcet | authorlink=Marquis de Condorcet| year=1785 }}</ref> one of his most important works.

He disagreed strongly with the alternative method of aggregating preferences put forth by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (based on summed [[Non-parametric statistics|rankings of alternatives]]). Condorcet was one of the first to systematically apply mathematics in the [[social sciences]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Other works==\nIn 1781, Condorcet wrote a pamphlet, ''Reflections on Negro Slavery'', in which he denounced [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Sociological Analysis|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsociolo0000bott|chapter-url-access=registration|last=Bierstedt|first=Robert|publisher=Basic Books|year=1978|isbn=0-465-03023-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofsociolo0000bott/page/19 19]|chapter=Sociological Thought in the Eighteenth Century|editor1-last=Bottomore|editor1-first=Tom|editor2-first=Robert|editor2-last=Nisbet}}</ref>  In 1786, Condorcet worked on ideas for the [[Derivative|differential]] and [[integral calculus]], giving a new treatment of [[infinitesimal]]s \u2013 a work which apparently was never published. In 1789, he published ''Vie de Voltaire (1789)'', which agreed with [[Voltaire]] in his opposition to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. In 1791, Condorcet, along with Sophie de Grouchy, [[Thomas Paine]], [[Pierre \u00c9tienne Louis Dumont|Etienne Dumont]], [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Jacques-Pierre Brissot]], and Achilles Duchastellet published a brief journal titled ''Le R\u00e9publicain'', its main goal being the promotion of republicanism and the rejection of constitutional monarchy. The journal's theme was that any sort of monarchy is a threat to freedom no matter who is leading and that liberty is freedom from domination.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berges|first=Sandrine|year=2015|title=Sophie de Grouchy on the Cost of Domination in the Letters on Sympathy and Two Anonymous Articles in Le R\u00e9publicain|url=|journal=Monist|volume=98|pages=102\u201312|via=Florida International University|doi=10.1093/monist/onu011|hdl=11693/12519}}</ref>\n\nIn 1795, Condorcet had a book published called ''[[Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind]]''.

As a result, in 1791 he was elected as a Paris representative in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and then became the secretary of the Assembly.\n\nIn April 1792 Condorcet presented a project for the reformation of the education system, aiming to create a hierarchical system, under the authority of experts, who would work as the guardians of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and who, independent of power, would be the guarantors of public liberties. The project was judged to be contrary to the republican and egalitarian virtues, giving the education of the Nation over to an aristocracy of savants. The institution adopted Condorcet's design for the state education system, and he drafted a proposed [[Constitutional monarchy|Bourbon Constitution]] for the new France.\n\nHe advocated [[women's suffrage]] for the new government, writing an article for ''Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1789'', and by publishing ''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cit\u00e9'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060616060257/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/condorcet4.html (\"For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women\")] in 1790.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert William Dimand|last2=Nyland|first2=Chris|title=The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moR__vx9scMC&pg=PA133|year=2003|publisher=Edward Elgar|page=133|isbn=9781781956854}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet was not affiliated with any political party but counted many friends among the Girondins. He distanced himself from them during the [[National Convention]], however, due to his distaste for their factionalism.\n\nAt the [[Trial of Louis XVI]], Condorcet, who opposed the death penalty albeit supporting the [[Trial of Louis XVI|trial]] itself, spoke out against the execution of the King during the public vote at the Convention \u2013 he proposed to send the king to the galleys.\n\nCondorcet was on the Constitution Committee and was the main author of the [[Girondin constitutional project]]. The constitution was not put to vote. When the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] gained control of the Convention, they wrote their own, the [[French Constitution of 1793]]. Condorcet criticized the new work, and as a result, he was branded a traitor. On 3 October 1793, a warrant was issued for Condorcet's arrest.<ref>{{cite book|author=William E.

He hid for five (or eight) months in the house of Mme. Vernet, on Rue Servandoni, in Paris. It was there that he wrote ''Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progr\u00e8s de l'esprit humain'' (''[[Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit]]''), which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought. It narrates the history of civilization as one of progress in the sciences, shows the intimate connection between [[scientific progress]] and the development of human rights and justice, and outlines the features of a future rational society entirely shaped by scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Loptson|first=Peter|title=Readings on Human Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bGOKpFOY7kC&pg=PA125|year=1998|publisher=[[Broadview Press]]|pages=125\u201328|isbn=9781551111568}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 1794 Condorcet, convinced he was no longer safe, left his hideout and attempted to flee Paris. He went to seek refuge at the house of [[Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard|Jean-Baptiste Suard]], a friend of his with whom he had resided in 1772,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Salmon|first=J.H.M|year=1977|title=Turgot and Condorcet. Progress, Reform and Revolution|url=|journal=History Today|volume=27|page=288|via=Florida International University}}</ref> but he was refused on the basis that he would be betrayed by one of their residents. Two days later, he was arrested in [[Clamart]] and imprisoned in [[Bourg-la-Reine]] (or, as it was known during the Revolution, ''Bourg-l'\u00c9galit\u00e9'', \"Equality Borough\" rather than \"Queen's Borough\") where, after another two days, he was found dead in his cell. The most widely accepted theory is that his friend, [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis]], gave him a poison which he eventually used. However, some historians believe that he may have been murdered (perhaps because he was too loved and respected to be executed). Jean-Pierre Brancourt (in his work ''L'\u00e9lite, la mort et la r\u00e9volution'') claims that Condorcet was killed with a mixture of ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and opium.\n\nCondorcet was symbolically interred in the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]] in 1989, in honour of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcet's role as a central figure in the Enlightenment.  His coffin, however, was empty as his remains, originally interred in the common cemetery of [[Bourg-la-Reine]], were lost during the nineteenth century.\n\n==Family==\nIn 1786 Condorcet married [[Sophie de Condorcet|Sophie de Grouchy]], who was more than twenty years his junior. Sophie, reckoned one of the most beautiful women of the day, became an accomplished [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] hostess as Madame de Condorcet, and also an accomplished translator of [[Thomas Paine]] and [[Adam Smith]]. She was intelligent and well educated, fluent in both English and Italian. The marriage was a strong one, and Sophie visited her husband regularly while he remained in hiding. Although she began proceedings for divorce in January 1794, it was at the insistence of Condorcet and Cabanis, who wished to protect their property from expropriation and to provide financially for Sophie and their young daughter, Louise 'Eliza' Alexandrine.\n\nCondorcet was survived by his widow and four-year-old Eliza. Sophie died in 1822, never having remarried, and having published all her husband's works between 1801 and 1804. Her work was carried on by Eliza, wife of former United Irishman [[Arthur O'Connor (United Irishman)|Arthur O'Connor]].  The Condorcet-O'Connors published a revised edition between 1847 and 1849.\n\n== Gender equality ==\n\nCondorcet's work was mainly focused on a quest for a more egalitarian society. This path led him to think and write about gender equality in the Revolutionary context. In 1790, he published \"''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cit\u00e9''\" (\"On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship\") in which he strongly advocated for women's suffrage in the new Republic as well as the enlargement of basic political and social rights to include women. One of the most famous [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers at the time, he was one of the first to make such a radical proposal. A visionary, he identified gender as a social construction based on perceived differences in sex and rejected [[biological determinism]] as being able to explain gender relations in society. He denounced patriarchal norms of oppression, present at every institutional level, and continuously subjugating and marginalising women. Like fellow [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinker [[Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his book ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]] ou De l'Education'' (1762), Condorcet identified education as crucial to the emancipation of individuals. He stated: \"I believe that all other differences between men and women are simply the result of education\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Social Choice and Political Theory|date=1994|publisher=Edward Edgard Publishing|last1=and Iain McLean|first1=Fiona Hewitt}}</ref> He saw it as the only solution for women to deconstruct gender roles and promote another kind of masculinity, not based on violence, virility and the subjugation of women but rather on shared attributes such as reason and intelligence. In her book ''Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism'', Hooks calls this new concept \"feminine masculinity\", \"new models of self\u2013assertion that do not require the construction of an enemy 'other,' be it a woman or the symbolic feminine, for them to define themselves against\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Feminism is for Everybody|url=https://archive.org/details/feminismisforeve00hook|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=South End Press|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet's whole plea for gender equality is founded on the recognition that the attribution of rights and authority comes from the false assumption that men possess reason and women do not. This is, according to Nall{{Who|date=February 2020}}, an obvious example of an individual practising and advocating this feminist masculinity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Condorcet and Feminist Masculinity|date=2010|publisher=Men's Studies Press, LLC|location=Florida Atlantic University|last1=Nall|first1=Jeff}}</ref> As such, women should enjoy the same fundamental \"[[natural right]]\".\n\nScholars{{Who|date=January 2018}} often disagree on the true impact that Condorcet's work had on pre-modern feminist thinking. His detractors{{Who|date=January 2018}} point out that, when he was eventually given some responsibilities in the constitutional drafting process, his convictions did not translate into concrete political action and he made limited efforts to push these issues on the agenda.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: le seul et premier f\u00e9ministe du 18\u00e8me si\u00e8cle?|last=Pappas|first=John|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=430\u2013441}}</ref> Some scholars{{Who|date=January 2018}} on the other hand, believe that this lack of action is not due to the weakness of his commitment but rather to the political atmosphere at the time and the absence of political appetite for gender equality on the part of decision-makers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Le Feminisme pendant la Revolution Francaise|date=2007|page=341 |last1=Devance|first1=Louis}}</ref> Along with authors such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] or [[Olympe de Gouges]], Condorcet made a lasting contribution to the pre-feminist debate.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}\n\n== The Idea of Progress ==\n{{main|Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit}}\nCondorcet's ''Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit'' (1795) was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the [[Idea of Progress]] a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's \"present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind\"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences \"no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions\"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink1=Keith Michael Baker|first=Keith Michael|last=Baker|title=On Condorcet's 'Sketch'|journal=[[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]]|volume=133|issue=3 |date=Summer 2004|pages=56\u201364|doi=10.1162/0011526041504506}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding. None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly [[utopian]] society. He believed in the great potential towards growth that man possessed.\n\nHowever, Condorcet stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender.<ref name=\"Williams 2004\">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=David|title=Condorcet and Modernity|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84139-9}}</ref>  To this end, he became a member of the French [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks)]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glawe|first=Eddie|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707124424/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=71563|archivedate=2014-07-07|url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=71563|title=Benjamin Banneker|journal=Professional Surveyor Magazine|date=June 2014|volume=39|issue=6|publisher=Flatdog Media, Inc.|accessdate=2017-03-11}}</ref> He wrote a set of rules for the Society of the Friends of the Blacks which detailed the reasoning and goals behind the organization along with describing the injustice of slavery and put in a statement calling for the abolition of the slave trade as the first step to true abolition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: Political Writings|last=Steven Lukes|first=Nadia Urbinati|publisher=Cambridge University Press, New York|year=2012|isbn=9781107021013|location=United States of America|pages=148\u201355}}</ref>\n\nCondorcet was also a strong proponent of women's civil rights. He claimed that women were equal to men in nearly every aspect and asked why then should they be debarred from their fundamental civil rights; the few differences that existed were due to the fact that women were limited by their lack of rights. Condorcet even mentioned several women who were more capable than average men, such as [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Maria Theresa|Maria-Theresa]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: Political Writings|last=Steven Lukes|first=Nadia Urbinati|publisher=Cambridge University, New York|year=2012|isbn=9781107021013|location=United States of America|pages=156\u201362}}</ref>\n\n==Civic duty==\nFor Condorcet's [[republicanism]] the nation needed enlightened citizens and education needed democracy to become truly public. Democracy implied free citizens, and ignorance was the source of servitude. Citizens had to be provided with the necessary knowledge to exercise their freedom and understand the rights and laws that guaranteed their enjoyment. Although education could not eliminate disparities in talent, all citizens, including women, had the right to free education. In opposition to those who relied on revolutionary enthusiasm to form the new citizens, Condorcet maintained that revolution was not made to last and that revolutionary institutions were not intended to prolong the revolutionary experience but to establish political rules and legal mechanisms that would insure future changes without revolution. In a democratic city there would be no Bastille to be seized. Public education would form free and responsible citizens, not revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Keith Michael|title=Condorcet: From Natural Philosophy to Social Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1975|isbn=0-226-03532-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/condorcetfromnat0000bake}}</ref>\n\n==Evaluation==\nRothschild (2001) argues that Condorcet has been seen since the 1790s as the embodiment of the cold, rational Enlightenment. However she suggests his writings on economic policy, voting, and public instruction indicate different views both of Condorcet and of the Enlightenment. Condorcet was concerned with individual diversity; he was opposed to [[proto-utilitarian]] theories; he considered individual independence, which he described as the characteristic liberty of the moderns, to be of central political importance; and he opposed the imposition of universal and eternal principles. His efforts to reconcile the universality of some values with the diversity of individual opinions are of continuing interest. He emphasizes the institutions of civilized or constitutional conflict, recognizes conflicts or inconsistencies within individuals, and sees moral sentiments as the foundation of universal values. His difficulties call into question some familiar distinctions, for example between French, German, and English-Scottish thought, and between the Enlightenment and the counter-Enlightenment. There was substantial continuity between Condorcet's criticism of the economic ideas of the 1760s and the liberal thought of the early 19th century.<ref name=\"Williams 2004\"/>\n\nThe [[Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet]] in the rue du Havre, in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], is named in his honour, as are streets in many French cities.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Condorcet: Political Writings'' (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought) edited by Steven Lukes, and Nadia Urbinati (2012)\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the metre]]\n*[[Seconds pendulum]]\n*[[Society of the Friends of Truth]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Baker, Keith.

With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". Later in the programme's run the Daleks acquired [[time travel in fiction|time travel technology]] and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] affecting most of the universe, with battles taking place across the whole of history.\n\nThe Daleks are the show's most popular and famous villains and their returns to the series over the decades have gained media attention.

If you were related to an octopus then it helped.\"<ref name=\"Monsters_85\">Howe (1997), p. 85</ref>\n\nFor ''Doctor Who'''s 21st-century revival the Dalek casings retain the same overall shape and dimensional proportions of previous Daleks, although many details have been redesigned to give the Dalek a heavier and more solid look.<ref name=\"Tucker\">{{cite magazine |last=Arnopp |first=Jason |date=July 2005 |title=Tucker's Luck |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Special Edition |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|Royal Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issue=11 |pages=62\u201370}}</ref> Changes include a larger, more pointed base; a glowing eyepiece; an all-over metallic-brass finish (specified by Davies); thicker, nailed strips on the \"neck\" section; a housing for the eyestalk pivot; and significantly larger dome lights.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode \"Dalek\".<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> These Dalek casings use a short operator inside the housing while the 'head' and eyestalk are operated via remote control.

Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.<ref>Howe (1997), pp. 84\u201385</ref> The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/>\n\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/> This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the \"new series\" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>\n\n====Voices====\nThe [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which the director, [[Graeme Harper]], deliberately used less distortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |work=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',<ref name=Planet>''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] which had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> A [[Emperor Dalek|Dalek Emperor]] returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with genetic material harvested from human subjects. It saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. These Daleks and their fleet were destroyed in \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\".<ref name=Parting/> The 2006 season finale \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\"/\"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\" featured a squad of four Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the [[Cult of Skaro]], led by a black Dalek known as \"[[Dalek Sec|Sec]]\", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged, along with the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison vessel containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the [[Torchwood Institute]] and [[Cyberman#Revived series|Cybermen from a parallel world]]. This resulted in a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London, which was resolved when the [[Tenth Doctor]] caused both groups to be sucked back into the Void. The Cult survived by utilising an \"emergency temporal shift\" to escape.<ref name=Doomsday/><ref name=\"army\">{{cite episode | title = [[Army of Ghosts]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = Cardiff | airdate = 1 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nThese four Daleks - Sec, Jast, Thay and Caan - returned in the two-part story \"[[Daleks in Manhattan]]\"/\"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\", in which whilst stranded in 1930s New York, they set up a base in the partially built [[Empire State Building]] and attempt to rebuild the Dalek race. To this end, Dalek Sec merges with a human being to become a Human/Dalek hybrid.

This angers the rest of the Cult, resulting in mutiny and the death of Sec, Thay and Jast as well as the wiping out of all the hybrids. This leaves Dalek Caan as the last Dalek in existence. When the Doctor makes Caan realise that he is the last of his kind, Caan uses emergency temporal shift and escapes once more.<ref name=Evolution/>\n\nThe Daleks returned in the 2008 season's two-part finale, \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\"/\"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan's temporal shift sent him into the Time War whence he rescued Davros, in the process gaining the ability to see the future at the cost of his own sanity. Davros has created a new race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth, which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in \"The Vault\", a section of the Dalek flagship, the ''Crucible''. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a \"reality bomb\" for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of [[Donna Noble]], a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.<ref name=Stolen>{{cite episode | title = [[The Stolen Earth]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 28 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=Journey>{{cite episode | title = [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 5 July 2008}}</ref> The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode \"[[Victory of the Daleks]]\", the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the \"Progenitor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532/doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |publisher=BBC |title=BBC concept artwork for Dalek Progenator |last=McKinstry |first=Peter |access-date=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224205734/http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532//doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA.

All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, \"[[Into the Dalek]]\" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\"/\"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor]] encountered a Dalek in a New Year's Day episode, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019). A Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to rebuild itself and summon more Daleks to conquer [[Earth]].\n\n{{Multiple images\n| align = center\n| footer = Evolution of the Daleks, variants of the props since 1963, on display at various exhibitions.\n| total_width = 800\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (5879255282).jpg\n| width1  =  1286 \n| height1 = 1801\n| image2 = 270811-048 CPS (6277340904).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n| image3  = Renegade Dalek (10634715363).jpg\n| width3  = 1629\n| height3 = 3125\n| image4 = Icons of Science Fiction - Doctor Who (9444463245).jpg\n| width4  = 1528\n| height4 =  2816\n| image5  = Dalek (10634451635).jpg\n| width5  = 1946\n| height5 =  3709\n| image6 = Doctor Who Experience Cardiff - Rise and evolution of the Daleks (14418887997).jpg\n| width6  = 1405\n| height6 = 2150 \n}}\n\n==Dalek culture==\nDaleks have little, if any, individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday/> ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].''

However, this was reversed in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nA ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).\n\nThe ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.\n\n==Licensed appearances==\n[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels.

The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and \"heroes\", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the \"Trods\" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the

With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\".

The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome, which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.<ref name=\"Monsters-82\"/>\n\nIn addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for operators to hear the director or dialogue. [[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: \"You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger.

Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.<ref>Howe (1997), pp. 84\u201385</ref> The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/>\n\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/> This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the \"new series\" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>\n\n====Voices====\nThe [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which the director, [[Graeme Harper]], deliberately used less distortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |work=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',<ref name=Planet>''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, \"[[Into the Dalek]]\" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\"/\"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor]] encountered a Dalek in a New Year's Day episode, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019). A Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to rebuild itself and summon more Daleks to conquer [[Earth]].\n\n{{Multiple images\n| align = center\n| footer = Evolution of the Daleks, variants of the props since 1963, on display at various exhibitions.\n| total_width = 800\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (5879255282).jpg\n| width1  =  1286 \n| height1 = 1801\n| image2 = 270811-048 CPS (6277340904).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n| image3  = Renegade Dalek (10634715363).jpg\n| width3  = 1629\n| height3 = 3125\n| image4 = Icons of Science Fiction - Doctor Who (9444463245).jpg\n| width4  = 1528\n| height4 =  2816\n| image5  = Dalek (10634451635).jpg\n| width5  = 1946\n| height5 =  3709\n| image6 = Doctor Who Experience Cardiff - Rise and evolution of the Daleks (14418887997).jpg\n| width6  = 1405\n| height6 = 2150 \n}}\n\n==Dalek culture==\nDaleks have little, if any, individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday/> ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].''

Season 5, episode 3.</ref>\n\nBecause the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their collective [[Archenemy|arch-enemy]] and they have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as ''\"Ka Faraq Gatri\"'' (\"Bringer of Darkness\" or \"Destroyer of Worlds\"), and \"The Oncoming Storm\".<ref name=Parting/><ref name=\"Journey\"/> Both the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) and [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear. In \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", Rose notes that while the Daleks see the extermination of five million [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as \"pest control\", \"one Doctor\" visibly un-nerves them (to the point they physically recoil).<ref name=\"Doomsday\"/> To his indignant surprise, in \"Asylum of the Daleks\", the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) learns that the Daleks have designated him as \"The Predator\".\n\nAs the Doctor escapes the Asylum (with companions Amy and Rory), a Dalek-converted-human (Oswin Oswald) prisoner provides critical assistance, which culminates in completely deleting the Doctor from the Dalek hive-consciousness (the PathWeb), thus wiping the slate entirely blank. However, this was reversed in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nA ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).\n\nThe ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.\n\n==Licensed appearances==\n[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels. The first panel contains the title \"The Daleks\" in jagged white letters.

The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called \"Dr. Who\" who built a time-travelling device named ''Tardis'', instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called \"the TARDIS\".<ref>Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129</ref>\n\nFour books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s.

The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and \"heroes\", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the \"Trods\" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Boies

He was born in [[Tunstead, Derbyshire]], and lived much of his life in [[Leek, Staffordshire]], becoming one of the most notable engineers of the 18th century.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn into a well-to-do family of [[yeoman]] farmers and craftsmen in the [[Peak District]], which in those days was extremely isolated, Brindley received little formal education, but was educated at home by his mother.<ref name=Malet>{{cite book |title=Coal Cotton and Canals |last=Malet |first=Hugh |year=1990 |publisher=Neil Richardson |location=Radcliffe, Manchester |isbn=0-907511-08-2 |page=14 }}</ref> At age 17, encouraged by his mother, he was apprenticed to a [[millwright]] in [[Sutton, Macclesfield]], and soon showed exceptional skill and ability.<ref name=Malet/> Having completed his apprenticeship he set up business for himself as a wheelwright in [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], Staffordshire. In 1750 he expanded his business by renting a [[millwright]]'s shop in [[Burslem]] from the [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]s who became his lifelong friends.<ref name=Malet/> He soon established a reputation for ingenuity and skill at repairing many different kinds of machinery. In 1752 he designed and built an engine for draining a coal mine, the [[Wet Earth Colliery]] at [[Clifton, Lancashire|Clifton]] in Lancashire. Three years later he built a machine for a silk mill at [[Congleton]].\n\n==Early canal engineering==\n[[File:Barton aqueduct drawing.jpg|right|thumb|The Barton Aqueduct over the River Irwell, 1807]]\n[[File:Barton aqueduct.jpg|thumb|right|Barton Aqueduct, shortly before its demolition, 1891]]\nBrindley's reputation brought him to the attention of the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], who was looking for a way to improve the transport of coal from his coal mines at [[Worsley]] to [[Manchester]].\n\nIn 1759 the Duke commissioned the construction of a [[canal]] to do just that. The resulting [[Bridgewater Canal]], opened in 1761, is often regarded as the first British canal of the modern era (though the [[Sankey Brook Navigation|Sankey Canal]] has a good claim to that title), and was a major technical triumph. Brindley was commissioned as the consulting engineer, However, although Brindley has often been credited as the genius behind the construction of the canal, it is now thought that the main designers were the Duke himself, who had some engineering training, and his land agent and engineer [[John Gilbert (agent)|John Gilbert]]. Brindley was engaged, at the insistence of Gilbert, to assist with particular problems such as the [[Barton Aqueduct]].<ref name=Malet/> This most impressive feature of the canal carried the canal at an elevation of 12 metres (39&nbsp;ft) over the [[River Irwell]] at [[Barton, Salford, Greater Manchester|Barton]].{{efn|In 1893, on the building of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], the [[navigable aqueduct|aqueduct]] was replaced by the equally impressive [[Barton Swing Aqueduct]].}}\n\nBrindley's technique minimised the amount of earth moving by developing the principle of contouring. He preferred to use a circuitous route that avoided embankments, and tunnels rather than cuttings. Though this recognised the primitive methods of earth-moving available at the time, it meant that his canals were often much longer than a more adventurous approach would have produced. But his greatest contribution was the technique of [[Puddling (engineering)|puddling clay]] to produce a watertight [[clay]]-based material, and its use in lining canals.<ref name=Rolt>{{cite book |title=Navigable Waterways |last=Rolt |first=L.T.C. |authorlink=L.

[[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-86239-184-0}}</ref>\n\n==Master canal engineer==\nBrindley's reputation spread rapidly and he was soon commissioned to construct more canals. He extended the Bridgewater to [[Runcorn]], connecting it to his next major work, the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]]. At this time Brindley had never built a lock and he first built an experimental lock in the grounds of [[Turnhurst]], a house he had bought near the summit, and this determined the design of the narrow canal lock which characterised most of the canals in the Midlands, with a single upper gate and double mitre lower gates.<ref name=Rolt/> These were for an elongated version of the boats designed for the underground system at Worsley, the so-called 'starvationers', which were subsequently known as [[narrowboat]]s and this decision was to cast a long shadow on the English canal system.\n\n[[File:Brindleyplace 3 with tower.jpg|240px|right|thumb|[[Brindleyplace]], Birmingham]]\nBrindley believed it would be possible to use canals to link the four great rivers of England: the [[River Mersey|Mersey]], [[River Trent|Trent]], [[River Severn|Severn]] and [[River Thames|Thames]] (the \"Grand Cross\" scheme). In 1762 he \"set out for Chester and Shropshire survey or a raconitering\" according to his diary. He had with him a sketch map of the continuation of the Dee southwards past Whitchurch.\n\nSince the potteries around [[Stoke-on-Trent]] were in desperate need of something better than the [[pack-horse]] to carry their fragile wares, they wholeheartedly supported the connection of [[Staffordshire]] to the Trent and to the Mersey. The first sod was cut by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in 1766 and Brindley carried it away in a barrow. From Runcorn, the canal would climb by a series of thirty-five [[lock (water transport)|locks]], pass through a 3000-yard tunnel (the [[Harecastle Tunnel]]), then descend by a further forty locks to join the Trent at Wilden Ferry, near [[Shardlow]]. There was mounting ridicule about his scheme and in the event, although the canal opened from Shardlow to near [[Stafford]] in 1770, it took eleven years to drive the tunnel.\n\nThe [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] was the first part of this ambitious network, and the later [[Chester Canal]], started in 1772, was also a result.\n\nHowever, although Brindley and his assistants surveyed the whole potential system&nbsp;\u2013 from the start, he had asserted his view of the Trent and Mersey as the \"Grand Trunk Canal\", the Grand Cross of waterways across the country&nbsp;\u2013 he did not live to see it completed. The Harecastle Tunnel finally opened in 1777 and coal was finally transported from the Midlands to the Thames at [[Oxford]] in January 1790, some 18 years after Brindley's death. Development of the network, therefore, had to be left to other engineers, such as [[Thomas Telford]].\n\nIn total, throughout his life Brindley built 365 miles (587&nbsp;km) of [[canal]]s and many [[watermill]]s, including the [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], the [[Coventry Canal]], the [[Oxford Canal]] and numerous others, and he also constructed the watermill at Leek, now the [[Brindley Water Museum]].\n\n==Last years and epitaph==\nBrindley married Anne Henshall on 8 December 1765 when he was 49 and she was 19. Anne's brother, [[Hugh Henshall]], was involved in canal construction himself, on the [[Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal]]. The couple had two daughters, Anne and Susannah.\n\nIn 1771, work had begun on the [[Chesterfield Canal]], but while surveying a new branch of the Trent and Mersey between [[Froghall]] and [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], Brindley was drenched in a severe rainstorm. It had happened many times before, but he was unable to dry out properly at the inn at which he was staying, and caught a chill. He became seriously ill and returned to his home at [[Turnhurst]], Staffordshire, where [[Erasmus Darwin]] attended him and discovered that he was suffering from [[diabetes]].\n\nJames Brindley died at Turnhurst within sight of the unfinished Harecastle Tunnel on 27 September 1772.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brindleymill.net/htmlfiles/chronology.html |title=Chief Works and Principal Events in the life of James Brindley |website=BrindleyMill.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222090832/http://www.brindleymill.net/htmlfiles/chronology.html |archivedate=22 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{sfn |Smiles |1864 |p=286}} He was buried on 30 September, just nine days after the completion of his [[BCN Main Line|Birmingham Canal]], at St. James in [[Newchapel]] in Staffordshire, England.
