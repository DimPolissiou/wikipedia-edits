It uses a wooden board about three times as wide as a [[skateboard]] and one and a half times as long. The board is thrown across a thin film of water. While the board is still moving the rider jumps on and skims across the water to do what ever tricks he or she can imagine.\n\n==History==\nInland skimboarding emerged in the mid 1970s and has its roots in [[Sacramento]], California.  With homemade skimboards made of [[plywood]], [[fiberglass]] and [[resin]], skimmers were sliding on [[sandbar]]s along the American and Sacramento rivers. Most skimmers back then were just doing headstands, multi-360 spins and 180 [[shuvit]]s for tricks.\n\nThe [[wikt:freestyle|freestyle]] aspects of inland skimboarding were pioneered in the early 1980s by two Sacramento locals: Launie Porteous and Mark Robinson.  Influenced by the emerging skateboard scene, Launie and Mark started adapting their newfound [[skateboarding]] skills to skimboarding and the concept of freestyle skimboarding was born. This freestyle adaptation has led to what is now considered the true definition of this sport.\n\nWith the evolution of the ''[[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|Ollie]]'' on a skimboard, it allowed skimmers to transcend into olling over obstacles and opened up the doors for more technical tricks. Riding up the side of a wet river bank and coming back down to simulate a [[quarter pipe|1/4 pipe]] was also a new trick. Skimmers also propped up skimboards or wood planks on logs creating a ramp to jump off and do more tricks.\n\nIn the late 1980s, skimmers advanced to building better rails and jumps and adapting more technical skateboard tricks, but they still used stuff found around their environment like shopping carts, road cones, trash cans, etc. to use for obstacles.\n\nThe 1990s is where inland skimboarding started to really take hold as a cult sport. Utah was next to have an inland skimboard scene that was actually influenced by Sacramento skimmers that transplanted there. Come the late 1990s, inland skimboarding had steadily grown and had emerged in other US cities and in Canada and Australia.\n\nAs of today, Canada has the largest number of participants of flatland skimmers; they can't be referred to as inland skimmers because they skim on the coast, but their style of skimboarding is the same as inland skimboarding. Australia also has a large coastal flatland skimboard scene. Flatland and inland skimboarding has also taken hold in various European countries.\n\n==Differences from other boardsports==\nFlatland [[skimboarding]] can be done in almost every region of the world as it only requires a shallow pool of water which can be found in oceans lakes and even flooded fields.  Riding rails in flatland skimming is unique in that you can combine snowboarding and skateboarding tricks into one.  Without trucks to prevent the rider from spinning creates many variations and combinations of tricks when combining it with the non-binding skateboard tricks such as big-spins and pop shuv-its.\n\n== Boards ==\nIn the late 1970s and early 80s, companies such as ''J-Gordon'' and ''Victoria'' manufactured wood skimboards for local California surf and skateboard shops. For the first time inland shops like ''[[Goskate|GoSkate]]'' of Sacramento offered skimboards to the local crowd. Shortly thereafter, ''Surf&Skate'' in Sacramento also got involved with offering boards to the emerging skim scene.\n\nBefore the availability of production-made boards, inland skimmers just made their own wood boards from scratch. The boards back then were a classic tear-drop or tombstone shape. Current designs and constructions have not changed much, but the new shape preference for most inland skimmers is a twin-tip or symmetrical shaped board.\n\nThe problems encountered with inland skimboarding are the countless rocks, sticks, logs, clam shells, railsliders, run-away boards, etc.  These obstacles will eventually destroy any foam constructed board, so wood is still the preferred material of choice for most inland skimmers.\n\n==Tricks==\nThere are an unlimited number of tricks that can be performed while skimboarding. This list only covers a small chunk of the tricks possible.  As with other [[board sports]], riders seek out or invent new tricks to progress the sport.\n\n===Ollies===\n*'''Ollie'''-A basic jump into the air with the board. To do an ollie, you should lift your back leg up and stomp on the tail of your board which with enough speed/flex will launch the front of your board into the air.\n*'''Ollie North'''-A small variation on the Ollie except that you lift your front foot off the board.\n*'''Hippy Jump'''-The rider rides up to an object a few inches off the ground and jumps over it while the board goes under.\n*'''180 ollie'''- Performing a 180 spin while doing an ollie\n\n===Flip Tricks===\n*'''Varial Flip''' - Consists of doing an ollie and then flicking then leading foot in the front right of the board which if done right will generate a flipping and spinning motion that will spin the board in a 180 or 360 depending on how much power was generated from the foot and transferred from the foot and will flip the board also in a side motion that will eventually make and end product of a varial flip.\n*'''Kickflip''' - A kickflip is when the rider after airborne from an ollie then proceeds to use the outer sole of his/her leading foot and also applied with a fast forward motion of the leading foot which should be simultaneously timed with the side flicking motion with the leading foot, the board will flip in a sideways motion thus the rider will stop this motion and stomp the trick.  This is arguably one of the hardest tricks in skimboarding.\n\n===Spins===\n* By pushing the sand while moving the rider can spin a number of revolutions.\n\n===Shuv-Its===\n*'''Shuv-It'''- By jumping in the air and sweeping the back foot forward and the front foot backwards you can make the board spin 180 degrees.\n*'''360 Shuv-It''' - By placing your feet differently and sweeping your feet harder it is possible to spin the board a full 360 degree spin.\n*'''540 Shuv-It''' - By placing your feet differently and sweeping your feet harder than a 360 shuv it, and jumping higher to get the full 540 degree spin.\n*'''Pop Shuv-It''' - By mixing an Ollie and a Shuv-It you can spin the board in the air.\n*'''Big Spin''' - Mixing a 360 shuv it with 180 varial.\n*'''Bigger Spin''' - Mixing a 540 shuv it with 180 varial. Trick Created by John Minns\n*'''Induvit''' - Consists of doing a large shuv it and then grabbing the board in an indy in either the 90 degree position or 270 position and then proceeding to finish the shuv it by continuing to finish the spin with the arm that grabbed the indy in the beginning of the Induvit.\n\n===Body Varials===\n*'''Body Varial'''- If you jump into the air and spin without spinning the board you can perform a Body Varial. You will know you have performed this right if you land with your back  forward.\n*'''Sex Change''' By combining a Shuv-It and a Body Varial you can perform a Sex Change. You will know you have done this right if you land with your back foot forward and the back of your board facing forward.\n\n== Contests ==\nThe first ever inland skimboard event and competition was put on by GoSkate skate shop in 1985 at a skim spot named ''Rio'' located along the [[American River]] in Sacramento, California. The second inland skimboard event, ''Skim Fest'', occurred in 1997 and was also held in Sacramento along the American River at a popular skim spot known as ''Paradise Beach''. ''Skim Fest'' was created by skim pioneers Launie Porteous and Mark Robinson and the event has evolved into an annual competition since 1998 to present. It now holds the title as the longest running inland skim competition in the world.\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing/Skimboarding/|Skimboarding}}\n* [http://www.inlandskimboarding.blogspot.com/ Inland Skimboarding (USA)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140105190507/http://skimbc.com/ SkimBC - Inland Skimboarding Resource]\n* [http://www.dbskimboards.com DB Skimboards: Dedicated to flatland skimboarding]\n* [http://www.bickskimboards.com Bick Skimboards: For Friends For Fun]\n* [http://www.seventyone.pl Seventyone Skimboards]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flatland Skimboarding}}\n[[Category:Skimboarding]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=July 2010}}\n{{colloquial|date=February 2008}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Skimboardin in V\u00e4xj\u00f6.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Flatland skimboarding]]\n'''Flatland skimboarding''' (also known as '''inland skimboarding''') is a form of [[skimboarding]] practiced on non-coastal waters, such as a river, lake, stream or puddle.

A cartoonist for the ''Homestead Epitaph'' who was successful enough to eventually attend [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) where his interest in the fine arts intensified and was encouraged by [[UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture]] professors [[Paul McCarthy]] and [[Don Suggs]]. McCarthy's support helped earn him UCLA's [[Clifton Webb]] Award for his achievement in [[performance art]]. Sullivan earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from UCLA in 1988.\n\n== Background ==\nPerformance art, painting and writing continue to be his primary pursuits. Since 1984, he has enacted approximately 24 documented performances and eight solo exhibitions, and has been included in several dozen group exhibitions throughout the United States and in Europe. Art critic [[David Pagel]] has noted Sullivan's focus on \"the potential significance of mundane events and apparently unremarkable occurrences\".<ref>Pagel, David S. \"Kevin Sullivan at Sue Spaid Fine Art\", ARTFORUM, Feb. 1993, pgs. 104-105</ref> His subjects are often the neglected and abused cultural achievements of the past. His projects include ''Towards an Ape Theatre'' (2016), ''old taco bells'' (2014), ''This is Bruxism'' (2000), ''The Revolutionist'' (1998), ''Residuum'' (1991) and ''The Diaries of Paul Varnac'' (1988). In 1990, he curated the exhibition ''Frontier Tales'' with Jan Tumlir for [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] (LACE) which included the work of Clive Barker, Russell Crotty, Sandy Hubshman, Daniel Johnston, Gina Lamb, Joan Mahony, Craig Stecyk and Kamar Uwais. He has published three artist books, and his critical writing on art, music and film has appeared in the magazines ''Dirt'', ''Raygun'', ''Visions'', ''Xtra'' and the ''transfixion'' blogspot , often under the name Sidral Mundet (a brand of Mexican soda pop).\n\n== Career ==\nDuring the early 1990s, Sullivan was represented by [[Sue Spaid]] Fine Art in Los Angeles and Jose Freire Fine Art in New York and had some measure of conventional success, primarily with the series ''Residuum'' : paintings based on old rock and roll album covers that focused on the materiality and artistic sophistication of those objects. The series earned the artist critical acclaim from numerous periodicals, including [[Art in America]], [[The New York Times]], [[The San Francisco Examiner]] and [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], as well as the active interest of several collectors and curators. Sullivan's paintings ''Raw Power and Mayonnaise'' (1991) and ''Paranoid Gatefold with Grape Jelly'' (1993) were both prominently featured in the traveling exhibition and Prestal-Verlag catalog ''It's Only Rock and Roll'', curated by [[David S.

In the late 1990s he continued showing in primarily artist-run exhibitions, while also playing electric bass for the pop/rock group Maw and Paw. In 1996, he married Zazu Faure, designer, toy maker and daughter of Los Angeles art dealer [[Patricia Faure]]. By 1998 his artwork became more overtly political, evidenced by his performance related short film ''The Revolutionist'' (1998), which found critical support in curator [[Michael Darling (curator)|Michael Darling]] who included it in his contribution to ''Performance Festival Odense'' in Denmark in 1999. According to Darling, \"The Revolutionist combines a colonial, expansionist narrative with the distinctively retrogressive characters from [[Planet of the Apes]] to make an allegorical work propelled by ambiguous historical dynamics.\"<ref>Darling, Michael Motion Studies catalog essay Performance Festival Odense 1999, pg. 56</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Sullivan founded 401K, a company dedicated to architectural and cultural preservation that also oversees his book publications. He continues with live performance, generally in public spaces and often prompted by his writing and drawing. In 2016, he performed a reading of his essay ''Towards an Ape Theatre parts I-V'' on the streets of The [[Pasadena Playhouse]] District, exploring the relationship between [[Planet of the Apes]], the radical theatre of [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[opera]].\n\nDuring 2017 Sullivan formed the conceptual art rock and roll group The Simian Racket, while defining art rock and roll as a unique social/musical phenomena with beginnings in England's [[The Who]].

For the Waldkunstphad (Forest Art Path), Sullivan enacted \"Towards an Ape Theatre part VI: The Simian Racket\", four distinct performance events, some lasting up to three hours, and consisting of readings, impromptu dialog and a non-electric form of rock and roll played on instruments built from forest materials and refuse.\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thisisbruxism.com/publications thisisbruxism.com]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sullivan, Kevin}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American artists]]\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name           = Kevin Sullivan\n| image          = \n| birth_date     = 1964\n| birth_place    = [[San Francisco]]\n| education = [[UCLA]]\n| occupation     = Artist\n| known_for    = [[Painting]], [[Performance Art]]\n}}\n\n'''Kevin Sullivan''', American artist (born 1964), lives and works in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n== Education ==\nHis early education was in California's public school system, including [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)]].

It was directed by [[David Fincher]] with a screenplay by [[Steven Zaillian]]. Starring [[Daniel Craig]] as journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]] and [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Lisbeth Salander]], it tells the story of Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of Salander, a computer hacker.\n\n[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]] began development on the film in 2009. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while also recruiting Zaillian and Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.\n\nThe film premiered at [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in [[London]] on December 12, 2011. Critics gave the film positive reviews, praising its bleak and dark tones and lauding Craig's and Mara's performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million worldwide. The film was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2011#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2011]] and was a candidate for numerous awards, winning, among others, the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]],<ref name=Oscars>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html|title=84th Academy Award winners|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> while Mara's performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2012|title=The 84th Academy Awards {{!}} 2012|work=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHola popow\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Stockholm]], disgraced journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]] is recovering from the legal and professional fallout of a libel suit brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m, straining Blomkvist's relationship with his business partner and married lover, Erika Berger. [[Lisbeth Salander]], a young, brilliant but antisocial investigator and [[Security hacker|hacker]], compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for the wealthy Henrik Vanger, who offers Blomkvist evidence against Wennerstr\u00f6m in exchange for an unusual task: investigate the 40-year-old disappearance and presumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet. Blomkvist agrees, and moves into a cottage on the Vanger family estate on Hedestad Island.\n\nSalander's state-appointed guardian, Holger Palmgren, suffers a stroke and is replaced by Nils Bjurman, a sadist who controls Salander's finances and extorts sexual favors by threatening to have her institutionalized. Unaware she is secretly recording one of their meetings, Bjurman brutally rapes her. At their next meeting, Salander tasers Bjurman, binds him to his bed, anally rapes him with a metallic [[dildo]], and tattoos \"I'm a rapist pig\" across his torso. Using the secret recording she'd made, she blackmails him into securing her independence and having no further contact with her.\n\nBlomkvist explores the island and interviews various Vanger family members, learning some were Nazi sympathizers during WWII. He uncovers a list of names and numbers that his visiting daughter, Pernilla, notices are Bible verse references. Blomkvist discovers that Salander had researched him illegally, but rather than report it, he recruits her as his research assistant. She uncovers a connection between the list and numerous young women brutally murdered from 1947 to 1967, indicating a serial killer. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of his adopted cat on the doorstep. Another night, while walking outdoors, a bullet grazes his forehead; after Salander tends his wounds, they have sex. Blomkvist begins to suspect Martin, Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire. Salander also uncovers evidence that Martin and Harriet's late father, Gottfried, and later Martin, committed the murders.\n\nBlomkvist breaks into Martin's house to obtain more proof, but Martin arrives and catches him. He forces Blomkvist into his specially prepared basement, knocking him out and placing him in restraints. Martin brags about killing women for decades, as did his father, who sexually abused him and Harriet, but denies murdering Harriet. As Martin is about to kill Blomkvist, Salander arrives, attacking Martin and forcing him to flee in his SUV. Salander pursues Martin aboard her motorbike until he runs off the road and is killed. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and tells him that, as a child, she was institutionalized after attempting to burn her father alive.\n\nThey deduce that Harriet is alive and in hiding; traveling to London, they confront Harriet's cousin, Anita, only to discover she is Harriet. Harriet reveals that her father and brother sexually abused her for years, and that Martin witnessed her killing their father in self-defense. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her off the island and let Harriet assume her identity in London, though Anita and her husband were later killed in a car accident. Finally free of her brother, Harriet returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.\n\nAs promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist information against Wennerstr\u00f6m, but it proves to be outdated and useless. Salander reveals that she had hacked Wennerstr\u00f6m's accounts, and gives Blomkvist evidence of Wennerstr\u00f6m's crimes, which Blomkvist uses to ruin him. Salander travels to Switzerland in disguise and removes two billion euros from Wennerstr\u00f6m's secret accounts. Wennerstr\u00f6m is later murdered in an apparent gangland shooting. \n\nOn her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him with Erika. She discards the gift and rides away on her motorbike.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Mikael Blomkvist]]:\n:A co-owner for Swedish magazine ''Millennium'', Blomkvist is devoted to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government, attracting infamy for his tendency to \"go too far\".<ref name=filming>{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/girl_with_dragon/notes.pdf|title=The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Production Notes|format=PDF|publisher=Visual Hollywood|accessdate=June 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002202741/http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/girl_with_dragon/notes.pdf#|archive-date=October 2, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Craig competed with [[George Clooney]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], and [[Brad Pitt]] as candidates for the role.<ref name=entd3>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/17/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo/|title=This week's cover: The secrets of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=June 17, 2010|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref><ref name=hollzgirl>{{cite web | last=Kilday | first= Greg | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-rooney-mara-281904| title=The Making of 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'| work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| date=January 24, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref> Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011) and ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) prompted Craig to postpone the casting process.<ref name=hollzgirl/><ref name=deadline/> Given the uncertainty surrounding ''Skyfall'' following [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s bankruptcy, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part.<ref name=deadline>{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/07/daniel-craig-closes-deal-for-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo |title=Daniel Craig Closes Deal For 'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm's worldly cultural fabric.

Fincher recalled of the encounter: \"The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to.

To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer [[Jeff Cronenweth]] and production designer [[Donald Graham Burt]]. The film was wholly shot using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]]'s RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. \"So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, but at the same time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image.\"<ref name=filming/> Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, \"It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct.\"<ref name=filming/> To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, \"It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film.

It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. \"We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys,\" Miller explained, \"Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys.\"<ref name=i0/> Among Miller's many vignettes was \"The Hacker Inside\", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more [[cyberpunk]] appearance than the final product. In creating the \"cyber\" look for Salander, Miller said, \"Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the [[Tandy Corporation#Computers|Tandy computers]]. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together.\"<ref name=i0>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5873372/an-exclusive-look-at-the-making-of-dragon-tattoos-stunning-titles|title=An Exclusive Look at the Making of Dragon Tattoo's Stunning Titles|first=Meredith|last=Woerner|publisher=[[io9]]|date=January 5, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFincher wanted the vignette to be a \"personal nightmare\" for Salander, replaying her darkest moments. \"Early on, we knew it was supposed to feel like a nightmare,\" Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, standing in the middle of a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the \"gooey\" element that was so desired. \"David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette,\" Miller recalled. \"It ties everything together other than the black on black.\"<ref name=i0/>\n\nThe title sequence includes abundant references to the novel, and exposes several political themes. Salander's tattoos, such as her phoenix and dragon tattoos, were incorporated. The multiple flower representations signified the [[biological life cycle]], as well as Henrik, who received a pressed flower each year on his birthday. \"One had flowers coming out of this black ooze,\" said Fincher, \"it blossoms, and then it dies. And then a different flower, as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it. It was supposed to represent this cycle of the killer sending flowers.\"<ref name=i0/> Ultimately, the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took \"a whole thought, and cut it up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots\". In one instance, Blomkvist is strangled by strips of newspaper, a metaphor for the establishment squelching his exposes.<ref name=i0/>\n\nIn the \"Hot Hands\" vignette, a pair of rough, distorted hands that embrace Salander's face and melt it represent all that's bad in men.

Dragon Tattoo''''' is a 2011 [[psychological]] [[crime thriller]] film based on the [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo|2005 novel]] by Swedish writer [[Stieg Larsson]].  It was directed by [[David Fincher]] with a screenplay by [[Steven Zaillian]]. Starring [[Daniel Craig]] as journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]] and [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Lisbeth Salander]], it tells the story of Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years prior. He recruits the help of Salander, a computer hacker.\n\n[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]] began development on the film in 2009. It took the company a few months to obtain the rights to the novel, while also recruiting Zaillian and Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.\n\nThe film premiered at [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in [[London]] on December 12, 2011. Critics gave the film positive reviews, praising its bleak and dark tones and lauding Craig's and Mara's performances. With a production budget of $90 million, the film grossed $232.6 million worldwide. The film was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2011#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2011]] and was a candidate for numerous awards, winning, among others, the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]],<ref name=Oscars>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html|title=84th Academy Award winners|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}</ref> while Mara's performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2012|title=The 84th Academy Awards {{!}} 2012|work=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Stockholm]], disgraced journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]] is recovering from the legal and professional fallout of a libel suit brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m, straining Blomkvist's relationship with his business partner and married lover, Erika Berger. [[Lisbeth Salander]], a young, brilliant but antisocial investigator and [[Security hacker|hacker]], compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for the wealthy Henrik Vanger, who offers Blomkvist evidence against Wennerstr\u00f6m in exchange for an unusual task: investigate the 40-year-old disappearance and presumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet. Blomkvist agrees, and moves into a cottage on the Vanger family estate on Hedestad Island.\n\nSalander's state-appointed guardian, Holger Palmgren, suffers a stroke and is replaced by Nils Bjurman, a sadist who controls Salander's finances and extorts sexual favors by threatening to have her institutionalized. Unaware she is secretly recording one of their meetings, Bjurman brutally rapes her. At their next meeting, Salander tasers Bjurman, binds him to his bed, anally rapes him with a metallic [[dildo]], and tattoos \"I'm a rapist pig\" across his torso. Using the secret recording she'd made, she blackmails him into securing her independence and having no further contact with her.\n\nBlomkvist explores the island and interviews various Vanger family members, learning some were Nazi sympathizers during WWII. He uncovers a list of names and numbers that his visiting daughter, Pernilla, notices are Bible verse references. Blomkvist discovers that Salander had researched him illegally, but rather than report it, he recruits her as his research assistant. She uncovers a connection between the list and numerous young women brutally murdered from 1947 to 1967, indicating a serial killer. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of his adopted cat on the doorstep. Another night, while walking outdoors, a bullet grazes his forehead; after Salander tends his wounds, they have sex. Blomkvist begins to suspect Martin, Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire. Salander also uncovers evidence that Martin and Harriet's late father, Gottfried, and later Martin, committed the murders.\n\nBlomkvist breaks into Martin's house to obtain more proof, but Martin arrives and catches him. He forces Blomkvist into his specially prepared basement, knocking him out and placing him in restraints. Martin brags about killing women for decades, as did his father, who sexually abused him and Harriet, but denies murdering Harriet. As Martin is about to kill Blomkvist, Salander arrives, attacking Martin and forcing him to flee in his SUV. Salander pursues Martin aboard her motorbike until he runs off the road and is killed. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and tells him that, as a child, she was institutionalized after attempting to burn her father alive.\n\nThey deduce that Harriet is alive and in hiding; traveling to London, they confront Harriet's cousin, Anita, only to discover she is Harriet. Harriet reveals that her father and brother sexually abused her for years, and that Martin witnessed her killing their father in self-defense. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her off the island and let Harriet assume her identity in London, though Anita and her husband were later killed in a car accident. Finally free of her brother, Harriet returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.\n\nAs promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist information against Wennerstr\u00f6m, but it proves to be outdated and useless. Salander reveals that she had hacked Wennerstr\u00f6m's accounts, and gives Blomkvist evidence of Wennerstr\u00f6m's crimes, which Blomkvist uses to ruin him.

Fincher recalled of the encounter: \"The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to.

To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer [[Jeff Cronenweth]] and production designer [[Donald Graham Burt]]. The film was wholly shot using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]]'s RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. \"So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, but at the same time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image.\"<ref name=filming/> Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, \"It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct.\"<ref name=filming/> To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, \"It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film.

Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the \"gooey\" element that was so desired. \"David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette,\" Miller recalled. \"It ties everything together other than the black on black.\"<ref name=i0/>\n\nThe title sequence includes abundant references to the novel, and exposes several political themes. Salander's tattoos, such as her phoenix and dragon tattoos, were incorporated. The multiple flower representations signified the [[biological life cycle]], as well as Henrik, who received a pressed flower each year on his birthday. \"One had flowers coming out of this black ooze,\" said Fincher, \"it blossoms, and then it dies. And then a different flower, as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it. It was supposed to represent this cycle of the killer sending flowers.\"<ref name=i0/> Ultimately, the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took \"a whole thought, and cut it up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots\". In one instance, Blomkvist is strangled by strips of newspaper, a metaphor for the establishment squelching his exposes.<ref name=i0/>\n\nIn the \"Hot Hands\" vignette, a pair of rough, distorted hands that embrace Salander's face and melt it represent all that's bad in men. The hands that embrace Blomkvist's face and shatter it, represent wealth and power.<ref name=i0/> Themes of [[domestic violence]] become apparent as a woman's face shatters after a merciless beating; this also ties in the brutal beating of Salander's mother by her father, an event revealed in the sequel, ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"i0\" />\n\nA cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Immigrant Song]]\" (1970) plays throughout the title sequence.

He was filming at this time last year and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently.\" Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. \"We weren\u2019t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work.

As part of the Women's Caucus of ACT-UP she and other Caucus members put together a \"teach-in\" on the politics and problems faced by women with AIDS. This was the first public forum to specifically address the spectrum of issues faced by women living with AIDS. Her contribution, an essay on the epidemiological differences observed by researchers studying the presenting symptoms and progression of AIDS in men and women was included in the Women and AIDS Handbook that documented the teach-in. The Handbook was, until the early 90s, the only document to focus on all the issues faced by the growing number of women infected with HIV and living with AIDS. The Handbook was translated into nearly 90 different languages. Later published in a revised and expanded form as Women, Aids & Activism by [[South End Press]] in 1990,<ref>Women, Aids & Activism by the Women's Caucus ([[South End Press]] 1992)</ref> Pokorny's essay provided the impetus for a lengthier treatise on the subject of epidemiological issues and her essay, while not appearing in the book provided the research for the expanded and revised essay on the issue that did appear. She was given credit in the book's introduction.\n\n==\"Obsess Yourself\"==\n\nPokorny published numerous articles in Boston's Gay Community News. One of her contributions, cultural criticism on Madonna and \"the lesbian gaze\" called \"Obsess Yourself\"<ref>Pokorny, Sydney (1989) \"Obsess yourself! The root of my obsession with Sandra and Madonna is unbridled lust.\" ''Gay Community News'' (30 July \u2013 5 August), pages  9-10.</ref> was published in the Gay Community News in 1989. It became an oft-cited work in the then growing field of \"Madonna Studies.\" \"Obsess Yourself\" attempted to blend autobiography, cultural studies, minority cultures, issues of identity and Madonna. Quotations from \"Obsess Yourself\" may be found in essay collections as diverse as: ''AIDS and the National Body'' by Thomas E. Yingling and Robyn Wiegman, ''Acting Out: Lesbian Performances'' by Lynda Hart and Peggy Phelan,<ref>Robinson, Amy, \"Is She or Isn't She?: Madonna and the Erotics of Appropriation,\" collected in ''Acting Out: Feminist Performances'', edited by Lynda Hart and Peggy Phelan, University of Michigan Press, 1993, pages 337-360. Reference to \"Obsess Yourself\" on p. 338, noted in footnotes on p. 357.</ref> ''The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory'', edited by Cathy Schwichtenberg<ref>Referenced on pp. 119 and 121.</ref> and ''I Dream of Madonna'', edited by [[Kay Turner]]. Arlene Stein references the article in her book ''Sisters, Sexperts, Queers: Beyond the Lesbian Nation'', noting Pokorny's observance that Madonna was both \"[c]lothed in the language of heterosexuality\" but \"soliciting a lesbian gaze.\"<ref>Stein, Arlene, ''Sisters, Sexperts, Queers: Beyond the Lesbian Nation'', Plume, 1993, p. 103.</ref> It was also part of the syllabus used in the University of Liverpool's course on Voice, Fragmentation, and Subjectivity in Popular Music.<ref>[http://www.liv.ac.uk/music/downloads/FJI%20research Dr Freya Jarman-Ivens: Research, University of Liverpool School of Music] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905140229/http://www.liv.ac.uk/music/downloads/FJI%20research |date=2012-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==Collaborations with Liz Tracey, ''Outweek'' and ''So You Want to be a Lesbian''==\n\nFollowing her contributions to the Gay Community News, Pokorny began contributing articles on gay and lesbian culture to the fledgling publication, Outweek.

''So You Want be a Lesbian'' was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award<ref name=\"Awards from 1996 - 1999\"/> the year it was released, losing out to ''The History of Lesbian Hair''.

The author of numerous articles on topics ranging from \"[[Madonna Studies]]\" to art criticism and the [[AIDS]] epidemic; she also cowrote the [[Lambda Literary Award]] nominated<ref name=\"Awards from 1996 - 1999\">[http://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/previous_winners/paw_1996_1999.html www.lambdaliterary.org - Awards from 1996 - 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130190050/http://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/previous_winners/paw_1996_1999.html |date=2009-01-30 }}</ref> ''So You Want to be a Lesbian?'' with Liz Tracey.\n\n==ACT-UP and the Women's Caucus==\n\nIn 1989, she joined the newly formed Women's Caucus<ref>[http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-90.html ]</ref> of [[ACT-UP]] after nearly a year in the group protesting housing issues, governmental policy, and lack of action by city and state agencies. As part of the Women's Caucus of ACT-UP she and other Caucus members put together a \"teach-in\" on the politics and problems faced by women with AIDS. This was the first public forum to specifically address the spectrum of issues faced by women living with AIDS. Her contribution, an essay on the epidemiological differences observed by researchers studying the presenting symptoms and progression of AIDS in men and women was included in the Women and AIDS Handbook that documented the teach-in. The Handbook was, until the early 90s, the only document to focus on all the issues faced by the growing number of women infected with HIV and living with AIDS. The Handbook was translated into nearly 90 different languages. Later published in a revised and expanded form as Women, Aids & Activism by [[South End Press]] in 1990,<ref>Women, Aids & Activism by the Women's Caucus ([[South End Press]] 1992)</ref> Pokorny's essay provided the impetus for a lengthier treatise on the subject of epidemiological issues and her essay, while not appearing in the book provided the research for the expanded and revised essay on the issue that did appear. She was given credit in the book's introduction.\n\n==\"Obsess Yourself\"==\n\nPokorny published numerous articles in Boston's Gay Community News. One of her contributions, cultural criticism on Madonna and \"the lesbian gaze\" called \"Obsess Yourself\"<ref>Pokorny, Sydney (1989) \"Obsess yourself! The root of my obsession with Sandra and Madonna is unbridled lust.\" ''Gay Community News'' (30 July \u2013 5 August), pages  9-10.</ref> was published in the Gay Community News in 1989. It became an oft-cited work in the then growing field of \"Madonna Studies.\" \"Obsess Yourself\" attempted to blend autobiography, cultural studies, minority cultures, issues of identity and Madonna. Quotations from \"Obsess Yourself\" may be found in essay collections as diverse as: ''AIDS and the National Body'' by Thomas E. Yingling and Robyn Wiegman, ''Acting Out: Lesbian Performances'' by Lynda Hart and Peggy Phelan,<ref>Robinson, Amy, \"Is She or Isn't She?: Madonna and the Erotics of Appropriation,\" collected in ''Acting Out: Feminist Performances'', edited by Lynda Hart and Peggy Phelan, University of Michigan Press, 1993, pages 337-360. Reference to \"Obsess Yourself\" on p. 338, noted in footnotes on p. 357.</ref> ''The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, and Cultural Theory'', edited by Cathy Schwichtenberg<ref>Referenced on pp. 119 and 121.</ref> and ''I Dream of Madonna'', edited by [[Kay Turner]]. Arlene Stein references the article in her book ''Sisters, Sexperts, Queers: Beyond the Lesbian Nation'', noting Pokorny's observance that Madonna was both \"[c]lothed in the language of heterosexuality\" but \"soliciting a lesbian gaze.\"<ref>Stein, Arlene, ''Sisters, Sexperts, Queers: Beyond the Lesbian Nation'', Plume, 1993, p. 103.</ref> It was also part of the syllabus used in the University of Liverpool's course on Voice, Fragmentation, and Subjectivity in Popular Music.<ref>[http://www.liv.ac.uk/music/downloads/FJI%20research Dr Freya Jarman-Ivens: Research, University of Liverpool School of Music] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905140229/http://www.liv.ac.uk/music/downloads/FJI%20research |date=2012-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==Collaborations with Liz Tracey, ''Outweek'' and ''So You Want to be a Lesbian''==\n\nFollowing her contributions to the Gay Community News, Pokorny began contributing articles on gay and lesbian culture to the fledgling publication, Outweek. There she wrote humorous articles about everything from her passion for Coco Chanel<ref>Pokorny, Sydney, \"A Lesbian's Lust for Coco,\" Outweek, November 26, 1989</ref> to her admiration for drag queens<ref>Pokorny, Sydney, \"Confessions of a Lesbo Drag Hag,\" Outweek, October 29, 1989</ref> Eventually, she teamed up with writer Liz Tracey to contribute a weekly nightlife column called \"Out on the Town.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stardustlanes.com/oott|title=Out on the Town: Liz and Sydney in Outweek 1990-1991|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatrice.com/interviews/tracey/|title=The BEATRICE Interview: 1996|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Pokorny and Tracey published ''So You Want to be a Lesbian?''

''So You Want be a Lesbian'' was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award<ref name=\"Awards from 1996 - 1999\"/> the year it was released, losing out to ''The History of Lesbian Hair''.

The game used an experience point system and afterlife mechanics rooted deeply in Viking mythology.\n\nSeveral different editions and supplements (mostly adventures) were published in digital form since then.  Starting in mid-2012, print versions of a few core products became available, leading to renewed interest and new planned products.\n\n==Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok and the RGS==\n\nThe most recent editions, starting with 2006's \"Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok,\" replace earlier editions' dice-based skill checks and combat mechanics with a new system based on regular [[Elder Futhark]] Runes for flavor, albeit in a very non-traditional way.  They are also somewhat more supernatural-oriented than previous editions, in part due to the change of premise from the conflicts between Aesir and Vanir to the unraveling of the Nordic end times, the Ragnarok.  In both editions of \"Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok,\" characters do in fact need to die in order to progress past a certain point, and the character sheets include information about their legacy from previous lives.\n\n==Game Summary==\nLegend has it that during every man\u2019s birth, the three Norns come to discuss his destiny and time of death. When they decide that man\u2019s fate, no mortal or deity may change the course of the future. It is said that even Ragnarok, the twilight of the Gods, was determined by the [[Norns]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wagnervalkyr.jpg|thumb|left|''Fate of the Norns'' was initially published in 1993 with this 1912 illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] as its cover.]]\n\n===Fate of the Norns, first edition (1993-2013)===\n(1993\u20132000) ''Fate of the Norns'' first edition ({{ISBN|978-098654140-7}}) achieved viral internet distribution in the late 1990s via a free demo pdf. This pdf was a pruned down version of the full game, with 80 pages as opposed to the full product's 320.<ref>\n{{Citation \n| url   = http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_6540.html\n| title = Review of the free extract of FOTN First Edition by John Macey; 2002-01-06\n| work  = RPG.NET\n| accessdate = 2013-12-22\n}}</ref> The game brought about a wide and colorful breath of magic and occupations- 6 types of distinct magic (independent systems), and over 35 occupations.

With the advent of MMORPGs and combat evolving into more than a roll-to-hit and roll-for-damage model, the game engine incorporated a myriad of special maneuvers, allowing players a colorful repertoire of actions during combat. This eliminated the classic [[Role-playing game|RPG]] combat grid. The character progression was changed from linear to distributed.

The game used an experience point system and afterlife mechanics rooted deeply in Viking mythology.\n\nSeveral different editions and supplements (mostly adventures) were published in digital form since then.  Starting in mid-2012, print versions of a few core products became available, leading to renewed interest and new planned products.\n\n==Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok and the RGS==\n\nThe most recent editions, starting with 2006's \"Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok,\" replace earlier editions' dice-based skill checks and combat mechanics with a new system based on regular [[Elder Futhark]] Runes for flavor, albeit in a very non-traditional way.  They are also somewhat more supernatural-oriented than previous editions, in part due to the change of premise from the conflicts between Aesir and Vanir to the unraveling of the Nordic end times, the Ragnarok.  In both editions of \"Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok,\" characters do in fact need to die in order to progress past a certain point, and the character sheets include information about their legacy from previous lives.\n\n==Game Summary==\nLegend has it that during every man\u2019s birth, the three Norns come to discuss his destiny and time of death. When they decide that man\u2019s fate, no mortal or deity may change the course of the future. It is said that even Ragnarok, the twilight of the Gods, was determined by the [[Norns]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wagnervalkyr.jpg|thumb|left|''Fate of the Norns'' was initially published in 1993 with this 1912 illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] as its cover.]]\n\n===Fate of the Norns, first edition (1993-2013)===\n(1993\u20132000) ''Fate of the Norns'' first edition ({{ISBN|978-098654140-7}}) achieved viral internet distribution in the late 90's via a free demo pdf.

With the advent of MMORPGs and combat evolving into more than a roll-to-hit and roll-for-damage model, the game engine incorporated a myriad of special maneuvers, allowing players a colorful repertoire of actions during combat. This eliminated the classic [[Role-playing game|RPG]] combat grid. The character progression was changed from linear to distributed. Rather than using a linear skill tree, the character skills would evolve over several \"chess boards\" of skills and abilities.\n\nIt also emphasized the historical background and introduced the theme of the [[Aesir]]-[[Vanir]] war.\n\nNotably, this edition has never been published as print product, and is in fact considerably harder to find than the first edition (which was readily available to buy both in PDF and Hardcover forms during much of 2012 and all of 2013).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok (2005-2006)===\n[[File:Fate of the norns ragnarok rpg first edition 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok RPG, First Edition, published in 2006.<br>First version of the RGS rules.]](2005\u20132011) ''Fate of the Norns: Ragnarok'' ({{ISBN|978-098654141-4}}) was a completely new departure for both the setting and the mechanics.

CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.<ref name=\"nczonline1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/ |title=Cross-domain Ajax with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing |publisher=NCZOnline |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}</ref> It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.\n\nThe specification for CORS is included as part of the [[WHATWG]]'s Fetch Living Standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/|title=Fetch Living Standard|publisher=}}</ref> This specification describes how CORS is currently implemented in browsers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/2017/08/16-webappsec-minutes.html#item03|title=WebAppSec Working Group Minutes|publisher=}}</ref> An earlier specification was published as a [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] Recommendation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/|title=Cross-Origin Resource Sharing|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== How CORS works ==\n\n[[File:Flowchart_showing_Simple_and_Preflight_XHR.svg|thumb|center|upright=3.5|Path of an [[XMLHttpRequest]](XHR) through CORS.]]\n\nThe CORS standard describes new HTTP headers which provide browsers a way to request remote URLs only when they have permission.  Although some validation and authorization can be performed by the server, it is generally the browser's responsibility to support these headers and honor the restrictions they impose.\n\nFor Ajax and [[Request method|HTTP request methods]] that can modify data (usually HTTP methods other than GET, or for [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] usage with certain [[MIME]] types), the specification mandates that browsers \"preflight\" the request, soliciting supported methods from the server with an HTTP OPTIONS request method, and then, upon \"approval\" from the server, sending the actual request with the actual HTTP request method. Servers can also notify clients whether \"credentials\" (including Cookies and HTTP Authentication data) should be sent with requests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/ |title=cross-site xmlhttprequest with CORS |publisher=MOZILLA |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}</ref>\n\n== Simple example ==\n\nSuppose a user visits <nowiki>http://www.example.com</nowiki> and the page attempts a cross-origin request to fetch the user's data from <nowiki>http://service.example.com</nowiki>.  A CORS-compatible browser will attempt to make a cross-origin request to <nowiki>service.example.com</nowiki> as follows.\n\n# The browser sends the GET request with an extra <code>Origin</code> [[HTTP header]] to <nowiki>service.example.com</nowiki> containing the domain that served the parent page:<pre><nowiki>Origin: http://www.example.com</nowiki></pre>\n# The server at service.example.com may respond with:\n#* The requested data along with an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> (ACAO) header in its response indicating the requests from the origin are allowed. For example in this case it should be: <pre><nowiki>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com</nowiki></pre>\n#* The requested data along with an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> (ACAO) header with a wildcard indicating that the requests from all domains are allowed: <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</pre>\n#* An error page if the server does not allow a cross-origin request\n\nA wildcard same-origin policy is appropriate when a page or API response is considered completely public content and it is intended to be accessible to everyone, including any code on any site. A freely-available [[web font]] on a public hosting service like [[Google Fonts]] is an example.\n\nA wildcard same-origin policy is also widely and appropriately used in the [[object-capability model]], where pages have unguessable URLs and are meant to be accessible to anyone who knows the secret.\n\nThe value of \"*\" is special in that it does not allow requests to supply credentials, meaning it does not allow HTTP authentication, client-side SSL certificates, or cookies to be sent in the cross-domain request.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-requests Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]. W3.org. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref>\n\nNote that in the CORS architecture, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is being set by the external web service (''service.example.com''), not the original web application server (''www.example.com'').

Although some validation and authorization can be performed by the server, it is generally the browser's responsibility to support these headers and honor the restrictions they impose.\n\nFor Ajax and [[Request method|HTTP request methods]] that can modify data (usually HTTP methods other than GET, or for [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] usage with certain [[MIME]] types), the specification mandates that browsers \"preflight\" the request, soliciting supported methods from the server with an HTTP OPTIONS request method, and then, upon \"approval\" from the server, sending the actual request with the actual HTTP request method. Servers can also notify clients whether \"credentials\" (including Cookies and HTTP Authentication data) should be sent with requests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/ |title=cross-site xmlhttprequest with CORS |publisher=MOZILLA |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}</ref>\n\n== Simple example ==\n\nSuppose a user visits <nowiki>http://www.example.com</nowiki> and the page attempts a cross-origin request to fetch the user's data from <nowiki>http://service.example.com</nowiki>.  A CORS-compatible browser will attempt to make a cross-origin request to <nowiki>service.example.com</nowiki> as follows.\n\n# The browser sends the GET request with an extra <code>Origin</code> [[HTTP header]] to <nowiki>service.example.com</nowiki> containing the domain that served the parent page:<pre><nowiki>Origin: http://www.example.com</nowiki></pre>\n# The server at service.example.com may respond with:\n#* The requested data along with an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> (ACAO) header in its response indicating the requests from the origin are allowed. For example in this case it should be: <pre><nowiki>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com</nowiki></pre>\n#* The requested data along with an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> (ACAO) header with a wildcard indicating that the requests from all domains are allowed: <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</pre>\n#* An error page if the server does not allow a cross-origin request\n\nA wildcard same-origin policy is appropriate when a page or API response is considered completely public content and it is intended to be accessible to everyone, including any code on any site. A freely-available [[web font]] on a public hosting service like [[Google Fonts]] is an example.\n\nA wildcard same-origin policy is also widely and appropriately used in the [[object-capability model]], where pages have unguessable URLs and are meant to be accessible to anyone who knows the secret.\n\nThe value of \"*\" is special in that it does not allow requests to supply credentials, meaning it does not allow HTTP authentication, client-side SSL certificates, or cookies to be sent in the cross-domain request.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-requests Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]. W3.org.
