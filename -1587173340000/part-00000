It was released on November 6, 1967, when the Monkees were exerting more control over their music and had started to play many of the instruments themselves, something their record company had previously forbidden. ''Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.'' sold more than three million copies and was also the band's fourth consecutive album to reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe group did employ studio musicians to a greater extent than their previous album, ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'', on which the four musicians played almost entirely on their own. Guitarist [[Michael Nesmith]] is heard vocally on this album more than ever before, singing lead on five cuts; conversely, [[Micky Dolenz]] sings lead on only three tracks after dominating the group's first three albums. The album's single, \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\" b/w \"Words\", was a double-sided hit.\n\nThe album was among the earliest to make use of the [[Moog synthesizer]], which Dolenz introduced to the group and played in the studio; he owned one of the first twenty ever sold.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.moogarchives.com/modular.htm | title = Moog Modular Systems | work = moogarchives.com | accessdate = 2014-09-30}}</ref> Along with [[the Doors]]' September 1967 album ''[[Strange Days (Doors album)|Strange Days]]'', ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' by [[the Rolling Stones]] in December, and [[the Byrds]]' January 1968 album ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'', ''Pisces'' was one of the first commercial recordings featuring the Moog to reach a wide audience. Dolenz plays the synthesizer on \"[[Daily Nightly]]\", while electronic musician [[Paul Beaver]] plays the Moog on \"[[Star Collector]]\".\n\nTwo additional songs, which eventually became the single \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" b/w \"Goin' Down\", were recorded during the album sessions. Released in October 1967 as a prelude to the ''Pisces'' album, it would be the group's last {{thinspace|No.|1}} single.\n\nThe album's title stems from each band member's respective [[astrological sign]]: Dolenz is Pisces, [[Peter Tork]] is Aquarius, and both Nesmith and [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] are Capricorn. However, since Nesmith and Jones share the same sun sign and birthday (December 30), Jones' last name was placed at the end of the title to avoid confusion. \n\nThe album's cover features a drawing by Bernard Yezsin of the four Monkees, their facial features blank, standing in a field of flowers with the group's guitar logo half-buried. The drawing was based on a photo of the group Yezsin had taken.\n\nIn 2007, Rhino issued a two-disc deluxe edition of the album. The CD set featured original album artwork (including replicas of the original Colgems vinyl labels on each disc), as well as a booklet of essays and session information by Monkees historian [[Andrew Sandoval]]. The discs contain both the stereo and mono mixes of the album, remastered, as well as alternate mixes and outtakes.\n\n===Aborted single===\nThe original single to precede the album, \"Love Is Only Sleeping\" b/w \"Daydream Believer\", was canceled, due to fears that the title of the A-side might be too risqu\u00e9. \"Daydream Believer\" was instead switched to the A-side, with \"Goin' Down\" placed on the B-side.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===Original 1967 Colgems vinyl issue===\n\n;Side 1\n{{Track listing\n| headline =\n| all_writing = \n| extra_column = Lead vocals\n\n| title1 =

The song refers to the adventure of a travelling salesman.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studio A, Hollywood, June 14, 1967\n\n'''\"She Hangs Out\"'''\n* Written by [[Jeff Barry]]\n* Lead vocal by Davy Jones\n* Backing vocals: Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith, and Unknown\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* Percussion: Unknown\n* Trumpet: Pete Candoli, Robert Helfer, Al Porcino, Manuel Stevens\n* Bass Trombone: Richard Leith, Philip Teele\n* Trombone: Richard Noel\n* Arrangement: [[Shorty Rogers]]\n* Used on episode #41 (\"The Card Carrying Red Shoes\"), without the horns (the hornless master remains lost, but available on Remastered, Deluxe Edition \u2013 \"Alternate Stereo Mix\")\n* This was a remake of the January 1967 cut that [[Don Kirshner]] released without authorization in Canada; the release helped lead to Kirshner's firing from Colgems records.\n* The original mono mix features a longer fade than on the stereo mix.\n* Used in the episodes \"Card Carrying Red Shoes\" and \"Some Like It Lukewarm\"\n* While Jeff Barry is officially credited as the writer of the song, several sites and sources claim [[Ellie Greenwich]] to have co-written the track.<ref>http://www.popsike.com/THE-MONKEESSHE-HANGS-OUTRARE-WITHDRAWN-CANADIAN-45/280576882261.html</ref>\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studio B, New York City, July 21, 1967\n\n'''\"The Door into Summer\"'''\n* Written by [[Chip Douglas]] and [[William E.

Close listening to the finished recording reveals that there are two separate drum tracks. The right channel features drumming which continues through the entire track. At the start of the second verse, another drum track begins in the left channel and continues through the rest of the song.\n* Used in the episodes \"Monkees on the Wheel\" and \"Some Like It Lukewarm\"\n* The song was officially written by Bill Martin and Chip Douglas, though the latter denies any writing contribution.\n* An early unused mono mix released on the deluxe edition used slightly different vocals.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, May 29 and August 23, 1967\n\n'''\"Love Is Only Sleeping\"'''\n* Written by [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]]\n* Lead vocal by Michael Nesmith\n* Harmony vocals: Micky Dolenz\n* Backing vocals: Davy Jones\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Acoustic guitar: Chip Douglas\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* Percussion: Davy Jones\n* Sound Effects: Bill Chadwick\n* Unknown: Bill Martin, Harry Nilsson\n* Not originally intended to be included on ''Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.'' as the song was to be issued as a single instead\n* After a manufacturing error caused some delays, Colgems rethought the strategy and released the more commercial \"Daydream Believer\" as the single instead, with \"Goin' Down\" as its B-side\n* The song was featured on three episodes of the TV show\u2014\"Everywhere a Sheik, Sheik\", \"I Was A 99-pound Weakling\", and \"The Monkees In Paris.\" The Paris episode features the song's released mix while the first two episodes feature a more stripped-down version derived from the song's original four-track mix before it was transferred to eight-track magnetic tape for additional mixing.This song was the first song by Nesmith after his surgery in 1967.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 19 and August 1967\n\n'''\"Cuddly Toy\"'''\n* Written by [[Harry Nilsson]]\n* Lead vocal by Davy Jones\n* Harmony vocals: Micky Dolenz\n* Backing vocals: Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork \n* Acoustic & electric guitars: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Micky Dolenz\n* Tambourine: Davy Jones\n* Piano: Peter Tork\n* Electric Piano: Peter Tork\n* Cello: Edgar Lustgarten\n* Wind: Ted Nash, Tom Scott, Bud Shank\n* This song and \"The Door Into Summer\" are the only songs featuring Micky behind the drums on the album\n* Demo was under the name \"By Any Boy\"\n* Selected by the band after Nilsson auditioned several songs for the group\n* Some have interpreted the lyrics as being about a [[gang bang]].

The band said that this lineup is what The Monkees should have been, as these instrument choices best represented the individual members' strengths (Nesmith believed Tork was a better guitarist than he, while Nesmith himself was particularly accomplished as a bass guitarist.  Jones was the only member of The Monkees who already knew how to play the drums). But, Nesmith played the guitar and Tork played the bass and organ, Jones played the chimes and \"Fast\" Eddie Hoh played the drums.\n* Reached number 11 on the pop charts\n* This version used in summer 1967 rebroadcast of the episodes \"Monkees in a Ghost Town\" and \"Monkees Chow Mein\"; then used in the second season episodes \"Monkees in Texas\" and \"Monkees' Paw\" while the original version was used in the episode \"Monkees in Manhattan\"\n* The single mix is not the album mix. Dolenz says \"ah\" twice on the single mix.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studio A, Hollywood, June 14, 1967\n\n'''\"Hard To Believe\"'''\n* Written by David Jones, Kim Capli, Eddie Brick and Charlie Rockett\n* Lead vocal by Davy Jones\n* Guitar: Kim Capli\n* Bass: Kim Capli\n* Drums: Kim Capli\n* Percussion: Kim Capli\n* Piano: Kim Capli\n* Violin: Leonard Atkins, Arnold Belnick, Nathan Kaproff, Wilbert Nuttycombe, Jerome Reisler, Darrel Terwilliger\n* Flugelhorn: Oliver Mitchell, [[Tony Terran|Anthony Terran]]\n* French horn: Vincent DeRosa\n* Baritone saxophone: [[Jim Horn]]\n* Bass trombone: Robert Knight\n* Shaker: Kim Capli\n* Claves: Kim Capli\n* Cowbell: Kim Capli\n* Orchestrator: [[George Tipton]]\n* Arrangement: Roger Farris\n* This was the last new composition to be recorded that would make the album. It is also the only track apart from \"Peter Percival Patterson's Pet Pig Porky\" to feature a single Monkee, and the only track that only features session musicians on instruments.\n* This the only song from the original album not to be used on the TV show.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, August 23, 1967\n\n'''\"What Am I Doing Hangin' 'Round?\"'''\n* Written under the pseudonyms Travis Lewis and Boomer Clark, but actually the work of [[Michael Martin Murphey]] and Owens Castleman\n* Lead vocal by Michael Nesmith\n* Backing vocals: Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Electric banjo: Douglas Dillard\n* Chosen by Nesmith for the country feel it gave off; Murphy was an old friend of Nesmith\n* The released mix features group vocals, but an early mix featured only a double-tracked vocal by Nesmith.\n* Used in the episodes \"It's a Nice Place To Visit...\", \"Monkees Marooned\", and \"The Monkees Race Again\". The mix included in \"Monkees Marooned\" had a slightly longer run time, owing to the song's chorus being repeated four times after the last verse, instead of three times.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 20, 1967\n\n'''\"Peter Percival Patterson's Pet Pig Porky\"'''\n* Written by Peter Tork\n* Spoken words by Peter Tork\n* Taught to Peter by Judy Mayhan, whom he was managing at the time.\n* Peter admits that it was public domain, but when Screen Gems asked who wrote it he gave his name (which he could do, as 'arranger' of the piece)\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 10, 1967\n\n'''\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\"'''\n* Written by [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]]\n* Lead vocal by Micky Dolenz\n* Backing vocals: Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Acoustic guitar: Bill Chadwick\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Percussion: Davy Jones\n* Electric piano: Peter Tork\n* Released as a single before the album on July 10, 1967\n* Reached number 3 on the pop charts\n* Micky Dolenz was the only member of The Monkees to not contribute to this track instrumentally\n* The stereo album mix differs from the mix released as a single, also heard on the mono album. The stereo and mono mixes feature slightly different vocals by Micky on the opening verse (particularly obvious in the phrase \"just came out to mow his lawn\"\u2014in mono, the word \"out\" is heavily enunciated, while in stereo, it sounds more natural). Additionally, there are group backing vocals in stereo after Micky sings \"hard for me to see\" in the bridge; these are absent in the mono mix. The distortion occurring on the fade of the stereo mix also happens much more gradually than in mono.\n* The fade on both released mixes is deliberately drowned in reverb and noise, but a karaoke mix released in 2004 features a conventional fade.\n* First used in summer 1967 rebroadcast of the episodes \"Case Of The Missing Monkee\" and \"Captain Crocodile,\" then in the second season episodes \"The Picture Frame\" and \"Monkee Mayor.\"\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 10 and 11, 1967 after their [[Hollywood Bowl]] performance.\n\n'''\"[[Daily Nightly]]\"'''\n* Written by Michael Nesmith\n* Lead vocal by Micky Dolenz\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Moog synthesizer: Micky Dolenz\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* Percussion: Davy Jones\n* Nesmith's inspiration for this song stemmed from the infamous [[Sunset Strip]] riots and the misinformation that the media reported about the event; the event was first discussed by the boys in the epilogue interview segment of the episode \"Find The Monkees.\"\n* The mono and stereo mixes have slightly different Moog parts.\n* Used in the episodes \"Fairy Tale\" and \"The Monkees Blow Their Minds\"\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 19 and August 1967\n\n'''\"Don't Call on Me\"'''\n* Written by Michael Nesmith and [[John London]]\n* Lead vocal by Michael Nesmith\n* Spoken words: Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Acoustic guitar: Chip Douglas\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Claves: Eddie Hoh\n* Piano: Robert Rafelson\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* A reworked version of a pre-Monkees Nesmith song\n* Recorded during two Hollywood sessions, not from \"the elegant [[The Pump Room, Chicago|Pump Room]] of the magnificent [[Palmer House]], high over Chicago\", which could not be possible anyway.

It was released on November 6, 1967, when the Monkees were exerting more control over their music and had started to play many of the instruments themselves, something their record company had previously forbidden. ''Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.'' sold more than three million copies and was also the band's fourth consecutive album to reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe group did employ studio musicians to a greater extent than their previous album, ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'', on which the four musicians played almost entirely on their own. Guitarist [[Michael Nesmith]] is heard vocally on this album more than ever before, singing lead on five cuts; conversely, [[Micky Dolenz]] sings lead on only three tracks after dominating the group's first three albums. The album's single, \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\" b/w \"Words\", was a double-sided hit.\n\nThe album was among the earliest to make use of the [[Moog synthesizer]], which Dolenz introduced to the group and played in the studio; he owned one of the first twenty ever sold.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.moogarchives.com/modular.htm | title = Moog Modular Systems | work = moogarchives.com | accessdate = 2014-09-30}}</ref> Along with [[the Doors]]' September 1967 album ''[[Strange Days (Doors album)|Strange Days]]'', ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'' by [[the Rolling Stones]] in December, and [[the Byrds]]' January 1968 album ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'', ''Pisces'' was one of the first commercial recordings featuring the Moog to reach a wide audience. Dolenz plays the synthesizer on \"[[Daily Nightly]]\", while electronic musician [[Paul Beaver]] plays the Moog on \"[[Star Collector]]\".\n\nTwo additional songs, which eventually became the single \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" b/w \"Goin' Down\", were recorded during the album sessions. Released in October 1967 as a prelude to the ''Pisces'' album, it would be the group's last {{thinspace|No.|1}} single.\n\nThe album's title stems from each band member's respective [[astrological sign]]: Dolenz is Pisces, [[Peter Tork]] is Aquarius, and both Nesmith and [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] are Capricorn. However, since Nesmith and Jones share the same sun sign and birthday (December 30), Jones' last name was placed at the end of the title to avoid confusion. \n\nThe album's cover features a drawing by Bernard Yezsin of the four Monkees, their facial features blank, standing in a field of flowers with the group's guitar logo half-buried. The drawing was based on a photo of the group Yezsin had taken.\n\nIn 2007, Rhino issued a two-disc deluxe edition of the album. The CD set featured original album artwork (including replicas of the original Colgems vinyl labels on each disc), as well as a booklet of essays and session information by Monkees historian [[Andrew Sandoval]]. The discs contain both the stereo and mono mixes of the album, remastered, as well as alternate mixes and outtakes.\n\n===Aborted single===\nThe original single to precede the album, \"Love Is Only Sleeping\" b/w \"Daydream Believer\", was canceled, due to fears that the title of the A-side might be too risqu\u00e9. \"Daydream Believer\" was instead switched to the A-side, with \"Goin' Down\" placed on the B-side.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===Original 1967 Colgems vinyl issue===\n\n;Side 1\n{{Track listing\n| headline =\n| all_writing = \n| extra_column = Lead vocals\n\n| title1 =

At the start of the second verse, another drum track begins in the left channel and continues through the rest of the song.\n* Used in the episodes \"Monkees on the Wheel\" and \"Some Like It Lukewarm\"\n* The song was officially written by Bill Martin and Chip Douglas, though the latter denies any writing contribution.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, May 29 and August 23, 1967\n\n'''\"Love Is Only Sleeping\"'''\n* Written by [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]]\n* Lead vocal by Michael Nesmith\n* Harmony vocals: Micky Dolenz\n* Backing vocals: Davy Jones\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Acoustic guitar: Chip Douglas\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* Percussion: Davy Jones\n* Sound Effects: Bill Chadwick\n* Unknown: Bill Martin, Harry Nilsson\n* Not originally intended to be included on ''Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.'' as the song was to be issued as a single instead\n* After a manufacturing error caused some delays, Colgems rethought the strategy and released the more commercial \"Daydream Believer\" as the single instead, with \"Goin' Down\" as its B-side\n* The song was featured on three episodes of the TV show\u2014\"Everywhere a Sheik, Sheik\", \"I Was A 99-pound Weakling\", and \"The Monkees In Paris.\" The Paris episode features the song's released mix while the first two episodes feature a more stripped-down version derived from the song's original four-track mix before it was transferred to eight-track magnetic tape for additional mixing.This song was the first song by Nesmith after his surgery in 1967.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 19 and August 1967\n\n'''\"Cuddly Toy\"'''\n* Written by [[Harry Nilsson]]\n* Lead vocal by Davy Jones\n* Harmony vocals: Micky Dolenz\n* Backing vocals: Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork \n* Acoustic & electric guitars: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Micky Dolenz\n* Tambourine: Davy Jones\n* Piano: Peter Tork\n* Electric Piano: Peter Tork\n* Cello: Edgar Lustgarten\n* Wind: Ted Nash, Tom Scott, Bud Shank\n* This song and \"The Door Into Summer\" are the only songs featuring Micky behind the drums on the album\n* Demo was under the name \"By Any Boy\"\n* Selected by the band after Nilsson auditioned several songs for the group\n* Some have interpreted the lyrics as being about a [[gang bang]]. In the liner notes to the CD's 1995 release it is stated that producer [[Lester Sill]] was angered to discover this.\n* Used in the episodes \"Everywhere a Sheik, Sheik\", and \"Monkees on the Wheel\"\n* The mix presented here does not have a fade, while appearances on compilation albums do.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, April 26, 1967\n\n'''\"Words\"'''\n* Written by Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart\n* Lead vocals by Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork\n* Backing vocals: Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Percussion: Michael Nesmith\n* Chimes: Davy Jones\n* Tree: Davy Jones\n* Hammond B-3 Organ: Peter Tork\n* Originally recorded for ''[[More of The Monkees]]'' in August 1966, but re-recorded for this album under the group's direction\n* In the music video, Tork plays the guitar, Nesmith plays the bass, Jones plays the drums and Dolenz sings and plays the tambourine. The band said that this lineup is what The Monkees should have been, as these instrument choices best represented the individual members' strengths (Nesmith believed Tork was a better guitarist than he, while Nesmith himself was particularly accomplished as a bass guitarist.  Jones was the only member of The Monkees who already knew how to play the drums). But, Nesmith played the guitar and Tork played the bass and organ, Jones played the chimes and \"Fast\" Eddie Hoh played the drums.\n* Reached number 11 on the pop charts\n* This version used in summer 1967 rebroadcast of the episodes \"Monkees in a Ghost Town\" and \"Monkees Chow Mein\"; then used in the second season episodes \"Monkees in Texas\" and \"Monkees' Paw\" while the original version was used in the episode \"Monkees in Manhattan\"\n* The single mix is not the album mix. Dolenz says \"ah\" twice on the single mix.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studio A, Hollywood, June 14, 1967\n\n'''\"Hard To Believe\"'''\n* Written by David Jones, Kim Capli, Eddie Brick and Charlie Rockett\n* Lead vocal by Davy Jones\n* Guitar: Kim Capli\n* Bass: Kim Capli\n* Drums: Kim Capli\n* Percussion: Kim Capli\n* Piano: Kim Capli\n* Violin: Leonard Atkins, Arnold Belnick, Nathan Kaproff, Wilbert Nuttycombe, Jerome Reisler, Darrel Terwilliger\n* Flugelhorn: Oliver Mitchell, [[Tony Terran|Anthony Terran]]\n* French horn: Vincent DeRosa\n* Baritone saxophone: [[Jim Horn]]\n* Bass trombone: Robert Knight\n* Shaker: Kim Capli\n* Claves: Kim Capli\n* Cowbell: Kim Capli\n* Orchestrator: [[George Tipton]]\n* Arrangement: Roger Farris\n* This was the last new composition to be recorded that would make the album. It is also the only track apart from \"Peter Percival Patterson's Pet Pig Porky\" to feature a single Monkee, and the only track that only features session musicians on instruments.\n* This the only song from the original album not to be used on the TV show.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, August 23, 1967\n\n'''\"What Am I Doing Hangin' 'Round?\"'''\n* Written under the pseudonyms Travis Lewis and Boomer Clark, but actually the work of [[Michael Martin Murphey]] and Owens Castleman\n* Lead vocal by Michael Nesmith\n* Backing vocals: Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Electric banjo: Douglas Dillard\n* Chosen by Nesmith for the country feel it gave off; Murphy was an old friend of Nesmith\n* The released mix features group vocals, but an early mix featured only a double-tracked vocal by Nesmith.\n* Used in the episodes \"It's a Nice Place To Visit...\", \"Monkees Marooned\", and \"The Monkees Race Again\". The mix included in \"Monkees Marooned\" had a slightly longer run time, owing to the song's chorus being repeated four times after the last verse, instead of three times.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 20, 1967\n\n'''\"Peter Percival Patterson's Pet Pig Porky\"'''\n* Written by Peter Tork\n* Spoken words by Peter Tork\n* Taught to Peter by Judy Mayhan, whom he was managing at the time.\n* Peter admits that it was public domain, but when Screen Gems asked who wrote it he gave his name (which he could do, as 'arranger' of the piece)\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 10, 1967\n\n'''\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\"'''\n* Written by [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]]\n* Lead vocal by Micky Dolenz\n* Backing vocals: Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Acoustic guitar: Bill Chadwick\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Percussion: Davy Jones\n* Electric piano: Peter Tork\n* Released as a single before the album on July 10, 1967\n* Reached number 3 on the pop charts\n* Micky Dolenz was the only member of The Monkees to not contribute to this track instrumentally\n* The stereo album mix differs from the mix released as a single, also heard on the mono album. The stereo and mono mixes feature slightly different vocals by Micky on the opening verse (particularly obvious in the phrase \"just came out to mow his lawn\"\u2014in mono, the word \"out\" is heavily enunciated, while in stereo, it sounds more natural). Additionally, there are group backing vocals in stereo after Micky sings \"hard for me to see\" in the bridge; these are absent in the mono mix. The distortion occurring on the fade of the stereo mix also happens much more gradually than in mono.\n* The fade on both released mixes is deliberately drowned in reverb and noise, but a karaoke mix released in 2004 features a conventional fade.\n* First used in summer 1967 rebroadcast of the episodes \"Case Of The Missing Monkee\" and \"Captain Crocodile,\" then in the second season episodes \"The Picture Frame\" and \"Monkee Mayor.\"\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 10 and 11, 1967 after their [[Hollywood Bowl]] performance.\n\n'''\"[[Daily Nightly]]\"'''\n* Written by Michael Nesmith\n* Lead vocal by Micky Dolenz\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Moog synthesizer: Micky Dolenz\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* Percussion: Davy Jones\n* Nesmith's inspiration for this song stemmed from the infamous [[Sunset Strip]] riots and the misinformation that the media reported about the event; the event was first discussed by the boys in the epilogue interview segment of the episode \"Find The Monkees.\"\n* The mono and stereo mixes have slightly different Moog parts.\n* Used in the episodes \"Fairy Tale\" and \"The Monkees Blow Their Minds\"\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 19 and August 1967\n\n'''\"Don't Call on Me\"'''\n* Written by Michael Nesmith and [[John London]]\n* Lead vocal by Michael Nesmith\n* Spoken words: Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Acoustic guitar: Chip Douglas\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Claves: Eddie Hoh\n* Piano: Robert Rafelson\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* A reworked version of a pre-Monkees Nesmith song\n* Recorded during two Hollywood sessions, not from \"the elegant [[The Pump Room, Chicago|Pump Room]] of the magnificent [[Palmer House]], high over Chicago\", which could not be possible anyway. The Pump Room Restaurant and Palmer House Hotel are two separate businesses located in two different areas of Chicago. The song begins with the sounds of a live audience in a lounge with dialogue between the boys, working into a jazzy, slow tune.\n* Show producer [[Robert Rafelson]] played piano heard in the song's intro.\n* Used in the episode \"The Monkees in Paris\"\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 20 and October 9, 1967, and RCA Victor Nashville Sound Studio, Nashville, August 1967\n\n'''\"[[Star Collector]]\"'''\n* Written by [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]]\n* Lead vocal by Davy Jones\n* Harmony vocals: Micky Dolenz\n* Backing vocals: Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith (singing through the Moog synthesizer)\n* Spoken words: Micky Dolenz\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Chip Douglas\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Organ: Peter Tork\n* Moog synthesizer: [[Paul Beaver]]\n* Moog used on the album for a second time, this time played by Paul Beaver\n* Song was about the growing phenomenon of [[groupie]]s\n* An alternate mix without Paul Beaver's Moog riffing was used on the TV show in the biker-themed episode \"The Wild Monkees.\" A different version of this Moog-less mix is featured on [[Rhino Records]]' 2007 two-disc re-release of the album.\n* Used in the episodes \"The Wild Monkees\", \"Hitting the High Seas\", \"Monkees Watch Their Feet\", \"The Monkees in Paris\", and \"Monkees Mind Their Manor\".\n* The song features Micky Dolenz singing \"bye bye\" during the moog riff after the final verse, and again during the end.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 22, 1967 and American Recorder, Studio City, October 4, 1967\n\n===1995 bonus tracks===\n\n'''\"Special Announcement\"'''\n* Originally intended to be the kick-off to the album, it is a parody of the tape-alignment instructions for RCA studios.\n* Spoken words by Peter Tork\n* Sound effects: Steve Pitts, and Robert Rafelson\n* The track features a dog barking at the end\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, October 9, 1967\n\n'''\"Goin' Down\" (Extended Mono Mix)'''\n* Written by Diane Hilderbrand, Peter Tork, Michael Nesmith, Micky Dolenz and David Jones\n* Lead vocal by Micky Dolenz\n* Electric guitar: Michael Nesmith\n* Bass: Peter Tork\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh\n* Percussion: Davy Jones\n* Trumpet: Bud Brisbois, Virgil Evans, Uan Rasey, Thomas Scott \n* Trombone: Louis Blackburn, Richard Leith, Richard Nash, Philip Teelee \n* Saxophone: William Collette, William Hood, [[Plas Johnson]], John Lowe \n* Arrangement: Shorty Rogers\n* B-side of \"Daydream Believer\"\n* Intended to be on the album, but cut after including \"Love Is Only Sleeping\" on the album\n* Inspired by [[Mose Allison]] and his song \"[[Parchman Farm (song)|Parchman Farm]].\" It began as a free-form jam and then Michael decided it should be recorded as an original track.\n* The mix presented here does not have a genuine fade-out, while appearances on compilations, and the '07 release do.\n* The mix presented here is in mono, the jazzy riff is more restrained and muffled, the background hiss is more restrained, the trumpet wailing is less restrained, and a dialog is included at the end.\n* The tempo in this mix is a couple of seconds faster than in the single.\n* Used in the series episodes \"The Wild Monkees\" \"A Coffin Too Frequent\" \"The Monkees in Texas\" \"The Monstrous Monkee Mash\" \"The Monkees Paw\" and \"The Monkees in Paris\". \"The Wild Monkees\" and \"The Monkees in Texas\" feature Micky singing live over the instrumental, while \"The Monkees Paw\" uses clips of just the instrumental track.\"\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 20, July 5 and September 15, 1967\n\n'''Salesman (Alternate Mono Mix)'''\n* Spoken words: Michael Nesmith\n* Features Nesmith during the fade explaining how to make a joint using a cigarette rolling machine.\n\n'''\"The Door Into Summer\" (Alternate Mono Mix)'''\n* Features a different background vocal arrangement with a more prominent vocal by Micky, and an altered lead vocal by Mike. The drumming is also more restrained in this mix.\n\n'''\"Love Is Only Sleeping\" (Early Mix)'''\n* This is the original four-track mix before the song was transferred to eight-track tape for further overdubs; the four-track mix lacks the released mix's extensive echo effects and also features alternate organ parts, particularly on the ending.\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 19, 1967\n\n'''\"Daily Nightly\" (Early Mix)'''\n* Lacks Dolenz's synthesizer part\n* Recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Hollywood, June 19, 1967\n\n'''\"Star Collector\" (Extended Mix)'''\n* Features a longer Moog solo and an altered beginning and ending.\n* Is featured on [[Rhino Records]]' 2007 re-release of the album in both the longer Moog mix and also a Moog-less mix that features extensive backing vocals during the prolonged outro and fade.\n\n===Personnel===\n\n* Drums: Eddie Hoh, Micky Dolenz (on \"Cuddly Toy\" & \"The Door Into Summer\"), Kim Capli (on \"Hard to Believe\")\n* Guitars: Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, Chip Douglas, Kim Capli (on \"Hard to Believe\")\n* Piano: Peter Tork, Kim Capli (on \"Hard to Believe\")\n* Organ and Clavinet: Peter Tork\n* Bass: Chip Douglas, Peter Tork (on \"Goin' Down\" & \"Words\"), Kim Capli (on \"Hard to Believe\")\n* Percussion: Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith (on \"Words\"), Kim Capli (on \"Hard to Believe\")\n* Banjo: Douglas Dillard\n* Moog Synthesizer: Micky Dolenz (on \"Daily Nightly\"), Paul Beaver (on \"Star Collector\")\n* Vocals, Backing vocals: Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, Chip Douglas\n\n==Chart positions==\n===Album===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1967)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peak<br /> position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')<ref name=\"Canadian album positions\">{{cite web |url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=h6banu1fsvdt9pof8c4m7dun24&q1=village+people&q2=Top+Albums%2FCDs&interval=50 |title = RPM: The Monkees (albums) |publisher = RPM Magazine |accessdate = April 8, 2017 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171014084220/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=h6banu1fsvdt9pof8c4m7dun24&q1=village+people&q2=Top+Albums%2FCDs&interval=50 |archivedate = October 14, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|French Albums ([[French Albums Chart|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infodisc.fr/Album_Artiste_Choisi.php|title=Tous les Albums de l'Artiste choisi|publisher=InfoDisc|accessdate=April 8, 2017}}</ref> \n| 3\n|-\n{{albumchart|Germany|18|artist=The Monkees|album=Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 8, 2017}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums ([[Oricon Albums Chart|Oricon]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/170825/|title=Oricon Archive -

The [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian State]] definitely buys the abbey in 1881 and in 1920, the school is renamed into the State Agricultural Institute (''Institut agronomique de l'\u00c9tat''). The name is changed again in 1965 into the State University of Agricultural Sciences (''Facult\u00e9 universitaire des sciences agronomiques de l\u2019\u00c9tat'') and again in 1994 into the Gembloux University of Agricultural Sciences (''Facult\u00e9 universitaire des sciences agronomiques de Gembloux'') after its administration was transferred from the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Federal State]] to the [[French Community of Belgium]].\n\nIn 2009, it was merged with the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]] and renamed to '''Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech''' (GxABT).

After the [[French Revolution]], monks were expelled, and the abbey was sold. In July 1860, the agronomic school of [[Thourout]] is transferred in [[Gembloux]], founding the Gembloux Agricultural Institute. The [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian State]] definitely buys the abbey in 1881 and in 1920, the school is renamed into the State Agricultural Institute (''Institut agronomique de l'\u00c9tat''). The name is changed again in 1965 into the State University of Agricultural Sciences (''Facult\u00e9 universitaire des sciences agronomiques de l\u2019\u00c9tat'') and again in 1994 into the Gembloux University of Agricultural Sciences (''Facult\u00e9 universitaire des sciences agronomiques de Gembloux'') after its administration was transferred from the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Federal State]] to the [[French Community of Belgium]].\n\nIn 2009, it was merged with the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]] and renamed to '''Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech''' (GxABT). Its official language has always been [[French (language)|French]].\n\n==Studies==\nAt the cutting edge of sustainable development and eco-innovation, the Faculty of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech is dedicated exclusively to agronomic sciences and biological [[engineering]]. The five-year program on offer at the Faculty trains bioengineers in the making.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ulg.ac.be/cms/c_281060/en/gembloux-agro-bio-tech|title=Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech|website=www.ulg.ac.be|access-date=2015-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908064653/http://www.ulg.ac.be/cms/c_281060/en/gembloux-agro-bio-tech|archive-date=2015-09-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Students can choose a specialization from among four different courses of study in the field of life sciences: \n*Environmental science and technology\n*Forest and natural space management \n*Agronomic science\n*Chemistry and bioindustries\n\nGembloux Agro Bio Tech also organizes the first year of the bachelor's program in [[Landscape architecture]], in partnership with the [[Haute \u00c9cole Charlemagne]] and the Institute of Architecture of [[La Cambre]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Crealys Science Park]]\n* [[Science and technology in Wallonia]]\n* [[Science Parks of Wallonia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commonscatinline}}\n\n* [http://www.fsagx.ac.be/ Gembloux Agricultural University]\n\n{{Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles}}\n{{Belgian universities}}\n\n{{coord|50.5623|N|4.696|E|region:BE_type:edu|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Universities in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Forestry education]]\n[[Category:Forestry in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Gembloux]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gembloux_Agro-Bio_Tech"}
