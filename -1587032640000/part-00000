The name is derived from the former American [[Clark Air Base]] which was the largest overseas base of the [[United States Air Force]] until it was closed in 1991 and handed over to the [[Government of the Philippines]].\n\nThe airport is managed and operated by Luzon International Premiere Airport Development (LIPAD) Corporation, a consortium of [[JG Summit Holdings]], [[Filinvest Development Corporation]], Philippine Airport Ground Support Solutions Inc., and [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airports Philippines Pte.

A new passenger terminal building is under construction and is expected to be finished in 2020.\n\n==History==\n{{For|information on the history of Clark Airport prior to the explosion of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991 and the departure of U.S. forces from the [[Philippines]]|Clark Air Base}}\n[[File:Clark International Airport (CRK).svg|thumb|200px|right|The logo of Clark International Airport used until 2019]]\n\nThe United States Cavalry established Fort Stotsenberg in 1902 and later converted a portion of which into an air field, which was, in turn, renamed Clark Air Field in 1919\u2014in honor of aviator Major [[Harold M. Clark|Harold Melville Clark]]\u2014and was used as one of the most important overseas bases during the 2nd World War.\n\nIn 1947, the RP-US Military Bases Agreement was signed, integrating Clark Air Field and Fort Stotsenberg into Clark Air Base but, after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991 and the non-renewal of the military bases agreement, Clark Air Base was reverted to the Philippine Government.\n\nThe Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992 accelerated the conversion of Clark Air Base into a Special Economic Zone, and in 2007, the Philippine Congress enacted a law (RA 9400) which renamed the base to Clark Freeport Philippines. It is now segregated in two separate entities:  Clark Freeport Zone administered by the Clark Development Corporation, and the Clark Civil Aviation Complex administered by the Clark International Airport Corporation.\n\nIn 1993, the former Clark Air Base was reopened as the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) after the area was cleared from [[lahar]] debris from the [[Mount Pinatubo]] explosion and a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] that followed. During the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]], it was designated to be the future primary international gateway of the Philippines and the major international airport of [[Metro Manila]] and its neighboring provinces when [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Metro Manila]] has reached full capacity and can no longer be expanded.\n\nCIAC traces its origin from Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992\", which authorized the conversion of several military reservations, including the former Clark Air Base, into sustainable economic zones. Jurisdiction over the corporation shifted from the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) since its formal incorporation with the SEC in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] renamed Clark International Airport as the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA), in memory of her father, former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], and ordered the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) in February 2007 to fund the US$1.7 billion (PH\u20b176.5 billion) expansion of DMIA and the approval of a US$2 million (PH\u20b190 million) study plan financed by the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The first stage of Clark Airport's expansion program, a PH\u20b1130 million terminal expansion, was completed in January 2008 to accommodate more than 2 million passengers annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.$2m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928144135/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.%242m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|url-status=dead|title=Sunstar.com|archivedate=28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, CIAC was transferred from the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] and became an attached agency of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President [[Benigno Aquino III]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2011/12/21/executive-order-no-64-s-2011/|title=Executive Order No. 64, s. 2011|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's name reverted to Clark International Airport in February 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/28/12/clark-airport-name-change-plan-sparks-debate |title=Clark airport name-change plan sparks debate |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=28 February 2012}}</ref> but the passenger terminal continued to bear Diosdado Macapagal's name.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] issued Executive Order No. 14, reverting CIAC as a subsidiary of the BCDA, but with the Department of Transportation maintaining supervision and operational control of the airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2017/02feb/20170228-EO-14-RRD.pdf|title=Executive Order No. 14, s. 2017|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the airport was temporarily closed as all flights to and from Clark are canceled due to a [[2019 Luzon earthquake|magnitude 6.1 earthquake]] occurred, originating in [[Zambales]].

The expansion boosted Clark's capacity to 2.5 million annually.\n\nIn 2013, Phase II expansion which costs $9.6 million (PH\u20b1417 million) increased the capacity of the passenger terminal from 2.5 million to 4.2 million passengers per annum. The expansion increased the size of the passenger terminal building from 11,439m\u00b2 to 19,799m\u00b2. It added 21 new check-in counters, increasing the total number of counters from 13 to 34. Five arrival counters and 12 departures counters were also constructed. The expanded terminal currently has eight entry points and three customs stations.

A new passenger terminal building is under construction and is expected to be finished in 2020.\n\n==History==\n{{For|information on the history of Clark Airport prior to the explosion of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991 and the departure of U.S. forces from the [[Philippines]]|Clark Air Base}}\n[[File:Clark International Airport (CRK).svg|thumb|200px|right|The logo of Clark International Airport used until 2019]]\n\nThe United States Cavalry established Fort Stotsenberg in 1902 and later converted a portion of which into an air field, which was, in turn, renamed Clark Air Field in 1919\u2014in honor of aviator Major [[Harold M. Clark|Harold Melville Clark]]\u2014and was used as one of the most important overseas bases during the 2nd World War.\n\nIn 1947, the RP-US Military Bases Agreement was signed, integrating Clark Air Field and Fort Stotsenberg into Clark Air Base but, after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991 and the non-renewal of the military bases agreement, Clark Air Base was reverted to the Philippine Government.\n\nThe Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992 accelerated the conversion of Clark Air Base into a Special Economic Zone, and in 2007, the Philippine Congress enacted a law (RA 9400) which renamed the base to Clark Freeport Philippines. It is now segregated in two separate entities:  Clark Freeport Zone administered by the Clark Development Corporation, and the Clark Civil Aviation Complex administered by the Clark International Airport Corporation.\n\nIn 1993, the former Clark Air Base was reopened as the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) after the area was cleared from [[lahar]] debris from the [[Mount Pinatubo]] explosion and a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] that followed. During the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]], it was designated to be the future primary international gateway of the Philippines and the major international airport of [[Metro Manila]] and its neighboring provinces when [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Metro Manila]] has reached full capacity and can no longer be expanded.\n\nCIAC traces its origin from Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992\", which authorized the conversion of several military reservations, including the former Clark Air Base, into sustainable economic zones. Jurisdiction over the corporation shifted from the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) since its formal incorporation with the SEC in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] renamed Clark International Airport as the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA), in memory of her father, former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], and ordered the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) in February 2007 to fund the US$1.7 billion (PH\u20b176.5 billion) expansion of DMIA and the approval of a US$2 million (PH\u20b190 million) study plan financed by the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The first stage of Clark Airport's expansion program, a PH\u20b1130 million terminal expansion, was completed in January 2008 to accommodate more than 2 million passengers annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.$2m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928144135/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.%242m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|url-status=dead|title=Sunstar.com|archivedate=28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, CIAC was transferred from the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] and became an attached agency of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President [[Benigno Aquino III]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2011/12/21/executive-order-no-64-s-2011/|title=Executive Order No. 64, s. 2011|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's name reverted to Clark International Airport in February 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/28/12/clark-airport-name-change-plan-sparks-debate |title=Clark airport name-change plan sparks debate |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=28 February 2012}}</ref> but the passenger terminal continued to bear Diosdado Macapagal's name.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] issued Executive Order No. 14, reverting CIAC as a subsidiary of the BCDA, but with the Department of Transportation maintaining supervision and operational control of the airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2017/02feb/20170228-EO-14-RRD.pdf|title=Executive Order No. 14, s. 2017|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the airport was temporarily closed as all flights to and from Clark are canceled due to a [[2019 Luzon earthquake|magnitude 6.1 earthquake]] occurred, originating in [[Zambales]].

The expansion boosted Clark's capacity to 2.5 million annually.\n\nIn 2013, Phase II expansion which costs $9.6 million (PH\u20b1417 million) increased the capacity of the passenger terminal from 2.5 million to 4.2 million passengers per annum. The expansion increased the size of the passenger terminal building from 11,439m\u00b2 to 19,799m\u00b2. It added 21 new check-in counters, increasing the total number of counters from 13 to 34. Five arrival counters and 12 departures counters were also constructed. The expanded terminal currently has eight entry points and three customs stations.

Uncertainty exists about which ''Ganoderma'' species was most widely utilized as Lingzhi mushroom in ancient times, and likely a few different common species were considered interchangeable.  However, in the most famous book of herbal medicine in China, the ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (1578), a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined by color. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient Lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dai |first1=Y.-C. |title=Ganoderma lingzhi (Polyporales, Basidiomycota): the scientific binomial for the widely cultivated medicinal fungus Lingzhi |journal=Mycological Progress |date=2017 |volume=16 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=1051\u20131055|doi=10.1007/s11557-017-1347-4 }}</ref>, as well as other researchers and based on molecular work, red reishi is most likely to be ''Ganoderma lingzhi'' (Sheng H. Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai, 2012). This is the species that is most widely found in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other ''Ganoderma'' species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives which vary widely among species. Lingzhi was formerly known as ''Ganoderma lucidum'' (Curtis) P. Karst. (1881), first described by Curtis. ''G. lucidum'' is part of a [[species complex]] that encompasses several varieties and forms (Species Fungorum). Research on the genus is on-going, but a number of recent phylogentic analyses have been published in the last number of years.\n<ref name=\"Zhou 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Li-Wei |last2=Cao |first2=Yun |last3=Wu |first3=Sheng-Hua |last4=Vlas\u00e1k |first4=Josef |last5=Li |first5=De-Wei |last6=Li |first6=Meng-Jie |last7=Dai |first7=Yu-Cheng |title=Global diversity of the ''Ganoderma lucidum'' complex (Ganodermataceae, Polyporales) inferred from morphology and multilocus phylogeny |journal=Phytochemistry |year=2015 |volume=114 |pages=7\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.023 |pmid=25453909}}</ref>\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\n[[Petter Adolf Karsten]] named the genus ''Ganoderma'' in 1881.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Karsten |first=PA. |title=Enumeratio Boletinearum et Polyporearum Fennicarum, systemate novo dispositarum |journal=Revue Mycologique, Toulouse |year=1881 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=16\u201319 |language=la}}</ref> English botanist [[William Curtis]] gave the fungus its first binomial name, ''Boletus lucidus'', in 1781.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Steyaert |first=R.

For example, elevated [[carbon dioxide]] levels result in stem [[wiktionary:elongation|elongation]] in lingzhi.

Uncertainty exists about which ''Ganoderma'' species was most widely utilized as Lingzhi mushroom in ancient times, and likely a few different common species were considered interchangeable.  However, in the most famous book of herbal medicine in China, the ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (1578), a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined by color. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient Lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al.

Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai, 2012). This is the species that is most widely found in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other ''Ganoderma'' species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives which vary widely among species. Lingzhi was formerly known as ''Ganoderma lucidum'' (Curtis) P. Karst. (1881), first described by Curtis. ''G. lucidum'' is part of a [[species complex]] that encompasses several varieties and forms (Species Fungorum). Research on the genus is on-going, but a number of recent phylogentic analyses have been published in the last number of years.\n<ref name=\"Zhou 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Li-Wei |last2=Cao |first2=Yun |last3=Wu |first3=Sheng-Hua |last4=Vlas\u00e1k |first4=Josef |last5=Li |first5=De-Wei |last6=Li |first6=Meng-Jie |last7=Dai |first7=Yu-Cheng |title=Global diversity of the ''Ganoderma lucidum'' complex (Ganodermataceae, Polyporales) inferred from morphology and multilocus phylogeny |journal=Phytochemistry |year=2015 |volume=114 |pages=7\u201315 |doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.023 |pmid=25453909}}</ref>\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\n[[Petter Adolf Karsten]] named the genus ''Ganoderma'' in 1881.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Karsten |first=PA. |title=Enumeratio Boletinearum et Polyporearum Fennicarum, systemate novo dispositarum |journal=Revue Mycologique, Toulouse |year=1881 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=16\u201319 |language=la}}</ref> English botanist [[William Curtis]] gave the fungus its first binomial name, ''Boletus lucidus'', in 1781.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Steyaert |first=R.

Although predominantly a [[midfielder]] he showed an aptitude at right back and understudied to then Spurs right back [[Stephen Carr]], and was viewed by many as the Irish international's natural successor. He really emerged onto the scene in a mid season friendly against Irish champions [[Bohemians F.C.|Bohemians]] putting in a man of the match performance from right back. Unable to get his start as a young player in the Tottenham team, he was loaned out early on in his career to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].\n\nHis initial first team action for Spurs came in August 2003, against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. By January 2004 he had joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on loan, as by that time Spurs had strengthened their strike force. Upon his return he was handed his debut start, but that would be his only appearance until November 2004, when he joined [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on loan.\n\nWhen he returned to Tottenham, he was immediately thrown in at the deep end, as a last minute choice to face an [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] team on 1 January 2005, in which he scored the first and last goals of the match in a 5\u20132 victory, the second being a superb 25-yard curler into the top right corner.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4114675.stm\n|title=Tottenham 5\u20132 Everton\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=1 January 2005\n|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe struggled with form until February 2005, the month in which he participated in his only international, an [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] match versus the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].\nAfter considerable squad strengthening in the early part of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306]] season, which included the signings of [[Edgar Davids]] and [[Jermaine Jenas]], he found himself out of action, and moved for a season-long loan to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the hope of winning them promotion back to the [[Premier League]]. However his time at Norwich City was cut short due to injury and he returned to Tottenham on 31 October 2005.\n\n===Hull City===\n[[Phil Parkinson]] made Marney his second signing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 14 July 2006 for an undisclosed fee.\n\n===Burnley===\nBurnley manager [[Brian Laws]] made Marney his first summer signing on 28 May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/8711194.stm|title=Burnley swoop for Hull City midfielder Dean Marney|date=28 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> Marney scored his first goal for Burnley in a 3\u20133 draw with [[Sheffield United]] on 16 October 2010.\n\nMarney struggled to establish himself in the Burnley team in his first season at the club, having spells in and out of the side. For the opening few games of his second season, Marney found himself out of favour and used predominantly as a substitute. However, a string of impressive performances from the midfielder saw him given an extended run in the side and Marney finished the season as one of the Claret\u2019s most impressive performers. The 2012\u201313 season is considered by many to be the best of Marney's career, being an almost ever-present in the Clarets side missing matches only through suspension and injury. Marney helped Burnley stave off relegation and eventually finish 11th in the [[Championship]] .\n\nMarney began the 2013\u201314 season in a similar vein, performing very well during pre-season and the opening matches of the [[Football League Championship]], where he formed an effective partnership with former [[Wolves F.C.|Wolves]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] midfielder, [[David Jones (footballer born 1984)|David Jones]], who signed for the Clarets in the summer. Over his first three seasons with Burnley, he appeared in approximately 75% of their league games and, with his contract about to expire in 2013, signed a new two-year deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22366489|title=Burnley: Dean Marney agrees new two-year contract at Turf Moor|date=1 May 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref> At the end of the [[2017\u201318 Burnley F.C. season|2017\u201318]] season, he was released by Burnley after eight years at the club and having made over 220 appearances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11347471/scott-arfield-and-dean-marney-to-leave-burnley-at-end-of-the-season|title=Scott Arfield and Dean Marney to leave Burnley at end of the season|date=26 April 2018|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fleetwood Town===\n\nIn July 2018, Marney joined [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45011513 Dean Marney: Fleetwood sign former Burnley midfielder on two-year deal - BBC Sport<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> taking the squad number 25.<ref>[https://www.fleetwoodtownfc.com/news/2018/july/town-secure-capture-of-experienced-midfielder-dean-marney/ Town secure capture of experienced midfielder Dean Marney - News - Fleetwood Town<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==International career==\nMarney represented England at international gaining one cap for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] side in England's 2\u20131 defeat to [[Netherlands U-21 national football team|Netherlands U-21]] in February 2005. He has not appeared for England since then.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Style of play==\nMarney is a free-flowing midfielder and has proven to be a key factor in distribution throughout the teams he has played for.  While at Burnley, he developed a reputation as something of a 'hard man', picking up 12 yellow cards and 1 red card in the [[2012\u201313 Burnley F.C. season|2012\u201313 season]], a figure higher than all of his team-mates and the second highest in the Championship. He is confident in challenging for the ball but shows good control of his aggression.\n\n==Career statistics==\n{{updated|match played 5 January 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

Although predominantly a [[midfielder]] he showed an aptitude at right back and understudied to then Spurs right back [[Stephen Carr]], and was viewed by many as the Irish international's natural successor. He really emerged onto the scene in a mid season friendly against Irish champions [[Bohemians F.C.|Bohemians]] putting in a man of the match performance from right back. Unable to get his start as a young player in the Tottenham team, he was loaned out early on in his career to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].\n\nHis initial first team action for Spurs came in August 2003, against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. By January 2004 he had joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on loan, as by that time Spurs had strengthened their strike force. Upon his return he was handed his debut start, but that would be his only appearance until November 2004, when he joined [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on loan.\n\nWhen he returned to Tottenham, he was immediately thrown in at the deep end, as a last minute choice to face an [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] team on 1 January 2005, in which he scored the first and last goals of the match in a 5\u20132 victory, the second being a superb 25-yard curler into the top right corner.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4114675.stm\n|title=Tottenham 5\u20132 Everton\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=1 January 2005\n|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nHe struggled with form until February 2005, the month in which he participated in his only international, an [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] match versus the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].\nAfter considerable squad strengthening in the early part of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005\u201306]] season, which included the signings of [[Edgar Davids]] and [[Jermaine Jenas]], he found himself out of action, and moved for a season-long loan to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the hope of winning them promotion back to the [[Premier League]]. However his time at Norwich City was cut short due to injury and he returned to Tottenham on 31 October 2005.\n\n===Hull City===\n[[Phil Parkinson]] made Marney his second signing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 14 July 2006 for an undisclosed fee.\n\n===Burnley===\nBurnley manager [[Brian Laws]] made Marney his first summer signing on 28 May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/8711194.stm|title=Burnley swoop for Hull City midfielder Dean Marney|date=28 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> Marney scored his first goal for Burnley in a 3\u20133 draw with [[Sheffield United]] on 16 October 2010.\n\nMarney struggled to establish himself in the Burnley team in his first season at the club, having spells in and out of the side. For the opening few games of his second season, Marney found himself out of favour and used predominantly as a substitute. However, a string of impressive performances from the midfielder saw him given an extended run in the side and Marney finished the season as one of the Claret\u2019s most impressive performers. The 2012\u201313 season is considered by many to be the best of Marney's career, being an almost ever-present in the Clarets side missing matches only through suspension and injury. Marney helped Burnley stave off relegation and eventually finish 11th in the [[Championship]] .\n\nMarney began the 2013\u201314 season in a similar vein, performing very well during pre-season and the opening matches of the [[Football League Championship]], where he formed an effective partnership with former [[Wolves F.C.|Wolves]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] midfielder, [[David Jones (footballer born 1984)|David Jones]], who signed for the Clarets in the summer. Over his first three seasons with Burnley, he appeared in approximately 75% of their league games and, with his contract about to expire in 2013, signed a new two-year deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22366489|title=Burnley: Dean Marney agrees new two-year contract at Turf Moor|date=1 May 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 March 2018}}</ref> At the end of the [[2017\u201318 Burnley F.C. season|2017\u201318]] season, he was released by Burnley after eight years at the club and having made over 220 appearances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11347471/scott-arfield-and-dean-marney-to-leave-burnley-at-end-of-the-season|title=Scott Arfield and Dean Marney to leave Burnley at end of the season|date=26 April 2018|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fleetwood Town===\n\nIn July 2018, Marney joined [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45011513 Dean Marney: Fleetwood sign former Burnley midfielder on two-year deal - BBC Sport<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> taking the squad number 25.<ref>[https://www.fleetwoodtownfc.com/news/2018/july/town-secure-capture-of-experienced-midfielder-dean-marney/ Town secure capture of experienced midfielder Dean Marney - News - Fleetwood Town<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==International career==\nMarney represented England at international gaining one cap for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] side in England's 2\u20131 defeat to [[Netherlands U-21 national football team|Netherlands U-21]] in February 2005. He has not appeared for England since then.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Style of play==\nMarney is a free-flowing midfielder and has proven to be a key factor in distribution throughout the teams he has played for.  While at Burnley, he developed a reputation as something of a 'hard man', picking up 12 yellow cards and 1 red card in the [[2012\u201313 Burnley F.C. season|2012\u201313 season]], a figure higher than all of his team-mates and the second highest in the Championship. He is confident in challenging for the ball but shows good control of his aggression.\n\n==Career statistics==\n{{updated|match played 5 January 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:
