During this period he worked in [[Andy Warhol]]'s factory, primarily in the silkscreen production studio applying diamond dust to Warhol's ''Myths'' series. He moved briefly to [[Los Angeles]] and had his first solo exhibition there in 1983 at Ulrike Kantor Gallery. After returning to New York later that year he made his first trip to Europe. Condo moved to [[Cologne]], Germany, where he met and worked with several artists from the Mulheimer Freiheit group, including Walter Dahn and [[Jiri Georg Dokoupil]]. His first solo exhibition in Europe was in 1984 at [[Monika Spr\u00fcth]] Gallery.\n\nWhile still in Europe Condo met and began working with American art dealer [[Barbara Gladstone]], and in 1984 he had a simultaneous two-gallery exhibition in New York at Pat Hearn and Barbara Gladstone Galleries.

In Paris, Haring introduced Condo to the American writer and artist [[Brion Gysin]], who in turn later introduced him to [[William S. Burroughs]]. Condo and Burroughs collaborated on numerous paintings and sculptures between 1988 and 1996. Selected works from their collaborations were exhibited in 1997 at Pat Hearn Gallery, New York.<ref>http://www.octobergallery.co.uk/artists/burroughs/index.shtml</ref> Condo and Burroughs also worked together on a collection of writings and etchings titled ''Ghost of Chance'', which was published by the [[Whitney Museum]] in 1991.\n\nWhile in Paris, Condo also met and befriended philosopher and semiotician [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]], best known for his collaborations with [[Gilles Deleuze]], when Condo was working in a studio in the apartment building where Guattari resided. Guattari wrote extensively on Condo's work, including an introductory text and interview in the exhibition catalogue for Condo's 1990 solo exhibition at Galerie [[Daniel Templon]]. Of Condo's paintings Guattari wrote:\n\n\"There is then a very specific 'Condo effect' which separates you from all the painters you seem to reinterpret. You sacrifice everything to this effect, particularly pictorial structure, which you systematically destroy, thus removing a protective guardrail, a frame of reference which might reassure the viewer, who is denied access to a stable set of meanings.\" (Felix Guattari, 1990)\n\nThroughout his career as an artist, Condo's work has served as an influence and inspiration to contemporary writers including Burroughs, Guattari, Demosthenes Davvetas, [[Donald Kuspit]], Wilfried Dickhoff, and [[Salman Rushdie]], whose 2001 novel ''[[Fury (Rushdie novel)|Fury]]'' includes a chapter inspired by Condo's 1994 oil painting ''The Psychoanalytic Puppeteer Losing His Mind''.<ref>[[Fury (Rushdie novel)|Fury (novel)]]</ref> American fiction writer [[David Means]] also used a Condo painting, ''The Fallen Butler'' (2010), as inspiration for his short story \"The Butler's Lament\", which appears in the catalogue for the exhibition ''Mental States'', a mid-career survey of the artist's paintings and sculptures organized by the [[Hayward Gallery]], London, and the [[New Museum]], New York, in 2011. [[Allen Ginsberg]], a close friend and frequent visitor to Condo's Paris studio, where he photographed the artist on several occasions, asked Condo to paint his portrait for the cover of his ''Selected Poems: 1947-1995'', published in 1996 by [[HarperCollins]].<ref>http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=poetry-books</ref>\n\nCondo's paintings, like ''The Orgy'' (2004), ''Superman'' (2005), ''Batman and Bunny'' (2005), ''Maja Desnuda'' (2005), ''Dreams and Nightmares of the Queen'' (2006), and ''God'' (2007), place archetypal human figures in a world of humorous, grotesque painting style that the artist refers to as Psychological Cubism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holzwarth |first1=Hans W. |title=100 Contemporary Artists A-Z |date=2009 |publisher=Taschen |location=K\u00f6ln |isbn=978-3-8365-1490-3 |pages=108\u2013113 |edition=Taschen's 25th anniversary special}}</ref>\n\n==Commissions==\nIn addition to commissions for book covers, such as [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''Book of Sketches'' (Penguin Poets, 2006),<ref>[[Book of Sketches]]</ref> for which he also wrote the introduction, Condo has also created or designed album covers for numerous musicians.<ref>[[The Story of the Ghost]]</ref> Most notably, in 2010 Condo collaborated with rapper [[Kanye West]] and created a series of paintings for West's album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' and various singles.<ref name=rapfx>{{cite web |title=Kanye West beautiful dark twisted fantasy banned 10 albums covers |url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2010/10/18/kanye-west-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-banned-10-albums-covers/}}</ref> Kanye West used to use a Condo painting as his [[Twitter]] image, and Condo has painted a [[Herm\u00e8s]] [[Birkin Bag]] for West that West gave to [[Kim Kardashian]].<ref>[http://hyperallergic.com/100508/kanye-gives-kim-kardashian-a-george-condo-painted-hermes-birkin-bag/] Kanye Gives Kim Kardashian a George Condo-Painted Herm\u00e8s Birkin Bag</ref> Condo also produced four alternate copies of the album cover that, although not included on the actual cover of the record, came included with certain productions of the record on vinyl and as individual posters. All variations reflect themes found throughout the West album, and were all considered for the cover. The final design, depicting a demonic caricature of the artist with a female phoenix on his lap and bottle in his hand, was even censored by [[iTunes]], and the album cover is now a blurred version of the Condo painting.<ref>http://www.vulture.com/2010/11/kanye_george_condo.html</ref> Condo's work has also been featured on the covers of the [[Phish]] album ''[[The Story of the Ghost]]'' (Elektra, 1998), [[Danny Elfman]]'s ''[[Serenada Schizophrana]]'' (2006), and ''Franck Debussy Schumann'' by Dora Schwarzberg and [[Martha Argerich]] (AventiClassic, 2006), among others. Most recently, Condo painted and abstracted portrait of the opera countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo for the cover of his first album ARC, released in 2018 by DeccaGold and featuring recordings of works by Philip Glass and George Frideric Handel.

In 2009 the Musee Maillol, Paris, organized the exhibition ''George Condo: The Lost Civilization'' featuring paintings, drawings and sculpture created between 2003 and 2008. The monograph published by Gallimard in conjunction with the exhibition featured new writings on the artist's work by Didier Ottinger, Bertrand Lorquin, and Massimiliano Gioni, as well as a reprinting of Felix Guattari's original text from 1990.\n\nIn 2011, the [[New Museum]] in New York City opened a mid-career retrospective of Condo's work titled ''Mental States''.

You sacrifice everything to this effect, particularly pictorial structure, which you systematically destroy, thus removing a protective guardrail, a frame of reference which might reassure the viewer, who is denied access to a stable set of meanings.\" (Felix Guattari, 1990)\n\nThroughout his career as an artist, Condo's work has served as an influence and inspiration to contemporary writers including Burroughs, Guattari, Demosthenes Davvetas, [[Donald Kuspit]], Wilfried Dickhoff, and [[Salman Rushdie]], whose 2001 novel ''[[Fury (Rushdie novel)|Fury]]'' includes a chapter inspired by Condo's 1994 oil painting ''The Psychoanalytic Puppeteer Losing His Mind''.<ref>[[Fury (Rushdie novel)|Fury (novel)]]</ref> American fiction writer [[David Means]] also used a Condo painting, ''The Fallen Butler'' (2010), as inspiration for his short story \"The Butler's Lament\", which appears in the catalogue for the exhibition ''Mental States'', a mid-career survey of the artist's paintings and sculptures organized by the [[Hayward Gallery]], London, and the [[New Museum]], New York, in 2011. [[Allen Ginsberg]], a close friend and frequent visitor to Condo's Paris studio, where he photographed the artist on several occasions, asked Condo to paint his portrait for the cover of his ''Selected Poems: 1947-1995'', published in 1996 by [[HarperCollins]].<ref>http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=poetry-books</ref>\n\nCondo's paintings, like ''The Orgy'' (2004), ''Superman'' (2005), ''Batman and Bunny'' (2005), ''Maja Desnuda'' (2005), ''Dreams and Nightmares of the Queen'' (2006), and ''God'' (2007), place archetypal human figures in a world of humorous, grotesque painting style that the artist refers to as Psychological Cubism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holzwarth |first1=Hans W. |title=100 Contemporary Artists A-Z |date=2009 |publisher=Taschen |location=K\u00f6ln |isbn=978-3-8365-1490-3 |pages=108\u2013113 |edition=Taschen's 25th anniversary special}}</ref>\n\n==Commissions==\nIn addition to commissions for book covers, such as [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''Book of Sketches'' (Penguin Poets, 2006),<ref>[[Book of Sketches]]</ref> for which he also wrote the introduction, Condo has also created or designed album covers for numerous musicians.<ref>[[The Story of the Ghost]]</ref> Most notably, in 2010 Condo collaborated with rapper [[Kanye West]] and created a series of paintings for West's album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' and various singles.<ref name=rapfx>{{cite web |title=Kanye West beautiful dark twisted fantasy banned 10 albums covers |url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2010/10/18/kanye-west-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-banned-10-albums-covers/}}</ref> Kanye West used to use a Condo painting as his [[Twitter]] image, and Condo has painted a [[Herm\u00e8s]] [[Birkin Bag]] for West that West gave to [[Kim Kardashian]].<ref>[http://hyperallergic.com/100508/kanye-gives-kim-kardashian-a-george-condo-painted-hermes-birkin-bag/] Kanye Gives Kim Kardashian a George Condo-Painted Herm\u00e8s Birkin Bag</ref> Condo also produced four alternate copies of the album cover that, although not included on the actual cover of the record, came included with certain productions of the record on vinyl and as individual posters. All variations reflect themes found throughout the West album, and were all considered for the cover. The final design, depicting a demonic caricature of the artist with a female phoenix on his lap and bottle in his hand, was even censored by [[iTunes]], and the album cover is now a blurred version of the Condo painting.<ref>http://www.vulture.com/2010/11/kanye_george_condo.html</ref> Condo's work has also been featured on the covers of the [[Phish]] album ''[[The Story of the Ghost]]'' (Elektra, 1998), [[Danny Elfman]]'s ''[[Serenada Schizophrana]]'' (2006), and ''Franck Debussy Schumann'' by Dora Schwarzberg and [[Martha Argerich]] (AventiClassic, 2006), among others. Most recently, Condo painted and abstracted portrait of the opera countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo for the cover of his first album ARC, released in 2018 by DeccaGold and featuring recordings of works by Philip Glass and George Frideric Handel.  He also has done a t-shirt with Adam Kimmel for [[Barneys New York]].<ref>[http://www.highsnobiety.com/2010/09/16/adam-kimmel-x-george-condo-t-shirt-for-barneys-new-york/] Adam Kimmel x George Condo T-Shirt for Barneys New York</ref>\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nCondo has exhibited extensively in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

The exhibition was accompanied by a monograph featuring essays by Margrit Brehm, Stacey Schmidt, and Kellein. In 2009 the Musee Maillol, Paris, organized the exhibition ''George Condo: The Lost Civilization'' featuring paintings, drawings and sculpture created between 2003 and 2008. The monograph published by Gallimard in conjunction with the exhibition featured new writings on the artist's work by Didier Ottinger, Bertrand Lorquin, and Massimiliano Gioni, as well as a reprinting of Felix Guattari's original text from 1990.\n\nIn 2011, the [[New Museum]] in New York City opened a mid-career retrospective of Condo's work titled ''Mental States''. This watershed exhibition was critically acclaimed by [[Holland Cotter]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as \"sensational\". The show traveled to [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]], the [[Hayward Gallery]], and the [[Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt]].\n\nIn 2013, Condo's large black-and-white banner featuring a [[court jester]] was installed on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], advertising the Met's new production of [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]''.<ref>Carol Vogel (January 25, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/george-condo-on-view-in-and-outside-the-metropolitan-opera-house/ \"George Condo, On View In and Outside the Metropolitan Opera House\"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> In 2016 the [[Berggruen Museum]] in Berlin honored Condo with the exhibition ''George Condo.

The exhibition is a major survey of Condo's drawings and \"drawing paintings\" that will travel to the [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Humleb\u00e6k]], Denmark, in the fall of 2017.\n\n==Collections==\nCondo's work is in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Whitney Museum]], New York, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, the [[Albright-Knox Museum]] in Buffalo, New York, the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], Washington D.C., and the [[Eli Broad|Broad Foundation]], Los Angeles, among other American and European museums and public collections.\n\n==Recognition==\nIn 2000, Condo was the subject of the documentary film ''Condo Painting'', directed by [[John McNaughton]].<ref name=Chang2000>{{cite journal |title=Condo Painting |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/condo_painting/ |year=2000 |author=Chang, Chris |journal=Frieze Magazine |issue=52 |accessdate=2012-01-31 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806062229/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/condo_painting/ |archivedate=2011-08-06 }}</ref> The film, which follows the progress of Condo's large-scale oil painting ''Big Red'' over the course of one year, features an appearance by Allen Ginsberg, as well as footage of Condo collaborating with William S. Burroughs on paintings the two made together at Burroughs' [[Kansas]] home in the mid-1990s.\n\nThere has been extensive critical writing about Condo's work. Several monographs have been published, including ''The Imaginary Portraits of George Condo'' (powerHouse), ''George Condo: Sculpture'' by Thomas Kellein (Hatje Kanz), ''George Condo: One Hundred Women'' (Hatje Kanz), and in conjunction with an exhibition of the same title, ''George Condo: Mental States'' (Hayward Publishing).\n\nIn 1999, Condo received an Academy Award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], and in 2005 he received the [[Francis J. Greenburger]] Award. He has been invited to lecture at many prestigious institutions including [[Columbia University]], [[Yale University]], Pasadena Art Center, San Francisco MOMA, the Solomon R.

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]].

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u20131995), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u20131998), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u20132003) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005\u20132007).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=27 December 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|title=The Year of the Rolling Stones|newspaper=New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701174542/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|archivedate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\" list and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated record sales]] is 200&nbsp;million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary. They still continue to release albums to brisk sales and critical acclaim; their most recent album ''[[Blue & Lonesome (Rolling Stones album)|Blue & Lonesome]]'' was released in December 2016 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US and won a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]].
