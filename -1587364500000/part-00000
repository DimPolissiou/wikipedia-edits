This earlier version was initially recorded as a demo in 1975. The song had a slower, funkier sound with a basic [[disco]] beat. For this reason the band referred to it as \"The Disco Song\".<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite magazine|first= Jim |last= Green |title= Blondie: Pumping Vinyl |magazine= [[Trouser Press]] |issue= 77 |page= 19 |date= September 1982}}</ref><ref name=\"Simpson\">{{cite news|first= Dave |last= Simpson |title= How we made: Heart of Glass |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location= London, England |date= April 29, 2013 |accessdate= April 29, 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/29/how-we-made-heart-glass}}</ref> This original version was inspired by [[The Hues Corporation]]'s hit disco song \"[[Rock the Boat (The Hues Corporation song)|Rock the Boat]]\" (1974).<ref name=\"Myers\">{{cite book|first= Marc |last= Myers |year= 2016 |title= Anatomy of a Song: The Inside Stories Behind 45 Iconic Hits |publisher= [[Grove Atlantic]] |chapter= Heart of Glass \u2013 Blondie |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KU8-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT231}}</ref> The song was re-recorded in a second demo with the same title in 1978, when the song was made a bit more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented. Harry said that \"'Heart of Glass' was one of the first songs Blondie wrote, but it was years before we recorded it properly. We'd tried it as a ballad, as reggae, but it never quite worked\", and that \"the lyrics weren't about anyone. They were just a plaintive moan about lost love.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> It was only when the band met with producer [[Mike Chapman]] to start work on ''Parallel Lines'' that Harry recalled Chapman \"asked us to play all the songs we had. At the end, he said: 'Have you got anything else?' We sheepishly said: 'Well, there is this old one.' He liked it \u2013 he thought it was fascinating and started to pull it into focus.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nExactly who decided to give the song a more pronounced disco vibe is subject to differing recollections. On some occasions, the producer Mike Chapman has stated that he convinced Harry and Stein to give the song a disco twist. On other occasions, Chapman has credited Harry with the idea.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Douglas |last= Wolk |title= The Greatest Songs Ever! \u2013 'Heart of Glass' |magazine= [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |location= London, England |date= March 2006}}</ref> As a band, Blondie had experimented with disco before, both in the predecessors to \"Heart of Glass\" and in live cover songs that the band played at shows. Bassist [[Gary Lachman|Gary Valentine]] noted that the set list for early Blondie shows often included disco hits such as \"Honey Bee\" or \"My Imagination\".<ref>{{cite book|first= Gary |last= Valentine |title= New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation |year= 2002 |page= 73 |publisher= [[Perseus Books Group#Former imprints|Thunder's Mouth Press]] |isbn= 1-56025-944-2}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview published in the February 4, 1978 edition of ''[[NME]]'', Debbie Harry expressed her affinity for the [[Euro disco]] music of [[Giorgio Moroder]], stating that \"It's commercial, but it's good, it says something... that's the kind of stuff that I want to do\".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Tony |last= Parsons |title= Gentlemen Prefer Blondies... |magazine= [[NME]] |location= London, England |date= February 4, 1978}}</ref> A notable example of this type of musical experimentation occurred when Blondie covered [[Donna Summer]]'s \"[[I Feel Love]]\" at the Blitz Benefit on May 7, 1978.<ref>{{cite book|first1= Debbie |last1= Harry |first2= Chris |last2= Stein |first3= Victor |last3= Bockris |title= Making Tracks: The Rise of Blondie |pages= 129\u201330 |publisher= Horizon Book Promotions |year= 1982 |isbn= 0-440-55150-1}}</ref> In his history of CBGB, music writer Roman Kozak described this event: \"When Blondie played for the [[Johnny Blitz]] benefit in May, 1978, they surprised everyone with a rendition of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love'. It was arguably the first time in New York, in the middle of the great rock versus disco split, that a rock band had played a disco song. Blondie went on to record 'Heart of Glass,' other groups recorded other danceable songs, and dance rock was born.\"<ref>{{cite book|first= Roman |last= Kozak |title= This Ain't No Disco: The Story of CBGB |url= https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma |url-access= registration |publisher= [[Faber and Faber]] |location= London, England |year= 1988 |page= [https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma/page/n135 110] |isbn= 0-571-12956-0}}</ref>\n\nThe song was ultimately given the disco orientation that made the song one of the best-known Blondie recordings. For the single release the track was remixed by Chapman, with the double-tracked bass drum even more accentuated.\n\nIn reflecting on the development of \"Heart of Glass\" from its earliest incarnations until the recorded version on ''Parallel Lines'', Chris Stein noted that the earliest versions had a basic conventional disco beat, but that the recorded version incorporated the [[Electronic music|electronic sound]] of Euro disco, stating that \"The original arrangement of 'Heart of Glass'\u2014as on the [1975] Betrock demos\u2014had doubles on the high-hat cymbals, a more straight-ahead disco beat. When we recorded it for ''Parallel Lines'' we were really into [[Kraftwerk]], and we wanted to make it more electronic. We weren't thinking disco as we were doing it; we thought it was more electro-European.\"<ref name=\"Green\"/>\n\nThe ''Parallel Lines'' version (as well as most others) contained some rhythmic features that were very unusual for the disco context, which typically follows a strict [[duple and quadruple meter|four-beats-per-measure]] pattern for maximum danceability. The instrumental interludes in \"Heart of Glass\", in contrast, consist of [[septuple meter|{{music|time|7|4}}]] (seven-beat) [[phrase (music theory)|phrases]], with exception to the last phrase and subsequent [[reprise]]s of each interlude, which resolve back to [[duple and quadruple meter|eight beats per phrase]].\n\nA 5:50 version of \"Heart of Glass\" was first released as a [[12-inch single]] in December 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Top Single Picks |magazine= Billboard |date= December 16, 1978 |page= 80 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1978/Billboard%201978-12-16.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"uncensored\"/> Some radio stations in the US were reluctant to play the song because of the \"pain in the ass\" lyric, so an edited 7-inch single was released in January 1979.<ref name=\"uncensored\">{{cite magazine|title= An Uncensored 'Glass' Cut On Blondie Album |magazine= Billboard |date= March 24, 1979 |page= 101 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1979/Billboard%201979-03-24.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Philip |last= Dodd |authorlink= Philip Dodd (author) |first2= Paul |last2= Du Noyer |authorlink2= Paul Du Noyer |year= 1999 |title= The Encyclopedia of Singles |publisher= Paragon |page= 82 |isbn= 0752533371}}</ref> The original album version was released as a single in the UK where the [[BBC]] [[bleep censor|bleeped]] out the offending word. Debbie Harry told ''[[The Guardian]]'', \"At first, the song kept saying: 'Once I had a love, it was a gas. Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass.' We couldn't keep saying that, so we came up with: 'Soon turned out, had a heart of glass.'

As explained in the program, the production of \"Heart of Glass\" was built around the use of a [[Roland CR-78]] [[drum machine]]. The CR-78 was first introduced in 1978, the same year that ''Parallel Lines'' was recorded, and the use of this device on \"Heart of Glass\" was, according to the program, among the earliest uses of this device in popular music. As the program explained, it was also very unusual to use a drum machine in the context of a rock band.\n\nIn deciding to use the CR-78 for \"Heart of Glass\", the choice was made to combine the sound of the drum machine with the sound of actual drumming. This reflected the hybrid nature of the song, the combination of a drum machine that was typically used in the context of dance music with the actual drum sound that was a traditional aspect of rock recordings. In combining these elements, the sound of the drum machine was first recorded on an individual track. To synchronize the actual drum play with the drum machine, the drums were also recorded on separate tracks, with the bass drum recorded separately from the rest of the drums.\n\nHaving combined the drums with the drum machine, another important feature of the CR-78 was that it could be used to send a trigger pulse to the early [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s. This trigger pulse feature was also used on \"Heart of Glass\". The trigger pulse created by the CR-78 became a distinctive electronic/synth element of the song. The additional [[synthesizer]] portions of the song were played separately.\n\nOther [[electronic musical instrument]]s used in the track include the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland SH-3A|SH-5]] and [[Minimoog]] synthesizers. Due to the lack of [[music sequencer]]s, they recorded three different parts using the SH-5 and Minimoog.<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\nFor the guitars, each guitar part was again recorded on separate tracks. For the vocals, a single track and a double track of Debbie Harry's voice were combined into a single vocal recording.\n\nIn an interview in the magazine that is part of the collector's edition for the ninth Blondie studio album ''[[Panic of Girls]]'', Debbie Harry explained that band members Chris Stein and [[Jimmy Destri]] had purchased the CR-78 from a music store on 47th Street in Manhattan, and that this is how the device had become part of the production of \"Heart of Glass\": \"Chris and Jimmy were always going over to 47th Street where all the music stores were, and one day they came back with this little rhythm box, which went 'tikka tikka tikka'... And the rest is history!\" Stein also credited Destri with influencing the song's sound, saying he \"had a lot to do with how the record sounds... It was Jimmy who brought in the drum machine and a synthesiser. Synchronising them was a big deal at the time. It all had to be done manually, with every note and beat played in real time rather than looped over.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nAt the time, Blondie was one of the bands at the forefront of New York's growing [[new wave music]] scene and were accused of \"[[selling out]]\" for releasing a disco song. According to Harry, \"Heart of Glass\" made the band pariahs in the eyes of many of their fellow musicians in the New York music scene. The band was accused of [[Pandering (politics)|pandering]] to the mainstream that many punk/new wave bands at the time were actively rebelling against.<ref>{{cite news|first1= Ann |last1= Bardach |first2= Susan |last2= Lydon |title= A Cool Blonde and a Hot Band |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]] |location= New York City, USA |page= 191 |date= August 26, 1979}}</ref> She also said, \"People got nervous and angry about us bringing different influences into rock. Although we'd covered '[[Lady Marmalade]]' and '[[I Feel Love]]' at gigs, lots of people were mad at us for 'going disco' with 'Heart of Glass'... [[Clem Burke]], our drummer, refused to play the song live at first. When it became a hit, he said: 'I guess I'll have to.'\" Chris Stein was unrepentant about the song's disco sound, saying, \"As far as I was concerned, disco was part of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], which I'd always liked.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nDespite the controversy, the song was a huge hit and helped propel Blondie from cult group to mainstream icons. The band itself has acknowledged the success of the song in helping their careers and has downplayed criticism of the song, pointing out that they always experimented with different styles of music and that \"Heart of Glass\" was their take on disco. The band itself has jokingly taken to referring to the song as \"The Disco Song\" in interviews. The band also credits the TV sitcom about a radio station, ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', which played the song on one of their episodes and gave it critical exposure. In gratitude, the band gave the series' producers a [[Music recording certification#Certification thresholds|Gold record]] for the song and it can be seen in the bullpen scenes from the second season to the series' conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|first= Michaelangelo |last= Matos |title= WKRP in Perpetuity |publisher= [[NPR]] |date= December 6, 2014 |accessdate= April 20, 2018 |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/12/06/367971595/wkrp-in-perpetuity}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe \"Heart of Glass\" promotional video was directed by [[Stanley Dorfman]]. Contrary to popular belief, it was not filmed at the [[Studio 54]] nightclub; Chris Stein said that \"in the video, there's a shot of the legendary Studio 54, so everyone thought we shot the video there, but it was actually in a short-lived club called the Copa or something\".<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> The video begins with footage of [[New York City]] at night before joining Blondie on stage. Then, the video alternates between close-ups of Debbie Harry's face as she lip-syncs and mid-distance shots of the entire band.

This earlier version was initially recorded as a demo in 1975. The song had a slower, funkier sound with a basic [[disco]] beat. For this reason the band referred to it as \"The Disco Song\".<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite magazine|first= Jim |last= Green |title= Blondie: Pumping Vinyl |magazine= [[Trouser Press]] |issue= 77 |page= 19 |date= September 1982}}</ref><ref name=\"Simpson\">{{cite news|first= Dave |last= Simpson |title= How we made: Heart of Glass |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location= London, England |date= April 29, 2013 |accessdate= April 29, 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/29/how-we-made-heart-glass}}</ref> This original version was inspired by [[The Hues Corporation]]'s hit disco song \"[[Rock the Boat (The Hues Corporation song)|Rock the Boat]]\" (1974).<ref name=\"Myers\">{{cite book|first= Marc |last= Myers |year= 2016 |title= Anatomy of a Song: The Inside Stories Behind 45 Iconic Hits |publisher= [[Grove Atlantic]] |chapter= Heart of Glass \u2013 Blondie |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KU8-DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT231}}</ref> The song was re-recorded in a second demo with the same title in 1978, when the song was made a bit more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented. Harry said that \"'Heart of Glass' was one of the first songs Blondie wrote, but it was years before we recorded it properly. We'd tried it as a ballad, as reggae, but it never quite worked\", and that \"the lyrics weren't about anyone. They were just a plaintive moan about lost love.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> It was only when the band met with producer [[Mike Chapman]] to start work on ''Parallel Lines'' that Harry recalled Chapman \"asked us to play all the songs we had. At the end, he said: 'Have you got anything else?' We sheepishly said: 'Well, there is this old one.' He liked it \u2013 he thought it was fascinating and started to pull it into focus.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nExactly who decided to give the song a more pronounced disco vibe is subject to differing recollections. On some occasions, the producer Mike Chapman has stated that he convinced Harry and Stein to give the song a disco twist. On other occasions, Chapman has credited Harry with the idea.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Douglas |last= Wolk |title= The Greatest Songs Ever! \u2013 'Heart of Glass' |magazine= [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |location= London, England |date= March 2006}}</ref> As a band, Blondie had experimented with disco before, both in the predecessors to \"Heart of Glass\" and in live cover songs that the band played at shows. Bassist [[Gary Lachman|Gary Valentine]] noted that the set list for early Blondie shows often included disco hits such as \"Honey Bee\" or \"My Imagination\".<ref>{{cite book|first= Gary |last= Valentine |title= New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation |year= 2002 |page= 73 |publisher= [[Perseus Books Group#Former imprints|Thunder's Mouth Press]] |isbn= 1-56025-944-2}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview published in the February 4, 1978 edition of ''[[NME]]'', Debbie Harry expressed her affinity for the [[Euro disco]] music of [[Giorgio Moroder]], stating that \"It's commercial, but it's good, it says something... that's the kind of stuff that I want to do\".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Tony |last= Parsons |title= Gentlemen Prefer Blondies... |magazine= [[NME]] |location= London, England |date= February 4, 1978}}</ref> A notable example of this type of musical experimentation occurred when Blondie covered [[Donna Summer]]'s \"[[I Feel Love]]\" at the Blitz Benefit on May 7, 1978.<ref>{{cite book|first1= Debbie |last1= Harry |first2= Chris |last2= Stein |first3= Victor |last3= Bockris |title= Making Tracks: The Rise of Blondie |pages= 129\u201330 |publisher= Horizon Book Promotions |year= 1982 |isbn= 0-440-55150-1}}</ref> In his history of CBGB, music writer Roman Kozak described this event: \"When Blondie played for the [[Johnny Blitz]] benefit in May, 1978, they surprised everyone with a rendition of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love'. It was arguably the first time in New York, in the middle of the great rock versus disco split, that a rock band had played a disco song. Blondie went on to record 'Heart of Glass,' other groups recorded other danceable songs, and dance rock was born.\"<ref>{{cite book|first= Roman |last= Kozak |title= This Ain't No Disco: The Story of CBGB |url= https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma |url-access= registration |publisher= [[Faber and Faber]] |location= London, England |year= 1988 |page= [https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma/page/n135 110] |isbn= 0-571-12956-0}}</ref>\n\nThe song was ultimately given the disco orientation that made the song one of the best-known Blondie recordings. For the single release the track was remixed by Chapman, with the double-tracked bass drum even more accentuated.\n\nIn reflecting on the development of \"Heart of Glass\" from its earliest incarnations until the recorded version on ''Parallel Lines'', Chris Stein noted that the earliest versions had a basic conventional disco beat, but that the recorded version incorporated the [[Electronic music|electronic sound]] of Euro disco, stating that \"The original arrangement of 'Heart of Glass'\u2014as on the [1975] Betrock demos\u2014had doubles on the high-hat cymbals, a more straight-ahead disco beat. When we recorded it for ''Parallel Lines'' we were really into [[Kraftwerk]], and we wanted to make it more electronic. We weren't thinking disco as we were doing it; we thought it was more electro-European.\"<ref name=\"Green\"/>\n\nThe ''Parallel Lines'' version (as well as most others) contained some rhythmic features that were very unusual for the disco context, which typically follows a strict [[duple and quadruple meter|four-beats-per-measure]] pattern for maximum danceability. The instrumental interludes in \"Heart of Glass\", in contrast, consist of [[septuple meter|{{music|time|7|4}}]] (seven-beat) [[phrase (music theory)|phrases]], with exception to the last phrase and subsequent [[reprise]]s of each interlude, which resolve back to [[duple and quadruple meter|eight beats per phrase]].\n\nA 5:50 version of \"Heart of Glass\" was first released as [[12-inch single]] in December 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Top Single Picks |magazine= Billboard |date= December 16, 1978 |page= 80 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1978/Billboard%201978-12-16.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"uncensored\"/> Some radio stations in the US were reluctant to play the song because of the \"pain in the ass\" lyric, so an edited 7-inch single was released in January 1979.<ref name=\"uncensored\">{{cite magazine|title= An Uncensored 'Glass' Cut On Blondie Album |magazine= Billboard |date= March 24, 1979 |page= 101 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1979/Billboard%201979-03-24.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Philip |last= Dodd |authorlink= Philip Dodd (author) |first2= Paul |last2= Du Noyer |authorlink2= Paul Du Noyer |year= 1999 |title= The Encyclopedia of Singles |publisher= Paragon |page= 82 |isbn= 0752533371}}</ref> The original album version was released as a single in the UK where the [[BBC]] [[bleep censor|bleeped]] out the offending word. Debbie Harry told ''[[The Guardian]]'', \"At first, the song kept saying: 'Once I had a love, it was a gas. Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass.' We couldn't keep saying that, so we came up with: 'Soon turned out, had a heart of glass.' We kept one 'pain in the ass' in \u2013 and the BBC bleeped it out for radio.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nThe single reached number one on the singles charts in the US and the UK. In the US, the single was certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 1979, representing sales of one million copies. In the UK, it was certified Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] in February 1979, also for sales of one million copies.\n\nDespite its overall popularity, \"Heart of Glass\" was not a hit in [[New York City]]'s traditional [[Nightclub|discoth\u00e8ques]] such as [[Studio 54]], [[Xenon (nightclub)|Xenon]] and [[Crisco Disco]],<ref name=\"Trakin\">{{cite magazine|first= Roy |last= Trakin |title= Update Blondie |magazine= [[New York Rocker]] |date= August 1979}}</ref> and only reached No. 58 in ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Dance Club Songs|Disco Top 80]] chart.<ref name=\"DiscoTop80\">{{cite magazine|title= Billboard Disco Top 80 |magazine= Billboard |date= May 5, 1979 |accessdate= December 4, 2016 |url= http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1979/Billboard%201979-05-05.pdf}}</ref> One of the first [[rock music|rock]]/[[disco]] fusion hits,<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Paul |last= Grein |title= 1979: The Great Rock/Disco Title Bout |magazine= Billboard |date= December 22, 1979 |accessdate= December 4, 2016 |url= http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1979/Billboard%201979-12-22.pdf}}</ref> it was more popular in rock-oriented nightclubs such as [[Hurrah (nightclub)|Hurrah]] and the [[Mudd Club]].<ref name=\"Trakin\"/>\n\nThe song is associated with the [[disco]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] genres.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Arion |last= Berger |title= Review: Parallel Lines |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= June 8, 2000 |location= New York |page= 129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Theo |last= Cateforis |title= Are We Not New Wave? : Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s |year= 2011 |isbn= 0-472-03470-7 |publisher= [[University of Michigan Press]] |page= 37 |quote= Undoubtedly the rock disco helped in breaking the year's first new wave / disco crossover hit, Blondie's chart-topping smash \"Heart of Glass\"}}</ref>\n\n;Mixes\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nThe versions appearing on original 7\" and 12\" singles issued in early 1979 varied from country to country:\n\n* Original album version \u2013 3:54\n* Single edit \u2013 3:22\n** Used for US/Canada 7\" releases\n* Disco version \u2013 5:50\n** Used for 12\" releases and Germany/Netherlands 7\" releases; replaced original album version on all future pressings of ''Parallel Lines.''\n* Disco mix edit \u2013 4:12\n** Used for UK 7\" (though the label incorrectly gives the timing of 3:54, as the original album version).

As explained in the program, the production of \"Heart of Glass\" was built around the use of a [[Roland CR-78]] [[drum machine]]. The CR-78 was first introduced in 1978, the same year that ''Parallel Lines'' was recorded, and the use of this device on \"Heart of Glass\" was, according to the program, among the earliest uses of this device in popular music. As the program explained, it was also very unusual to use a drum machine in the context of a rock band.\n\nIn deciding to use the CR-78 for \"Heart of Glass\", the choice was made to combine the sound of the drum machine with the sound of actual drumming. This reflected the hybrid nature of the song, the combination of a drum machine that was typically used in the context of dance music with the actual drum sound that was a traditional aspect of rock recordings. In combining these elements, the sound of the drum machine was first recorded on an individual track. To synchronize the actual drum play with the drum machine, the drums were also recorded on separate tracks, with the bass drum recorded separately from the rest of the drums.\n\nHaving combined the drums with the drum machine, another important feature of the CR-78 was that it could be used to send a trigger pulse to the early [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s. This trigger pulse feature was also used on \"Heart of Glass\". The trigger pulse created by the CR-78 became a distinctive electronic/synth element of the song. The additional [[synthesizer]] portions of the song were played separately.\n\nOther [[electronic musical instrument]]s used in the track include the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland SH-3A|SH-5]] and [[Minimoog]] synthesizers. Due to the lack of [[music sequencer]]s, they recorded three different parts using the SH-5 and Minimoog.<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\nFor the guitars, each guitar part was again recorded on separate tracks. For the vocals, a single track and a double track of Debbie Harry's voice were combined into a single vocal recording.\n\nIn an interview in the magazine that is part of the collector's edition for the ninth Blondie studio album ''[[Panic of Girls]]'', Debbie Harry explained that band members Chris Stein and [[Jimmy Destri]] had purchased the CR-78 from a music store on 47th Street in Manhattan, and that this is how the device had become part of the production of \"Heart of Glass\": \"Chris and Jimmy were always going over to 47th Street where all the music stores were, and one day they came back with this little rhythm box, which went 'tikka tikka tikka'... And the rest is history!\" Stein also credited Destri with influencing the song's sound, saying he \"had a lot to do with how the record sounds... It was Jimmy who brought in the drum machine and a synthesiser. Synchronising them was a big deal at the time. It all had to be done manually, with every note and beat played in real time rather than looped over.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nAt the time, Blondie was one of the bands at the forefront of New York's growing [[new wave music]] scene and were accused of \"[[selling out]]\" for releasing a disco song. According to Harry, \"Heart of Glass\" made the band pariahs in the eyes of many of their fellow musicians in the New York music scene. The band was accused of [[Pandering (politics)|pandering]] to the mainstream that many punk/new wave bands at the time were actively rebelling against.<ref>{{cite news|first1= Ann |last1= Bardach |first2= Susan |last2= Lydon |title= A Cool Blonde and a Hot Band |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]] |location= New York City, USA |page= 191 |date= August 26, 1979}}</ref> She also said, \"People got nervous and angry about us bringing different influences into rock. Although we'd covered '[[Lady Marmalade]]' and '[[I Feel Love]]' at gigs, lots of people were mad at us for 'going disco' with 'Heart of Glass'... [[Clem Burke]], our drummer, refused to play the song live at first. When it became a hit, he said: 'I guess I'll have to.'\" Chris Stein was unrepentant about the song's disco sound, saying, \"As far as I was concerned, disco was part of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], which I'd always liked.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nDespite the controversy, the song was a huge hit and helped propel Blondie from cult group to mainstream icons. The band itself has acknowledged the success of the song in helping their careers and has downplayed criticism of the song, pointing out that they always experimented with different styles of music and that \"Heart of Glass\" was their take on disco. The band itself has jokingly taken to referring to the song as \"The Disco Song\" in interviews. The band also credits the TV sitcom about a radio station, ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', which played the song on one of their episodes and gave it critical exposure. In gratitude, the band gave the series' producers a [[Music recording certification#Certification thresholds|Gold record]] for the song and it can be seen in the bullpen scenes from the second season to the series' conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|first= Michaelangelo |last= Matos |title= WKRP in Perpetuity |publisher= [[NPR]] |date= December 6, 2014 |accessdate= April 20, 2018 |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/12/06/367971595/wkrp-in-perpetuity}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe \"Heart of Glass\" promotional video was directed by [[Stanley Dorfman]]. Contrary to popular belief, it was not filmed at the [[Studio 54]] nightclub; Chris Stein said that \"in the video, there's a shot of the legendary Studio 54, so everyone thought we shot the video there, but it was actually in a short-lived club called the Copa or something\".<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> The video begins with footage of [[New York City]] at night before joining Blondie on stage.
