K. Rowling]]'s series of ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels. Voldemort first appeared in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series except the third, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in which he is only mentioned.\n\nVoldemort is the [[archenemy]] of [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], who according to a [[prophecy]] has \"the power to vanquish the [[Dark Lord]]\". He attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters|Lily]] and [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and leaves Harry with a scar on his head in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as \"'''You-Know-Who'''\", \"'''He Who Must Not Be Named'''\", or \"'''the Dark Lord'''\". Voldemort's obsession with [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|blood purity]] signifies his aim to rid the [[Wizarding World|wizarding world]] of [[Muggle]] (non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance. Through his mother's family, he is the last descendant of the wizard [[Salazar Slytherin]],<ref name=\"{{HP2}}ch17\">{{HPref|book=2|chapter=17}}</ref><ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch20\"/> one of the four founders of [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He is the leader of the [[Death Eater]]s, a group of evil wizards and witches dedicated to ridding the Wizarding World of Muggles and establishing Voldemort as its supreme ruler.\n\n== Character development ==\nIn a 1999 interview, Rowling said Voldemort was invented as a nemesis for Harry Potter, and she intentionally did not flesh out Voldemort's [[backstory]] at first. \"The basic idea [was that Harry] didn't know he was a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most [[evil]] wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry\u2014he tried to curse him. ... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And\u2014so\u2014but for some mysterious reason the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this [[lightning]] bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.\"<ref name=\"rehm\" />\n\nIn the second book, Rowling establishes that Voldemort hates non-[[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|pure-blood]] wizards, despite being a half-blood himself. In a 2000 interview with the [[BBC]], Rowling described Voldemort as a self-hating bully: \"Well I think it is often the case that the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other and that's what Voldemort does.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm|title=JK Rowling talks about Book Four |publisher=cBBC Newsround |date= 4 March 2004|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> In the same year, Rowling became more precise about Voldemort. She began to link him to real-life tyrants, describing him as \"a raging [[psychopath]], devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering\".<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jeff|last=Jensen|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0900-ew-jensen.htm| |title='Fire' Storm |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=7 September 2000|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> In 2004, though, Rowling said that she did not base Voldemort on any real person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm|title=JK Rowling's World Book Day Chat |website=The Leaky Cauldron|date=4 March 2004|via=accio-quote.org}}</ref> In 2006, Rowling told an interviewer that Voldemort at his core has a human fear: the fear of death. She said: \"Voldemort's fear is death, ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it's a shameful human weakness, as you know. His worst fear is death.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |first1=Melissa |last1= Anelli |first2= Emerson |last2=Spartz  |title= The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two |website= The Leaky Cauldron |date= 16 July 2005 |accessdate= 2 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, Rowling establishes that Voldemort is so feared in the wizarding world that it is considered dangerous even to speak his name. Most characters in the novels refer to him as \"You-Know-Who\" or \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\" rather than say his name aloud. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', a \"taboo\" spell is placed upon the name, such that Voldemort or his followers may trace anyone who utters it. By this means, his followers eventually find and capture Harry and his friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. In the second book, Rowling reveals that ''I am Lord Voldemort'' is an anagram of the character's birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle. According to the author, Voldemort's name is an invented word.<ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher|last=Lydon|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm|title=J.K.

This is not a place for fanboy cruft, but only a BRIEF retelling of above publishing information in a canonical form.\n-->\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' ===\n[[File:Voldemort in Movie 1.jpg|thumb|left|Voldemort on the back of [[Professor Quirrell]]'s head in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'']]\n\nVoldemort makes his debut in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''. In this story, Rowling introduces him as the Dark Lord who murdered Harry's parents, [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter|Lily]], but as a result of his mother's love and willingness to sacrifice herself for him, baby Harry survives when Voldemort tries to murder him with a [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]]. Voldemort is disembodied, and Harry carries a mysterious scar on his forehead as a result. In the book, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to regain his dissolved body by stealing the titular [[Sorcerer's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]. To achieve his objective, Voldemort uses [[Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell's]] aid by latching onto the back of the latter's head. However, at the climax of the book, Harry manages to prevent Voldemort from stealing the stone.\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' ===\nIn the second instalment, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', Rowling introduces Tom Marvolo Riddle, a manifestation of a teenage Voldemort that resides inside a magical diary found by [[Ginny Weasley]]. In this book, Ginny is written as a shy girl with a crush on Harry. Feeling anxious and lonely, she begins to write into the diary and shares her deepest fears with the sympathetic Tom. However, at the climax of the story, when Riddle rearranges the letters in his name to write \"I am Lord Voldemort\", Riddle is revealed as a magical manifestation of the boy who would later grow up to become the Dark Lord. Riddle states he has grown strong on Ginny's fears and eventually [[demonic possession|possesses]] her, using her as a pawn to unlock the [[Locations in Hogwarts#Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], whence a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]] is set free and petrifies several Hogwarts students. Harry defeats the manifestation of Riddle from the diary and the basilisk.<ref name=\"{{HP2}}ch17\"/> In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', [[Albus Dumbledore]] reveals to Harry that the diary was one of Voldemort's [[Horcruxes]].\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' ===\nVoldemort does not appear in the third book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', either in person or as a magical manifestation. He is, however, heard when Harry passes out from the harsh effects of a [[Dementors|Dementor]]. Towards the end of the story [[Sybill Trelawney]], the Divination professor, makes a rare genuine prophecy: \"The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight, the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant's aid, greater and more terrible than ever before. Tonight... before midnight... the servant... will set out... to rejoin... his master...\"<ref name=\"{{HP3}}ch16\">{{HPref|book=3|chapter=16}}</ref> Though it is initially implied that the prophecy refers to [[Sirius Black]], the book's ostensible antagonist, the servant is eventually revealed to be [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], who, for the 12 years since Voldemort's fall, has been disguised as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' ===\nIn the fourth instalment of the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Voldemort appears at the start and the climax of the book. Rowling lets many seemingly unrelated plot elements fall into order. It is revealed that Voldemort's minion [[Barty Crouch Jr]], disguised as Hogwarts professor [[Mad-Eye Moody]], has manipulated the events of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] in Harry's favour. Voldemort's goal is to [[Teleportation|teleport]] Harry under Dumbledore's watch as a reluctant participant to the [[Little Hangleton]] graveyard, where the Riddle family is buried.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32333435\" /> Harry is captured and, after Pettigrew uses Harry's blood to fulfil a gruesome magical ritual, Voldemort regains his body and is restored to his full power.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32\">{{HPref|book=4}}</ref> For the first time in the series, Rowling describes his appearance: \"tall and skeletally thin\", with a face \"whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was as flat as a snake\u2019s with slits for nostrils\".<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32333435\" /> Rowling writes that his \"hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat's, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness\".<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32333435\" /> It was revealed that, while in [[Albania]], Pettigrew had captured the [[Ministry of Magic]] official [[Minor Ministry officials in Harry Potter#Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], who was [[torture]]d for information about the Ministry.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch1\" /> After they learned that Barty Crouch Jr, a faithful [[Death Eater]], had been smuggled out of [[Azkaban]] and was privately confined at his [[Barty Crouch Sr|father's]] house, they killed her. With Pettigrew's help, Voldemort creates a small, rudimentary body, corporeal enough to travel and perform magic, and formulated a plan to restore his own body by capturing Harry. A portion of the plan had been overheard by [[Frank Bryce]], a gardener, whom Voldemort then killed.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch1\" /> Voldemort then completes his plan and returns to life in his full body as a result of the ritual with Harry's blood. He then summons his Death Eaters to the graveyard to witness the death of Harry as he challenges Harry to a duel. However, when Voldemort duels Harry, their wands become magically locked together due to the twin Phoenix feather cores of the wands. Because of a phenomenon later revealed as [[Priori Incantatem]], ghost-like manifestations of Voldemort's most recent victims (including Harry's parents) then appear and distract Voldemort, allowing Harry just enough time to escape via [[Portkey]] with the body of fellow-student, [[Cedric Diggory]], who was murdered by Pettigrew on Voldemort's orders.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch36\">{{HPref|book=4|chapter=36}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' ===\nVoldemort appears at the climax of the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', having again plotted against Harry.<ref name=\"{{HP5}}ch35\">{{HPref|book=5|chapter=35}}</ref> In this book, Harry goes through extreme emotional stress, and according to Rowling, it was necessary to prove that Harry is emotionally vulnerable and thus human, in contrast to his nemesis Voldemort, who is emotionally invulnerable and thus inhuman: \"[Harry is] a very ''human'' hero, and this is, obviously, there\u2019s a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately ''de''humanised himself. [\u2026] and Harry, therefore, did have to reach a point where he did almost break down.\"<ref name=\"Fry2005 \">{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/1205-bbc-fry.html |title=Living With Harry Potter |accessdate=15 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602092002/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/1205-bbc-fry.html |archivedate= 2 June 2009 |df= }}</ref> In this book, Voldemort makes liberal use of the Ministry of Magic's refusal to believe that he has returned.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch36\" /> Voldemort engineers a plot to free [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and other Death Eaters from Azkaban and then embarks on a scheme to retrieve the full record of a prophecy stored in the [[Department of Mysteries]] regarding Harry and himself. He sends a group of Death Eaters to retrieve the prophecy, where the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] meets them. All but Bellatrix are captured, and Voldemort engages in a ferocious duel with Dumbledore. When Dumbledore gets the upper hand, Voldemort attempts to possess Harry but finds that he cannot; Harry is too full of that which Voldemort finds incomprehensible, and which he detests as weakness: love. Sensing that Dumbledore could win, Voldemort disapparates, but not before the Minister for Magic sees him in person, making his return to life public knowledge in the next book.\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' ===\nVoldemort does not appear in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', although his presence and actions are felt: he once again declares war, and begins to rise to power once more. He murders [[Amelia Bones]] of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix, including [[Emmeline Vance]].\n\nRowling uses several chapters as exposition to establish Voldemort's backstory. In a series of flashbacks, using the [[pensieve]] as a plot device, she reveals that Voldemort was the son of the witch [[Merope Gaunt]] and a Muggle called Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child's birth, soon after which Merope died.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\" /> After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch13\" /> Riddle was outwardly a model student, but was in reality a [[psychopath]] who took [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch17\" /> The book also discusses Riddle's hatred of \"[[Muggle]]s\", his obsession with [[Horcrux]]es, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch23\" /> Rowling stated Voldemort's conception under the influence of a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Magic and love|love potion]] symbolises the prejudicial circumstances under which he was brought into the world.<ref name=\"AfterBook7\">{{cite web|url=http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript\n| title=\"J.\" K. rowling web chat transcript|accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the main plot of the book, Voldemort's next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to attack Dumbledore. This is accomplished by [[Draco Malfoy]], who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch27\">{{HPref|book=6|chapter=27}}</ref> The cabinets allow Voldemort's Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered.

He disposes of the Minister for Magic and replaces him with [[Pius Thicknesse]], who is under the [[Imperius Curse]].<ref name=\"DH121315\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=1}}</ref> Establishing a [[totalitarian]] [[police state]], he has Muggle-borns persecuted and arrested for \"stealing magic\" from the \"pure blood\" wizards.<ref name=\"DH121315\" /> After failing to kill Harry with Draco's father [[Lucius Malfoy]]'s borrowed wand (to avoid the effect of [[Priori Incantatem]]),<ref name=\"DH4\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=4}}</ref> he goes on a murderous search for the [[Elder Wand]], the most powerful wand ever created, seeing it as the weapon he needs to overcome Harry's wand and make him truly invincible. He goes on a quest that takes him out of the country to [[Gregorovitch]]'s wand shop, where he kills the old wandmaker.<ref name=\"DH14\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=14}}</ref> His journey also takes him to [[Nurmengard]], the prison where [[Gellert Grindelwald]] is kept, and he kills Grindelwald as well. He finally locates the Elder Wand and steals it from Dumbledore's tomb.\n\nLater, Voldemort finds out that Harry and his friends are hunting and destroying his Horcruxes when informed of their heist on the Lestranges' vault at Gringotts in search for [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup|Hufflepuff's Cup]].<ref name=\"DH27\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=27}}</ref> After offering the occupants of Hogwarts mercy if they give up Harry, he assembles a large army and launches an invasion of the castle, where Harry is searching for [[Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem|Ravenclaw's Diadem]].<ref name=\"DH31\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=31}}</ref> Voldemort orders his pet snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] to execute Snape, believing it would make him the true master of the Elder Wand, since Snape killed Dumbledore.<ref name=\"DH32\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=32}}</ref> He then calls an hour's [[armistice]], in exchange for Harry.<ref name=\"DH34\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=34}}</ref> When Harry willingly walks into Voldemort's camp in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], Voldemort strikes him down with the Elder Wand.<ref name=\"DH34\" /> However, the use of Harry's blood to resurrect Voldemort's body proves to be a major setback: while Harry's blood runs in Voldemort's veins, Harry cannot be killed as his mother's protection lives on now in Voldemort too. Instead, Voldemort destroys the part of his own soul that resides in Harry's body. Voldemort forces [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to carry Harry's apparently lifeless body back to the castle as a trophy, sparking another battle during which Nagini, his last Horcrux, is destroyed by [[Neville Longbottom]]. The battle then moves into the Great Hall, where Voldemort fights [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], and [[Horace Slughorn]] simultaneously. Harry then reveals himself and explains to Voldemort that Draco became the true master of the Elder Wand when he disarmed Dumbledore; Harry, in turn, won the wand's allegiance when he took Draco's wand. Refusing to believe this, Voldemort casts the Killing Curse with the Elder Wand while Harry uses a Disarming Charm with Draco's, but the Elder Wand refuses to kill its master and the spell rebounds on Voldemort who, with all of his Horcruxes destroyed, finally dies. His body is laid in a different chamber from all the others who died battling him.<ref name=\"DH36\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=36}}</ref>\n\nRowling stated that after his death, Voldemort is forced to exist in the stunted infant-like form that Harry sees in the [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]]-like Limbo after his confrontation with Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Rowling also mentioned that, despite his extreme fear of death, he cannot become a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Ghosts|ghost]].<ref name=\"bloomsbury\">{{cite web |url=http://bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031070152/http://bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |title=Webchat with J.K.

Twenty-two years later, Delphi poses as Cedric's cousin and manipulates Harry and Ginny's second son [[Albus Severus Potter]] and his friend, Draco and [[Astoria Greengrass]]'s son [[Scorpius Malfoy]], into stealing a prototype Time Turner with which she hopes to resurrect her father. Using the Time Turner, Scorpius accidentally creates an alternative timeline where Voldemort killed Harry at the battle and now rules the wizarding world. In an attempt to achieve this future, Delphi travels to [[Godric's Hollow]] on the night Voldemort killed Harry's parents, hoping to avert the prophecy that led to her father's downfall. After receiving a message from his son, Harry, together with Ron, Hermione and Draco (who by now has become friends with Harry after they join forces to save their respective sons) transfigures himself into Voldemort so that he can distract Delphi, allowing them to overpower her. The real Voldemort kills Harry's parents as prophesied, and Delphi is sent to Azkaban.\n\n== Portrayals within films ==\n[[File:riddleinhogwarts.jpg|thumb|Young Tom in his fifth year at [[Hogwarts]] as played by [[Christian Coulson]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.]]\nVoldemort appears in seven [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], namely ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''. Several actors have portrayed him in his varying incarnations and ages.\n\nIn ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Voldemort's manifestation is as a face on the back of Quirrell's head, an effect achieved by computer generated imagery. [[Ian Hart]], the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort's face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart's voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart's playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence when he arrived at the home of James and Lily Potter to kill them. In this scene Voldemort is played by [[Richard Bremmer]],<ref name=\"mn-cast-confusion\">{{cite web | url=http://www.mugglenet.com/castpages/credits.shtml | title=Credit Confusion | publisher=MuggleNet | accessdate=7 January 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029190049/http://www.mugglenet.com/castpages/credits.shtml | archivedate=29 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> though his face is never seen.

By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by [[Ralph Fiennes]]. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears to be made of bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and his eyes are blue, because producer [[David Heyman]] felt that his evil would not be able to be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.\n\nFiennes stated that he had two weeks to shoot the climactic showdown scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by [[Daniel Radcliffe]]. Fiennes said with a chuckle: \"I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before.\" In preparation, he read the novel ''Goblet of Fire'', but jokingly conceded: \"I was only interested in my scene, and I had to go through thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until I got to my scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Fischer|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/fiennes.php |title=Ralph Fiennes for \"White Countess\" and \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" |website=[[Dark Horizons]]|date=21 October 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026014441/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/fiennes.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 October 2005 |accessdate=7 January 2007 }}</ref> Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''<ref name=\"oop-press-release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=176487|title=Helena Bonham Carter Joins the All-Star Cast and Nicholas Hooper Signs on to Compose the Score of Warner Bros.

The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union\".<ref name=\"AfterBook7\" />\n\nLike most archetypical villains, Voldemort's arrogance leads to his downfall. He also suffers from a [[thanatophobia|pathological fear of death]], which he regards as a shameful and ignominious human weakness. However, while he had many traits of a megalomaniac, he did not have all, as one common trait associated with megalomania and narcissists was shifting blame. Voldemort admitted he paid an expensive price in attacking the parents of Harry Potter, and carefully studied what went wrong when reorganizing his Death Eaters, ultimately placing the blame upon himself.

He disembodies himself when his Killing Curse targeting Harry rebounds on him, leaving the scar on Harry's forehead. In the books, and to a lesser extent in the films, Harry's scar serves as an indicator of Voldemort's presence: it burns when the Dark Lord is near or when Voldemort is feeling murderous or exultant.

They owned over half of the valley that the town of [[Little Hangleton]] lay in, and Thomas was the most prominent inhabitant of that town. They lived in a large house with fine gardens, but were unpopular amongst the local residents due to their snobbish attitudes. Tom, apparently the only child of Thomas and Mary, indulged in the typical pursuits of the upper class in the first half of the twentieth century, socialising with attractive women of his class, riding horses, and enjoying his status in the town.\n\nRowling revealed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' that young [[Merope Gaunt]] made efforts to get as close to Tom as she could, peering at him through the windows and bushes at every opportunity. Morfin noticed his sister's affection for Tom and hexed him as he rode by, covering him in hives. This breach of wizarding law, and the ensuing violent struggle with Ministry of Magic officials, led to Marvolo and Morfin being imprisoned in Azkaban. As surmised by Dumbledore, once Merope was alone and no longer dominated by her father, she could make her move for Tom. Merope offered Tom a drink laced with a love potion as he rode by one day without his attractive companion, Cecilia. He became infatuated with Merope and they eloped. Within three months of the marriage, Merope became pregnant. Merope decided to stop giving Tom the love potion, having come to the belief such enchantment of a man was tantamount to slavery. She also revealed her witch status to Tom, believing either that he had fallen in love with her on his own or he would at least stay for their unborn child. She was wrong, and Tom quickly left his pregnant wife and went home to his parents, claiming to have been \"hoodwinked\" and tricked into marrying Merope.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\" /> Tom Marvolo Riddle, their son, was born on 31 December 1926<ref name=\"voldbirthdatefaq\">[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=119 F.A.Q] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214193435/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=119 |date=14 February 2012 }}</ref> and was left to grow up in an orphanage, as Merope had died soon after giving birth.\n\nReaders first learn about the doom of the Riddles in the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.

The Riddles' gardener [[Frank Bryce]] was blamed for the murders in the [[Muggle]] world,<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch1\">{{HPref|book=4|chapter=1}}</ref> though he was never charged or tried, while in the wizarding world [[#Gaunt family|Morfin Gaunt]] was framed for them<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch17\" /> and died in Azkaban prison.\n\nIn the film adaptation of ''The Goblet of Fire'', Voldemort's grandparents were given the names Thomas and Mary Riddle.\n\n=== Gaunt family ===\nMost of the [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] of the '''House of Gaunt'''{{'}}s background occurs in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', through the medium of Dumbledore's [[Pensieve]]. The Gaunts were once a powerful and influential family, and are the last known descendants of [[Salazar Slytherin]]. However, an infamous vein of mental instability and violence that was reinforced by [[cousin marriage]]s intended to preserve the pureblood line had reduced them to poverty and squalor, as shown in the Pensieve's \"memory\" that Harry and Dumbledore witnessed. Like Salazar Slytherin, the Gaunts spoke Parseltongue. At the time of the story, the Gaunts owned hardly any assets save for a ramshackle shanty in Little Hangleton, which stood in a thicket in a valley opposite the Riddle House. Like the Riddles, the Gaunts were also unpopular with the local residents,\nbut for the opposite reason; their squalor was looked down upon and the vicious behavior of the Gaunt men earned them a reputation for being vulgar and intimidating.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\">{{HPref|book=6|chapter=10}}</ref>\n\n'''Marvolo''' Gaunt was the last Gaunt family patriarch. He was sentenced to a short term in [[Azkaban]] for his and his son's assault upon a [[Ministry of Magic]] official; this affected his health and he died soon after returning home. His [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] passed to his son, '''Morfin''' Gaunt, who was convicted of assaulting a Muggle, and later died in [[Azkaban]], convicted this time as a party to the murder of Tom Riddle Sr and Riddle's parents by his nephew.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch17\">{{HPref|book=6|chapter=17}}</ref> The real culprit was discovered much later by Dumbledore, who visited Morfin in Azkaban to gather information about Voldemort. After Dumbledore successfully extracted Morfin's memory of his encounter with his nephew, he tried to use the evidence to have Morfin released, but Morfin died before the decision could be made. Morfin being the last male Gaunt, the House of Gaunt ended with his death.\n\n'''Merope''' Gaunt ({{IPAc-en|m|\u025b|\u02c8|r|o\u028a|p|i}}) was the daughter of Marvolo, sister of Morfin. Harry's first impression of her was that she looked \"like the most defeated person he had ever seen\", probably because she lived in raggedness, squalour, and abuse. She married Tom Riddle Sr and became pregnant within three months of the wedding.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\" /> It is suggested that she tricked her husband into loving her by using a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Magic and love|love potion]], but when she became pregnant, she chose to stop administering the potion. It is implied that Merope had grown tired of living the lie and thought that her husband might have grown to love her, or that he might have stayed for the sake of their unborn child; however, he left her. Desperate, Merope wandered through the streets of London. The only thing she had left was the heavy gold locket that had once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, one of her family's most treasured items, which she sold for a small amount. When she was due to give birth, she stumbled into a [[Muggle]] orphanage, where she gave birth to her only son, '''Tom Marvolo Riddle'''. She died within the next hour.\n\n'''Gormlaith''' Gaunt was a 17th-century descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]], and like Salazar, a Parselmouth. Her wand was that which once belonged to Salazar himself. Educated at Hogwarts, Gormlaith lived in Ireland in the early 1600s. In about 1608, Gormlaith killed her estranged unnamed sister, and her sister's husband, William Sayre (a descendant of the Irish witch Morrigan), and kidnapped their five-year-old daughter, Isolt Sayre, raising her in the neighbouring valley of Coomcallee, or \"Hag's Glen\", because she felt that her parents' association with Muggles would badly influence Isolt. Fanatical and cruel, Gormlaith used Dark magic to isolate Isolt from others, forbade her a wand, and did not allow her to attend Hogwarts as she herself had, disgusted that it was now filled with Muggle-borns. After twelve years with Gormlaith, Isolt stole Gormlaith's wand and fled to the [[British America|Colonies]] and settled in [[Massachusetts]], where she founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Gormlaith learned of the school, she pursued her niece in Massachusetts, where she was killed by Isolt's friend, William the [[Pukwudgie]], with a venom-tipped arrow.<ref>[[Rowling, J.K.]] (28 June 2016).

K. Rowling]]'s series of ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels. Voldemort first appeared in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series except the third, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', in which he is only mentioned.\n\nVoldemort is the [[archenemy]] of [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], who according to a [[prophecy]] has \"the power to vanquish the [[Dark Lord]]\". He attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters|Lily]] and [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], and leaves Harry with a scar on his head in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as \"'''You-Know-Who'''\", \"'''He Who Must Not Be Named'''\", or \"'''the Dark Lord'''\". Voldemort's obsession with [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Blood purity|blood purity]] signifies his aim to rid the [[Wizarding World|wizarding world]] of [[Muggle]] (non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance. Through his mother's family, he is the last descendant of the wizard [[Salazar Slytherin]],<ref name=\"{{HP2}}ch17\">{{HPref|book=2|chapter=17}}</ref><ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch20\"/> one of the four founders of [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He is the leader of the [[Death Eater]]s, a group of evil wizards and witches dedicated to ridding the Wizarding World of Muggles and establishing Voldemort as its supreme ruler.\n\n== Character development ==\nIn a 1999 interview, Rowling said Voldemort was invented as a nemesis for Harry Potter, and she intentionally did not flesh out Voldemort's [[backstory]] at first. \"The basic idea [was that Harry] didn't know he was a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most [[evil]] wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry\u2014he tried to curse him. ... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And\u2014so\u2014but for some mysterious reason the curse didn't work on Harry.

In a 2000 interview with the [[BBC]], Rowling described Voldemort as a self-hating bully: \"Well I think it is often the case that the biggest bullies take what they know to be their own defects, as they see it, and they put them right on someone else and then they try and destroy the other and that's what Voldemort does.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm|title=JK Rowling talks about Book Four |publisher=cBBC Newsround |date= 4 March 2004|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> In the same year, Rowling became more precise about Voldemort.

Most characters in the novels refer to him as \"You-Know-Who\" or \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\" rather than say his name aloud. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', a \"taboo\" spell is placed upon the name, such that Voldemort or his followers may trace anyone who utters it. By this means, his followers eventually find and capture Harry and his friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. In the second book, Rowling reveals that ''I am Lord Voldemort'' is an anagram of the character's birth name, Tom Marvolo Riddle. According to the author, Voldemort's name is an invented word.<ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher|last=Lydon|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm|title=J.K.

This is not a place for fanboy cruft, but only a BRIEF retelling of above publishing information in a canonical form.\n-->\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' ===\n[[File:Voldemort in Movie 1.jpg|thumb|left|Voldemort on the back of [[Professor Quirrell]]'s head in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'']]\n\nVoldemort makes his debut in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''. In this story, Rowling introduces him as the Dark Lord who murdered Harry's parents, [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter|Lily]], but as a result of his mother's love and willingness to sacrifice herself for him, baby Harry survives when Voldemort tries to murder him with a [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]]. Voldemort is disembodied, and Harry carries a mysterious scar on his forehead as a result. In the book, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to regain his dissolved body by stealing the titular [[Sorcerer's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]. To achieve his objective, Voldemort uses [[Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell's]] aid by latching onto the back of the latter's head. However, at the climax of the book, Harry manages to prevent Voldemort from stealing the stone.\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' ===\nIn the second instalment, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', Rowling introduces Tom Marvolo Riddle, a manifestation of a teenage Voldemort that resides inside a magical diary found by [[Ginny Weasley]]. In this book, Ginny is written as a shy girl with a crush on Harry. Feeling anxious and lonely, she begins to write into the diary and shares her deepest fears with the sympathetic Tom. However, at the climax of the story, when Riddle rearranges the letters in his name to write \"I am Lord Voldemort\", Riddle is revealed as a magical manifestation of the boy who would later grow up to become the Dark Lord. Riddle states he has grown strong on Ginny's fears and eventually [[demonic possession|possesses]] her, using her as a pawn to unlock the [[Locations in Hogwarts#Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], whence a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]] is set free and petrifies several Hogwarts students. Harry defeats the manifestation of Riddle from the diary and the basilisk.<ref name=\"{{HP2}}ch17\"/> In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', [[Albus Dumbledore]] reveals to Harry that the diary was one of Voldemort's [[Horcruxes]].\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' ===\nVoldemort does not appear in the third book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', either in person or as a magical manifestation. He is, however, heard when Harry passes out from the harsh effects of a [[Dementors|Dementor]]. Towards the end of the story [[Sybill Trelawney]], the Divination professor, makes a rare genuine prophecy: \"The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight, the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant's aid, greater and more terrible than ever before. Tonight... before midnight... the servant... will set out... to rejoin... his master...\"<ref name=\"{{HP3}}ch16\">{{HPref|book=3|chapter=16}}</ref> Though it is initially implied that the prophecy refers to [[Sirius Black]], the book's ostensible antagonist, the servant is eventually revealed to be [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], who, for the 12 years since Voldemort's fall, has been disguised as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' ===\nIn the fourth instalment of the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', Voldemort appears at the start and the climax of the book. Rowling lets many seemingly unrelated plot elements fall into order. It is revealed that Voldemort's minion [[Barty Crouch Jr]], disguised as Hogwarts professor [[Mad-Eye Moody]], has manipulated the events of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] in Harry's favour. Voldemort's goal is to [[Teleportation|teleport]] Harry under Dumbledore's watch as a reluctant participant to the [[Little Hangleton]] graveyard, where the Riddle family is buried.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32333435\" /> Harry is captured and, after Pettigrew uses Harry's blood to fulfil a gruesome magical ritual, Voldemort regains his body and is restored to his full power.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32\">{{HPref|book=4}}</ref> For the first time in the series, Rowling describes his appearance: \"tall and skeletally thin\", with a face \"whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was as flat as a snake\u2019s with slits for nostrils\".<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32333435\" /> Rowling writes that his \"hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat's, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness\".<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch32333435\" /> It was revealed that, while in [[Albania]], Pettigrew had captured the [[Ministry of Magic]] official [[Minor Ministry officials in Harry Potter#Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]], who was [[torture]]d for information about the Ministry.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch1\" /> After they learned that Barty Crouch Jr, a faithful [[Death Eater]], had been smuggled out of [[Azkaban]] and was privately confined at his [[Barty Crouch Sr|father's]] house, they killed her. With Pettigrew's help, Voldemort creates a small, rudimentary body, corporeal enough to travel and perform magic, and formulated a plan to restore his own body by capturing Harry. A portion of the plan had been overheard by [[Frank Bryce]], a gardener, whom Voldemort then killed.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch1\" /> Voldemort then completes his plan and returns to life in his full body as a result of the ritual with Harry's blood. He then summons his Death Eaters to the graveyard to witness the death of Harry as he challenges Harry to a duel. However, when Voldemort duels Harry, their wands become magically locked together due to the twin Phoenix feather cores of the wands. Because of a phenomenon later revealed as [[Priori Incantatem]], ghost-like manifestations of Voldemort's most recent victims (including Harry's parents) then appear and distract Voldemort, allowing Harry just enough time to escape via [[Portkey]] with the body of fellow-student, [[Cedric Diggory]], who was murdered by Pettigrew on Voldemort's orders.<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch36\">{{HPref|book=4|chapter=36}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' ===\nVoldemort appears at the climax of the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', having again plotted against Harry.<ref name=\"{{HP5}}ch35\">{{HPref|book=5|chapter=35}}</ref> In this book, Harry goes through extreme emotional stress, and according to Rowling, it was necessary to prove that Harry is emotionally vulnerable and thus human, in contrast to his nemesis Voldemort, who is emotionally invulnerable and thus inhuman: \"[Harry is] a very ''human'' hero, and this is, obviously, there\u2019s a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately ''de''humanised himself.

He sends a group of Death Eaters to retrieve the prophecy, where the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] meets them. All but Bellatrix are captured, and Voldemort engages in a ferocious duel with Dumbledore. When Dumbledore gets the upper hand, Voldemort attempts to possess Harry but finds that he cannot; Harry is too full of that which Voldemort finds incomprehensible, and which he detests as weakness: love. Sensing that Dumbledore could win, Voldemort disapparates, but not before the Minister for Magic sees him in person, making his return to life public knowledge in the next book.\n\n=== ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' ===\nVoldemort does not appear in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', although his presence and actions are felt: he once again declares war, and begins to rise to power once more. He murders [[Amelia Bones]] of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix, including [[Emmeline Vance]].\n\nRowling uses several chapters as exposition to establish Voldemort's backstory. In a series of flashbacks, using the [[pensieve]] as a plot device, she reveals that Voldemort was the son of the witch [[Merope Gaunt]] and a Muggle called Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child's birth, soon after which Merope died.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\" /> After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch13\" /> Riddle was outwardly a model student, but was in reality a [[psychopath]] who took [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch17\" /> The book also discusses Riddle's hatred of \"[[Muggle]]s\", his obsession with [[Horcrux]]es, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch23\" /> Rowling stated Voldemort's conception under the influence of a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Magic and love|love potion]] symbolises the prejudicial circumstances under which he was brought into the world.<ref name=\"AfterBook7\">{{cite web|url=http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript\n| title=\"J.\" K. rowling web chat transcript|accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the main plot of the book, Voldemort's next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to attack Dumbledore. This is accomplished by [[Draco Malfoy]], who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch27\">{{HPref|book=6|chapter=27}}</ref> The cabinets allow Voldemort's Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered.

He finally locates the Elder Wand and steals it from Dumbledore's tomb.\n\nLater, Voldemort finds out that Harry and his friends are hunting and destroying his Horcruxes when informed of their heist on the Lestranges' vault at Gringotts in search for [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup|Hufflepuff's Cup]].<ref name=\"DH27\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=27}}</ref> After offering the occupants of Hogwarts mercy if they give up Harry, he assembles a large army and launches an invasion of the castle, where Harry is searching for [[Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem|Ravenclaw's Diadem]].<ref name=\"DH31\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=31}}</ref> Voldemort orders his pet snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] to execute Snape, believing it would make him the true master of the Elder Wand, since Snape killed Dumbledore.<ref name=\"DH32\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=32}}</ref> He then calls an hour's [[armistice]], in exchange for Harry.<ref name=\"DH34\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=34}}</ref> When Harry willingly walks into Voldemort's camp in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], Voldemort strikes him down with the Elder Wand.<ref name=\"DH34\" /> However, the use of Harry's blood to resurrect Voldemort's body proves to be a major setback: while Harry's blood runs in Voldemort's veins, Harry cannot be killed as his mother's protection lives on now in Voldemort too. Instead, Voldemort destroys the part of his own soul that resides in Harry's body. Voldemort forces [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to carry Harry's apparently lifeless body back to the castle as a trophy, sparking another battle during which Nagini, his last Horcrux, is destroyed by [[Neville Longbottom]]. The battle then moves into the Great Hall, where Voldemort fights [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], and [[Horace Slughorn]] simultaneously. Harry then reveals himself and explains to Voldemort that Draco became the true master of the Elder Wand when he disarmed Dumbledore; Harry, in turn, won the wand's allegiance when he took Draco's wand. Refusing to believe this, Voldemort casts the Killing Curse with the Elder Wand while Harry uses a Disarming Charm with Draco's, but the Elder Wand refuses to kill its master and the spell rebounds on Voldemort who, with all of his Horcruxes destroyed, finally dies. His body is laid in a different chamber from all the others who died battling him.<ref name=\"DH36\">{{HPref|book=7|chapter=36}}</ref>\n\nRowling stated that after his death, Voldemort is forced to exist in the stunted infant-like form that Harry sees in the [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]]-like Limbo after his confrontation with Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Rowling also mentioned that, despite his extreme fear of death, he cannot become a [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Ghosts|ghost]].<ref name=\"bloomsbury\">{{cite web |url=http://bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031070152/http://bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/content.asp?sec=3&sec2=1 |title=Webchat with J.K.

Twenty-two years later, Delphi poses as Cedric's cousin and manipulates Harry and Ginny's second son [[Albus Severus Potter]] and his friend, Draco and [[Astoria Greengrass]]'s son [[Scorpius Malfoy]], into stealing a prototype Time Turner with which she hopes to resurrect her father. Using the Time Turner, Scorpius accidentally creates an alternative timeline where Voldemort killed Harry at the battle and now rules the wizarding world. In an attempt to achieve this future, Delphi travels to [[Godric's Hollow]] on the night Voldemort killed Harry's parents, hoping to avert the prophecy that led to her father's downfall. After receiving a message from his son, Harry, together with Ron, Hermione and Draco (who by now has become friends with Harry after they join forces to save their respective sons) transfigures himself into Voldemort so that he can distract Delphi, allowing them to overpower her. The real Voldemort kills Harry's parents as prophesied, and Delphi is sent to Azkaban.\n\n== Portrayals within films ==\n[[File:riddleinhogwarts.jpg|thumb|Young Tom in his fifth year at [[Hogwarts]] as played by [[Christian Coulson]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.]]\nVoldemort appears in seven [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], namely ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''. Several actors have portrayed him in his varying incarnations and ages.\n\nIn ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Voldemort's manifestation is as a face on the back of Quirrell's head, an effect achieved by computer generated imagery. [[Ian Hart]], the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort's face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart's voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart's playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence when he arrived at the home of James and Lily Potter to kill them.

By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by [[Ralph Fiennes]]. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears to be made of bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and his eyes are blue, because producer [[David Heyman]] felt that his evil would not be able to be seen and would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.\n\nFiennes stated that he had two weeks to shoot the climactic showdown scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by [[Daniel Radcliffe]]. Fiennes said with a chuckle: \"I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before.\" In preparation, he read the novel ''Goblet of Fire'', but jokingly conceded: \"I was only interested in my scene, and I had to go through thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until I got to my scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Fischer|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/fiennes.php |title=Ralph Fiennes for \"White Countess\" and \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" |website=[[Dark Horizons]]|date=21 October 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026014441/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/fiennes.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 October 2005 |accessdate=7 January 2007 }}</ref> Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''<ref name=\"oop-press-release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=176487|title=Helena Bonham Carter Joins the All-Star Cast and Nicholas Hooper Signs on to Compose the Score of Warner Bros.

He also suffers from a [[thanatophobia|pathological fear of death]], which he regards as a shameful and ignominious human weakness. However, while he had many traits of a megalomaniac, he did not have all, as one common trait associated with megalomania and narcissists was shifting blame. Voldemort admitted he paid an expensive price in attacking the parents of Harry Potter, and carefully studied what went wrong when reorganizing his Death Eaters, ultimately placing the blame upon himself. According to Rowling, his [[Boggart (Harry Potter)|Boggart]] would be his own corpse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=\"Anelli, Melissa and Emerson Spartz. \"The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two,\" The Leaky Cauldron |date=16 July 2005}}</ref> Rowling also said that the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry accepts mortality, and thus Harry is in the end stronger than his nemesis.<ref name=\"AfterBook7\" />\n\n=== Magical abilities and skills ===\n\nRowling establishes Voldemort throughout the series as an extremely powerful, intelligent, and ruthless dark wizard, described as the greatest<ref>[[Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets]] Chapter 1 The Worst Birthday</ref> and most powerful Dark Wizard of all time.<ref>[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]] Chapter 2 The Scar</ref><ref>[https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/lord-voldemort Lord Voldemort-Pottermore]</ref> He is known as one of the greatest [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Legilimency and Occlumency|Legilimens]] in the world and a highly accomplished [[Magic (Harry Potter)#Legilimency and Occlumency|Occlumens]]; he can read minds and shield his own from penetration.

They owned over half of the valley that the town of [[Little Hangleton]] lay in, and Thomas was the most prominent inhabitant of that town. They lived in a large house with fine gardens, but were unpopular amongst the local residents due to their snobbish attitudes. Tom, apparently the only child of Thomas and Mary, indulged in the typical pursuits of the upper class in the first half of the twentieth century, socialising with attractive women of his class, riding horses, and enjoying his status in the town.\n\nRowling revealed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' that young [[Merope Gaunt]] made efforts to get as close to Tom as she could, peering at him through the windows and bushes at every opportunity. Morfin noticed his sister's affection for Tom and hexed him as he rode by, covering him in hives. This breach of wizarding law, and the ensuing violent struggle with Ministry of Magic officials, led to Marvolo and Morfin being imprisoned in Azkaban. As surmised by Dumbledore, once Merope was alone and no longer dominated by her father, she could make her move for Tom. Merope offered Tom a drink laced with a love potion as he rode by one day without his attractive companion, Cecilia. He became infatuated with Merope and they eloped. Within three months of the marriage, Merope became pregnant. Merope decided to stop giving Tom the love potion, having come to the belief such enchantment of a man was tantamount to slavery. She also revealed her witch status to Tom, believing either that he had fallen in love with her on his own or he would at least stay for their unborn child. She was wrong, and Tom quickly left his pregnant wife and went home to his parents, claiming to have been \"hoodwinked\" and tricked into marrying Merope.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\" /> Tom Marvolo Riddle, their son, was born on 31 December 1926<ref name=\"voldbirthdatefaq\">[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=119 F.A.Q] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214193435/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=119 |date=14 February 2012 }}</ref> and was left to grow up in an orphanage, as Merope had died soon after giving birth.\n\nReaders first learn about the doom of the Riddles in the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''. Tom Riddle, Esq. and his parents were murdered by Tom Marvolo Riddle. The Riddles' gardener [[Frank Bryce]] was blamed for the murders in the [[Muggle]] world,<ref name=\"{{HP4}}ch1\">{{HPref|book=4|chapter=1}}</ref> though he was never charged or tried, while in the wizarding world [[#Gaunt family|Morfin Gaunt]] was framed for them<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch17\" /> and died in Azkaban prison.\n\nIn the film adaptation of ''The Goblet of Fire'', Voldemort's grandparents were given the names Thomas and Mary Riddle.\n\n=== Gaunt family ===\nMost of the [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] of the '''House of Gaunt'''{{'}}s background occurs in ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', through the medium of Dumbledore's [[Pensieve]]. The Gaunts were once a powerful and influential family, and are the last known descendants of [[Salazar Slytherin]]. However, an infamous vein of mental instability and violence that was reinforced by [[cousin marriage]]s intended to preserve the pureblood line had reduced them to poverty and squalor, as shown in the Pensieve's \"memory\" that Harry and Dumbledore witnessed. Like Salazar Slytherin, the Gaunts spoke Parseltongue. At the time of the story, the Gaunts owned hardly any assets save for a ramshackle shanty in Little Hangleton, which stood in a thicket in a valley opposite the Riddle House. Like the Riddles, the Gaunts were also unpopular with the local residents,\nbut for the opposite reason; their squalor was looked down upon and the vicious behavior of the Gaunt men earned them a reputation for being vulgar and intimidating.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\">{{HPref|book=6|chapter=10}}</ref>\n\n'''Marvolo''' Gaunt was the last Gaunt family patriarch. He was sentenced to a short term in [[Azkaban]] for his and his son's assault upon a [[Ministry of Magic]] official; this affected his health and he died soon after returning home. His [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] passed to his son, '''Morfin''' Gaunt, who was convicted of assaulting a Muggle, and later died in [[Azkaban]], convicted this time as a party to the murder of Tom Riddle Sr and Riddle's parents by his nephew.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch17\">{{HPref|book=6|chapter=17}}</ref> The real culprit was discovered much later by Dumbledore, who visited Morfin in Azkaban to gather information about Voldemort. After Dumbledore successfully extracted Morfin's memory of his encounter with his nephew, he tried to use the evidence to have Morfin released, but Morfin died before the decision could be made. Morfin being the last male Gaunt, the House of Gaunt ended with his death.\n\n'''Merope''' Gaunt ({{IPAc-en|m|\u025b|\u02c8|r|o\u028a|p|i}}) was the daughter of Marvolo, sister of Morfin. Harry's first impression of her was that she looked \"like the most defeated person he had ever seen\", probably because she lived in raggedness, squalour, and abuse. She married Tom Riddle Sr and became pregnant within three months of the wedding.<ref name=\"{{HP6}}ch10\" /> It is suggested that she tricked her husband into loving her by using a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Magic and love|love potion]], but when she became pregnant, she chose to stop administering the potion. It is implied that Merope had grown tired of living the lie and thought that her husband might have grown to love her, or that he might have stayed for the sake of their unborn child; however, he left her. Desperate, Merope wandered through the streets of London. The only thing she had left was the heavy gold locket that had once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, one of her family's most treasured items, which she sold for a small amount. When she was due to give birth, she stumbled into a [[Muggle]] orphanage, where she gave birth to her only son, '''Tom Marvolo Riddle'''. She died within the next hour.\n\n'''Gormlaith''' Gaunt was a 17th-century descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]], and like Salazar, a Parselmouth. Her wand was that which once belonged to Salazar himself. Educated at Hogwarts, Gormlaith lived in Ireland in the early 1600s. In about 1608, Gormlaith killed her estranged unnamed sister, and her sister's husband, William Sayre (a descendant of the Irish witch Morrigan), and kidnapped their five-year-old daughter, Isolt Sayre, raising her in the neighbouring valley of Coomcallee, or \"Hag's Glen\", because she felt that her parents' association with Muggles would badly influence Isolt. Fanatical and cruel, Gormlaith used Dark magic to isolate Isolt from others, forbade her a wand, and did not allow her to attend Hogwarts as she herself had, disgusted that it was now filled with Muggle-borns. After twelve years with Gormlaith, Isolt stole Gormlaith's wand and fled to the [[British America|Colonies]] and settled in [[Massachusetts]], where she founded the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Gormlaith learned of the school, she pursued her niece in Massachusetts, where she was killed by Isolt's friend, William the [[Pukwudgie]], with a venom-tipped arrow.<ref>[[Rowling, J.K.]] (28 June 2016).
