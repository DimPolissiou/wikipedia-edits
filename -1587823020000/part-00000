They play this game and happily live their life.\n\nLaachi gets a chance to sing a song and make some money. Due to financial difficulties, she ends up singing and dancing with family's approval.  During that time, a famous singer Ajitpal Singh sees Laachi and signs her up with him.

Loser tradus din englez\u0103 in rusa \u00eenseamn\u0103 koncin\u00eei\n\n==Plot==\nPaul Tannek ([[Jason Biggs]]), a small-town, intelligent kid from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] is accepted into [[New York University]] on an academic scholarship. Trying to follow the advice of his father ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) he tries to gain friends by trying to be polite and interested in others. His attempts are noticed by his new roommates Chris ([[Thomas Sadoski]]), Adam ([[Zak Orth]]) and Noah ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), three rich, spoiled, obnoxious city boys who consider his polite behavior, [[working class]] background and determination for education lame and brand him a loser. To salvage their reputation, the trio concoct a false story to the housing administration about Paul\u2019s attitude and have him thrown out of the dorm. Paul takes residence in a veterinary hospital. Chris meets Paul and again concocts another story about how they were trying to help him as a ploy for Paul to let them use the hospital to throw parties since a resident at the dorm fell into sickness due to excessive alcohol, forbidding them to hold any parties thereon.\n\nPaul meets classmate Dora Diamond ([[Mena Suvari]]) and develops an attraction to her, unaware that she is having an affair with their decorated but highly pretentious English professor Edward Alcott ([[Greg Kinnear]]). Dora is equally as intelligent as Paul but doesn't have a scholarship and works shifts as a waitress in a strip club to pay for her tuition until she is unceremoniously fired. To avoid a long daily commute which she can no longer afford, Dora asks Alcott to let her live with him for a while to which he selfishly declines for fear of losing his tenure at the university if their relationship is found out. Paul and Dora bump into each other one night and Paul invites her to an [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] concert after discovering when they met that she is a fan. Dora agrees to the date, but first goes to a job interview for a night shift in a convenience store, but is denied the position because she's a woman. Adam is at the same store buying beer and pretends to be sympathetic as a ploy to invite her to a party which she accepts, but says she will be there only for a short time so she can meet Paul. At the party, one of the boys slips a roofie into Dora's drink and she passes out. Paul returns dejected from the concert to a huge mess and an unresponsive Dora and immediately rushes her to the hospital. At the hospital, Paul pretends to be her boyfriend since neither he or Dora can afford to keep her there overnight. He also learns that Dora listed Alcott as her case of emergency contact which he tells Chris the next morning without thinking. Alcott tells emergency officials he doesn't really know her when they contact him. \n\nPaul bonds with Dora as she recovers and they start to develop feelings for one another; he also learns that Dora cannot see past her blind infatuation with Alcott even when she says even though he loves her, he doesn't want a relationship. While Paul continues with his studies, Dora searches for a new job. She pulls Paul out of class and invites him out to celebrate receiving a spot in a medical experiment. They steal a loaf of bread from a bakery, coffee from a dispenser in the park and sneak into a Broadway show. Paul goes out to grab a pizza and a movie for both of them hoping it may lead to something further between them only to return to find Alcott with Dora and learning that Alcott has changed his mind about Dora living with him. Alcott reveals to Dora that Chris, Noah and Adam are blackmailing him with the knowledge of their relationship in return for a passing grade on their transcript and also tells her that he believes Paul is in on it. After discovering roofies were involved at the party, Paul steals Noah's supply and replaces them with placebos. Paul then pays a visit to Alcott's office to ask how Dora is doing and is instead given his final exam as a take-home test by Alcott to buy his silence, Paul takes the moral high ground and refuses the test, jeopardizing his scholarship and place in the university.\n\nDora, since living with Alcott, has become his errand-girl and overhears Paul on the phone with his father talking about how much he misses her. Alcott then admits he learned that Paul had nothing to do with the blackmail, but still intends to fail him. Dora then realizes that Paul is the one who really loves her and terminates her affair with Alcott, beginning a relationship with Paul. Afterwards, Adam, Noah, and Chris' behavior get the better of them and their lives plummet into failure, Alcott is found out and sent to prison for having an affair with a different student who is underage, and Paul and Dora remain happy in their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Paul Tannek\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Dora Diamond\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Professor Edward Alcott\n* [[Zak Orth]] as Adam\n* [[Thomas Sadoski|Tom Sadoski]] as Chris\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Noah\n* [[Bobby Slayton]] as Sal\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Mr. Tannek\n* [[Twink Caplan]] as Gena\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Professor\n* [[Robert Miano]] as Victor\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Dog-loving girl\n* [[Stuart Cornfeld]] as Foreman\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Photographer\n* [[Catherine Black (actress)|Catherine Black]] as Military jacket girl\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Bar dude\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Office clerk\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Homeless woman\n* [[David Spade]] as Video store clerk\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Himself/[[Emcee]] (in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'')\n* [[Brian Backer]] as Doctor\n* [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] ([[Art Alexakis]], [[Greg Eklund]], and [[Craig Montoya]]) as themselves\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Critics|Critical response}} \nThe film received negative reviews.

Trying to follow the advice of his father ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) he tries to gain friends by trying to be polite and interested in others. His attempts are noticed by his new roommates Chris ([[Thomas Sadoski]]), Adam ([[Zak Orth]]) and Noah ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), three rich, spoiled, obnoxious city boys who consider his polite behavior, [[working class]] background and determination for education lame and brand him a loser. To salvage their reputation, the trio concoct a false story to the housing administration about Paul\u2019s attitude and have him thrown out of the dorm. Paul takes residence in a veterinary hospital. Chris meets Paul and again concocts another story about how they were trying to help him as a ploy for Paul to let them use the hospital to throw parties since a resident at the dorm fell into sickness due to excessive alcohol, forbidding them to hold any parties thereon.\n\nPaul meets classmate Dora Diamond ([[Mena Suvari]]) and develops an attraction to her, unaware that she is having an affair with their decorated but highly pretentious English professor Edward Alcott ([[Greg Kinnear]]). Dora is equally as intelligent as Paul but doesn't have a scholarship and works shifts as a waitress in a strip club to pay for her tuition until she is unceremoniously fired. To avoid a long daily commute which she can no longer afford, Dora asks Alcott to let her live with him for a while to which he selfishly declines for fear of losing his tenure at the university if their relationship is found out. Paul and Dora bump into each other one night and Paul invites her to an [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] concert after discovering when they met that she is a fan. Dora agrees to the date, but first goes to a job interview for a night shift in a convenience store, but is denied the position because she's a woman. Adam is at the same store buying beer and pretends to be sympathetic as a ploy to invite her to a party which she accepts, but says she will be there only for a short time so she can meet Paul. At the party, one of the boys slips a roofie into Dora's drink and she passes out. Paul returns dejected from the concert to a huge mess and an unresponsive Dora and immediately rushes her to the hospital. At the hospital, Paul pretends to be her boyfriend since neither he or Dora can afford to keep her there overnight. He also learns that Dora listed Alcott as her case of emergency contact which he tells Chris the next morning without thinking. Alcott tells emergency officials he doesn't really know her when they contact him. \n\nPaul bonds with Dora as she recovers and they start to develop feelings for one another; he also learns that Dora cannot see past her blind infatuation with Alcott even when she says even though he loves her, he doesn't want a relationship. While Paul continues with his studies, Dora searches for a new job. She pulls Paul out of class and invites him out to celebrate receiving a spot in a medical experiment. They steal a loaf of bread from a bakery, coffee from a dispenser in the park and sneak into a Broadway show. Paul goes out to grab a pizza and a movie for both of them hoping it may lead to something further between them only to return to find Alcott with Dora and learning that Alcott has changed his mind about Dora living with him. Alcott reveals to Dora that Chris, Noah and Adam are blackmailing him with the knowledge of their relationship in return for a passing grade on their transcript and also tells her that he believes Paul is in on it. After discovering roofies were involved at the party, Paul steals Noah's supply and replaces them with placebos. Paul then pays a visit to Alcott's office to ask how Dora is doing and is instead given his final exam as a take-home test by Alcott to buy his silence, Paul takes the moral high ground and refuses the test, jeopardizing his scholarship and place in the university.\n\nDora, since living with Alcott, has become his errand-girl and overhears Paul on the phone with his father talking about how much he misses her. Alcott then admits he learned that Paul had nothing to do with the blackmail, but still intends to fail him. Dora then realizes that Paul is the one who really loves her and terminates her affair with Alcott, beginning a relationship with Paul. Afterwards, Adam, Noah, and Chris' behavior get the better of them and their lives plummet into failure, Alcott is found out and sent to prison for having an affair with a different student who is underage, and Paul and Dora remain happy in their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Paul Tannek\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Dora Diamond\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Professor Edward Alcott\n* [[Zak Orth]] as Adam\n* [[Thomas Sadoski|Tom Sadoski]] as Chris\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Noah\n* [[Bobby Slayton]] as Sal\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Mr. Tannek\n* [[Twink Caplan]] as Gena\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Professor\n* [[Robert Miano]] as Victor\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Dog-loving girl\n* [[Stuart Cornfeld]] as Foreman\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Photographer\n* [[Catherine Black (actress)|Catherine Black]] as Military jacket girl\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Bar dude\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Office clerk\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Homeless woman\n* [[David Spade]] as Video store clerk\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Himself/[[Emcee]] (in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'')\n* [[Brian Backer]] as Doctor\n* [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] ([[Art Alexakis]], [[Greg Eklund]], and [[Craig Montoya]]) as themselves\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Critics|Critical response}} \nThe film received negative reviews.

She is best known for being a former member of the group [[Sugababes]]. Range was an original member of girl group [[Atomic Kitten]], although she left the group two years before releasing any material. In 2001, Range replaced [[Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy]] of the Sugababes and had accumulated six UK number one singles as well as two number one studio albums with the group before splitting in 2011. Range has since concentrated on theatre work.\n\n==History==\nIn 1997, Range auditioned for a part in the group [[Scooch]], but was rejected as she was too young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a136982/sugababe-heidi-i-auditioned-for-scooch.html |title=Sugababe Heidi: 'I auditioned for Scooch' \u2013 Music News |work=Digital Spy |date=28 November 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> Instead, she joined [[Atomic Kitten]], a girl group founded by [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]] frontman [[Andy McCluskey]], along with [[Liz McClarnon]] and [[Kerry Katona]]. She recorded several demos and the intended debut album with the group. In 1999 Range decided to leave the group after 8 months  wanting to pursue a more R&B style of music instead of the pop music Atomic Kitten were making and was therefore replaced with [[Natasha Hamilton]].\n\nHaving already started work on a second album with new member Range, Sugababes looked for a new record label, eventually signing to [[Island Records]]. Their first single on the new label, \"[[Freak like Me]]\" scored the group their first UK number 1 single. Follow-up single \"[[Round Round]]\" also debuted on top of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and peaked at number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand. Both singles were certified silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]].<ref name=BPI-platinum>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinum.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208011800/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinum.html |date=8 February 2009 }}</ref> On the back of the success of the singles, the group's second album, ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces (Sugababes album)|Angels with Dirty Faces]]'', debuted at number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was later certified triple platinum, selling almost a million copies in the UK alone.<ref name=BPI-platinum/><ref name=MW-Nov2008>Music Week, 1 November 2008; CHARTS ANALYSIS: AC/DC don't mind the gap after twenty eight years.

She is best known for being a former member of the group [[Sugababes]]. Range was an original member of girl group [[Atomic Kitten]], although she left the group two years before releasing any material. In 2001, Range replaced [[Siobh\u00e1n Donaghy]] of the Sugababes and had accumulated six UK number one singles as well as two number one studio albums with the group before splitting in 2011. Range has since concentrated on theatre work.\n\n==History==\nIn 1997, Range auditioned for a part in the group [[Scooch]], but was rejected as she was too young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a136982/sugababe-heidi-i-auditioned-for-scooch.html |title=Sugababe Heidi: 'I auditioned for Scooch' \u2013 Music News |work=Digital Spy |date=28 November 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> Instead, she joined [[Atomic Kitten]], a girl group founded by [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]] frontman [[Andy McCluskey]], along with [[Liz McClarnon]] and [[Kerry Katona]]. She recorded several demos and the intended debut album with the group. In 1999 Range decided to leave the group after 8 months  wanting to pursue a more R&B style of music instead of the pop music Atomic Kitten were making and was therefore replaced with [[Natasha Hamilton]].\n\nHaving already started work on a second album with new member Range, Sugababes looked for a new record label, eventually signing to [[Island Records]]. Their first single on the new label, \"[[Freak like Me]]\" scored the group their first UK number 1 single. Follow-up single \"[[Round Round]]\" also debuted on top of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and peaked at number 2 in Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand.

It also aired on weekdays in the school holidays. The slot had a separate [[station identification]] [[Digital On-screen Graphic|on screen graphic]] from Channel 4 and E4. Channel 4 originally produced the strand in-house until 2002, when production was passed onto independent companies. The slot was targeted at the 16-34 age group.\n\nUntil 25 March 2012, T4 aired on Channel 4 both Saturday and Sunday, however, to make way for the introduction of ''[[Sunday Brunch]]'' in March 2012, T4 Sunday was moved to run on E4; T4 Saturday remained on Channel 4, and some programmes that previously appeared within the T4 block, such as ''The Simpsons'', remained on Channel 4 on Sunday afternoons.<ref>[http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/t4-sundays-set-to-move-to-e4/5038218.article T4 Sundays set to move to E4] Balihar Khalsa, Broadcast Now, 17 February 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.imediamonkey.com/t4-to-move-to-e4-to-make-room-for-sunday-brunch/ T4 to move to E4 to make room for ''Sunday Brunch''] Anna Howell, iMedia Monkey, 17 February 2012</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 2012, Channel 4 announced that they would be axing T4 at the end of December 2012.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a430400/channel-4-axes-t4-brand.html Channel 4 axes T4 brand] Digital Spy, 12 October 2012</ref> The show ended on 29 December 2012.\n\n==Early history==\nEarly on in T4's run, programmes aimed at children often aired in addition to the content aimed at older viewers, with shows such as ''[[CatDog]]'' and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]'' appearing in the early schedule of the strand. Around 2001, this was dropped and the strand refocused entirely towards the teen/youth market. For the first few months of T4's life, its idents consisted of an animated spaceman like character. In 1999, this character instead appeared on the idents during the early morning pre-school shows, in addition to the weekend children's programmes that fell outside the T4 strand. These idents continued in use until 2004.\n\n===T4 on E4, 2001===\nAfter E4's launch in 2001, T4 initially also had a slot on the channel. However, this was short lived. They also had an equally short lived Friday evening slot on Channel 4. Following the sale of ''[[Quiz Call]]'' by Channel 4, it was rumoured that a T4 channel was one of the proposals to fill the vacant slot on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] (and subsequently on satellite and cable). However, the plan is also thought to have been rejected by director of television [[Kevin Lygo]], as the slot was filled by [[Film4|Film4 +1]] (now replaced, in turn, by [[Channel 4|Channel 4 +1]]).\n\n==Later years==\nInitially broadcast only on Sundays, the success of T4 saw the strand subsequently extended to include a Saturday block.\n\nIn more recent years, T4 had provided Channel 4 a broadcast window of programmes that are also broadcast in primetime slots on E4, such as ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''. In addition, following Channel 4's acquisition of terrestrial broadcast rights to ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the series began to feature regularly within T4. ''[[Friends]]'' featured regularly within T4 until Channel 4 relinquished the rights to the sitcom in 2011.\n\n[[Vernon Kay]], [[Dermot O'Leary]], [[Miquita Oliver]] and [[Alexa Chung]] returned for the last show on 29 December 2012 alongside current presenters [[Matt Edmondson]], [[Nick Grimshaw]], [[Jameela Jamil]], Georgie Okell and Will Best.\n\n==T4 on the Beach==\n{{main|T4 on the Beach}}\nT4 also staged an annual summer festival, ''[[T4 on the Beach]]'', in the resort of [[Weston-super-Mare]] (for its first two years in 2003 and 2004, it was held in [[Great Yarmouth]] under the name ''Pop Beach''), and previous musical acts that have appeared include [[McFly (band)|McFly]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Little Boots]], and [[The Zutons]]. The concert in July 2010 was the sixth year running that the event had taken place in [[Weston-super-Mare]] which featured [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Florence and the Machine]], among others.\n\n==T4 ''Stars of...''==\nNormally bookended at the tail end of the year, T4 \u2018Stars Of\u2026\u2019 broadcast live from [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]]. The event was first held in 2009 and since then had become an annual fixture in the T4 events calendar. The ''Stars Of...'' title usually preceded the year in which it was being held e.g. ''Stars of 2010'', as it was widely regarded as the replacement show for the now defunct ''[[Smash Hits Poll Winners Party]]'' that T4 broadcast from 2001 to 2005.\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-3}}\n'''2009 line-up'''\n*[[Kasabian]]\n*[[JLS]]\n*[[Sugababes]]\n*[[La Roux]]\n*[[Calvin Harris]]\n*[[N-Dubz]]\n*[[Alexandra Burke]]\n*[[Florence and the Machine]]\n*[[Example (musician)|Example]]\n*[[Ke$ha]]\n*[[Paloma Faith]]\n*[[The Saturdays]]\n*[[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]]\n*[[Tinchy Stryder]]\n{{col-3}}\n'''2010 line-up'''\n*[[Alexandra Burke]]\n*[[Tinie Tempah]]\n*[[Pixie Lott]]\n*[[Professor Green]]\n*Example\n*[[Ellie Goulding]]\n*[[N-Dubz]]\n*[[Olly Murs]]\n*[[JLS]]\n*[[The Wanted]]\n*[[Mark Ronson]]\n*[[Jason Derulo]]\n*[[The Saturdays]]\n*[[Roll Deep]]\n*[[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]\n{{col-3}}\n'''2011 line-up'''\n*[[Labrinth]]\n*[[Matt Cardle]]\n*[[Emeli Sand\u00e9]]\n*[[Cher Lloyd]]\n*[[Rizzle Kicks]]\n*Tinchy Stryder\n*[[Dappy]]\n*Example\n*[[Pixie Lott]]\n*[[Ed Sheeran]]\n*[[Wretch 32]]\n*The Wanted\n*Professor Green\n*[[DJ Fresh]]\n{{col end}}\n\n==Presenters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It also aired on weekdays in the school holidays. The slot had a separate [[station identification]] [[Digital On-screen Graphic|on screen graphic]] from Channel 4 and E4. Channel 4 originally produced the strand in-house until 2002, when production was passed onto independent companies. The slot was targeted at the 16-34 age group.\n\nUntil 25 March 2012, T4 aired on Channel 4 both Saturday and Sunday, however, to make way for the introduction of ''[[Sunday Brunch]]'' in March 2012, T4 Sunday was moved to run on E4; T4 Saturday remained on Channel 4, and some programmes that previously appeared within the T4 block, such as ''The Simpsons'', remained on Channel 4 on Sunday afternoons.<ref>[http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/t4-sundays-set-to-move-to-e4/5038218.article T4 Sundays set to move to E4] Balihar Khalsa, Broadcast Now, 17 February 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.imediamonkey.com/t4-to-move-to-e4-to-make-room-for-sunday-brunch/ T4 to move to E4 to make room for ''Sunday Brunch''] Anna Howell, iMedia Monkey, 17 February 2012</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 2012, Channel 4 announced that they would be axing T4 at the end of December 2012.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a430400/channel-4-axes-t4-brand.html Channel 4 axes T4 brand] Digital Spy, 12 October 2012</ref> The show ended on 29 December 2012.\n\n==Early history==\nEarly on in T4's run, programmes aimed at children often aired in addition to the content aimed at older viewers, with shows such as ''[[CatDog]]'' and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]'' appearing in the early schedule of the strand. Around 2001, this was dropped and the strand refocused entirely towards the teen/youth market. For the first few months of T4's life, its idents consisted of an animated spaceman like character. In 1999, this character instead appeared on the idents during the early morning pre-school shows, in addition to the weekend children's programmes that fell outside the T4 strand. These idents continued in use until 2004.\n\n===T4 on E4, 2001===\nAfter E4's launch in 2001, T4 initially also had a slot on the channel. However, this was short lived. They also had an equally short lived Friday evening slot on Channel 4. Following the sale of ''[[Quiz Call]]'' by Channel 4, it was rumoured that a T4 channel was one of the proposals to fill the vacant slot on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] (and subsequently on satellite and cable). However, the plan is also thought to have been rejected by director of television [[Kevin Lygo]], as the slot was filled by [[Film4|Film4 +1]] (now replaced, in turn, by [[Channel 4|Channel 4 +1]]).\n\n==Later years==\nInitially broadcast only on Sundays, the success of T4 saw the strand subsequently extended to include a Saturday block.\n\nIn more recent years, T4 had provided Channel 4 a broadcast window of programmes that are also broadcast in primetime slots on E4, such as ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''. In addition, following Channel 4's acquisition of terrestrial broadcast rights to ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the series began to feature regularly within T4. ''[[Friends]]'' featured regularly within T4 until Channel 4 relinquished the rights to the sitcom in 2011.\n\n[[Vernon Kay]], [[Dermot O'Leary]], [[Miquita Oliver]] and [[Alexa Chung]] returned for the last show on 29 December 2012 alongside current presenters [[Matt Edmondson]], [[Nick Grimshaw]], [[Jameela Jamil]], Georgie Okell and Will Best.\n\n==T4 on the Beach==\n{{main|T4 on the Beach}}\nT4 also staged an annual summer festival, ''[[T4 on the Beach]]'', in the resort of [[Weston-super-Mare]] (for its first two years in 2003 and 2004, it was held in [[Great Yarmouth]] under the name ''Pop Beach''), and previous musical acts that have appeared include [[McFly (band)|McFly]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Little Boots]], and [[The Zutons]]. The concert in July 2010 was the sixth year running that the event had taken place in [[Weston-super-Mare]] which featured [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Florence and the Machine]], among others.\n\n==T4 ''Stars of...''==\nNormally bookended at the tail end of the year, T4 \u2018Stars Of\u2026\u2019 broadcast live from [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]]. The event was first held in 2009 and since then had become an annual fixture in the T4 events calendar. The ''Stars Of...'' title usually preceded the year in which it was being held e.g. ''Stars of 2010'', as it was widely regarded as the replacement show for the now defunct ''[[Smash Hits Poll Winners Party]]'' that T4 broadcast from 2001 to 2005.\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-3}}\n'''2009 line-up'''\n*[[Kasabian]]\n*[[JLS]]\n*[[Sugababes]]\n*[[La Roux]]\n*[[Calvin Harris]]\n*[[N-Dubz]]\n*[[Alexandra Burke]]\n*[[Florence and the Machine]]\n*[[Example (musician)|Example]]\n*[[Ke$ha]]\n*[[Paloma Faith]]\n*[[The Saturdays]]\n*[[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]]\n*[[Tinchy Stryder]]\n{{col-3}}\n'''2010 line-up'''\n*[[Alexandra Burke]]\n*[[Tinie Tempah]]\n*[[Pixie Lott]]\n*[[Professor Green]]\n*Example\n*[[Ellie Goulding]]\n*[[N-Dubz]]\n*[[Olly Murs]]\n*[[JLS]]\n*[[The Wanted]]\n*[[Mark Ronson]]\n*[[Jason Derulo]]\n*[[The Saturdays]]\n*[[Roll Deep]]\n*[[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]\n{{col-3}}\n'''2011 line-up'''\n*[[Labrinth]]\n*[[Matt Cardle]]\n*[[Emeli Sand\u00e9]]\n*[[Cher Lloyd]]\n*[[Rizzle Kicks]]\n*Tinchy Stryder\n*[[Dappy]]\n*Example\n*[[Pixie Lott]]\n*[[Ed Sheeran]]\n*[[Wretch 32]]\n*The Wanted\n*Professor Green\n*[[DJ Fresh]]\n{{col end}}\n\n==Presenters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
