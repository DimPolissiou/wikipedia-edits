The Coast Guard noted that the LCS has previously performed this task, and pointed towards its high speed and embarked helicopters to run down fast smuggling boats; the Navy plans to base 10 ''Freedom''-class ships at Naval Station Mayport, Florida which could be tasked to conduct interdiction missions.<ref>[http://www.seapowermagazine.org/stories/20141204-lcs-drug.html Coast Guard Admiral: LCS \u2018an Incredible Ship\u2019 for Drug Interdiction] - Seapowermagazine.org, 4 December 2014</ref>\n\n==Developmental history==\n\n===Background===\nDuring the late 1990s, the U.S. Navy realized its [[Cold War]]-era cruisers and destroyers had been designed for open-ocean warfare, and would be vulnerable in shallow coastal waters, where they would face dangers from high-speed boats, missile-firing fast-attack craft, small submarines, sea mines, and land and air-launched anti-ship missiles. The Navy's official solution was the [[DD-21]], a large coastal warship that could absorb hits. Two Navy strategists, retired Captain Wayne Hughes and Vice Admiral Art Cebrowski, refined an opposing ''Streetfighter'' concept for a 1,000-ton small, specialized, and heavily armed vessel costing just $90 million (2001 dollars). Being small, light and numerous, the Streetfighter was envisioned as a \"single-serving\" ship to be abandoned once hit, made possible by its low cost. The concept of a manned expendable warship was contentious and the idea was not picked up. When [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was made Secretary of Defense in early 2001, he promised transformational approaches and doing jobs with fewer people. In October 2001, Cebrowski was assigned to head the Pentagon's new Office of Force Transformation, shortly after which Admiral [[Vernon Clark]] cancelled the DD-21 and replaced it with a \"family\" of ships, including the littoral combat ship, being motivated to produce ships cheaper and faster to increase fleet size. Clark declared the LCS was his \"most transformational effort\" and number-one budget priority in 2003.<ref name=\"wired3aug11\">[https://www.wired.com/2011/08/future-warship-ran-aground/all/ How the Navy\u2019s Warship of the Future Ran Aground] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917032140/https://www.wired.com/2011/08/future-warship-ran-aground/all/ |date=17 September 2017 }} - Wired.com, 3 August 2011</ref>\n\nThe Navy committed to the $15 billion (2003) program in advance of rigorous analysis or clearly defined purpose, appearance, or survivability. Proponents typically pointed to its speed, asymmetric littoral threats, and impact on the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The LCS suffered from requirements creep, adding more missions and equipment, potentially rendering it too complex and expensive to use. When it was decided the ship would not be expendable, the original concept of a small, cheap, simple coastal warship became bigger, more expensive, and more complicated; with a smaller crew due to automation. The task force assigned six different missions which had been previously performed by individual ships: submarine and mine hunting; combating small boats; intelligence gathering; transporting special forces; and counter-drug and piracy patrols. Each ship would be big enough to sail across the Pacific alone, embark a helicopter, have a minimum 40 knot top speed, and cost $220 million. The Navy was only willing to build one type of ship, the task force, realized it was virtually impossible for one vessel to fill all roles, advocated a large hull to cover the mission range through modularity, organic combat power, and unmanned systems. Empty space was left for weapon and sensor mission modules costing $150 million. When the first production contracts were awarded in 2004, no mission module worked outside of a laboratory. Fast, cheap construction was emphasized, solving problems with technology.<ref name=\"wired3aug11\"/>\n\n[[File:USS Freedom (LCS 1), the crew mans the rails.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Freedom|LCS-1|2}}, the first LCS, on commissioning day]]\nIn 2003, the Navy launched its first experimental LCS, ''[[Sea Fighter]]'', designated as fast sea frame or FSF-1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicholsboats.com/x-craft.htm |title=Sea Fighter (X-Craft) |publisher=Nicholsboats.com |accessdate=8 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430003420/http://www.nicholsboats.com/x-craft.htm |archivedate=30 April 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2005, the [[Small waterplane area twin hull|SWATH]]-hulled ''Sea Fighter'' entered service as an experimental vessel using mission modules.<ref>{{cite press release |author=Journalist 3rd Class (SW) Nick Young, Fleet Public Affairs Center, Pacific |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=19463 |title=Navy Sea Fighter Makes San Diego Home |id=NNS050803-02 |publisher=Navy News Service |accessdate=8 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217101116/http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=19463 |archive-date=17 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> As the ''Oliver Hazard Perry'', {{sclass-|Osprey|minehunter|5}}, and the {{sclass-|Avenger|mine countermeasures ship|5}} classes were reaching the end of their lives, the U.S. Navy released the LCS requirement.

Detractors claim the LCS is not survivable enough for long-range threats that China possesses; LCS ships are built to the Navy's survivability category Level I+, higher than Level I patrol craft and mine warfare ships, but lower than the Level II ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class frigate they are replacing.

The Navy requires the class' roles of counter-mine, anti-submarine, and surface warfare provided by modules.

The SSC shall have an improved 3D air defense radar, air defense decoys, better electronic warfare system, over-the-horizon anti-ship missiles, multi-function towed array sonar, torpedo defenses, additional armor, and displace less than Flight 0 vessels. The SSC will focus on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare; mine countermeasures will be handled by existing LCS ships. Although not designed for modularity, it will maintain the ability to carry mission modules and LCS mission package equipment, including 30&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm cannons (upgrading to a 76&nbsp;mm gun would have had marginal benefits for increased costs), Hellfire missiles, {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} RHIBs, and the ASW variable-depth sonar. Current plans lack vertical launchers for Standard missiles; the SSC is planned to be able to operate alone. The over-the-horizon surface-to-surface missile will likely be in the Harpoon Block II class. Other enhancements include spaced armor, installation of [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 2 25&nbsp;mm chain guns]], improved decoy systems, the SeaRAM missile interceptor, a \"lite\" version of the [[AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite|Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program]] (SEWIP), and improved signature management through [[degaussing]]. An SSC will cost $60\u2013$75 million more than a Flight 0 LCS, with procurement to begin by 2019. Hagel also directed the Navy to study which improvements could be added to LCSs; completed ships cannot accommodate all changes, more can be added to incomplete ones, the final number and mix of each type has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"military11dec14\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2014/12/11/hagel-new-ship-based-lcs/20266187/ |title=Hagel: New ship to be based on LCS |website=navytimes.com |last=Cavas |first=Christopher P. |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/12/11/gunned-lcs-hulls-picked-navys-next-small-surface-combatant |title=Up Gunned LCS Hulls Picked for Navy's Next Small Surface Combatant |website=usni.org |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324215307/http://news.usni.org/2014/12/11/gunned-lcs-hulls-picked-navys-next-small-surface-combatant |archive-date=24 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seapowermagazine.org/stories/20141212-ssc-lcs.html |title=Modified LCS Selected for Follow-On Small Surface Combatant |website=seapowermagazine.org |date=12 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214172124/http://seapowermagazine.org/stories/20141212-ssc-lcs.html |archivedate=14 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20141211/DEFREG02/312110041/Hagel-New-Ship-Based-LCS |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141214154956/http://www.defensenews.com/article/20141211/DEFREG02/312110041/Hagel-New-Ship-Based-LCS |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2014 |title=Split Decision on New US Navy Ship |website=defensenews.com |date=11 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/20141212_lcs_rearmed.html#.VI2sScIfodU |title=The US Navy wants better armed, more protected LCS based surface combat ships |website=defense-update.com |date=12 December 2014 |last=Eshel |first=Tamir |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429122803/http://defense-update.com/20141212_lcs_rearmed.html#.VI2sScIfodU |archive-date=29 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/12/lcs-lives-hagel-approves-bigger-gunned-upgrade/ |title=LCS Lives: Hagel Approves Better Armed Upgrade |website=breakingdefense.com |last=Freedburg |first=Sydney J. |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530233825/http://breakingdefense.com/2014/12/lcs-lives-hagel-approves-bigger-gunned-upgrade/ |archive-date=30 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/hagels-new-small-surface-combatant-ssc-gives-lcs-eyes-teeth-and-toughness/ |title=Hagel's New Small Surface Combatant Gives LCS Eyes, Teeth, and Toughness |website=defensemedianetwork.com |last=Oldham |first=Chuck |date=12 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000634/http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/hagels-new-small-surface-combatant-ssc-gives-lcs-eyes-teeth-and-toughness/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe decision was made on SSC upgrade features to prioritize over-the-horizon surface and ASW capabilities with a greater degree of self-defense, not anti-aircraft or missile defense, which will be left to large surface combatants. Although a 3D radar is included in the designs, a VLS was absent from the hulls, contrary to what naval experts suggested and industry submissions contained. Adding a vertical launch system was evaluated, but was determined to be too heavy and large and requiring long and costly changes; modular aspects of the ships may allow for the addition of the smaller Mk 56 VLS for the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. When emphasized on ASW, the ships will combine the fixed multi-function towed sonar array with the mission package's variable depth sonar to have \"the most effective ASW sensor platform in the Navy.\" For SUW, the key addition is the inclusion of an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile; the Navy is looking at potential systems that could compete with the Harpoon Block II. Aside from lethality changes, the service also intends to have a common combat management system for both variants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/12/15/navy-fleet-put-lcs-follow-focus-surface-sub-threats-not-air |title=Navy: Fleet Put LCS Follow-on Focus on Surface and Sub Threats, Not Air |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |website=usni.org |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306230651/http://news.usni.org/2014/12/15/navy-fleet-put-lcs-follow-focus-surface-sub-threats-not-air |archive-date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, the Navy announced that the up-gunned LCS will be reclassified as a frigate, since the requirements of the SSCTF was to upgrade the ships with frigate-like capabilities.

The Coast Guard noted that the LCS has previously performed this task, and pointed towards its high speed and embarked helicopters to run down fast smuggling boats; the Navy plans to base 10 ''Freedom''-class ships at Naval Station Mayport, Florida which could be tasked to conduct interdiction missions.<ref>[http://www.seapowermagazine.org/stories/20141204-lcs-drug.html Coast Guard Admiral: LCS \u2018an Incredible Ship\u2019 for Drug Interdiction] - Seapowermagazine.org, 4 December 2014</ref>\n\n==Developmental history==\n\n===Background===\nDuring the late 1990s, the U.S. Navy realized its [[Cold War]]-era cruisers and destroyers had been designed for open-ocean warfare, and would be vulnerable in shallow coastal waters, where they would face dangers from high-speed boats, missile-firing fast-attack craft, small submarines, sea mines, and land and air-launched anti-ship missiles. The Navy's official solution was the [[DD-21]], a large coastal warship that could absorb hits. Two Navy strategists, retired Captain Wayne Hughes and Vice Admiral Art Cebrowski, refined an opposing ''Streetfighter'' concept for a 1,000-ton small, specialized, and heavily armed vessel costing just $90 million (2001 dollars). Being small, light and numerous, the Streetfighter was envisioned as a \"single-serving\" ship to be abandoned once hit, made possible by its low cost. The concept of a manned expendable warship was contentious and the idea was not picked up. When [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was made Secretary of Defense in early 2001, he promised transformational approaches and doing jobs with fewer people. In October 2001, Cebrowski was assigned to head the Pentagon's new Office of Force Transformation, shortly after which Admiral [[Vernon Clark]] cancelled the DD-21 and replaced it with a \"family\" of ships, including the littoral combat ship, being motivated to produce ships cheaper and faster to increase fleet size. Clark declared the LCS was his \"most transformational effort\" and number-one budget priority in 2003.<ref name=\"wired3aug11\">[https://www.wired.com/2011/08/future-warship-ran-aground/all/ How the Navy\u2019s Warship of the Future Ran Aground] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917032140/https://www.wired.com/2011/08/future-warship-ran-aground/all/ |date=17 September 2017 }} - Wired.com, 3 August 2011</ref>\n\nThe Navy committed to the $15 billion (2003) program in advance of rigorous analysis or clearly defined purpose, appearance, or survivability. Proponents typically pointed to its speed, asymmetric littoral threats, and impact on the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The LCS suffered from requirements creep, adding more missions and equipment, potentially rendering it too complex and expensive to use. When it was decided the ship would not be expendable, the original concept of a small, cheap, simple coastal warship became bigger, more expensive, and more complicated; with a smaller crew due to automation. The task force assigned six different missions which had been previously performed by individual ships: submarine and mine hunting; combating small boats; intelligence gathering; transporting special forces; and counter-drug and piracy patrols. Each ship would be big enough to sail across the Pacific alone, embark a helicopter, have a minimum 40 knot top speed, and cost $220 million. The Navy was only willing to build one type of ship, the task force, realized it was virtually impossible for one vessel to fill all roles, advocated a large hull to cover the mission range through modularity, organic combat power, and unmanned systems. Empty space was left for weapon and sensor mission modules costing $150 million. When the first production contracts were awarded in 2004, no mission module worked outside of a laboratory. Fast, cheap construction was emphasized, solving problems with technology.<ref name=\"wired3aug11\"/>\n\n[[File:USS Freedom (LCS 1), the crew mans the rails.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Freedom|LCS-1|2}}, the first LCS, on commissioning day]]\nIn 2003, the Navy launched its first experimental LCS, ''[[Sea Fighter]]'', designated as fast sea frame or FSF-1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicholsboats.com/x-craft.htm |title=Sea Fighter (X-Craft) |publisher=Nicholsboats.com |accessdate=8 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430003420/http://www.nicholsboats.com/x-craft.htm |archivedate=30 April 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2005, the [[Small waterplane area twin hull|SWATH]]-hulled ''Sea Fighter'' entered service as an experimental vessel using mission modules.<ref>{{cite press release |author=Journalist 3rd Class (SW) Nick Young, Fleet Public Affairs Center, Pacific |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=19463 |title=Navy Sea Fighter Makes San Diego Home |id=NNS050803-02 |publisher=Navy News Service |accessdate=8 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217101116/http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=19463 |archive-date=17 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> As the ''Oliver Hazard Perry'', {{sclass-|Osprey|minehunter|5}}, and the {{sclass-|Avenger|mine countermeasures ship|5}} classes were reaching the end of their lives, the U.S. Navy released the LCS requirement.

Detractors claim the LCS is not survivable enough for long-range threats that China possesses; LCS ships are built to the Navy's survivability category Level I+, higher than Level I patrol craft and mine warfare ships, but lower than the Level II ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class frigate they are replacing.

The Navy requires the class' roles of counter-mine, anti-submarine, and surface warfare provided by modules.

The SSC will focus on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare; mine countermeasures will be handled by existing LCS ships. Although not designed for modularity, it will maintain the ability to carry mission modules and LCS mission package equipment, including 30&nbsp;mm and 57&nbsp;mm cannons (upgrading to a 76&nbsp;mm gun would have had marginal benefits for increased costs), Hellfire missiles, {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} RHIBs, and the ASW variable-depth sonar. Current plans lack vertical launchers for Standard missiles; the SSC is planned to be able to operate alone. The over-the-horizon surface-to-surface missile will likely be in the Harpoon Block II class. Other enhancements include spaced armor, installation of [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 2 25&nbsp;mm chain guns]], improved decoy systems, the SeaRAM missile interceptor, a \"lite\" version of the [[AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite|Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program]] (SEWIP), and improved signature management through [[degaussing]]. An SSC will cost $60\u2013$75 million more than a Flight 0 LCS, with procurement to begin by 2019. Hagel also directed the Navy to study which improvements could be added to LCSs; completed ships cannot accommodate all changes, more can be added to incomplete ones, the final number and mix of each type has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"military11dec14\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2014/12/11/hagel-new-ship-based-lcs/20266187/ |title=Hagel: New ship to be based on LCS |website=navytimes.com |last=Cavas |first=Christopher P. |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/12/11/gunned-lcs-hulls-picked-navys-next-small-surface-combatant |title=Up Gunned LCS Hulls Picked for Navy's Next Small Surface Combatant |website=usni.org |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324215307/http://news.usni.org/2014/12/11/gunned-lcs-hulls-picked-navys-next-small-surface-combatant |archive-date=24 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seapowermagazine.org/stories/20141212-ssc-lcs.html |title=Modified LCS Selected for Follow-On Small Surface Combatant |website=seapowermagazine.org |date=12 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214172124/http://seapowermagazine.org/stories/20141212-ssc-lcs.html |archivedate=14 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20141211/DEFREG02/312110041/Hagel-New-Ship-Based-LCS |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141214154956/http://www.defensenews.com/article/20141211/DEFREG02/312110041/Hagel-New-Ship-Based-LCS |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2014 |title=Split Decision on New US Navy Ship |website=defensenews.com |date=11 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/20141212_lcs_rearmed.html#.VI2sScIfodU |title=The US Navy wants better armed, more protected LCS based surface combat ships |website=defense-update.com |date=12 December 2014 |last=Eshel |first=Tamir |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429122803/http://defense-update.com/20141212_lcs_rearmed.html#.VI2sScIfodU |archive-date=29 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/12/lcs-lives-hagel-approves-bigger-gunned-upgrade/ |title=LCS Lives: Hagel Approves Better Armed Upgrade |website=breakingdefense.com |last=Freedburg |first=Sydney J. |date=11 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530233825/http://breakingdefense.com/2014/12/lcs-lives-hagel-approves-bigger-gunned-upgrade/ |archive-date=30 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/hagels-new-small-surface-combatant-ssc-gives-lcs-eyes-teeth-and-toughness/ |title=Hagel's New Small Surface Combatant Gives LCS Eyes, Teeth, and Toughness |website=defensemedianetwork.com |last=Oldham |first=Chuck |date=12 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000634/http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/hagels-new-small-surface-combatant-ssc-gives-lcs-eyes-teeth-and-toughness/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe decision was made on SSC upgrade features to prioritize over-the-horizon surface and ASW capabilities with a greater degree of self-defense, not anti-aircraft or missile defense, which will be left to large surface combatants. Although a 3D radar is included in the designs, a VLS was absent from the hulls, contrary to what naval experts suggested and industry submissions contained. Adding a vertical launch system was evaluated, but was determined to be too heavy and large and requiring long and costly changes; modular aspects of the ships may allow for the addition of the smaller Mk 56 VLS for the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. When emphasized on ASW, the ships will combine the fixed multi-function towed sonar array with the mission package's variable depth sonar to have \"the most effective ASW sensor platform in the Navy.\" For SUW, the key addition is the inclusion of an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile; the Navy is looking at potential systems that could compete with the Harpoon Block II. Aside from lethality changes, the service also intends to have a common combat management system for both variants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/12/15/navy-fleet-put-lcs-follow-focus-surface-sub-threats-not-air |title=Navy: Fleet Put LCS Follow-on Focus on Surface and Sub Threats, Not Air |last=LaGrone |first=Sam |website=usni.org |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306230651/http://news.usni.org/2014/12/15/navy-fleet-put-lcs-follow-focus-surface-sub-threats-not-air |archive-date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, the Navy announced that the up-gunned LCS will be reclassified as a frigate, since the requirements of the SSCTF was to upgrade the ships with frigate-like capabilities.

This cut is to reallocate funds to other priorities including buying more [[F-35C Lightning II]] and [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] fighters, SM-6 missiles, accelerating Flight III {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}} DDG-51 acquisition, and expanding development of the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) for the Block V {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|1}}.

It was directed by [[George Waggner]] and the screenplay was written by Maurice Tombragel and Victor McLeod. It stars [[Dick Foran]], [[Peggy Moran]], [[Leo Carrillo]], [[Eddie Parker (actor)|Eddie Parker]], [[Dale Van Sickle]], [[John Eldredge (actor)|John Eldredge]], Lewis Howard, [[Hobart Cavanaugh]], [[Iris Adrian]] and  [[Fuzzy Knight]]. Foy Van Dolsen plays the monstrous villain \"Panama Pete\", alias \"The Phantom\". Directed by George Waggner, the movie runs 61 minutes. It was released on March 28, 1941. The plot has assorted colorful characters going to a mysterious island to seek a pirate's hidden fortune.\n\nThe film cost $93,000  and was made between March 3 and March 15, 1941.\n\nThe movie is on the \"Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive\" DVD box set, released in 2009.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBill Martin, graduate of [[Princeton University]], is the proud owner of a small boulder of an island off the coast of [[Florida]] called \"Morgan's Island.\" It is a deserted useless rock to Bill, but by pure chance he stumbles across a treasure map pointing to his island. The map is presented to him by a peg-legged old sailor, Tobias Clump, after Bill and his friend \"Stuff\" Oliver saves the man from drowning. Clump was pushed into the water by a \"phantom,\" who got away with part of the treasure map. Clump tells them that the map shows the way to infamous buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan's twenty million dollar treasure.\n\nSoon after this, Bill's cousin George offers to buy the whole island for the amount of $20,000, but Bill isn't willing to sell. Instead he brings the map to a reputed cartographer who claims that the map is fake&mdash;it's a very well-made forgery. Letting go of the thought of the legendary treasure, Bill instead thinks of making some money by starting a \"treasure hunt\" cruise to his island, for fifty dollars apiece. He involves Stuff in the plans and together they start out for the island to plant a fake treasure for the tourists to find. On their way they are involved in a traffic accident, and by \"accident\" meet the posh Wendy Creighton and her boy toy, Thurman Coldwater. Since Bill is a little short of money he persuades Wendy to take his treasure cruise.\n\nWhen the ship is ready to leave on the cruise, Bill, Stuff, Wendy and Thurman are accompanied by cousin George, a man named Jasper, a small-time gangster by the name of Rod Grady, his wife Arleen and a private investigator, McGoon, who has tried to find evidence that the cruise is a fake and uses false advertising.\n\nBefore the ship even leaves the harbor a bomb is secretly delivered. However, someone accidentally drops the bomb over board just before it explodes. The ship sails and is soon lost at sea, until Bill discovers that a magnet has been placed on the compass to deliberately put them off track. It becomes obvious that someone is trying to sabotage the trip to the island. Once the ship is on the right course again it takes only six hours to cover the distance to Morgan's Island. It doesn't take long before bad things start to happen to the group. In the old abandoned castle a cross-bow almost kills Clump and a suit of armor nearly crushes Wendy. Bill mistakes the accidents for Stuff's planned surprises, part of the \"haunting\" experience included in the treasure hunt.\n\nThe phantom that stole part of the treasure map from Clump reappears and warns Wendy and tells her that she will die if she stays on. She doesn't take this seriously, but the phantom appears once more, this time in her bedroom at night, and warns her again. Everyone believes that someone is pretending to be the ghost in an effort to scare them all off. Bill starts looking for the joker, and encounters Jasper as he is sleepwalking in the castle corridors at night. Tobias goes missing and when Rod and Arleen try to escape the castle and leave the island they discover that the boat is gone. A man in a cape kills Rod in front of Arleen, but when she gets back to the rest of the group the private investigator McGoon suspects her of being the killer. Bill suspects Tobias, who is still missing, and a \"footprint\" from a peg-leg is found near Rod's body. It turns out there is big reward set for the dead gangster, \"dead or alive\".\n\nTobias reunites with the group and tells of a key he has found. It is supposed to unlock a torture chamber in the castle, where Sir Henry Morgan's treasure is hidden. The group enters the chamber but finds only a single gold coin. As they return to the castle's main hall there is a note on the table saying \"nine left\". The cross-bow fires again, but misses Clump by an inch, killing the phantom instead. It turns out the phantom was no other than an old shipmate of Clump's. On the phantom's body they find the rest of the treasure map and a fake peg-leg.\n\nBill, Stuff and Clump go to find the treasure, leaving George and Wendy to themselves in the castle. They find a new note saying \"eight left\" and when George tries to find the anonymous killer, Wendy is abducted by an unknown person. When the rest of the group is back at the castle they find George murdered inside one of the armor suits. Bill realizes that Jasper must be the killer, but when Bill confronts him with Rod's gun in his hand, it turns out the gun is unloaded and Jasper gets the advantage. Bill, Stuff and Wendy escape, but only to find themselves trapped in a secret passage inside the castle walls.

It was directed by [[George Waggner]] and the screenplay was written by Maurice Tombragel and Victor McLeod. It stars [[Dick Foran]], [[Peggy Moran]], [[Leo Carrillo]], [[Eddie Parker (actor)|Eddie Parker]], [[Dale Van Sickle]], [[John Eldredge (actor)|John Eldredge]], Lewis Howard, [[Hobart Cavanaugh]], [[Iris Adrian]] and  [[Fuzzy Knight]]. Foy Van Dolsen plays the monstrous villain \"Panama Pete\", alias \"The Phantom\". Directed by George Waggner, the movie runs 61 minutes. It was released on March 28, 1941. The plot has assorted colorful characters going to a mysterious island to seek a pirate's hidden fortune.\n\nThe film cost $93,000  and was made between March 3 and March 15, 1941.\n\nThe movie is on the \"Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive\" DVD box set, released in 2009.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBill Martin, graduate of [[Princeton University]], is the proud owner of a small boulder of an island off the coast of [[Florida]] called \"Morgan's Island.\" It is a deserted useless rock to Bill, but by pure chance he stumbles across a treasure map pointing to his island. The map is presented to him by a peg-legged old sailor, Tobias Clump, after Bill and his friend \"Stuff\" Oliver saves the man from drowning. Clump was pushed into the water by a \"phantom,\" who got away with part of the treasure map. Clump tells them that the map shows the way to infamous buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan's twenty million dollar treasure.\n\nSoon after this, Bill's cousin George offers to buy the whole island for the amount of $20,000, but Bill isn't willing to sell. Instead he brings the map to a reputed cartographer who claims that the map is fake&mdash;it's a very well-made forgery. Letting go of the thought of the legendary treasure, Bill instead thinks of making some money by starting a \"treasure hunt\" cruise to his island, for fifty dollars apiece. He involves Stuff in the plans and together they start out for the island to plant a fake treasure for the tourists to find. On their way they are involved in a traffic accident, and by \"accident\" meet the posh Wendy Creighton and her boy toy, Thurman Coldwater. Since Bill is a little short of money he persuades Wendy to take his treasure cruise.\n\nWhen the ship is ready to leave on the cruise, Bill, Stuff, Wendy and Thurman are accompanied by cousin George, a man named Jasper, a small-time gangster by the name of Rod Grady, his wife Arleen and a private investigator, McGoon, who has tried to find evidence that the cruise is a fake and uses false advertising.\n\nBefore the ship even leaves the harbor a bomb is secretly delivered. However, someone accidentally drops the bomb over board just before it explodes. The ship sails and is soon lost at sea, until Bill discovers that a magnet has been placed on the compass to deliberately put them off track. It becomes obvious that someone is trying to sabotage the trip to the island. Once the ship is on the right course again it takes only six hours to cover the distance to Morgan's Island. It doesn't take long before bad things start to happen to the group. In the old abandoned castle a cross-bow almost kills Clump and a suit of armor nearly crushes Wendy. Bill mistakes the accidents for Stuff's planned surprises, part of the \"haunting\" experience included in the treasure hunt.\n\nThe phantom that stole part of the treasure map from Clump reappears and warns Wendy and tells her that she will die if she stays on. She doesn't take this seriously, but the phantom appears once more, this time in her bedroom at night, and warns her again. Everyone believes that someone is pretending to be the ghost in an effort to scare them all off. Bill starts looking for the joker, and encounters Jasper as he is sleepwalking in the castle corridors at night. Tobias goes missing and when Rod and Arleen try to escape the castle and leave the island they discover that the boat is gone. A man in a cape kills Rod in front of Arleen, but when she gets back to the rest of the group the private investigator McGoon suspects her of being the killer. Bill suspects Tobias, who is still missing, and a \"footprint\" from a peg-leg is found near Rod's body. it turns out there is big reward set for the dead gangster, \"dead or alive\".\n\nTobias reunites with the group and tells of a key he has found. It is supposed to unlock a torture chamber in the castle, where Sir Henry Morgan's treasure is hidden. The group enters the chamber but finds only a single gold coin. As they return to the castle's main hall there is a note on the table saying \"nine left\". the cross-bow fires again, but misses Clump by an inch, killing the phantom instead. it turns out the phantom was no other than an old shipmate of Clump's. On the phantom's body they find the rest of the treasure map and a fake peg-leg.\n\nBill, Stuff and Clump go to find the treasure, leaving George and Wendy to themselves in the castle. they find a new note saying \"eight left\" and when George tries to find the anonymous killer, Wendy is abducted by an unknown person. When the rest of the group is back at the castle they find George murdered inside one of the armor suits. Bill realises that Jasper must be the killer, but when Bill confronts him with Rod's gun in his hand, it turns out the gun is unloaded and Jasper gets the advantage. Bill, Stuff and Wendy escape, but only to find themselves trapped in a secret passage inside the castle walls. As they get rescued by Clump, it turns out the passage leads directly to [[Sir Henry Morgan]]'s treasure. Jasper follows and finds them, forcing them on to the treasure chamber. as they open the final passage door an axe falls down to kill Jasper. The rest of the group enter the treasure chamber and opens the chest, only to find the skeleton of Sir Henry Morgan himself.\n\nDisappointed the group members make their way back to the surface, where they meet a government agent, who offers to buy the whole island from Bill in order to build a naval base.

A digital signal is an abstraction which is discrete in time and amplitude.

The shape of the waveform depends the transmission scheme, which may be either a [[line coding]] scheme allowing [[baseband transmission]]; or a [[digital modulation]] scheme, allowing [[passband]] transmission over long wires or over a limited radio frequency band. Such a carrier-modulated sine wave is considered a digital signal in literature on digital communications and data transmission,<ref>J.S.Chitode, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ycq1cTYrLDkC&pg=PA585&dq=%22a+digital+signal+is%22+CW&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI0-DjspvjxwIVhBEsCh0FjAFT#v=onepage&q=%22a%20digital%20signal%20is%22%20CW&f=false Communication Systems], 2008: \"When a digital signal is transmitted over a long distance, it needs CW modulation.\"</ref> but considered as a bitstream converted to an analog signal in electronics and computer networking.<ref>Fred Halsall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QadX5XErZ9IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=halsall+computer+networks&hl=sv&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=%22digital%20signal%22&f=false Computer Networking and the Internet]: \"In order to transmit a digital signal over an analog subscriber line, modulated transmission must be used; thas is the electrical signal that represents the binary bit stream of the source (digital) output must first be converted to an analog signal that is compatible with a (telephony) speech signal.\"</ref>\n\nIn communications, sources of interference are usually present, and noise is frequently a significant problem. The effects of interference are typically minimized by filtering off interfering signals as much as possible and by using [[Redundancy (information theory)|data redundancy]]. The main advantages of digital signals for communications are often considered to be the noise immunity to noise capability, and the ability, in many cases such as with audio and video data, to use [[data compression]] to greatly decrease the bandwidth that is required on the communication media.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Logic voltage levels==\n{{main article|Logic level}}\n[[File:S Digital.svg|framed|A logic signal waveform: (1) low level, (2) high level, (3) rising edge, and (4) falling edge.]]\nA [[waveform]] that switches representing the two states of a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value (0 and 1, or low and high, or false and true) is referred to as a ''digital signal'' or ''logic signal'' or ''binary signal'' when it is interpreted in terms of only two possible digits.\n\nThe two states are usually represented by some measurement of an electrical property: [[Electric potential|Voltage]] is the most common, but [[Electric current|current]] is used in some logic families.  A threshold is designed for each logic family.  When below that threshold, the signal is ''low'', when above ''high''.\n\nThe [[clock signal]] is a special digital signal that is used to [[synchronization|synchronize]] many digital circuits. The image shown can be considered the waveform of a clock signal. Logic changes are triggered either by the rising edge or the falling edge. The rising edge is the transition from a low voltage (level 1 in the diagram) to a high voltage (level 2). The falling edge is the transition from a high voltage to a low one.\n\nAlthough in a highly simplified and idealized model of a digital circuit, we may wish for these transitions to occur instantaneously, no real world circuit is purely resistive and therefore no circuit can instantly change voltage levels.  This means that during a short, finite [[transition time]] the output may not properly reflect the input, and will not correspond to either a logically high or low voltage.\n\n==Modulation==\n{{main article|Modulation#Digital modulation methods}}\nTo create a digital signal, an analog signal must be modulated with a control signal to produce it. The simplest modulation, a type of [[unipolar encoding]], is simply to switch on and off a DC signal, so that high voltages represent a '1' and low voltages are '0'.\n\nIn [[digital radio]] schemes one or more carrier waves are [[Amplitude modulation|amplitude]], [[Frequency modulation|frequency]] or [[Phase modulation|phase modulated]] by the control signal to produce a digital signal suitable for transmission.\n\n[[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line]] (ADSL) over [[telephone wire]]s, does not primarily use binary logic; the digital signals for individual carriers are modulated with different valued logics, depending on the [[Shannon capacity]] of the individual channel.\n\n==Clocking==\n[[File:FF Tsetup Thold Toutput.svg|thumb|Clocking digital signals through a clocked flip-flop]]\nDigital signals may be ''sampled'' by a clock signal at regular intervals by passing the signal through a [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]. When this is done, the input is measured at the clock edge, and the signal from that time. The signal is then held steady until the next clock. This process is the basis of [[synchronous logic]].\n\n[[Asynchronous logic]] also exists, which uses no single clock, and generally operates more quickly, and may use less power, but is significantly harder to design.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Intersymbol interference]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite video |author=Monty Montgomory |title=Digital Show & Tell |url=https://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml}}\n\n{{digital systems}}\n{{Bit-encoding}} \n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A signal used to represent a sequence of discrete values}}\n{{about|digital signals in electronics|digital data and systems|Digital data|digital signals that specifically represent analog waveforms|Digital signal (signal processing)|other uses|Digital signal (disambiguation)}}\n{{broader|Signal (electrical engineering)}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n\n[[File:Original message.jpg|thumb|A binary signal, also known as a logic signal, is a digital signal with two distinguishable levels]]\n\nA '''digital signal''' is a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] that is being used to represent data as a sequence of [[discrete space|discrete]] values; at any given time it can only take on one of a finite number of values.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1eO7kLWUmYIC&lpg=PA49&ots=EBhxEwk7bY&dq=digital%20signal%20logic&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q=digital%20signal%20logic&f=false |title=Digital Design with CPLD Applications and VHDL |author=Robert K.

A digital signal is an abstraction which is discrete in time and amplitude.

The shape of the waveform depends the transmission scheme, which may be either a [[line coding]] scheme allowing [[baseband transmission]]; or a [[digital modulation]] scheme, allowing [[passband]] transmission over long wires or over a limited radio frequency band. Such a carrier-modulated sine wave is considered a digital signal in literature on digital communications and data transmission,<ref>J.S.Chitode, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ycq1cTYrLDkC&pg=PA585&dq=%22a+digital+signal+is%22+CW&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI0-DjspvjxwIVhBEsCh0FjAFT#v=onepage&q=%22a%20digital%20signal%20is%22%20CW&f=false Communication Systems], 2008: \"When a digital signal is transmitted over a long distance, it needs CW modulation.\"</ref> but considered as a bitstream converted to an analog signal in electronics and computer networking.<ref>Fred Halsall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QadX5XErZ9IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=halsall+computer+networks&hl=sv&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=%22digital%20signal%22&f=false Computer Networking and the Internet]: \"In order to transmit a digital signal over an analog subscriber line, modulated transmission must be used; thas is the electrical signal that represents the binary bit stream of the source (digital) output must first be converted to an analog signal that is compatible with a (telephony) speech signal.\"</ref>\n\nIn communications, sources of interference are usually present, and noise is frequently a significant problem. The effects of interference are typically minimized by filtering off interfering signals as much as possible and by using [[Redundancy (information theory)|data redundancy]]. The main advantages of digital signals for communications are often considered to be the noise immunity to noise capability, and the ability, in many cases such as with audio and video data, to use data compression to greatly decrease the bandwidth that is required on the communication media.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Logic voltage levels==\n{{main article|Logic level}}\n[[File:S Digital.svg|framed|A logic signal waveform: (1) low level, (2) high level, (3) rising edge, and (4) falling edge.]]\nA [[waveform]] that switches representing the two states of a [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] value (0 and 1, or low and high, or false and true) is referred to as a ''digital signal'' or ''logic signal'' or ''binary signal'' when it is interpreted in terms of only two possible digits.\n\nThe two states are usually represented by some measurement of an electrical property: [[Electric potential|Voltage]] is the most common, but [[Electric current|current]] is used in some logic families.  A threshold is designed for each logic family.  When below that threshold, the signal is ''low'', when above ''high''.\n\nThe [[clock signal]] is a special digital signal that is used to [[synchronization|synchronize]] many digital circuits. The image shown can be considered the waveform of a clock signal. Logic changes are triggered either by the rising edge or the falling edge. The rising edge is the transition from a low voltage (level 1 in the diagram) to a high voltage (level 2). The falling edge is the transition from a high voltage to a low one.\n\nAlthough in a highly simplified and idealized model of a digital circuit, we may wish for these transitions to occur instantaneously, no real world circuit is purely resistive and therefore no circuit can instantly change voltage levels.  This means that during a short, finite [[transition time]] the output may not properly reflect the input, and will not correspond to either a logically high or low voltage.\n\n==Modulation==\n{{main article|Modulation#Digital modulation methods}}\nTo create a digital signal, an analog signal must be modulated with a control signal to produce it. The simplest modulation, a type of [[unipolar encoding]], is simply to switch on and off a DC signal, so that high voltages represent a '1' and low voltages are '0'.\n\nIn [[digital radio]] schemes one or more carrier waves are [[Amplitude modulation|amplitude]], [[Frequency modulation|frequency]] or [[Phase modulation|phase modulated]] by the control signal to produce a digital signal suitable for transmission.\n\n[[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line]] (ADSL) over [[telephone wire]]s, does not primarily use binary logic; the digital signals for individual carriers are modulated with different valued logics, depending on the [[Shannon capacity]] of the individual channel.\n\n==Clocking==\n[[File:FF Tsetup Thold Toutput.svg|thumb|Clocking digital signals through a clocked flip-flop]]\nDigital signals may be ''sampled'' by a clock signal at regular intervals by passing the signal through a [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]. When this is done, the input is measured at the clock edge, and the signal from that time. The signal is then held steady until the next clock. This process is the basis of [[synchronous logic]].\n\n[[Asynchronous logic]] also exists, which uses no single clock, and generally operates more quickly, and may use less power, but is significantly harder to design.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Intersymbol interference]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite video |author=Monty Montgomory |title=Digital Show & Tell |url=https://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml}}\n\n{{digital systems}}\n{{Bit-encoding}} \n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "name_user": "Jarble", "label": "safe", "comment": "linking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal"}

He drives to a comedy gig, stays at a bed & breakfast while analysing the people there, texts a girl he likes, stops at a service station on the way home, does the washing up, goes to the gym, and travels into London for a meeting about writing the book. All the while, the reader gets an insight into Richardson's unique perspective on the world, life and other people. For instance, he divides the world into two kinds of people. A person is either a 'putter', someone who puts things away and knows where their belongings are at all times, or a 'leaver', someone who constantly loses their things.\n\n== Reviews ==\n[[ShortList (magazine)|ShortList]] described ''It's Not Me, It's You!'' as a \"staggeringly honest memoir\", \"boldly funny and expertly written, it\u2019s a look at dark subjects deftly handled by an engaging comic talent.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ui84jI3rR-8/Tg7rOpcVxqI/AAAAAAAAABY/oHwbFaOqkps/s1600/The-Playlist_Review.gif |title=The Playlist review |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper's review described the book as \"written in his unique style\", and a \"hilarious eye-opener into the mind of a neat freak.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vTlHD3lmpS8/Tg7rUI_jGvI/AAAAAAAAABg/biqoUx7Oj6w/s1600/The-Sun-Review.gif |title='&#39;The Sun'&#39; review, June 24th 2011 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.jonrichardsoncomedy.com/ Jon Richardson's home page]\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n[[Category:2011 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Comedy books]]\n[[Category:HarperCollins books]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n'''''It's Not Me, It's You!''''' is a book written by English comedian [[Jon Richardson (comedian)|Jon Richardson]] based on his 2011 comedy show of the same name.
