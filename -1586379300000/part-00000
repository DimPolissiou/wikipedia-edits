A finite difference scheme is stable if the errors made at one time step of the calculation do not cause the errors to be magnified as the computations are continued. A ''neutrally stable scheme'' is one in which errors remain constant as the computations are carried forward. If the errors decay and eventually damp out, the numerical scheme is said to be stable. If, on the contrary, the errors grow with time the numerical scheme is said to be unstable. The stability of numerical schemes can be investigated by performing von Neumann stability analysis. For time-dependent problems, stability guarantees that the numerical method produces a bounded solution whenever the solution of the exact differential equation is bounded. Stability, in general, can be difficult to investigate, especially when the equation under consideration is [[nonlinear partial differential equation|nonlinear]].\n\nIn certain cases, von Neumann stability is necessary and sufficient for stability in the sense of Lax\u2013Richtmyer (as used in the [[Lax equivalence theorem]]): The PDE and the finite difference scheme models are linear; the PDE is constant-coefficient with [[periodic boundary conditions]] and has only two independent variables; and the scheme uses no more than two time levels.<ref>\n{{Citation \n | last = Smith | first = G.

It is often used in place of a more detailed stability analysis to provide a good guess at the restrictions (if any) on the step sizes used in the scheme because of its relative simplicity.\n\n==Illustration of the method==\nThe von Neumann method is based on the decomposition of the errors into [[Fourier series]].

Equations (1) and (2) show that both the error and the numerical solution have the same growth or decay behavior with respect to time.

The time dependence of the error is included by assuming that the amplitude of error <math>A_m</math> is a function of time.

To find out how error varies in steps of time, substitute equation (5) into equation (2), after noting that\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n \\epsilon_j^n & = e^{at} e^{ik_m x} \\\\\n \\epsilon_j^{n+1} & = e^{a(t+\\Delta t)} e^{ik_m x} \\\\\n \\epsilon_{j+1}^n & = e^{at} e^{ik_m (x+\\Delta x)} \\\\\n \\epsilon_{j-1}^n & = e^{at} e^{ik_m (x-\\Delta x)},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nto yield (after simplification)\n:<math>\n  \\quad (6) \\qquad e^{a\\Delta t} = 1 + r \\left(e^{ik_m \\Delta x} + e^{-ik_m \\Delta x} -  2\\right).\n</math>\n\nUsing the identities\n:<math>\n  \\qquad \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right)= \\frac{e^{ik_m \\Delta x/2} - e^{-ik_m \\Delta x/2}}{2i} \\qquad \\rightarrow \\qquad \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{ e^{ik_m \\Delta x} + e^{-ik_m \\Delta x} -  2 }{4}\n</math>\nequation (6) may be written as\n:<math>\n  \\quad (7) \\qquad e^{a\\Delta t} = 1 - 4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2)\n</math>\nDefine the amplification factor\n:<math>\n  G \\equiv \\frac{\\epsilon_j^{n+1}}{\\epsilon_j^n}\n</math>\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the error to remain bounded is that <math>\\vert G \\vert \\leq 1.</math> \nHowever,\n:<math>\n  \\quad (8) \\qquad G = \\frac{e^{a(t+\\Delta t)} e^{ik_m x}}{e^{at} e^{ik_m x}} = e^{a\\Delta t}\n</math>\nThus, from equations (7) and (8), the condition for stability is given by\n:<math>\n  \\quad (9) \\qquad \\left\\vert 1 - 4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2) \\right\\vert \\leq 1\n</math>\nNote that the term <math>4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2)</math> is always positive.  Thus, to satisfy Equation (9):\n:<math>\n  \\quad (10) \\qquad  4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2) \\leq 2\n</math>\nFor the above condition to hold for all <math>m</math>  (and therefore all <math>\\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2)</math>). The highest value the sinusoidal term can take is 1 and for that particular choice if the upper threshold condition is satisfied, then so will be for all grid points, thus we have\n:<math>\n  \\quad (11) \\qquad r=\\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\left( \\Delta x \\right)^2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}  \n</math> \n:\nEquation (11) gives the stability requirement for the [[FTCS scheme]] as applied to one-dimensional heat equation.

The time dependence of the error is included by assuming that the amplitude of error <math>A_m</math> is a function of time. Since the error tends to grow or decay exponentially with time, it is reasonable to assume that the amplitude varies exponentially with time; hence\n:<math>\n  \\quad (4) \\qquad \\epsilon(x,t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} e^{at} e^{ik_m x}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a</math> is a constant.\n\nSince the difference equation for error is linear (the behavior of each term of the series is the same as series itself), it is enough to consider the growth of error of a typical term:\n:<math>\n  \\quad (5) \\qquad \\epsilon_m(x,t) = e^{at} e^{ik_m x}\n</math>\nThe stability characteristics can be studied using just this form for the error with no loss in generality. To find out how error varies in steps of time, substitute equation (5) into equation (2), after noting that\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n \\epsilon_j^n & = e^{at} e^{ik_m x} \\\\\n \\epsilon_j^{n+1} & = e^{a(t+\\Delta t)} e^{ik_m x} \\\\\n \\epsilon_{j+1}^n & = e^{at} e^{ik_m (x+\\Delta x)} \\\\\n \\epsilon_{j-1}^n & = e^{at} e^{ik_m (x-\\Delta x)},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nto yield (after simplification)\n:<math>\n  \\quad (6) \\qquad e^{a\\Delta t} = 1 + r \\left(e^{ik_m \\Delta x} + e^{-ik_m \\Delta x} -  2\\right).\n</math>\n\nUsing the identities\n:<math>\n  \\qquad \\sin\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right)= \\frac{e^{ik_m \\Delta x/2} - e^{-ik_m \\Delta x/2}}{2i} \\qquad \\rightarrow \\qquad \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{ e^{ik_m \\Delta x} + e^{-ik_m \\Delta x} -  2 }{4}\n</math>\nequation (6) may be written as\n:<math>\n  \\quad (7) \\qquad e^{a\\Delta t} = 1 - 4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2)\n</math>\nDefine the amplification factor\n:<math>\n  G \\equiv \\frac{\\epsilon_j^{n+1}}{\\epsilon_j^n}\n</math>\nThe necessary and sufficient condition for the error to remain bounded is that <math>\\vert G \\vert \\leq 1.</math> \nHowever,\n:<math>\n  \\quad (8) \\qquad G = \\frac{e^{a(t+\\Delta t)} e^{ik_m x}}{e^{at} e^{ik_m x}} = e^{a\\Delta t}\n</math>\nThus, from equations (7) and (8), the condition for stability is given by\n:<math>\n  \\quad (9) \\qquad \\left\\vert 1 - 4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2) \\right\\vert \\leq 1\n</math>\nNote that the term <math>4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2)</math> is always positive.  Thus, to satisfy Equation (9):\n:<math>\n  \\quad (10) \\qquad  4 r \\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2) \\leq 2\n</math>\nFor the above condition to hold for all <math>m</math>  (and therefore all <math>\\sin^2 (k_m \\Delta x/2)</math>), we have\n:<math>\n  \\quad (11) \\qquad r=\\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\left( \\Delta x \\right)^2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}  \n</math>\nEquation (11) gives the stability requirement for the [[FTCS scheme]] as applied to one-dimensional heat equation. It says that for a given <math>\\Delta x</math>, the allowed value of <math>\\Delta t</math> must be small enough to satisfy equation (10).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Numerical analysis]]\n[[Category:Fourier analysis]]\n", "name_user": "Dutta.alankar1996", "label": "safe", "comment": "Small edit for better clarification of a mathematical step.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_stability_analysis"}
