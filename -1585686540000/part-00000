After working as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer in the 1980s, he signed with [[Epic Records]]' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, five of which peaked at number one: his debut release \"[[Home (Joe Diffie song)|Home]]\", \"[[If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)]]\", \"[[Third Rock from the Sun (song)|Third Rock from the Sun]]\", \"[[Pickup Man]]\" (his longest-lasting number-one song, at four weeks) and \"[[Bigger Than the Beatles]]\". In addition to these singles, he had 12 others reach the top 10 and ten more reach the top 40 on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for [[Holly Dunn]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Jo Dee Messina]], and recorded with [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[George Jones]], and [[Marty Stuart]].\n\nDiffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album, and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through [[Monument Records]], [[Broken Bow Records]], and [[Rounder Records]]. Among his albums, 1993's ''[[Honky Tonk Attitude]]'' and 1994's ''[[Third Rock from the Sun]]'' are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while 1992's ''[[Regular Joe (album)|Regular Joe]]'' and 1995's ''[[Life's So Funny]]'' are both certified gold. His album, ''[[Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album]]'', was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a [[neotraditionalist country]] influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Diffie was born into a musical family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1958.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His first musical performance came at age 14, when he performed in his Aunt Dawn Anita's country music band.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-diffie-mn0000787960/biography |title=Joe Diffie biography |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Diffie's father, Joe R., played guitar and banjo, and his mother sang.

Although he initially earned credits toward medical school, he decided against a medical profession after marrying for the first time in 1977 and ultimately dropped out before graduation.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie first worked in oil fields, then drove a truck that pumped concrete in the oilfield in [[Alice, Texas]], before he moved back to Duncan to work in a [[foundry]]. During this period, he worked as a musician on the side, first in a gospel group called Higher Purpose, and then in a bluegrass band called Special Edition.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie then built a recording studio, began touring with Special Edition in adjacent states, and sent [[demo (music)|demonstration]] recordings to publishers in [[Nashville]].

The feelings were reciprocated leading Debbie Jones to file for a legal separation followed by a divorce that became final in 1996. \n\nIn 2000, Diffie married Theresa ([[Birth name|n\u00e9e]] Crump), whom he met at a concert, at the [[Opryland Hotel]] in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1476778/joe-diffie-ties-the-knot.jhtml |title=Joe Diffie Ties the Knot |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |work=CMT.com}}</ref><ref name=\"crump\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/119215455.html?dids=119215455:119215455&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+11%2C+2002&author=Alan+Sculley+Special+to+The+Morning+Call+--+Freelance&pub=Morning+Call&desc=Just+being+himself+makes+a+difference+for+Joe+Diffie&pqatl=google|title=Just being himself makes a difference for Joe Diffie|last=Sculley|first=Alan|date=May 11, 2002|work=Morning Call|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}</ref> They have one daughter, Kylie, born in 2004.<ref name=\"tougher1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=399|title=Joe Diffie is tougher than nails (page 1)|last=McIntosh|first=Dan|date=June 2004|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}</ref> The couple divorced in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tncourts.gov/sites/default/files/diffie.joe_.opn_.pdf|title=JOE LOGAN DIFFIE v.

After working as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer in the 1980s, he signed with [[Epic Records]]' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, five of which peaked at number one: his debut release \"[[Home (Joe Diffie song)|Home]]\", \"[[If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)]]\", \"[[Third Rock from the Sun (song)|Third Rock from the Sun]]\", \"[[Pickup Man]]\" (his longest-lasting number-one song, at four weeks) and \"[[Bigger Than the Beatles]]\". In addition to these singles, he had 12 others reach the top 10 and ten more reach the top 40 on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for [[Holly Dunn]], [[Tim McGraw]], and [[Jo Dee Messina]], and recorded with [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[George Jones]], and [[Marty Stuart]].\n\nDiffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album, and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through [[Monument Records]], [[Broken Bow Records]], and [[Rounder Records]]. Among his albums, 1993's ''[[Honky Tonk Attitude]]'' and 1994's ''[[Third Rock from the Sun]]'' are [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while 1992's ''[[Regular Joe (album)|Regular Joe]]'' and 1995's ''[[Life's So Funny]]'' are both certified gold. His album, ''[[Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album]]'', was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a [[neotraditionalist country]] influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads.\n\n==Early life==\nJoe Diffie was born into a musical family in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1958.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His first musical performance came at age 14, when he performed in his Aunt Dawn Anita's country music band.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-diffie-mn0000787960/biography |title=Joe Diffie biography |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |last=Huey |first=Steve |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Diffie's father, Joe R., played guitar and banjo, and his mother sang.

In his last two years in high school, Diffie played football, baseball, and golf in addition to running track; in his senior year, he was recognized as Best All-Around Male Athlete.<ref name=\"stambler\" />\n\nAfter graduating, he attended [[Cameron University]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. Although he initially earned credits toward medical school, he decided against a medical profession after marrying for the first time in 1977 and ultimately dropped out before graduation.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie first worked in oil fields, then drove a truck that pumped concrete in the oilfield in [[Alice, Texas]], before he moved back to Duncan to work in a [[foundry]]. During this period, he worked as a musician on the side, first in a gospel group called Higher Purpose, and then in a bluegrass band called Special Edition.<ref name=\"stambler\" /> Diffie then built a recording studio, began touring with Special Edition in adjacent states, and sent [[demo (music)|demonstration]] recordings to publishers in [[Nashville]].

He had been the city secretary, and was probably his patron. His successor, Johan van Schuylenburgh, who became city secretary in 1712, was the man to whom Houbraken [[:File:Schouburg VI dedication.JPG|dedicated the first volume of his ''Schouburg'']].\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 003.jpg|thumb|\"Cutting the Feather\" c. 1660, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], Budapest]]\n\nOstade was the contemporary io'''FTugkilrs''' the Flemish painters [[David Teniers the Younger]] and  [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and . Like them, he spent his life in  delineation of the homeliest subjects: tavern scenes, village fairs and country quarters. Between Teniers and Ostade the contrast lies in the different condition of the agricultural classes of [[North Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Holland]] and in the atmosphere and dwellings peculiar to each region. Brabant has more sun and more comfort; Teniers, in consequence, is silvery and sparkling, and the people he paints are fair specimens of their culture. Holland, in the vicinity of Haarlem, seems to have suffered much from war; the air is moist and hazy, and the people depicted by Ostade are short and ill-favoured, marked with adversity's stamp in feature and dress.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nBrouwer, who painted the peasant in his frolics and passions, brought more of the spirit of Frans Hals into his depictions than did his colleague; but the type is the same as Ostade's. During the first years of his career, Ostade tended toward the same exaggeration and frolic as his comrade, though he is distinguished from his rival by a more general use of light and shade, especially a greater concentration of light on a small surface in contrast with a broad expanse of gloom. The key of his harmonies remained for a time in the scale of greys, but his treatment is dry and careful in a style which shuns no difficulties of detail. He shows us the cottages, inside and out: vine leaves cloak the poverty of the outer walls; indoors, nothing decorates the patchwork of rafters and thatch, the tumble-down chimneys and the ladder staircases, the rustic Dutch home of those days. The greatness of Ostade lies in how often he caught the poetic side of the peasant class in spite of its coarseness. He gave the magic light of a sun-gleam to their lowly sports, their quarrels, even their quieter moods of enjoyment; he clothed the wreck of the cottages with gay vegetation.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIt was natural, given the tendency to effect which marked Ostade from the first, that he should have been fired by emulation to rival the masterpieces of [[Rembrandt]]. His early pictures are not so rare but that we can trace how he glided from one period to the other. Before the dispersal of the {{ill|Jakob Gsell|de}} collection at [[Vienna]] in 1872, it was easy to study the steel-grey harmonies, the exaggerated caricature of his early works between 1632 and 1638. There is a picture in the [[Vienna Gallery]] of a ''Countryman Having his Tooth Drawn'', unsigned, and painted about 1632; a \"Bagpiper\" of 1635 in the [[Liechtenstein Gallery]] at Vienna; cottage scenes of 1635 and 1636 in the museums of [[Karlsruhe]], [[Darmstadt]], and [[Dresden]]; and the ''Card Players'' of 1637 in the Liechtenstein palace at Vienna, making up for the loss of the Gsell collection. The same style marks most of those pieces.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The painter in his workshop (selfportrait)'' (1663), at the [[Semper Gallery]], Dresden]]\nAbout 1638 or 1640, the influence of Rembrandt suddenly changed his style. He painted the ''[[Annunciation]]'' of the Brunswick Museum: angels, appearing in the sky to Dutch boors half-asleep amidst their cattle, sheep and dogs in front of a cottage, recall at once the similar subject by Rembrandt, who effectively lighted the principal groups by rays propelled to earth from a murky sky. Ostade, however, did not succeed here in giving dramatic force and expression; his shepherds were without much emotion, passion or surprise.

Ostade was more at home in a similar effect applied to the commonplace incident of the ''Slaughtering of a Pig'', one of the masterpieces of 1643, and once in the Gsell collection. In this and similar subjects of the previous and succeeding years, he returned to the homely themes in which his power and wonderful observation had made him a master. He does not seem to have gone back to [[gospel]] illustrations until 1667, when he produced an admirable ''Nativity'' which is only surpassed in arrangement and colour by Rembrandt's ''Carpenter's Family'' at the Louvre, or by the ''Woodcutter and Children'' in the gallery of [[Kassel|Cassel]]. Almost innumerable are the more familiar themes to which he devoted his brush during this interval: from small single figures, representing smokers or drinkers, to allegories of the five senses ([[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] galleries), half-lengths of fishmongers and bakers, cottage brawls, scenes of gambling, itinerant players and quacks, and ninepins players in the open air.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 011.jpg|thumb|''Resting Travelers'' (1671), at the [[Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam]]]]\nThe humor in some of these pieces is contagious, as in the ''Tavern Scene'' of the [[Louis La Caze|La Caze Collection]] (Louvre, 1653).

At his death, the stock of his unsold pieces was over 200. His engraved plates were put up to auction with the pictures. Fifty etched plates, most of them dated 1647\u20131648, were disposed of in 1686. there are 220 of his pictures in public and private collections, of which 104 are signed and dated, while seventeen are signed with the name but not with the date.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The prices which Ostade received are not known; but pictures which were worth \u00a340 in 1750 were worth \u00a31,000 a century later, and Earl Dudley gave \u00a34,120 for a cottage interior in 1876.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe signatures of Ostade vary at different periods, but the first two letters are generally interlaced.

He had been the city secretary, and was probably his patron. His successor, Johan van Schuylenburgh, who became city secretary in 1712, was the man to whom Houbraken [[:File:Schouburg VI dedication.JPG|dedicated the first volume of his ''Schouburg'']].\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 003.jpg|thumb|\"Cutting the Feather\" c. 1660, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], Budapest]]\n\nOstade was the contemporary of the Flemish painters [[David Teniers the Younger]] and  [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and . Like them, he spent his life in  delineation of the homeliest subjects: tavern scenes, village fairs and country quarters. Between Teniers and Ostade the contrast lies in the different condition of the agricultural classes of [[North Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Holland]] and in the atmosphere and dwellings peculiar to each region. Brabant has more sun and more comfort; Teniers, in consequence, is silvery and sparkling, and the people he paints are fair specimens of their culture. Holland, in the vicinity of Haarlem, seems to have suffered much from war; the air is moist and hazy, and the people depicted by Ostade are short and ill-favoured, marked with adversity's stamp in feature and dress.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nBrouwer, who painted the peasant in his frolics and passions, brought more of the spirit of Frans Hals into his depictions than did his colleague; but the type is the same as Ostade's. During the first years of his career, Ostade tended toward the same exaggeration and frolic as his comrade, though he is distinguished from his rival by a more general use of light and shade, especially a greater concentration of light on a small surface in contrast with a broad expanse of gloom. The key of his harmonies remained for a time in the scale of greys, but his treatment is dry and careful in a style which shuns no difficulties of detail. He shows us the cottages, inside and out: vine leaves cloak the poverty of the outer walls; indoors, nothing decorates the patchwork of rafters and thatch, the tumble-down chimneys and the ladder staircases, the rustic Dutch home of those days. The greatness of Ostade lies in how often he caught the poetic side of the peasant class in spite of its coarseness. He gave the magic light of a sun-gleam to their lowly sports, their quarrels, even their quieter moods of enjoyment; he clothed the wreck of the cottages with gay vegetation.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIt was natural, given the tendency to effect which marked Ostade from the first, that he should have been fired by emulation to rival the masterpieces of [[Rembrandt]]. His early pictures are not so rare but that we can trace how he glided from one period to the other. Before the dispersal of the {{ill|Jakob Gsell|de}} collection at [[Vienna]] in 1872, it was easy to study the steel-grey harmonies, the exaggerated caricature of his early works between 1632 and 1638. There is a picture in the [[Vienna Gallery]] of a ''Countryman Having his Tooth Drawn'', unsigned, and painted about 1632; a \"Bagpiper\" of 1635 in the [[Liechtenstein Gallery]] at Vienna; cottage scenes of 1635 and 1636 in the museums of [[Karlsruhe]], [[Darmstadt]], and [[Dresden]]; and the ''Card Players'' of 1637 in the Liechtenstein palace at Vienna, making up for the loss of the Gsell collection. The same style marks most of those pieces.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The painter in his workshop (selfportrait)'' (1663), at the [[Semper Gallery]], Dresden]]\nAbout 1638 or 1640, the influence of Rembrandt suddenly changed his style. He painted the ''[[Annunciation]]'' of the Brunswick Museum: angels, appearing in the sky to Dutch boors half-asleep amidst their cattle, sheep and dogs in front of a cottage, recall at once the similar subject by Rembrandt, who effectively lighted the principal groups by rays propelled to earth from a murky sky. Ostade, however, did not succeed here in giving dramatic force and expression; his shepherds were without much emotion, passion or surprise. His picture was an effect of light, and masterly as such, in its sketchy rubbings of dark brown tone relieved by strongly impasted lights, but without the very qualities which made his usual subjects attractive.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1642 he painted the beautiful interior at the Louvre:<ref>Among the treasures of the [[Louvre]] is a striking picture of a father sitting in state, his wife at his side, surrounded by his son, five daughters, and a young married couple in a handsomely furnished room.

In a close and highly fractured election, U.S. Representative [[Ed Koch]] finished first with 19.81% of the vote and Cuomo came second with 18.74%. As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%.

He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary. This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as \"sterile\" and lamented the thought of having to live in \"the small town\" of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] as governor, saying it was \"a city without a good Chinese restaurant\".<ref name=\"marioeffect\"/> Cuomo won the primary by ten points and faced Republican nominee businessman [[Lewis Lehrman]] in the general election.

In October 1991, news broke that he was interested in running and was taking advice from consultant [[Bob Shrum]]. At the same time, he began working on a budget with the [[New York State Legislature]], and promised not to make any announcements about a presidential run until he had reached an agreement with the Republican-controlled [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] and the Democratic-controlled [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]]. Two polls taken in November of the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992|New Hampshire Democratic primary]] showed him leading the field by at least twenty points, and a poll in December showed him trailing President [[George H.

In this election, Republicans attacked him for the weak economic recovery within the state since the early 1990s recession and the resulting high unemployment as well as his opposition to the death penalty by highlighting the case of [[Arthur Shawcross]], a multiple murderer convicted of manslaughter who was paroled by the state in 1987 and while on release became a serial killer. Republicans were able to associate Shawcross with Cuomo much like [[Willie Horton]] with [[Michael Dukakis]] six years earlier. Cuomo was defeated by [[George Pataki]] in the [[Republican Revolution|1994 Republican landslide]], taking 45.4% of the vote to Pataki's 48.8%. Cuomo lost mainly because his support outside of New York City all but vanished; he only carried one county outside the Five Boroughs, [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]].\n\nCuomo and fellow Democrat [[Ann Richards]], the [[Governor of Texas]] who had been defeated in her re-election campaign by [[George W.

He was the first governor to support an ecological approach to families which was represented by [[community integration]] and community development as the goal of deinstitutionalization.\n\nHealthcare was also an area that Cuomo improved as governor, implementing initiatives that succeeded in reducing costs of prescription medications.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />  This endeavor assisted senior citizens in making the medications more affordable.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />  Under Cuomo's leadership, a public health plan that tackled the AIDS epidemic was the most intense in the nation.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />\n\nOverseeing programs for environmental preservation and conservation, Cuomo implemented aggressive initiatives in these areas.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />  Under Cuomo's leadership, New York State was the first in the United States to integrate both environmental protection and energy conservation goals.<ref name=\"Greiner\" />\n\nCuomo's progressivism was also evident in his appointments of judges to the [[New York Court of Appeals]].

In a close and highly fractured election, U.S. Representative [[Ed Koch]] finished first with 19.81% of the vote and Cuomo came second with 18.74%. As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%.

He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic primary. This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and upstate New York as \"sterile\" and lamented the thought of having to live in \"the small town\" of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] as governor, saying it was \"a city without a good Chinese restaurant\".<ref name=\"marioeffect\"/> Cuomo won the primary by ten points and faced Republican nominee businessman [[Lewis Lehrman]] in the general election.

In October 1991, news broke that he was interested in running and was taking advice from consultant [[Bob Shrum]]. At the same time, he began working on a budget with the [[New York State Legislature]], and promised not to make any announcements about a presidential run until he had reached an agreement with the Republican-controlled [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] and the Democratic-controlled [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]]. Two polls taken in November of the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992|New Hampshire Democratic primary]] showed him leading the field by at least twenty points, and a poll in December showed him trailing President [[George H.

In this election, Republicans attacked him for the weak economic recovery within the state since the early 1990s recession and the resulting high unemployment as well as his opposition to the death penalty by highlighting the case of [[Arthur Shawcross]], a multiple murderer convicted of manslaughter who was paroled by the state in 1987 and while on release became a serial killer. Republicans were able to associate Shawcross with Cuomo much like [[Willie Horton]] with [[Michael Dukakis]] six years earlier. Cuomo was defeated by [[George Pataki]] in the [[Republican Revolution|1994 Republican landslide]], taking 45.4% of the vote to Pataki's 48.8%. Cuomo lost mainly because his support outside of New York City all but vanished; he only carried one county outside the Five Boroughs, [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]].\n\nCuomo and fellow Democrat [[Ann Richards]], the [[Governor of Texas]] who had been defeated in her re-election campaign by [[George W.

Aneurysms and dissections also can occur in [[artery|arteries]] other than the aorta. Because aneurysms in children tend to rupture early, children are at greater risk for dying if the syndrome is not identified. [[Surgery]] to repair aortic aneurysms is essential for treatment.\n\nThere are five types of the syndrome, labelled types I through V, which are distinguished by their genetic cause. Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4 and Type 5 are caused by [[mutation]]s in ''[[TGFBR1]]'', ''[[TGFBR2]]'', ''[[SMAD3]]'', ''[[TGFB2]]'', and ''[[TGFB3]]'' respectively. These five [[genes]] encoding [[transforming growth factor]]s play a role in [[cell signaling]] that promotes growth and development of the body's [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Mutations of these genes cause production of proteins without function. The skin cells for individuals with Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome are not able to produce collagen, the protein that allows skin cells to be strong and elastic. This causes these individuals to be susceptible to different tears in the skin such as hernias. Although the disorder has an autosomal pattern of [[inheritance]], this disorder results from a new gene mutation in 75% of cases and occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In other cases it is inherited from one affected parent.<ref name=\"NLM\">{{NLM|loeys-dietz-syndrome}}</ref>\n\nLoeys\u2013Dietz syndrome was identified and characterized by pediatric geneticists Bart Loeys and Harry \"Hal\" Dietz at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 2005.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThere is considerable variability in the phenotype of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome, from mild features to severe systemic abnormalities. The primary manifestations of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome are arterial tortuosity (winding course of blood vessels), widely spaced eyes ([[hypertelorism]]), wide or split [[uvula]], and aneurysms at the aortic root. Other features may include [[cleft palate]] and a blue/gray appearance of the white of the eyes. Cardiac defects and [[club foot]] may be noted at birth.<ref>{{cite web |title=Loeys-Dietz Syndrome |url=https://www.marfan.org/loeys-dietz |website=The Marfan Foundation |language=en |date=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere is overlap in the manifestations of Loeys\u2013Dietz and Marfan syndromes, including increased risk of [[aortic aneurysm|ascending aortic aneurysm]] and [[aortic dissection]], abnormally long limbs and fingers, and [[dural ectasia]] (a gradual stretching and weakening of the [[dura mater]] that can cause abdominal and leg pain). Findings of hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), bifid or split [[uvula]], and skin findings such as easy [[bruise|bruising]] or abnormal [[scar]]s may distinguish Loeys\u2013Dietz from Marfan syndrome.\n\nAffected individuals often develop immune system related problems such as allergies to food, asthma, hay fever, and inflammatory disorders such as eczema or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nFindings of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome may include:\n*Skeletal/spinal malformations: [[Craniosynostosis|craniosynositosis]], [[Scoliosis]], spinal instability and spondylolisthesis, [[Kyphosis]]\n*Sternal abnormalities: [[pectus excavatum]], [[pectus carinatum]]\n*Contractures of fingers and toes ([[camptodactyly]])\n*Long fingers and lax joints\n*Weakened or missing eye muscles ([[strabismus]])\n*[[Club foot]]\n*Premature fusion of the skull bones ([[craniosynostosis]])\n*Joint hypermobility\n*Congenital heart problems including [[patent ductus arteriosus]] (connection between the aorta and the lung circulation) and [[atrial septal defect]] (connection between heart chambers)\n*Translucency of the skin with velvety texture\n*Abnormal junction of the brain and medulla ([[Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation]])\n*Bicuspid [[aortic valves]]\n*Criss-crossed pulmonary arteries\n\n==Cause==\n===Types===\nSeveral genetic causes of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome have been identified. A ''de novo'' mutation in [[TGFB3]], a ligand of the TGF \u00df pathway, was identified in an individual with a syndrome presenting partially overlapping symptoms with Marfan Syndrome and Loeys\u2013Dietz Syndrome.<ref>Rienhoff HY, Yeo C-Y, Morissette R, Khrebtukova I, Melnick J, Luo S, Leng N, Kim Y-J, Schroth G, Westwick J, Vogel H, McDonnell N, Hall JG, Whitman M. 2013.

Presence of split uvula is a differentiating characteristic from Marfan Syndrome, as well as the severity of the heart defects. Loeys\u2013Dietz Syndrome patients have more severe heart involvement and it is advised that they be treated for enlarged aorta earlier due to the increased risk of early rupture in Loeys\u2013Dietz patients. Because different people express different combinations of symptoms and the syndrome was first identified in 2005, many doctors may not be aware of its existence.\n\n==Treatment==\nAs there is no known cure, Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome is a lifelong condition. Due to the high risk of death from aortic aneurysm rupture, patients should be followed closely to monitor aneurysm formation, which can then be corrected with [[interventional radiology]] or [[vascular surgery]].\n\nPrevious research in laboratory [[mouse|mice]] has suggested that the [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] [[losartan]], which appears to block TGF-beta activity, can slow or halt the formation of aortic aneurysms in Marfan syndrome. A large [[clinical trial]] sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]] is currently underway to explore the use of losartan to prevent aneurysms in Marfan syndrome patients.

Aneurysms and dissections also can occur in [[artery|arteries]] other than the aorta. Because aneurysms in children tend to rupture early, children are at greater risk for dying if the syndrome is not identified. [[Surgery]] to repair aortic aneurysms is essential for treatment.\n\nThere are five types of the syndrome, labelled types I through V, which are distinguished by their genetic cause. Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4 and Type 5 are caused by [[mutation]]s in ''[[TGFBR1]]'', ''[[TGFBR2]]'', ''[[SMAD3]]'', ''[[TGFB2]]'', and ''[[TGFB3]]'' respectively. These five [[genes]] encoding [[transforming growth factor]]s play a role in [[cell signaling]] that promotes growth and development of the body's [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Mutations of these genes cause production of proteins without function. The skin cells for individuals with Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome are not able to produce collagen, the protein that allows skin cells to be strong and elastic. This causes these individuals to be susceptible to different tears in the skin such as hernias. Although the disorder has an autosomal pattern of [[inheritance]], this disorder results from a new gene mutation in 75% of cases and occurs in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In other cases it is inherited from one affected parent.<ref name=\"NLM\">{{NLM|loeys-dietz-syndrome}}</ref>\n\nLoeys\u2013Dietz syndrome was identified and characterized by pediatric geneticists Bart Loeys and Harry \"Hal\" Dietz at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 2005.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThere is considerable variability in the phenotype of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome, from mild features to severe systemic abnormalities. The primary manifestations of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome are arterial tortuosity (winding course of blood vessels), widely spaced eyes ([[hypertelorism]]), wide or split [[uvula]], and aneurysms at the aortic root. Other features may include [[cleft palate]] and a blue/gray appearance of the white of the eyes. Cardiac defects and [[club foot]] may be noted at birth.<ref>{{cite web |title=Loeys-Dietz Syndrome |url=https://www.marfan.org/loeys-dietz |website=The Marfan Foundation |language=en |date=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere is overlap in the manifestations of Loeys\u2013Dietz and Marfan syndromes, including increased risk of [[aortic aneurysm|ascending aortic aneurysm]] and [[aortic dissection]], abnormally long limbs and fingers, and [[dural ectasia]] (a gradual stretching and weakening of the [[dura mater]] that can cause abdominal and leg pain). Findings of hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), bifid or split [[uvula]], and skin findings such as easy [[bruise|bruising]] or abnormal [[scar]]s may distinguish Loeys\u2013Dietz from Marfan syndrome.\n\nAffected individuals often develop immune system related problems such as allergies to food, asthma, hay fever, and inflammatory disorders such as eczema or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nFindings of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome may include:\n*Skeletal/spinal malformations: [[Craniosynostosis|craniosynositosis]], [[Scoliosis]], spinal instability and spondylolisthesis, [[Kyphosis]]\n*Sternal abnormalities: [[pectus excavatum]], [[pectus carinatum]]\n*Contractures of fingers and toes ([[camptodactyly]])\n*Long fingers and lax joints\n*Weakened or missing eye muscles ([[strabismus]])\n*[[Club foot]]\n*Premature fusion of the skull bones ([[craniosynostosis]])\n*Joint hypermobility\n*Congenital heart problems including [[patent ductus arteriosus]] (connection between the aorta and the lung circulation) and [[atrial septal defect]] (connection between heart chambers)\n*Translucency of the skin with velvety texture\n*Abnormal junction of the brain and medulla ([[Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation]])\n*Bicuspid [[aortic valves]]\n*Criss-crossed pulmonary arteries\n\n==Cause==\n===Types===\nSeveral genetic causes of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome have been identified. A ''de novo'' mutation in [[TGFB3]], a ligand of the TGF \u00df pathway, was identified in an individual with a syndrome presenting partially overlapping symptoms with Marfan Syndrome and Loeys\u2013Dietz Syndrome.<ref>Rienhoff HY, Yeo C-Y, Morissette R, Khrebtukova I, Melnick J, Luo S, Leng N, Kim Y-J, Schroth G, Westwick J, Vogel H, McDonnell N, Hall JG, Whitman M. 2013.

Presence of split uvula is a differentiating characteristic from Marfan Syndrome, as well as the severity of the heart defects. Loeys\u2013Dietz Syndrome patients have more severe heart involvement and it is advised that they be treated for enlarged aorta earlier due to the increased risk of early rupture in Loeys\u2013Dietz patients. Because different people express different combinations of symptoms and the syndrome was first identified in 2005, many doctors may not be aware of its existence.\n\n==Treatment==\nAs there is no known cure, Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome is a lifelong condition. Due to the high risk of death from aortic aneurysm rupture, patients should be followed closely to monitor aneurysm formation, which can then be corrected with [[interventional radiology]] or [[vascular surgery]].\n\nPrevious research in laboratory [[mouse|mice]] has suggested that the [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] [[losartan]], which appears to block TGF-beta activity, can slow or halt the formation of aortic aneurysms in Marfan syndrome. A large [[clinical trial]] sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]] is currently underway to explore the use of losartan to prevent aneurysms in Marfan syndrome patients. Both Marfan syndrome and Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome are associated with increased TGF-beta signaling in the vessel wall. Therefore, losartan also holds promise for the treatment of Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome. In those patients in which losartan is not halting the growth of the aorta, irbesartan has been shown to work and is currently also being studied and prescribed for some patients with this condition.\n\nIf an increased heart rate is present, atenolol is sometimes prescribed to reduce the heart rate to prevent any extra pressure on the tissue of the aorta.

Santa Rita houses the majority of persons arrested in [[Alameda County]], in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and includes the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] and [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. Santa Rita is not the only prison facility in the vicinity as the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin]] is located on the premises of Camp Parks.\n\nThe original Santa Rita Jail was constructed in 1947 on a retired WWII training base near the current site. By 1983, overcrowding had become an issue, and plans were established for the construction of the current $172 million facility, which opened in 1989. Funding for the jail's construction was obtained through state bonds as well as local county matching funds.\n\nThe current {{convert|113|acre|km2|sing=on}}<ref name=\"CHPcenter\" /> facility is laid out in a modern decentralized \"campus\" design, similar to many modern prisons, one-half mile long by one-quarter mile wide. The facility has 18 separate, self-contained housing units, a \"core\" building containing central booking, release and administration, and a service building containing the laundry, commissary, kitchen and warehouses. Santa Rita is the third largest jail in California and the fifth largest in the [[United States]], and is considered a \"mega-jail\", specified to hold 4,000 prisoners at any one time, making it as large or larger than many California [[list of California state prisons|state prisons]]. An automatic robotic cart system moves all meals, laundry, commissary items, supplies and garbage through the jail, allowing maximal restriction of prisoner movement throughout the facility.<ref name=\"FuelCellFactSheet\" /> A 1.2 [[megawatt]] peak-power [[solar power|solar]] array was installed in Spring 2002 on the roofs of the housing units,<ref name=\"CHPcenter\">{{cite web|title=Alameda County Santa Rita jail 1 MW fuel cell CHP system|url=http://www.chpcentermw.org/rac_profiles/pacific/SantaRitaJail.pdf|publisher=Pacific Region Combined Heat and Power Application Center|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> supplying nearly one half of the jail's power demand during daylight hours.<ref name=\"FuelCellFactSheet\">{{cite web|title=Santa Rita Jail Fuel Cell Power Plant|url=http://www.acgov.org/sustain/documents/fuelcellfactsheet.pdf|publisher=County Of Alameda, California|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> In May 2006, the Chevron Energy Solutions deployed a 1-[[megawatt]] [[fuel cell]] system that generates 8,000,000&nbsp;[[kWh]] of electricity and {{convert|1.4|e6Btu|kWh}} of waste heat (50% and 18% of Jail's needs, respectively) from natural gas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alameda County Santa Rita Jail Fuel Cell Project Overview|url=http://www.acgov.org/sustain/documents/fuelcelloverview.pdf|publisher=[[Alameda County]]|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Bomb range==\nThe [[Alameda County Sheriff's Office]] bomb range is located behind the Santa Rita Jail.<ref>Paul Thissen, [http://www.contracostatimes.com/top-stories/ci_19483521 \"Errant 'MythBusters' cannonball hits home in Dublin\"], ''Contra Costa Times'', December 2011</ref>\n\nIt has come into the public eye by being featured in many episodes of [[MythBusters]], and named as their #1 favorite location in their [[MythBusters (2011 season)#Special 2 - Location, Location, Location|Top 12 Favorite Locations special]].

Santa Rita houses the majority of persons arrested in [[Alameda County]], in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and includes the cities of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]], [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] and [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. Santa Rita is not the only prison facility in the vicinity as the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin]] is located on the premises of Camp Parks.\n\nThe original Santa Rita Jail was constructed in 1947 on a retired WWII training base near the current site.  By 1983, overcrowding had become an issue, and plans were established for the construction of the current $172 million facility, which opened in 1989. Funding for the jail's construction was obtained through state bonds as well as local county matching funds.\n\nThe current {{convert|113|acre|km2|sing=on}}<ref name=\"CHPcenter\" /> facility is laid out in a modern decentralized \"campus\" design, similar to many modern prisons, one-half mile long by one-quarter mile wide. The facility has 18 separate, self-contained housing units, a \"core\" building containing central booking, release and administration, and a service building containing the laundry, commissary, kitchen and warehouses. Santa Rita is the third largest jail in California and the fifth largest in the [[United States]], and is considered a \"mega-jail\", specified to hold 4,000 prisoners at any one time, making it as large or larger than many California [[list of California state prisons|state prisons]]. An automatic robotic cart system moves all meals, laundry, commissary items, supplies and garbage through the jail, allowing maximal restriction of prisoner movement throughout the facility.<ref name=\"FuelCellFactSheet\" /> A 1.2 [[megawatt]] peak-power [[solar power|solar]] array was installed in Spring 2002 on the roofs of the housing units,<ref name=\"CHPcenter\">{{cite web|title=Alameda County Santa Rita jail 1 MW fuel cell CHP system|url=http://www.chpcentermw.org/rac_profiles/pacific/SantaRitaJail.pdf|publisher=Pacific Region Combined Heat and Power Application Center|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> supplying nearly one half of the jail's power demand during daylight hours.<ref name=\"FuelCellFactSheet\">{{cite web|title=Santa Rita Jail Fuel Cell Power Plant|url=http://www.acgov.org/sustain/documents/fuelcellfactsheet.pdf|publisher=County Of Alameda, California|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> In May 2006, the Chevron Energy Solutions deployed a 1-[[megawatt]] [[fuel cell]] system that generates 8,000,000 [[kWh]] of electricity and {{convert|1.4|e6Btu|kWh}} of waste heat (50% and 18% of Jail's needs, respectively) from natural gas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alameda County Santa Rita Jail FUEL CELL PROJECT Overview|url=http://www.acgov.org/sustain/documents/fuelcelloverview.pdf|publisher=[[Alameda County]]|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Bomb range==\nThe [[Alameda County Sheriff's Office]] bomb range is located behind the Santa Rita Jail.<ref>Paul Thissen, [http://www.contracostatimes.com/top-stories/ci_19483521 \"Errant 'MythBusters' cannonball hits home in Dublin\"], ''Contra Costa Times'', December 2011</ref>\n\nIt has come into the public eye by being featured in many episodes of [[MythBusters]], and named as their #1 favorite location in their [[MythBusters (2011 season)#Special 2 - Location, Location, Location|Top 12 Favorite Locations special]].
