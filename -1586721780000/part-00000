Young will often travel far in search of mating sites, new habitat, or new food sources, as do elder turtles.\n\n==Conservation status==\nThe primary threat to Blanding's turtle is habitat fragmentation and destruction as well as nest predation by unnaturally large populations of predators.<ref name=iucn/> It is listed as an [[endangered species]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]<ref name=iucn/> as endangered in some U.S. states, and as either threatened or endangered throughout Canada, though it has no federal status in the U.S. The Blanding's turtle is also not currently listed under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) protection, but is under consideration as of 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/international/cites/cop16/cop16-proposal-appendix-ii-listing-of-blandings-turtle.pdf|title=CONSIDERATION OF PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS TO APPENDICES I AND II|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The U.S. states in which it is considered endangered are [[Indiana]],<ref name=312iac>{{Cite web|author=Indiana Legislative Services Agency|year=2011|title=312 IAC 9-5-4: Endangered species of reptiles and amphibians|work=Indiana Administrative Code|accessdate=28 Apr 2012|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/iac/}}</ref> [[Illinois]], [[List of endangered species in Missouri|Missouri]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Endangered Species in the Field Guide|url=http://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/endangered-species/endangered-species-field-guide|website=Discover Nature Field Guide|publisher=MO Dept. of Conservation|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[South Dakota]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubstorage.sdstate.edu/agbio_publications/articles/ec919.pdf|title=A Field Guide to South Dakota Turtles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=South Dakota State University|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021133339/http://pubstorage.sdstate.edu/AgBio_Publications/articles/EC919.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is considered threatened in [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Blanding's Turtle Fact Sheet|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/7166.html|publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Blanding's turtle is also fully protected in [[Michigan]] as a special concern species, and is not to be collected or harmed.<ref>[http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10370_12145_12201-60647--,00.html Blanding's Turtle (''Emys blandingii'', DNR, Michigan]</ref> In Nebraska, this turtle is uncommon in the eastern portion of the state, but common to abundant in the Sand Hills region lakes, ponds, and streams.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, Things started to turn around when new manager and former 1928 Italy national team Olympian Fulvio Bernardini took his place on the Bologna touchline. On his resume, was Fiorentina's 1956 Serie A championship. On his arrival at the club, the side was already well stocked with talented players, but a few crucial ingredients were missing that would make Bologna true title contenders once again. Bernardini made several quality acquisition, such as the purchase of Harald Nielsen, a Denmark Olympic squad member who caught Bologna's eye at the Rome 1960 Games. Helmut Haller, the German international, also came on board. Like Nielsen, Haller was an amateur player who divided his time between football and driving a truck for a living. The clubs owner, Renato Dall\u2019Ara, personally went to Germany to sign the player. However, on his way back to Italy, Dall\u2019Ara's car skidded off the road and crashed into a ditch. Without missing a beat, the old man emerged from the wreck waving Haller's contract and shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the accident, what matters is that we got this piece of paper signed!\u201d\n\nThe next season, Haller and teammates like Ezio Pascutti with his spectacular diving headers delighted the Bologna faithful. However, they still only managed a forth place finish and the finger was pointed at goalkeeper  Santarelli, who at times was guity of poor mistakes. The finishing touch came with the purchase of former Italy national team goalkeeper William Negri. Three wins a row launched the 1963/64 season, and despite a stuttering start after that, it was a win over Genoa that got Bologna's season back on track. The team regrouped and travelled to the San Siro for a difficult test against Inter. They played excellently, and Negri put in a top performance between the sticks, and the game ended in a goalless draw. From here, Bologna gained confidence and marched to ten successive victories, progressively making their way up the table. Nobody could believe what they were seeing. Even Helenio Herrera was shocked when his Inter lost in their second meeting. The Rossoblu kept moving towards their 7th Scudetto with a 2\u20131 win over AC Milan after which they found themselves leading both Milan clubs in the stadings by three points. But three days after the Milan victory, everything came crashing down.\n\nIn March, the Italian Football Federation issued a statement that 5 Bologna players had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. They were immediately suspended and the club was docked 3 points. Everyone associated with Bologna FC was shocked, and nobody doubted the innocence of the players implicated for a moment. The notoriously tough and emotionless Fulvio Bernardini was in tears. So close to finally winning another title after a 23-year wait, it was about to be ripped away from them. Well, Bologna were having none of it. Protest marches exploded in the streets, the local media cried foul in the newspapers, and a team of Bolognese lawyers took on the case. While all this was happening, Renato Dall\u2019Ara, by now an elderly man, was on the way out with a failing heart. The Bolognese prosecutor discovered that the tubes containing the urine samples from the players were not adequately sealed \u2013 therefore, anyone could have tampered with the specimens. In addition, the methamphetamine the samples contained was enough to kill a man. Meanwhile, other samples from the players, taken at the same time, were found perfectly sealed, in a double-locked refrigerator, with no traces of drugs whatsoever. The plot thickened. In the end, the players were acquitted of any wrongdoing. It was determined that the entire affair was an act of sabotage on behalf of the northern clubs to derail Bologna's season.\n\nHowever, Bologna still lost 3 points while investigations continued and because of that, they struggled to keep up with Inter in the race for the Scudetto. The two teams matched each other win for win while Bologna anxiously awaited for the final investigation results. Finally it came \u2013 an established lack of evidence of any wrongdoing meant that the crucial three points would be returned to Bologna, bringing them level with Inter, with just three games to go. At the end of the season, both teams were still on equal points, which meant that for the first and only time in the history of the Serie A, a playoff would decide the ultimate champions. Four days before this penultimate match however, Bologna's emblematic president of 30 years, Renato Dall\u2019Ara, died from a heart attack in the middle of a meeting in the offices of the Federation. The players were in tears, as Dall\u2019Ara was not only their employer, he was like their father. Bologna's season from hell continued.:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,8/articleid,0096_01_1964_0055_0008_6059376/|title=Cinque calciatori del Bologna accusati di \"doping, La capolista rischia la penalizzazione di tre punti|publisher=[[La Stampa]]|date=5 March 1964}}</ref> In his honour, Bologna took to the pitch against an Inter side who had just become European champions. Finally, the play-off kicked off.\n\nAfter a goalless first half, the Bolognese side outclassed team from Milan and won 2\u20130. The Scudetto, to this day their last, was finally theirs, despite everything that had taken place. Bologna never gave up. Time and again, just when it seemed like it couldn't get any worse, it did \u2013 but they just kept on going and the reward for their perseverance was the Scudetto.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Bologna/Primo_Piano/2009/02/19/spareggioscudetto.shtml|title=Quando Bologna-Inter decideva lo scudetto|author=Giuseppe Bagnati|publisher=Gazzetta.it|date=19 February 2009}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Dream_Cup/Primo_Piano/2007/07_Luglio/Bologna_64.shtml|title=Il Bologna di Bernardini e lo storico spareggio|publisher=gazzetta.it}}</ref>\n\n== Squad ==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[William Negri]]|pos=GK|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Rino Rado]]|pos=GK|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Carlo Furlanis]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Mirko Pavinato]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}} (Captain)\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Paride Tumburus]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Francesco Janich]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Bruno Capra]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Edmondo Lorenzini]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Tazio Roversi]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Helmut Haller]]|pos=MF|nat=FRG}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[H\u00e9ctor Demarco]]|pos=MF|nat=URU}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Romano Fogli]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Giacomo Bulgarelli]] |pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Marino Perani]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Bruno Franzini]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Sidio Corradi]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Harald Nielsen]]|pos=FW|nat=DEN}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Ezio Pascutti]]|pos=FW|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Antonio Renna]]|pos=FW|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Transfers ===\n<ref>{{Cita|C.F.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, Things started to turn around when new manager and former 1928 Italy national team Olympian Fulvio Bernardini took his place on the Bologna touchline. On his resume, was Fiorentina's 1956 Serie A championship. On his arrival at the club, the side was already well stocked with talented players, but a few crucial ingredients were missing that would make Bologna true title contenders once again. Bernardini made several quality acquisition, such as the purchase of Harald Nielsen, a Denmark Olympic squad member who caught Bologna's eye at the Rome 1960 Games. Helmut Haller, the German international, also came on board. Like Nielsen, Haller was an amateur player who divided his time between football and driving a truck for a living. The clubs owner, Renato Dall\u2019Ara, personally went to Germany to sign the player. However, on his way back to Italy, Dall\u2019Ara's car skidded off the road and crashed into a ditch. Without missing a beat, the old man emerged from the wreck waving Haller's contract and shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the accident, what matters is that we got this piece of paper signed!\u201d\n\nThe next season, Haller and teammates like Ezio Pascutti with his spectacular diving headers delighted the Bologna faithful. However, they still only managed a forth place finish and the finger was pointed at goalkeeper  Santarelli, who at times was guity of poor mistakes. The finishing touch came with the purchase of former Italy national team goalkeeper William Negri. Three wins a row launched the 1963/64 season, and despite a stuttering start after that, it was a win over Genoa that got Bologna's season back on track. The team regrouped and travelled to the San Siro for a difficult test against Inter. They played excellently, and Negri put in a top performance between the sticks, and the game ended in a goalless draw. From here, Bologna gained confidence and marched to ten successive victories, progressively making their way up the table. Nobody could believe what they were seeing. Even Helenio Herrera was shocked when his Inter lost in their second meeting. The Rossoblu kept moving towards their 7th Scudetto with a 2\u20131 win over AC Milan after which they found themselves leading both Milan clubs in the stadings by three points. But three days after the Milan victory, everything came crashing down.\n\nIn March, the Italian Football Federation issued a statement that 5 Bologna players had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. They were immediately suspended and the club was docked 3 points. Everyone associated with Bologna FC was shocked, and nobody doubted the innocence of the players implicated for a moment. The notoriously tough and emotionless Fulvio Bernardini was in tears. So close to finally winning another title after a 23-year wait, it was about to be ripped away from them. Well, Bologna were having none of it. Protest marches exploded in the streets, the local media cried foul in the newspapers, and a team of Bolognese lawyers took on the case. While all this was happening, Renato Dall\u2019Ara, by now an elderly man, was on the way out with a failing heart. The Bolognese prosecutor discovered that the tubes containing the urine samples from the players were not adequately sealed \u2013 therefore, anyone could have tampered with the specimens. In addition, the methamphetamine the samples contained was enough to kill a man. Meanwhile, other samples from the players, taken at the same time, were found perfectly sealed, in a double-locked refrigerator, with no traces of drugs whatsoever. The plot thickened. In the end, the players were acquitted of any wrongdoing. It was determined that the entire affair was an act of sabotage on behalf of the northern clubs to derail Bologna's season.\n\nHowever, Bologna still lost 3 points while investigations continued and because of that, they struggled to keep up with Inter in the race for the Scudetto. The two teams matched each other win for win while Bologna anxiously awaited for the final investigation results. Finally it came \u2013 an established lack of evidence of any wrongdoing meant that the crucial three points would be returned to Bologna, bringing them level with Inter, with just three games to go. At the end of the season, both teams were still on equal points, which meant that for the first and only time in the history of the Serie A, a playoff would decide the ultimate champions. Four days before this penultimate match however, Bologna's emblematic president of 30 years, Renato Dall\u2019Ara, died from a heart attack in the middle of a meeting in the offices of the Federation. The players were in tears, as Dall\u2019Ara was not only their employer, he was like their father. Bologna's season from hell continued.:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,8/articleid,0096_01_1964_0055_0008_6059376/|title=Cinque calciatori del Bologna accusati di \"doping, La capolista rischia la penalizzazione di tre punti|publisher=[[La Stampa]]|date=5 March 1964}}</ref> In his honour, Bologna took to the pitch against an Inter side who had just become European champions. Finally, the play-off kicked off.\n\nAfter a goalless first half, the Bolognese side outclassed team from Milan and won 2\u20130. The Scudetto, to this day their last, was finally theirs, despite everything that had taken place. Bologna never gave up. Time and again, just when it seemed like it couldn't get any worse, it did \u2013 but they just kept on going and the reward for their perseverance was the Scudetto.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Bologna/Primo_Piano/2009/02/19/spareggioscudetto.shtml|title=Quando Bologna-Inter decideva lo scudetto|author=Giuseppe Bagnati|publisher=Gazzetta.it|date=19 February 2009}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Dream_Cup/Primo_Piano/2007/07_Luglio/Bologna_64.shtml|title=Il Bologna di Bernardini e lo storico spareggio|publisher=gazzetta.it}}</ref>\n\n== Squad ==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[William Negri]]|pos=GK|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Rino Rado]]|pos=GK|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Carlo Furlanis]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Mirko Pavinato]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}} (Captain)\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Paride Tumburus]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Francesco Janich]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Bruno Capra]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Edmondo Lorenzini]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Tazio Roversi]]|pos=DF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Helmut Haller]]|pos=MF|nat=FRG}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[H\u00e9ctor Demarco]]|pos=MF|nat=URU}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Romano Fogli]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Giacomo Bulgarelli]] |pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Marino Perani]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Bruno Franzini]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Sidio Corradi]]|pos=MF|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Harald Nielsen]]|pos=FW|nat=DEN}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Ezio Pascutti]]|pos=FW|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs player|no= |name=[[Antonio Renna]]|pos=FW|nat=ITA}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Transfers ===\n<ref>{{Cita|C.F.

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks. Developing security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11#History}}\n\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Great Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

To communicate, devices must use a common Wi-Fi version. The versions differ between the radio wavebands they operate on, the radio bandwidth they occupy, the maximum data rates they can support and other details. Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet access ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314). In the US and other countries, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.\n\n802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax can use the [[U-NII|5&nbsp; GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp; MHz channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, where the channels are only 5 MHz wide. In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth. Additionally, they have gained the ability to [[Link aggregation|aggregate]] (or 'bond') channels together to gain still more throughput where the bandwidth is available. 802.11n allows for double radio spectrum/bandwidth (40 MHz- 8 channels) compared to [[IEEE 802.11a-1999|802.11a]] or 802.11g (20&nbsp;MHz). 802.11n can also be set to limit itself to 20 MHz bandwidth to prevent interference in dense communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|title=802.11n Data Rates Dependability and scalability|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Cisco]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705034144/http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/Aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|archive-date=2017-07-05|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> In the 5 GHz band, 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz bandwidth signals are permitted with some restrictions, giving much faster connections.\n\n=== Communication stack ===\n[[File:802.11_frame.png|alt=|right|frameless|622x622px|Generic 802.11 Frame]]\n{{Main|IEEE 802|IEEE 802.11}}\nWi-Fi is part of the IEEE 802 protocol family.

They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had many subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|title=What Does WiFi Stand For and How Does Wifi Work?|last=Stobing|first=Chris|date=2015-11-17|website=GadgetReview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201045951/http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|archivedate=December 1, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> As a result, in the market place, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nIn addition to 802.11 the IEEE 802 protocol family has specific provisions for Wi-Fi. These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]]. This means that nodes have an associated [[internet address]] and, with suitable connectivity, this allows full Internet access.\n\n===Modes===\n\n====Infrastructure====\n[[File:Wi-Fi.gif|thumb|Depiction of a Wi-Fi network in infrastructure mode. The device sends information wirelessly to another device, both connected to the local network, in order to print a document]]\nIn infrastructure mode, which is the most common mode used, all communications goes through a base station. For communications within the network, this introduces an extra use of the airwaves, but has the advantage that any two stations that can communicate with the base station can also communicate through the base station, which enormously simplifies the protocols.\n\n==== Ad hoc and Wi-Fi direct ====\nWi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary. This is called [[wireless ad hoc network|''ad hoc'' Wi-Fi transmission]]. Different types of ad hoc network exist. In the simplest case network nodes must talk directly to each other.

In addition, propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.\n\nAt longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.\n\n=== Transmitter power ===\nCompared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low power devices.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW.

In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band.

Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing.

On some 5 GHz bands interference from radar systems can occur in some places. For base stations that support those bands they employ Dynamic Frequency Selection which listens for radar, and if it is found, will not permit a network on that band.\n\nThese bands can be used by low power transmitters without a license, and with few restrictions. However, while unintended interference is common, users that have been found to cause deliberate interference (particularly for attempting to locally monopolize these bands for commercial purposes) have been issued large fines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/mobile-wireless/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|title=Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown|last=Brown|first=Bob|date=2016-03-10|website=[[Network World]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227033935/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|archive-date=2019-02-27|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Throughput ===\n[[File:Throughputenvelope80211g.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11g]]\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11n with 40 MHz]]\n\nVarious layer 2 variants of IEEE 802.11 have different characteristics. Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements. Each represents an average throughput of 25 measurements (the error bars are there, but barely visible due to the small variation), is with a specific packet size (small or large), and with a specific data rate (10 kbit/s \u2013 100 Mbit/s). Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. This text and measurements do not cover packet errors but information about this can be found at the above references.

Also, spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. However, building walls of certain materials, such as stone with high metal content, can block Wi-Fi signals.\n\nA Wi-Fi device is a [[short-range device|short-range]] [[wireless]] device. Wi-Fi devices are [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on [[RF CMOS]] [[integrated circuit]] ([[RF circuit]]) chips.<ref name=\"Happich\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Veendrick |first1=Harry J.

The price of [[chipset]]s for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in ever more devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|title=Free WiFi Analyzer-Best Channel Analyzer Apps For Wireless Networks|last=|first=|date=2017-06-08|website=The Digital Worm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808000116/https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|archivedate=2017-08-08|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDifferent competitive brands of access points and client network-interfaces can inter-operate at a basic level of service. Products designated as \"Wi-Fi Certified\" by the Wi-Fi Alliance are [[backward compatible]]. Unlike [[mobile phone]]s, any standard Wi-Fi device works anywhere in the world.\n\n=== Access point ===\n[[File:Apple-Airport-Extreme-80211g-WiFi-Card.jpg|thumb|An [[AirPort]] wireless G Wi-Fi adapter from an Apple [[MacBook]].]]\n\nA wireless access point (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired LAN. An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The [[Internet of Things]] and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2017-06-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630050952/http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|archive-date=2010-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |title       = Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n |accessdate  = 2008-04-29\n |url-status  = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428103306/http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |archivedate = 2008-04-28\n}}</ref> This allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons.|last=Jensen|first=Joe|date=2007-10-26|website=Networkbits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075900/http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|archivedate=2008-03-05|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used.

Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks. Developing security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11#History}}\n\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Great Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

To communicate, devices must use a common Wi-Fi version. The versions differ between the radio wavebands they operate on, the radio bandwidth they occupy, the maximum data rates they can support and other details. Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet access ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

As with all radio, this is done by the [[modem|modulating and demodulation]] of [[carrier wave]]s. Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314). In the US and other countries, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.\n\n802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax can use the [[U-NII|5&nbsp; GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp; MHz channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, where the channels are only 5 MHz wide. In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth.

These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]]. This means that nodes have an associated [[internet address]] and, with suitable connectivity, this allows full Internet access.\n\n===Modes===\n\n====Infrastructure====\n[[File:Wi-Fi.gif|thumb|Depiction of a Wi-Fi network in infrastructure mode.

For communications within the network, this introduces an extra use of the airwaves, but has the advantage that any two stations that can communicate with the base station can also communicate through the base station, which enormously simplifies the protocols.\n\n==== Ad hoc and Wi-Fi direct ====\nWi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW. Note that this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost; this may not be the case in some situations, especially in large buildings or within a [[waveguide]]. In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions. Outdoor ranges can be improved to many kilometres through the use of high gain [[directional antenna]]s at the router and remote device(s).\n\n===MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) ===\n[[File:Netgear-Nighthawk-AC1900-WiFi-Router.jpg|thumb|This [[Netgear]] Wi-Fi router contains dual bands for transmitting the 802.11 standard across the 2.4 and 5 GHz spectrums and supports MIMO.]]\n[[File:Huawei 4G+ Modem.jpg|thumb|A dual band cellular 4G+ Wi-Fi modem by Huawei]]\n{{Main|MIMO}}\nWi-Fi 4 and higher standards allow devices to have multiple antennas on transmitters and receivers.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Interference can be caused by overlapping channels. Any two channel numbers that differ by five or more, such as 2 and 7, do not overlap (no [[adjacent-channel interference]]). The oft-repeated adage that channels 1, 6, and 11 are the ''only'' non-overlapping channels is, therefore, not accurate. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing. Channels that are four apart interfere a negligible amount-much less than reusing channels (which causes [[co-channel interference]])-if transmitters are at least a few metres apart.<ref name=\"vilegas\">Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs - Eduard Garcia Villegas, Elena Lopez-Aguilera, Rafael Vidal, Josep Paradells (2007) {{DOI|10.1109/CROWNCOM.2007.4549783}}</ref> In Europe and Japan where channel 13 is available, using Channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 for [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] and [[IEEE 802.11#802.11n|802.11n]] is [[IEEE 802.11#Channels and international compatibility|recommended]].\n\nHowever, many 2.4 GHz 802.11b and 802.11g access-points default to the same channel on initial startup, contributing to congestion on certain channels. Wi-Fi pollution, or an excessive number of access points in the area, can prevent access and interfere with other devices' use of other access points as well as with decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) between access points. These issues can become a problem in high-density areas, such as large apartment complexes or office buildings with many Wi-Fi access points.<ref>den Hartog, F., Raschella, A., Bouhafs, F., Kempker, P., Boltjes, B., & Seyedebrahimi, M.

On some 5 GHz bands interference from radar systems can occur in some places. For base stations that support those bands they employ Dynamic Frequency Selection which listens for radar, and if it is found, will not permit a network on that band.\n\nThese bands can be used by low power transmitters without a license, and with few restrictions. However, while unintended interference is common, users that have been found to cause deliberate interference (particularly for attempting to locally monopolize these bands for commercial purposes) have been issued large fines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/mobile-wireless/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|title=Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown|last=Brown|first=Bob|date=2016-03-10|website=[[Network World]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227033935/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|archive-date=2019-02-27|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Throughput ===\n[[File:Throughputenvelope80211g.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11g]]\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11n with 40 MHz]]\n\nVarious layer 2 variants of IEEE 802.11 have different characteristics. Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements.

An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used. In 2018, [[WPA3]] was announced as a replacement for WPA2, increasing security;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|title=WPA3 protocol will make public Wi-Fi hotspots a lot more secure|last=Thubron|first=Rob|date=2018-01-09|website=Techspot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116023123/https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|archive-date=2018-11-16|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> it rolled out on June 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|title=Wi-Fi security is starting to get its biggest upgrade in over a decade|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2018-06-26|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220012909/https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|archive-date=2019-02-20|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Piggybacking ===\n{{Main|Piggybacking (Internet access)}}\n{{Further|Legality of piggybacking}}\n{{Further|Wi-Fi Protected Setup#Physical security issues}}\nPiggybacking refers to access to a wireless Internet connection by bringing one's own computer within the range of another's wireless connection, and using that service without the subscriber's explicit permission or knowledge.\n\nDuring the early popular adoption of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouraged{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to cultivate [[wireless community network]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nocat.net/ |title=NoCat's goal is to bring you Infinite Bandwidth Everywhere for Free |publisher=Nocat.net |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref> particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time.\n\nRecreational logging and mapping of other people's access points has become known as [[wardriving]]. Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health concerns ==\n{{Further|Wireless electronic devices and health}}\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) says, \"no health effects are expected from exposure to RF fields from base stations and wireless networks\", but notes that they promote research into effects from other RF sources.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs304/en/\n |title       = Electromagnetic fields and public health -
