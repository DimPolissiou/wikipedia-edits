It also housed an important Safavid [[Mint (facility)|mint]].\n\nSafavid rule was mainly exercised through the approval or appointment of Georgian royals of the [[Bagrationi dynasty]], at times converts to [[Shia Islam]], as ''[[W\u0101li|valis]]'' or ''[[Khan (title)|khan]]s''.{{efn|Before [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]'s reign (1588\u20131629), governors of Georgia were usually referred to as ''hakem''.{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=83}} Sometimes they were also styled as ''[[sultan|soltan]] (salatin)''.{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=86}}}} The eastern Georgian kingdoms had been subjected in the early 16th century, their rulers did not commonly convert. Tiflis was garrisoned by an Iranian force as early as Ismail{{nbsp}}I's reign, but relations between the Georgians and Safavids at the time mostly bore features of traditional [[vassalage]]. [[David XI of Kartli|Davud Khan]] (David XI) was the first Safavid-appointed ruler, whose placement on the throne of Kartli in 1562 marked the start of nearly two and a half centuries of [[Iran]]ian political control of eastern Georgia. During the same period, [[Culture of Iran|Iranian cultural]] influence dominated eastern Georgia.\n\nFrom [[Tahmasp I]]'s reign onwards ({{reign|1524|1576}}), the province was of great strategic importance. Many ethnic [[Georgians]], generally from Kartli and Kakheti, rose to prominence in the Safavid state. These men held many of the highest positions in the civil and military administration, and many women entered the harem of the ruling class. By the late Safavid period, Georgians formed the mainstay of the Safavid army as well. The establishment of a large [[Iranian Georgians|Georgian community in Iran]] proper dates back to the era of Safavid suzerainty in Georgia. As the province was a border entity, the ''valis'' of Georgia exercised more autonomy than other provinces of the Safavid empire; it could therefore be compared to the Arabestan Province (present-day [[Khuzestan Province]]), in the southwestern part of the empire.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|pages=17\u201318}} The province of Georgia was one of only four Safavid administrative territories where governors were consistently given the title of ''vali''.\n\n==History==\n{{History of Georgia (country)}}\n\n===16th century===\nThe first [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] king (''[[shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] ({{Reign}}1501\u20131524) made the two kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] and [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] his [[Vassal state|vassals]] as early as the 1510s.{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|pages=164, 166}} However, distracted by the task of establishing power in [[Iran]], he did not tighten his hold on [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. He did raid Georgia a number of times, notably in 1518, which reconfirmed its status as a vassal, and in 1522, which resulted in Tiflis being garrisoned by a large Safavid force, but it was only under his son and successor [[Tahmasp I]] (r.{{nbsp}}1524\u20131576) that a genuine province with Safavid-appointed rulers and governors began to take shape.{{sfn|Hitchins|2001|pages=464\u2013470}}{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|page=166}}\n\nTahmasp I undertook active steps to integrate Georgia into the Safavid domains.

Due to this, in the years 1703\u20131714, the administration there was led by two successive regents (''janeshins'') namely [[Levan of Kartli|Shah-Qoli Khan]] (Levan) and [[Vakhtang VI of Kartli|Hosayn-Qoli Khan]] (Vakhtang{{nbsp}}VI).\n\nIn 1712\u20131719 Hosayn-Qoli Khan was forced to stay in Iran, and the Safavid king therefore gave the governorships of Kartli to others, amongst them [[Jesse of Kartli|Ali-Qoli Khan]] (Jesse) and ''janeshins'' such as [[Prince Bakar of Kartli|Shah-Navaz, Bakar Mirza]]. In 1719 the Iranian government decided to send Hosayn-Qoli Khan, who had occupied several other high positions since 1716, back to Georgia with the task of handling the Lezgin rebellion.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} Assisted by the ruler of neighboring Kakheti, as well as the governor (''beglarbeg'') of [[Safavid Shirvan|Shirvan]], Hosayn-Qoli made significant progress in putting a halt to the Lezgins.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} However, in the winter of 1721, at a crucial moment in the campaign, he was recalled.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} The order, which came after the fall of grand vizier [[Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani]], was made at the instigation of the eunuch faction within the royal court, who had persuaded the shah that a successful end to the campaign would do the Safavid realm more harm than good. In their view, it would enable Vakhtang, the Safavid ''[[Vali (governor)|vali]]'', to form an alliance with Russia with an eye to conquering Iran.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=225}} Shortly after, the Lezgins overran [[Safavid Shirvan|Shirvan]], whereafter they [[Sack of Shamakhi (1721)|sacked and looted]] the provincial capital of [[Shamakhi]] and massacred much of its population. In 1722 Emamqoli Khan died and was buried in [[Qom, Iran|Qom]]. Sultan Husayn then appointed his brother [[Constantine II of Kakheti|Mahmad Qoli Khan]] (Constantine{{nbsp}}II) as the new governor of Kakheti.\n\nWhen the capital of Isfahan was put under [[Siege of Isfahan|siege in 1722]], Hosayn-Qoli Khan defied the royal orders and refused to send the requested relief force.{{sfn|Suny|1994|page=54}} In the meantime, Russia took full advantage of the situation. With the Safavids on the brink of collapse, they launched a campaign in 1722\u20131723 that resulted in the [[Russo-Persian War (1722\u20131723)|annexation of the coastal territories]]. The Ottomans, also taking advantage of the situation, overran the province of Georgia and other territories to the west of the area that the Russians had captured.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=142}} By the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|Treaty of Constantinople]], the two powers further divided the annexed territories between them, with the Ottomans again retaining Georgia.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|pages=226\u2013227}} The rebellious Hosayn-Qoli Khan, who had sided with the Russians during their invasion in 1722\u20131723, in what turned out to be an ill-fated alliance, died in exile in Russia in 1737. When the Safavids were restored by [[Nader Shah|Nader Qoli Beg]] (later known as Nader Shah), the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of Iran, he restored Iranian dominance in the Caucasus and made [[Teimuraz II of Kakheti|Teimuraz II]] ''vali'' of Kakheti, while appointing an Iranian as the governor of Kartli.{{sfn|Hitchins|2001|pages=464\u2013470}} In 1736 Nader deposed the Safavids and became king himself, establishing the [[Afsharid dynasty]].\n\n==Mint==\n[[File:Eight Safavid abbasis struck at the Tiflis mint.jpg|thumb|right|Silver ''abbasis'' minted in Tiflis during the reign of Sultan Husayn ({{Reign|1694|1722}}), with minting dates varying from 1717\u20131718 to 1719\u20131720.]]\n[[File:Safavid shahis struck at the Tiflis mint.jpg|thumb|right|Silver ''panj shahis'' minted in Tiflis in 1716\u20131717 during the reign of Sultan Husayn.]]\n{{see also|Abbasi (currency)|Georgian abazi}}\nOne of the most important Safavid [[Mint (facility)|mint]]s was located in the province of Georgia, in Tiflis. Close to the border with the Ottoman Empire, the Tiflis mint was important to the Safavids, for [[bullion]] (i.e. silver bars, Spanish [[Spanish real|reals]], Dutch [[rijksdaalder]]s) for the minting of coins was largely imported from and through the Ottoman Empire (and Russia).{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=68}}{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=53}} Upon arrival in Iran, the bullion was always brought to Tiflis, Erivan, or Tabriz to be melted into Iranian coins.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|pages=5, 15}} Tiflis was thus a major stopping point for merchants who returned with silver.{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=68}} It was also one of the few mints, alongside the ones at Tabriz and [[Yerevan|Erivan]] (Yerevan), where re-minting took place.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=53}} In the 17th century the Tiflis mint was one of the most active Safavid mints.{{sfn|Barendse|2002|page=221}}\n\nThe Tiflis mint also lay on a route widely used by silk traders.{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=68}} According to French traveller [[Jean Baptiste Tavernier]], traders who went to Gilan to negotiate over silk, went to the mint at Tiflis, for the mint master (''zarrab-bashi'') gave a 2%{{nbsp}}discount on silver for silk traders.{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|page=68}} Tavernier notes that this is partly due to the silver coins from Tiflis being a little less [[Fineness|fine]].{{sfn|Babaie|Babayan|Baghdiantz-McCabe|Farhad|2004|pages=68\u201369}}\n\nThe coins minted at Tiflis were mostly used for the local citizens, rather than for the local Safavid garrison.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=17}} The coins always had to bear the Safavid rulers' name and follow the Safavid types, legends, and weight standards.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|pages=17\u201318}} In many other regards, however, the appointed ''valis'' were granted a great deal of autonomy in terms of minting practises.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|pages=17\u201318}} For example, the ''vali'' reportedly was allowed to benefit from the profit accrued by the mints in the province.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=17}}\n\nDuring the reign of Suleiman I, the economic situation worsened.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|pages=130\u2013131}} The amount of precious metal coming into the country decreased, and as a result the quality of the coins diminished.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|pages=130\u2013131}} This deficiency in weight was also apparent in coins from the Tiflis mint; in 1688, the ''abbasis'' and ''mahmudis'' struck at the mint were 22.5% below the standard weight they were supposed to have.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=131}} The royal treasury was aware of the issue, and subsequently stopped accepting ''mahmudis'' that had been minted in Tiflis.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=131}}\n\nIn the years 1682\u20131685 the only Safavid mints that were recorded as active were the ones at Tiflis and [[Tabriz]].{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=119}} According to a 1687 report, money played close to no role in Georgia.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=44}} French botanist [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] confirms this: according to his texts of 1701, people in large parts of Georgia preferred to be paid in materials such as bracelets, rings, necklaces, and so forth.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|page=44}}\n\n==Stationed military force==\nThe province of Georgia hosted many Safavid soldiers, as it was considered a territory of the utmost importance.

Therefore, Iranian traditions also spread throughout Georgia.{{sfn|Gelashvili|2012|page=494}} The placement of [[David XI of Kartli|Davud Khan]] (David XI) on the puppet throne of Kartli in 1562 did not just initiate a lengthy period of Iranian political dominance; in the same two and a half centuries that followed, until the [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|coming]] of the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] in the 19th century, [[Culture of Iran|Iranian cultural]] influence dominated eastern Georgia (Kartli\u2013Kakheti).{{sfn|Suny|1994|page=48}} According to Jean Chardin, who was in Georgia in 1672, the Georgians followed Iranian traditions.{{sfn|Gelashvili|2012|page=494}} Chardin assumed that the process had been influenced by those nobles who had converted to Islam (in order to obtain positions as state officials), as well as those who encouraged their female relatives to become ladies at court.{{sfn|Gelashvili|2012|page=494}}\n\nIn the Safavid period, \"a great number of books\" were translated from Persian into Georgian. The ''Rostomiani'', the Georgian version of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', was further developed and improved, as well as ''[[Visramiani]]'', the Georgian version of ''[[Vis o Ramin]]''.{{sfn|Gelashvili|2012|page=494}} According to a letter sent to the Pope by a Catholic missionary who [[Floruit|flourished]] in the 17th century, Padre Bernardi, it was to his \"great regret\" that literate Georgians preferred to read works such as the ''Rostomiani'' (''[[Shahnameh]]''), ''Bezhaniani'', and ''Baramguriani'' and were less interested in religious texts.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}}\n\n[[Teimuraz I of Kakheti]] (Tahmuras Khan) is perhaps mostly remembered for creating issues for the central government, but he was fluent in Persian and fond of Persian poetry, which he \"highly valued\".{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} In his words:{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}}\n\n{{quote|The sweetness of Persian speech urged me to compose the music of verse.}}\n\nTeimuraz wrote several poems influenced by the contemporary Persian tradition, packed with \"Persian imagery and allusions, loanwords, and phraseology\". A later Georgian ruler, Vakhtang{{nbsp}}VI (Hosayn-Qoli Khan), was also important in this regard.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} When he was forced to stay in Iran, he learned to excel in Persian. He later used this skill to translate works into Georgian.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} He created a Georgian version of the Persian ''[[Qabus-Nama|Qabusnameh]]'' known as ''Amirnasariani'' (\"The story of Amirnasar\", Amirnasar being the mythical Iranian king [[Kaykavus]]). During his detention in Iran, Vakhtang also translated into Georgian Kashefi's ''[[Panchatantra|Kal\u012bleh o Demneh]]''.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} Later, back in Georgia, he ordered the entire story to be translated once more, while his tutor, [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]], also made a revised version of Vakhtang's own translation.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} Though Vakhtang, individually, was heavily involved in further developing Georgian-Iranian literary ties (in other words, by his own writings), he also founded an entire school dedicated to translators from Persian into Georgian.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} During this period, a number of folk stories (i.e. ''[[dastan]]s'') that were extremely popular in Iran, were translated into Georgian on his orders.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} One of these was the ''Bakhtiarnameh'', a collection of several novellas, as well as the ''Baramgulandamiani'' (\"Bahram o Golandam\"), originally written by Katebi Nishapuri. The many other Persian-Georgian literary efforts of this era include translations of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] and books on Shia [[jurisprudence]].{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}}{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}}\n\n===Iranian culture===\nIn another, perhaps unorthodox, way Georgia also influenced the culture of Iran. According to a story, an ethnic Georgian named Scedan Cilaze was so renowned for being able to \"hold\" his liquor, that Safavid King [[Safi of Persia|Safi]] ({{reign|1629|1642}}) invited him to the court in order to hold a drinking competition.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} After beating everyone at court, the king himself challenged Cilaze, and reportedly died doing so. Though Prof. Matthee reports that the story may be \"apocryphal\", as alcoholism did kill Safi, but not in relation to a drinking contest, it does show that Georgian habits had spread to Iran.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}}\n\nIn the Safavid period, large numbers of ethnic Georgian men entered Safavid government service, whereas many Georgian women entered the harems of the ruling elite and the royal court.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} Drinking alcohol, a prominent Georgian habits, influenced Iranian society, and more importantly, court culture, during this period.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} It is especially evident in the taxes the province had to pay{{snd}}they included many liters of wine. The royal harem, the private area of the royal court, was where Safavid rulers grew up; after Abbas{{nbsp}}I's reign, all Safavid rulers grew up there surrounded by mostly Georgian women.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} There were also many ''[[Military of the Safavid dynasty#Gholam|gholams]]'' who drank. Matthee therefore suggests that it is quite likely that the \"fondness\" for wine exhibited by Safavid rulers originated in this environment.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Safavid Georgia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last1=Babaie|first1=Sussan|last2=Babayan|first2=Kathryn|last3=Baghdiantz-McCabe|first3=Ina|last4=Farhad|first4=Massumeh|title=Slaves of the Shah: New Elites of Safavid Iran|date=2004|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=1\u2013256|isbn=978-0857716866|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barendse|first1=R.J.|title=The Arabian Seas: The Indian Ocean World of the Seventeenth Century|date=2002|location=Armonk, N.Y.|publisher=M.E.

It also housed an important Safavid [[Mint (facility)|mint]].\n\nSafavid rule was mainly exercised through the approval or appointment of Georgian royals of the [[Bagrationi dynasty]], at times converts to [[Shia Islam]], as ''[[W\u0101li|valis]]'' or ''[[Khan (title)|khan]]s''.{{efn|Before [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]'s reign (1588\u20131629), governors of Georgia were usually referred to as ''hakem''.{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=83}} Sometimes they were also styled as ''[[sultan|soltan]] (salatin)''.{{sfn|Floor|2001|page=86}}}} The eastern Georgian kingdoms had been subjected in the early 16th century, their rulers did not commonly convert. Tiflis was garrisoned by an Iranian force as early as Ismail{{nbsp}}I's reign, but relations between the Georgians and Safavids at the time mostly bore features of traditional [[vassalage]]. [[David XI of Kartli|Davud Khan]] (David XI) was the first Safavid-appointed ruler, whose placement on the throne of Kartli in 1562 marked the start of nearly two and a half centuries of [[Iran]]ian political control of eastern Georgia. During the same period, [[Culture of Iran|Iranian cultural]] influence dominated eastern Georgia.\n\nFrom [[Tahmasp I]]'s reign onwards ({{reign|1524|1576}}), the province was of great strategic importance. Many ethnic [[Georgians]], generally from Kartli and Kakheti, rose to prominence in the Safavid state. These men held many of the highest positions in the civil and military administration, and many women entered the harem of the ruling class. By the late Safavid period, Georgians formed the mainstay of the Safavid army as well. The establishment of a large [[Iranian Georgians|Georgian community in Iran]] proper dates back to the era of Safavid suzerainty in Georgia. As the province was a border entity, the ''valis'' of Georgia exercised more autonomy than other provinces of the Safavid empire; it could therefore be compared to the Arabestan Province (present-day [[Khuzestan Province]]), in the southwestern part of the empire.{{sfn|Matthee|Floor|Clawson|2013|pages=17\u201318}} The province of Georgia was one of only four Safavid administrative territories where governors were consistently given the title of ''vali''.\n\n==History==\n{{History of Georgia (country)}}\n\n===16th century===\nThe first [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] king (''[[shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] ({{Reign}}1501\u20131524) made the two kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] and [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] his [[Vassal state|vassals]] as early as the 1510s.{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|pages=164, 166}} However, distracted by the task of establishing power in [[Iran]], he did not tighten his hold on [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. He did raid Georgia a number of times, notably in 1518, which reconfirmed its status as a vassal, and in 1522, which resulted in Tiflis being garrisoned by a large Safavid force, but it was only under his son and successor [[Tahmasp I]] (r.{{nbsp}}1524\u20131576) that a genuine province with Safavid-appointed rulers and governors began to take shape.{{sfn|Hitchins|2001|pages=464\u2013470}}{{sfn|Rayfield|2012|page=166}}\n\nTahmasp I undertook active steps to integrate Georgia into the Safavid domains.

A later Georgian ruler, Vakhtang{{nbsp}}VI (Hosayn-Qoli Khan), was also important in this regard.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} When he was forced to stay in Iran, he learned to excel in Persian. He later used this skill to translate works into Georgian.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} He created a Georgian version of the Persian ''[[Qabus-Nama|Qabusnameh]]'' known as ''Amirnasariani'' (\"The story of Amirnasar\", Amirnasar being the mythical Iranian king [[Kaykavus]]). During his detention in Iran, Vakhtang also translated into Georgian Kashefi's ''[[Panchatantra|Kal\u012bleh o Demneh]]''.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} Later, back in Georgia, he ordered the entire story to be translated once more, while his tutor, [[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]], also made a revised version of Vakhtang's own translation.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} Though Vakhtang, individually, was heavily involved in further developing Georgian-Iranian literary ties (in other words, by his own writings), he also founded an entire school dedicated to translators from Persian into Georgian.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} During this period, a number of folk stories (i.e. ''[[dastan]]s'') that were extremely popular in Iran, were translated into Georgian on his orders.{{sfn|Gvakharia|2001|pages=481\u2013486}} One of these was the ''Bakhtiarnameh'', a collection of several novellas, as well as the ''Baramgulandamiani'' (\"Bahram o Golandam\"), originally written by Katebi Nishapuri.

According to a story, an ethnic Georgian named Scedan Cilaze was so renowned for being able to \"hold\" his liquor, that Safavid King [[Safi of Persia|Safi]] ({{reign|1629|1642}}) invited him to the court in order to hold a drinking competition.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} After beating everyone at court, the king himself challenged Cilaze, and reportedly died doing so. Though Prof. Matthee reports that the story may be \"apocryphal\", as alcoholism did kill Safi, but not in relation to a drinking contest, it does show that Georgian habits had spread to Iran.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}}\n\nIn the Safavid period, large numbers of ethnic Georgian men entered Safavid government service, whereas many Georgian women entered the harems of the ruling elite and the royal court.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} Drinking alcohol, a prominent Georgian habits, influenced Iranian society, and more importantly, court culture, during this period.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} It is especially evident in the taxes the province had to pay{{snd}}they included many liters of wine. The royal harem, the private area of the royal court, was where Safavid rulers grew up; after Abbas{{nbsp}}I's reign, all Safavid rulers grew up there surrounded by mostly Georgian women.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}} There were also many ''[[Military of the Safavid dynasty#Gholam|gholams]]'' who drank. Matthee therefore suggests that it is quite likely that the \"fondness\" for wine exhibited by Safavid rulers originated in this environment.{{sfn|Matthee|2005|page=43}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Safavid Georgia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last1=Babaie|first1=Sussan|last2=Babayan|first2=Kathryn|last3=Baghdiantz-McCabe|first3=Ina|last4=Farhad|first4=Massumeh|title=Slaves of the Shah: New Elites of Safavid Iran|date=2004|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=1\u2013256|isbn=978-0857716866|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barendse|first1=R.J.|title=The Arabian Seas: The Indian Ocean World of the Seventeenth Century|date=2002|location=Armonk, N.Y.|publisher=M.E.

In September 1974, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] had been overthrown by the [[Derg]] (the military council), marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy. Meanwhile, various anti-Derg as well as separatist movements began throughout the country. The regional balance of power now favoured Somalia.\n\nOne of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia [[Western Somali Liberation Front]] (WSLF) operating in the Somali-inhabited [[Ogaden|Ogaden area]], which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. WSLF had control of most of the Ogaden, the first time since the Second World War that all Somalia was united with the exception of the NFD region in Kenya. The victory in Ogaden was mostly because of support from the [[Harari people|Harari]] populace who had aligned with the WSLF.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Matshanda |first1=Namhla |title=Centres in the Periphery: Negotiating Territoriality and Identification in Harar and Jijiga from 1942 |date=2014 |publisher=The University of Edinburgh |page=200 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e51e/aa84c13ba093ddf2bc242117aa9d8179dd71.pdf}}</ref> From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF.\n\nA sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|Red Terror]] (or Qey Shibir in Amharic). Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine [[Marxist\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the [[United States|U.S.]] military mission and the communications centre in April 1977.\n\nIn June 1977, Mengistu accused Somalia of infiltrating SNA soldiers into the Somali area to fight alongside the WSLF. Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, [[Siad Barre|Barre]] strongly denied this, saying SNA \"volunteers\" were being allowed to help the WSLF.\n\n===Castro siding with Ethiopia===\nWhen the Cubans and the Soviets learned of the Somali plans to annex the Ogaden, Castro flew to Aden in March 1977 where he suggested an Ethiopian-Somali-Yemeni Socialist Federation.  Castro's plan didn't get any support and two months later Somali forces attacked the Ethiopians.  Cuba, supported by troops from the USSR and South Yemen, sided with Ethiopia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/africa/fidel-castro-left-mark-somalia-horn-africa|title=Fidel Castro Left Mark on Somalia, Horn of Africa|website=Voice of America|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://defenceindepth.co/2019/02/19/the-battle-for-the-horn-of-africa-a-retrospective/|title=THE BATTLE FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA: A RETROSPECTIVE|last=defenceresearch|date=2019-02-19|website=Defence-In-Depth|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/69-ethiopiaogaden-1948-present/|title=68.

The attacking forces did suffer some early setbacks; Ethiopian defenders at [[Dire Dawa]] and [[Jijiga]] inflicted heavy casualties on assaulting forces.  The [[Ethiopian Air Force]] (EAF) also began to establish [[air superiority]] using its [[Northrop F-5]]s, despite being initially outnumbered by Somali [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21s]].  However, Somalia was easily overpowering Ethiopian military hardware and technology capability. [[Army]]-[[general]] [[Vasily Ivanovich Petrov|Vasily Petrov]] of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] had to report back to [[Moscow]] the \"sorry state\" of the [[Ethiopian Army]]. The [[3rd Infantry Division (Ethiopia)|3rd]] and [[4th Infantry Division (Ethiopia)|4th Ethiopian Infantry Division]]s that suffered the brunt of the Somali invasion had practically ceased to exist.<ref name = \"Urban 1983 42\">{{Harvnb|Urban|1983|p=42}}.</ref>\n\nThe USSR, finding itself supplying both sides of a war, attempted to mediate a ceasefire.  When their efforts failed, the Soviets abandoned Somalia. All aid to Siad Barre's regime was halted, while arms shipments to Ethiopia were increased.

Not only was the country's second largest military airbase located here, as well as Ethiopia's crossroads into the Ogaden, but Ethiopia's rail lifeline to the Red Sea ran through this city, and if the Somalis held Dire Dawa, Ethiopia would be unable to export its crops or bring in equipment needed to continue the fight. Gebre Tareke estimates the Somalis advanced with two motorized brigades, one tank battalion and one BM battery upon the city; against them were the Ethiopian Second Militia Division, the 201 Nebelbal battalion, 781 battalion of the 78th Brigade, the 4th Mechanized Company, and a tank platoon possessing two tanks.<ref name = \"Tareke 2000 645\">{{Harvnb|Tareke|2000|p=645}}.</ref> The fighting was vicious as both sides knew what the stakes were, but  after two days, despite that the Somalis had gained possession of the airport at one point, the Ethiopians had repulsed the assault, forcing the Somalis to withdraw. Henceforth, Dire Dawa was never at risk of attack.<ref name = \"Tareke 2000 646\">{{Harvnb|Tareke|2000|p=646}}.</ref>\n\n===Somali victories and siege of Harar (September\u2013January)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Damagedsomalitank.jgp.jpg|thumb|left|A heavily damaged Somali National Army T-34 going through repairs]]\nThe greatest single victory of the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September (the [[Battle of Jijiga]]), in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were no match for the assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the [[Marda Pass]], halfway between Jijiga and [[Harar]]. By September Ethiopia was forced to admit that it controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of [[Harerge]], [[Bale province (Ethiopia)|Bale]], and [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new [[Warsaw Pact]] bloc weaponry took place.\n\nFrom October 1977 until January 1978, the SNA-WSLF forces attempted to capture Harar during the [[Battle of Harar]], where 40,000 Ethiopians had regrouped and re-armed with Soviet-supplied [[artillery]] and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armor]]; backed by 1500 Soviet \"advisors\" and 11,000 Cuban soldiers, they engaged the attackers in vicious fighting. Though the Somali forces reached the city outskirts by November, they were too exhausted to take the city and eventually had to withdraw to await the Ethiopian counterattack.\n\n===Ethiopian-Cuban counter-attack (February\u2013March)===\n[[File:Tiglachin monument (Addis Ababa).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tiglachin Monument|Tiglachin]] memorial in [[Addis Ababa]], commemoring the Ethiopian and Cuban soldiers involved in the Ogaden War]]\nThe expected Ethiopian-Cuban attack occurred in early February; however, it was accompanied by a second attack that the Somalis did not expect. A column of Ethiopian and Cuban troops crossed northeast into the highlands between Jijiga and the border with Somalia, bypassing the SNA-WSLF force defending the Marda Pass. [[Mil Mi-6]] helicopters airlifted Cuban [[BMD-1]] and [[ASU-57]] armored vehicles behind enemy lines. The Somali defense collapsed and every major Somali town was recaptured in the following weeks. Recognizing that his position was untenable, Siad Barre ordered the SNA to retreat back into Somalia on 9 March 1978, although Rene LaFort claims that the Somalis, having foreseen the inevitable, had already withdrawn their heavy weapons.<ref name = \"Lefort 1983 260\">{{Harvnb|Lefort|1983|p=260}}.</ref> The last significant Somali unit left Ethiopia on 15 March 1978, marking the end of the war.\n\n==Effects of the war==\nFollowing the withdrawal of the SNA, the WSLF continued their insurgency. By May 1980, the rebels, with the assistance of a small number of SNA soldiers who continued to help the guerrilla war, controlled a substantial region of the Ogaden. However, by 1981 the insurgents were reduced to sporadic hit-and-run attacks and were finally defeated. In addition, the WSLF and SALF were significantly weakened after the Ogaden War. The former was practically defunct by the late 1980s, with its splinter group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) operating from headquarters in Kuwait. Even though elements of the ONLF would later manage to slip back into the Ogaden, their actions had little impact.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Journal of Eastern African Studies]]|title=Ethiopian foreign policy and the Ogaden War: the shift from \u201ccontainment\u201d to \u201cdestabilization,\u201d 1977\u20131991|author=Belete Belachew Yihun|url=http://samaynta.com/index.php/2017/02/13/ethiopian-professor-writes-about-ethiopian-policy-of-destabilizing-somalia/|date=2014|doi=10.1080/17531055.2014.947469|volume=8|issue=4}} The version at samaynta.com lacks references.</ref>\n\nFor the Barre regime, the invasion was perhaps the greatest strategic blunder since independence,<ref name = \"Tareke 2009 214\">{{Harvnb|Tareke|2009|p=214}}.</ref> and it weakened the military. Almost one-third of the regular SNA soldiers, three-eighths of the armored units and half of the [[Somali Air Force]] (SAF) were lost. The weakness of the Barre administration led it to effectively abandon the dream of a unified [[Greater Somalia]]. The failure of the war aggravated discontent with the Barre regime; the first organized opposition group, the [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]] (SSDF), was formed by army officers in 1979.\n\nThe United States adopted Somalia as a Cold War ally from the late 1970s to 1988 in exchange for use of Somali bases, and a way to exert influence upon the region.

In September 1974, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] had been overthrown by the [[Derg]] (the military council), marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy. Meanwhile, various anti-Derg as well as separatist movements began throughout the country. The regional balance of power now favoured Somalia.\n\nOne of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia [[Western Somali Liberation Front]] (WSLF) operating in the Somali-inhabited [[Ogaden|Ogaden area]], which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. WSLF had control of most of the Ogaden, the first time since the Second World War that all Somalia was united with the exception of the NFD region in Kenya. The victory in Ogaden was mostly because of support from the [[Harari people|Harari]] populace who had aligned with the WSLF.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Matshanda |first1=Namhla |title=Centres in the Periphery: Negotiating Territoriality and Identification in Harar and Jijiga from 1942 |date=2014 |publisher=The University of Edinburgh |page=200 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e51e/aa84c13ba093ddf2bc242117aa9d8179dd71.pdf}}</ref> From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF.\n\nA sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|Red Terror]] (or Qey Shibir in Amharic). Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine [[Marxist\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the [[United States|U.S.]] military mission and the communications centre in April 1977.\n\nIn June 1977, Mengistu accused Somalia of infiltrating SNA soldiers into the Somali area to fight alongside the WSLF. Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, [[Siad Barre|Barre]] strongly denied this, saying SNA \"volunteers\" were being allowed to help the WSLF.\n\n===Castro siding with Ethiopia===\nWhen the Cubans and the Soviets learned of the Somali plans to annex the Ogaden, Castro flew to Aden in March 1977 where he suggested an Ethiopian-Somali-Yemeni Socialist Federation.  Castro's plan didn't get any support and two months later Somali forces attacked the Ethiopians.  Cuba, supported by troops from the USSR and South Yemen, sided with Ethiopia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/africa/fidel-castro-left-mark-somalia-horn-africa|title=Fidel Castro Left Mark on Somalia, Horn of Africa|website=Voice of America|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://defenceindepth.co/2019/02/19/the-battle-for-the-horn-of-africa-a-retrospective/|title=THE BATTLE FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA: A RETROSPECTIVE|last=defenceresearch|date=2019-02-19|website=Defence-In-Depth|language=en|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/69-ethiopiaogaden-1948-present/|title=68.

The attacking forces did suffer some early setbacks; Ethiopian defenders at [[Dire Dawa]] and [[Jijiga]] inflicted heavy casualties on assaulting forces.  The [[Ethiopian Air Force]] (EAF) also began to establish [[air superiority]] using its [[Northrop F-5]]s, despite being initially outnumbered by Somali [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21s]].  However, Somalia was easily overpowering Ethiopian military hardware and technology capability. [[Army]]-[[general]] [[Vasily Ivanovich Petrov|Vasily Petrov]] of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] had to report back to [[Moscow]] the \"sorry state\" of the [[Ethiopian Army]]. The [[3rd Infantry Division (Ethiopia)|3rd]] and [[4th Infantry Division (Ethiopia)|4th Ethiopian Infantry Division]]s that suffered the brunt of the Somali invasion had practically ceased to exist.<ref name = \"Urban 1983 42\">{{Harvnb|Urban|1983|p=42}}.</ref>\n\nThe USSR, finding itself supplying both sides of a war, attempted to mediate a ceasefire.  When their efforts failed, the Soviets abandoned Somalia. All aid to Siad Barre's regime was halted, while arms shipments to Ethiopia were increased.

Not only was the country's second largest military airbase located here, as well as Ethiopia's crossroads into the Ogaden, but Ethiopia's rail lifeline to the Red Sea ran through this city, and if the Somalis held Dire Dawa, Ethiopia would be unable to export its crops or bring in equipment needed to continue the fight. Gebre Tareke estimates the Somalis advanced with two motorized brigades, one tank battalion and one BM battery upon the city; against them were the Ethiopian Second Militia Division, the 201 Nebelbal battalion, 781 battalion of the 78th Brigade, the 4th Mechanized Company, and a tank platoon possessing two tanks.<ref name = \"Tareke 2000 645\">{{Harvnb|Tareke|2000|p=645}}.</ref> The fighting was vicious as both sides knew what the stakes were, but  after two days, despite that the Somalis had gained possession of the airport at one point, the Ethiopians had repulsed the assault, forcing the Somalis to withdraw. Henceforth, Dire Dawa was never at risk of attack.<ref name = \"Tareke 2000 646\">{{Harvnb|Tareke|2000|p=646}}.</ref>\n\n===Somali victories and siege of Harar (September\u2013January)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Damagedsomalitank.jgp.jpg|thumb|left|A heavily damaged Somali National Army T-34 going through repairs]]\nThe greatest single victory of the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September (the [[Battle of Jijiga]]), in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were no match for the assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the [[Marda Pass]], halfway between Jijiga and [[Harar]]. By September Ethiopia was forced to admit that it controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of [[Harerge]], [[Bale province (Ethiopia)|Bale]], and [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty acclimatization to the new [[Warsaw Pact]] bloc weaponry took place.\n\nFrom October 1977 until January 1978, the SNA-WSLF forces attempted to capture Harar during the [[Battle of Harar]], where 40,000 Ethiopians had regrouped and re-armed with Soviet-supplied [[artillery]] and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armor]]; backed by 1500 Soviet \"advisors\" and 11,000 Cuban soldiers, they engaged the attackers in vicious fighting. Though the Somali forces reached the city outskirts by November, they were too exhausted to take the city and eventually had to withdraw to await the Ethiopian counterattack.\n\n===Ethiopian-Cuban counter-attack (February\u2013March)===\n[[File:Tiglachin monument (Addis Ababa).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tiglachin Monument|Tiglachin]] memorial in [[Addis Ababa]], commemoring the Ethiopian and Cuban soldiers involved in the Ogaden War]]\nThe expected Ethiopian-Cuban attack occurred in early February; however, it was accompanied by a second attack that the Somalis did not expect. A column of Ethiopian and Cuban troops crossed northeast into the highlands between Jijiga and the border with Somalia, bypassing the SNA-WSLF force defending the Marda Pass. [[Mil Mi-6]] helicopters airlifted Cuban [[BMD-1]] and [[ASU-57]] armored vehicles behind enemy lines. The Somali defense collapsed and every major Somali town was recaptured in the following weeks. Recognizing that his position was untenable, Siad Barre ordered the SNA to retreat back into Somalia on 9 March 1978, although Rene LaFort claims that the Somalis, having foreseen the inevitable, had already withdrawn their heavy weapons.<ref name = \"Lefort 1983 260\">{{Harvnb|Lefort|1983|p=260}}.</ref> The last significant Somali unit left Ethiopia on 15 March 1978, marking the end of the war.\n\n==Effects of the war==\nFollowing the withdrawal of the SNA, the WSLF continued their insurgency. By May 1980, the rebels, with the assistance of a small number of SNA soldiers who continued to help the guerrilla war, controlled a substantial region of the Ogaden. However, by 1981 the insurgents were reduced to sporadic hit-and-run attacks and were finally defeated. In addition, the WSLF and SALF were significantly weakened after the Ogaden War. The former was practically defunct by the late 1980s, with its splinter group, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) operating from headquarters in Kuwait. Even though elements of the ONLF would later manage to slip back into the Ogaden, their actions had little impact.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Journal of Eastern African Studies]]|title=Ethiopian foreign policy and the Ogaden War: the shift from \u201ccontainment\u201d to \u201cdestabilization,\u201d 1977\u20131991|author=Belete Belachew Yihun|url=http://samaynta.com/index.php/2017/02/13/ethiopian-professor-writes-about-ethiopian-policy-of-destabilizing-somalia/|date=2014|doi=10.1080/17531055.2014.947469|volume=8|issue=4}} The version at samaynta.com lacks references.</ref>\n\nFor the Barre regime, the invasion was perhaps the greatest strategic blunder since independence,<ref name = \"Tareke 2009 214\">{{Harvnb|Tareke|2009|p=214}}.</ref> and it weakened the military. Almost one-third of the regular SNA soldiers, three-eighths of the armored units and half of the [[Somali Air Force]] (SAF) were lost. The weakness of the Barre administration led it to effectively abandon the dream of a unified [[Greater Somalia]]. The failure of the war aggravated discontent with the Barre regime; the first organized opposition group, the [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]] (SSDF), was formed by army officers in 1979.\n\nThe United States adopted Somalia as a Cold War ally from the late 1970s to 1988 in exchange for use of Somali bases, and a way to exert influence upon the region. A second armed clash in 1988 was resolved when the two countries agreed to withdraw their militaries from the border.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Soviet Union-Africa relations#Ethiopia]]\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book  |last= Crockatt  |first= Richard  |year= 1995  |title= The Fifty Years War: The United States and the Soviet Union in World Politics  |location= London & New York,&nbsp;NY  |publisher= [[Routledge]]  |isbn= 978-0-415-10471-5  |ref= harv  |url-access= registration  |url= https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearswaruni0000croc  }}\n* {{Cite journal\n  |last= Gebru Tareke    |year= 2000\n  |title= The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited\n  |journal= [[International Journal of African Historical Studies]]  |volume= 33  |issue= 3  |pages= 635\u2013667|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/students/modules/hi277/programme/t2w13/hi277_tareke.pdf   |jstor= 3097438  |ref= CITEREFTareke2000  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last= \u2014\u2014\u2014  |year= 2009\n  |title= The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa\n  |location= New Haven,&nbsp;CT  |publisher= [[Yale University Press]]\n  |isbn= 978-0-300-14163-4  |ref= CITEREFTareke2009  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last= Gorman  |first= Robert F.  |year= 1981\n  |title= Political Conflict on the Horn of Africa\n  |location= Westport,&nbsp;CT  |publisher= [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]\n  |isbn= 978-0-030-59471-7  |ref= harv  }}\n* {{Cite journal\n  |last1= Halliday  |first1= Fred  |last2= Molyneux  |first2= Maxine  |year= 1982\n  |author1-link= Fred Halliday  |author2-link= Maxine Molyneux\n  |title= Ethiopia's Revolution from Above\n  |journal= [[MERIP Reports]]  |number= 106  |pages= 5\u201315\n  |jstor= 3011492  |ref= harv  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last= Lefort  |first= Ren\u00e9  |year= 1983\n  |title= Ethiopia: An Heretical Revolution?\n  |location= London  |publisher= [[Zed Books|Zed Press]]\n  |isbn= 978-0-862-32154-3  |ref= harv  }}\n* {{Cite journal\n  |last= Urban  |first= Mark  |authorlink= Mark Urban  |year= 1983\n  |title= Soviet intervention and the Ogaden counter-offensive of 1978\n  |journal= [[RUSI Journal]]  |volume= 128  |issue= 2  |pages= 42\u201346\n  |doi= 10.1080/03071848308523524  |ref= harv  }}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last= Ayele  |first= Fantahun  |year= 2014\n  |title= The Ethiopian Army: From Victory to Collapse, 1977-1991\n  |publisher= Northwestern University Press\n  |isbn= 9780810130111 |ref= CITEREFAyele2014  }}\n{{Refend}}\n* Woodroofe, Louise P.

The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added.\n\nIn Egyptian society, [[ancient Egyptian religion|religion]] was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people. The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods; his role was both as civil and religious administrator. He owned all of the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and defended Egypt from invaders as the [[commander-in-chief]] of the army.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/pharaoh/home.html |title=Pharaoh |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1999 |website=AncientEgypt.co.uk |publisher=The British Museum |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}</ref> Religiously, the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples. He was responsible for maintaining [[Maat]] ([[wikt:m\ua723\ua725t#Egyptian|m\ua723\ua725t]]), or cosmic order, balance, and justice, and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat, such as to obtain resources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ancient.eu/pharaoh/ |title=Pharaoh - Ancient History Encyclopedia |last=Mark |first=Joshua |date=2 September 2009 |website=ancient.eu |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia Limited |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early days prior to the unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]], the [[Deshret]] or the \"Red Crown\", was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt, while the [[Hedjet]], the \"White Crown\", was worn by the kings of the kingdom of Upper Egypt. After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt, the [[Pschent]], the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings. With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties like the [[Khat (apparel)|Khat]], [[Nemes]], [[Atef]], [[Hemhem crown]], and [[Khepresh]]. At times, it was depicted that a combination of these headdresses or crowns would be worn together.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''pharaoh'' ultimately derives from the [[Egyptian language#History|Egyptian]] compound ''{{lang|egy-Latn|[[wikt:pr \ua725\ua723|pr \ua725\ua723]]}}'', *{{ipa|/\u02ccpa\u027euw\u02c8\u0295a\u0280/}} \"great house\", written with the two [[Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral hieroglyphs]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|[[pr (hieroglyph)|pr]]}}'' \"house\" and ''{{lang|egy-Latn|\ua725\ua723}}'' \"column\", here meaning \"great\" or \"high\". It was used only in larger phrases such as ''[[wikt:smr#Etymology 1|smr]] pr-\ua725\ua723'' \"Courtier of the High House\", with specific reference to the buildings of the court or palace.<ref>A. Gardiner, ''Ancient Egyptian Grammar'' (3rd edn, 1957), 71\u201376.</ref> From the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] onward, the word appears in a wish formula \"Great House, May it [[Ankh wedja seneb|Live, Prosper, and be in Health]]\", but again only with reference to the royal palace and not the person.\n\nSometime during the era of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], ''pharaoh'' became the form of address for a person who was king. The earliest confirmed instance where ''pr \ua725\ua723'' is used specifically to address the ruler is in a letter to [[Akhenaten]] (reigned c. 1353\u20131336 BCE) which is addressed to \"Great House, L, W, H, the Lord\".<ref>''Hieratic Papyrus from Kahun and Gurob'', F.

A red crown has been found on a pottery shard from [[Naqada]], and later, [[Narmer]] is shown wearing the red crown on both the [[Narmer Macehead]] and the [[Narmer Palette]].\n\n===Hedjet===\nThe white crown of Upper Egypt, the [[Hedjet]], was worn in the Predynastic Period by [[Scorpion II]], and, later, by Narmer.\n\n===Pschent===\nThis is the combination of the Deshret and Hedjet crowns into a double crown, called the [[Pschent]] crown. It is first documented in the middle of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The earliest depiction may date to the reign of [[Djet]], and is otherwise surely attested during the reign of Den.<ref name=\"TW\">Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''.

The earliest depictions of the ''khat'' headdress comes from the reign of Den, but is not found again until the reign of [[Djoser]].\n\n===Nemes===\nThe [[Nemes]] headdress dates from the time of Djoser. It is the most common type of crown that has been depicted throughout Pharaonic Egypt. Any other type of crown, apart from the Khat headdress, has been commonly depicted on top of the [[Nemes]]. The statue from his [[Serdab]] in [[Saqqara]] shows the king wearing the ''nemes'' headdress.<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n[[File:Kneeling Statuette of Pepy I, ca. 2338-2298 B.C.E., 39.121.jpg|left|thumb|Statuette of Pepy I (ca. 2338-2298 B.C.E.) wearing a nemes headdress [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\n===Atef===\nOsiris is shown to wear the [[Atef]] crown, which is an elaborate [[Hedjet]] with feathers and disks. Depictions of Pharaohs wearing the [[Atef]] crown originate from the Old Kingdom.\n\n===Hemhem===\nThe [[Hemhem crown]] is usually depicted on top of [[Nemes]], [[Pschent]], or [[Deshret]] crowns. It is an ornate triple [[Atef]] with corkscrew sheep horns and usually two uraei. The usage (depiction) of this crown begins during the Early 18th dynasty of Egypt.\n\n===Khepresh===\nAlso called the blue crown, the [[Khepresh]] crown has been depicted in art since the New Kingdom. It is often depicted being worn in battle, but it was also frequently worn during ceremonies. It used to be called a war crown by many, but modern historians refrain from defining it thus.\n\n===Physical evidence===\nEgyptologist [[Bob Brier]] has noted that despite their widespread depiction in royal portraits, no ancient Egyptian crown has ever been discovered. [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb, discovered largely intact, did contain such regalia as his [[crook and flail]], but no crown was found among the funerary equipment. Diadems have been discovered.<ref>Shaw, Garry J. ''The Pharaoh, Life at Court and on Campaign''. Thames and Hudson, 2012, pp.&nbsp;21, 77.</ref>\n\nIt is presumed that crowns would have been believed to have magical properties. Brier's speculation is that crowns were religious or state items, so a dead pharaoh likely could not retain a crown as a personal possession. The crowns may have been passed along to the successor.<ref>Bob Brier, ''The Murder of Tutankhamen'', 1998, p. 95.</ref>\n\n==Titles==\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian royal titulary}}\nDuring the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic period]] kings had three titles. The [[Horus]] name is the oldest and dates to the late pre-dynastic period. The ''Nesu Bity'' name was added during the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The ''Nebty'' name was first introduced toward the end of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]].<ref name=\"TW\" /> The Golden falcon (''bik-nbw'') name is not well understood. The prenomen and nomen were introduced later and are traditionally enclosed in a [[Cartouche (hieroglyph)|cartouche]].<ref name=\"DH\"/> By the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the official [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|titulary]] of the ruler consisted of five names; Horus, nebty, golden Horus, nomen, and prenomen<ref>Ian Shaw, ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', Oxford University Press 2000, p.&nbsp;477</ref> for some rulers, only one or two of them may be known.\n\n===''Nesu Bity'' name===\nThe ''Nesu Bity'' name, also known as [[Prenomen (ancient Egypt)|Prenomen]], was one of the new developments from the reign of [[Den (pharaoh)|Den]]. The name would follow the glyphs for the \"Sedge and the Bee\". The title is usually translated as king of Upper and Lower Egypt. The ''nsw bity'' name may have been the birth name of the king. It was often the name by which kings were recorded in the later annals and king lists.<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n\n===Horus name===\nThe Horus name was adopted by the king, when taking the throne. The name was written within a square frame representing the palace, named a [[serekh]]. The earliest known example of a serekh dates to the reign of king [[Ka (pharaoh)|Ka]], before the first dynasty.<ref>Toby A. H. Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt, Routledge 1999, pp.&nbsp;57f.</ref> The Horus name of several early kings expresses a relationship with [[Horus]]. [[Hor-Aha|Aha]] refers to \"Horus the fighter\", [[Djer]] refers to \"Horus the strong\", etc. Later kings express ideals of kingship in their Horus names. [[Khasekhemwy]] refers to \"Horus: the two powers are at peace\", while [[Nebra (Pharaoh)|Nebra]] refers to \"Horus, Lord of the Sun\".<ref name=\"TW\" />\n\n===''Nebty'' name===\nThe earliest example of a ''nebty'' name comes from the reign of king [[Hor-Aha|Aha]] from the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The title links the king with the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt [[Nekhbet]] and [[Wadjet]].<ref name=\"TW\"/><ref name=\"DH\"/> The title is preceded by the vulture (Nekhbet) and the cobra (Wadjet) standing on a basket (the neb sign).<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n\n===Golden Horus===\nThe Golden Horus or Golden Falcon name was preceded by a falcon on a gold or ''nbw'' sign. The title may have represented the divine status of the king. The Horus associated with gold may be referring to the idea that the bodies of the deities were made of gold and the [[Egyptian pyramids#Pyramid symbolism|pyramid]]s and [[obelisk]]s are representations of (golden) [[sun]]-rays. The gold sign may also be a reference to Nubt, the city of Set. This would suggest that the iconography represents Horus conquering Set.<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n\n===Nomen and prenomen===\nThe [[Prenomen (ancient Egypt)|prenomen]] and [[Nomen (ancient Egypt)|nomen]] were contained in a cartouche. The prenomen often followed the King of Upper and Lower Egypt (''nsw bity'') or Lord of the Two Lands (''nebtawy'') title. The prenomen often incorporated the name of [[Ra|Re]]. The nomen often followed the title Son of Re (''sa-ra'') or the title Lord of Appearances (''neb-kha'').<ref name=\"DH\">Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

Print.</ref> although the actual term \"Pharaoh\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until [[Merneptah]], c. 1200 BCE. In the early dynasty, ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to [[ancient Egyptian royal titulary|three titles]], the Horus, the [[prenomen (Ancient Egypt)|Sedge and Bee]] ([[wikt:nswt-bjtj|''nswt-bjtj'']]) name, and the Two Ladies ([[wikt:nbtj|''nbtj'']]) name. The Golden Horus and nomen and prenomen titles were later added.\n\nIn Egyptian society, [[ancient Egyptian religion|religion]] was central to everyday life. One of the roles of the pharaoh was as an intermediary between the gods and the people. The pharaoh thus deputised for the gods; his role was both as civil and religious administrator. He owned all of the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, and defended Egypt from invaders as the [[commander-in-chief]] of the army.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ancientegypt.co.uk/pharaoh/home.html |title=Pharaoh |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1999 |website=AncientEgypt.co.uk |publisher=The British Museum |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}</ref> Religiously, the pharaoh officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples. He was responsible for maintaining [[Maat]] ([[wikt:m\ua723\ua725t#Egyptian|m\ua723\ua725t]]), or cosmic order, balance, and justice, and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat, such as to obtain resources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ancient.eu/pharaoh/ |title=Pharaoh - Ancient History Encyclopedia |last=Mark |first=Joshua |date=2 September 2009 |website=ancient.eu |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia Limited |access-date=20 December 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early days prior to the unification of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]], the [[Deshret]] or the \"Red Crown\", was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt, while the [[Hedjet]], the \"White Crown\", was worn by the kings of the kingdom of Upper Egypt. After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt, the [[Pschent]], the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings. With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties like the [[Khat (apparel)|Khat]], [[Nemes]], [[Atef]], [[Hemhem crown]], and [[Khepresh]]. At times, it was depicted that a combination of these headdresses or crowns would be worn together.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''pharaoh'' ultimately derives from the [[Egyptian language#History|Egyptian]] compound ''{{lang|egy-Latn|[[wikt:pr \ua725\ua723|pr \ua725\ua723]]}}'', *{{ipa|/\u02ccpa\u027euw\u02c8\u0295a\u0280/}} \"great house\", written with the two [[Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral hieroglyphs]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|[[pr (hieroglyph)|pr]]}}'' \"house\" and ''{{lang|egy-Latn|\ua725\ua723}}'' \"column\", here meaning \"great\" or \"high\". It was used only in larger phrases such as ''[[wikt:smr#Etymology 1|smr]] pr-\ua725\ua723'' \"Courtier of the High House\", with specific reference to the buildings of the court or palace.<ref>A. Gardiner, ''Ancient Egyptian Grammar'' (3rd edn, 1957), 71\u201376.</ref> From the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] onward, the word appears in a wish formula \"Great House, May it [[Ankh wedja seneb|Live, Prosper, and be in Health]]\", but again only with reference to the royal palace and not the person.\n\nSometime during the era of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], ''pharaoh'' became the form of address for a person who was king. The earliest confirmed instance where ''pr \ua725\ua723'' is used specifically to address the ruler is in a letter to [[Akhenaten]] (reigned c. 1353\u20131336 BCE) which is addressed to \"Great House, L, W, H, the Lord\".<ref>''Hieratic Papyrus from Kahun and Gurob'', F.

The ''was''-scepter is shown in the hands of both kings and deities.\n\nThe [[flail]] later was closely related to the ''heqa''-scepter (the [[crook and flail]]), but in early representations the king was also depicted solely with the flail, as shown in a late pre-dynastic knife handle which is now in the Metropolitan museum, and on the [[Narmer Macehead]].<ref name=\"TW161\">Wilkinson, Toby A.H.

A red crown has been found on a pottery shard from [[Naqada]], and later, [[Narmer]] is shown wearing the red crown on both the [[Narmer Macehead]] and the [[Narmer Palette]].\n\n===Hedjet===\nThe white crown of Upper Egypt, the [[Hedjet]], was worn in the Predynastic Period by [[Scorpion II]], and, later, by Narmer.\n\n===Pschent===\nThis is the combination of the Deshret and Hedjet crowns into a double crown, called the [[Pschent]] crown. It is first documented in the middle of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The earliest depiction may date to the reign of [[Djet]], and is otherwise surely attested during the reign of Den.<ref name=\"TW\">Wilkinson, Toby A.H. ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-415-26011-4}}</ref>\n\n===Khat===\n[[File:Den1.jpg|thumb|right|Den]]\nThe [[Khat (apparel)|''khat'']] headdress consists of a kind of \"kerchief\" whose end is tied similarly to a [[ponytail]]. The earliest depictions of the ''khat'' headdress comes from the reign of Den, but is not found again until the reign of [[Djoser]].\n\n===Nemes===\nThe [[Nemes]] headdress dates from the time of Djoser. It is the most common type of crown that has been depicted throughout Pharaonic Egypt. Any other type of crown, apart from the Khat headdress, has been commonly depicted on top of the [[Nemes]]. The statue from his [[Serdab]] in [[Saqqara]] shows the king wearing the ''nemes'' headdress.<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n[[File:Kneeling Statuette of Pepy I, ca. 2338-2298 B.C.E., 39.121.jpg|left|thumb|Statuette of Pepy I (ca. 2338-2298 B.C.E.) wearing a nemes headdress [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\n===Atef===\nOsiris is shown to wear the [[Atef]] crown, which is an elaborate [[Hedjet]] with feathers and disks. Depictions of Pharaohs wearing the [[Atef]] crown originate from the Old Kingdom.\n\n===Hemhem===\nThe [[Hemhem crown]] is usually depicted on top of [[Nemes]], [[Pschent]], or [[Deshret]] crowns. It is an ornate triple [[Atef]] with corkscrew sheep horns and usually two uraei. The usage (depiction) of this crown begins during the Early 18th dynasty of Egypt.\n\n===Khepresh===\nAlso called the blue crown, the [[Khepresh]] crown has been depicted in art since the New Kingdom. It is often depicted being worn in battle, but it was also frequently worn during ceremonies. It used to be called a war crown by many, but modern historians refrain from defining it thus.\n\n===Physical evidence===\nEgyptologist [[Bob Brier]] has noted that despite their widespread depiction in royal portraits, no ancient Egyptian crown has ever been discovered. [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb, discovered largely intact, did contain such regalia as his [[crook and flail]], but no crown was found among the funerary equipment. Diadems have been discovered.<ref>Shaw, Garry J. ''The Pharaoh, Life at Court and on Campaign''. Thames and Hudson, 2012, pp.&nbsp;21, 77.</ref>\n\nIt is presumed that crowns would have been believed to have magical properties. Brier's speculation is that crowns were religious or state items, so a dead pharaoh likely could not retain a crown as a personal possession. The crowns may have been passed along to the successor.<ref>Bob Brier, ''The Murder of Tutankhamen'', 1998, p. 95.</ref>\n\n==Titles==\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian royal titulary}}\nDuring the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic period]] kings had three titles. The [[Horus]] name is the oldest and dates to the late pre-dynastic period. The ''Nesu Bity'' name was added during the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The ''Nebty'' name was first introduced toward the end of the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]].<ref name=\"TW\" /> The Golden falcon (''bik-nbw'') name is not well understood. The prenomen and nomen were introduced later and are traditionally enclosed in a [[Cartouche (hieroglyph)|cartouche]].<ref name=\"DH\"/> By the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the official [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|titulary]] of the ruler consisted of five names; Horus, nebty, golden Horus, nomen, and prenomen<ref>Ian Shaw, ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'', Oxford University Press 2000, p.&nbsp;477</ref> for some rulers, only one or two of them may be known.\n\n===''Nesu Bity'' name===\nThe ''Nesu Bity'' name, also known as [[Prenomen (ancient Egypt)|Prenomen]], was one of the new developments from the reign of [[Den (pharaoh)|Den]]. The name would follow the glyphs for the \"Sedge and the Bee\". The title is usually translated as king of Upper and Lower Egypt. The ''nsw bity'' name may have been the birth name of the king. It was often the name by which kings were recorded in the later annals and king lists.<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n\n===Horus name===\nThe Horus name was adopted by the king, when taking the throne. The name was written within a square frame representing the palace, named a [[serekh]]. The earliest known example of a serekh dates to the reign of king [[Ka (pharaoh)|Ka]], before the first dynasty.<ref>Toby A. H. Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt, Routledge 1999, pp.&nbsp;57f.</ref> The Horus name of several early kings expresses a relationship with [[Horus]]. [[Hor-Aha|Aha]] refers to \"Horus the fighter\", [[Djer]] refers to \"Horus the strong\", etc. Later kings express ideals of kingship in their Horus names. [[Khasekhemwy]] refers to \"Horus: the two powers are at peace\", while [[Nebra (Pharaoh)|Nebra]] refers to \"Horus, Lord of the Sun\".<ref name=\"TW\" />\n\n===''Nebty'' name===\nThe earliest example of a ''nebty'' name comes from the reign of king [[Hor-Aha|Aha]] from the [[First dynasty of Egypt|first dynasty]]. The title links the king with the goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt [[Nekhbet]] and [[Wadjet]].<ref name=\"TW\"/><ref name=\"DH\"/> The title is preceded by the vulture (Nekhbet) and the cobra (Wadjet) standing on a basket (the neb sign).<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n\n===Golden Horus===\nThe Golden Horus or Golden Falcon name was preceded by a falcon on a gold or ''nbw'' sign. The title may have represented the divine status of the king. The Horus associated with gold may be referring to the idea that the bodies of the deities were made of gold and the [[Egyptian pyramids#Pyramid symbolism|pyramid]]s and [[obelisk]]s are representations of (golden) [[sun]]-rays. The gold sign may also be a reference to Nubt, the city of Set. This would suggest that the iconography represents Horus conquering Set.<ref name=\"TW\"/>\n\n===Nomen and prenomen===\nThe [[Prenomen (ancient Egypt)|prenomen]] and [[Nomen (ancient Egypt)|nomen]] were contained in a cartouche. The prenomen often followed the King of Upper and Lower Egypt (''nsw bity'') or Lord of the Two Lands (''nebtawy'') title. The prenomen often incorporated the name of [[Ra|Re]]. The nomen often followed the title Son of Re (''sa-ra'') or the title Lord of Appearances (''neb-kha'').<ref name=\"DH\">Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

The band found success in the mid-1980s, releasing seven singles that made the [[UK Top 40]] and three albums on the UK Top 30. They were the first band under the production team of [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] to have a number-one single. At the peak of their success, the lineup consisted of [[Pete Burns]] (vocals), Mike Percy (bass), Steve Coy (drums) and Tim Lever (keyboards).\n\nTwo of the band's singles reached the U.S. Top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] -- \"[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]\" (No.&nbsp;11 in 1985) and \"[[Brand New Lover]]\" (No.&nbsp;15 in 1986). \n\n\"You Spin Me Round\" peaked at number one for two weeks in 1985 in the UK, then charted again in 2006 following Burns' appearance on the television reality show ''[[Big Brother (UK)#Celebrity Big Brother|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. It also became the first of two singles to top the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]'' ranked them as the 96th most successful \"dance artist\" of all time. As of 2017 Dead or Alive had sold over 30 million albums and 28 million singles worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> The band was discontinued following Pete Burns' death in 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early career of band===\n[[File:Nightmares In wax 1980.jpg|thumb|Nightmares In Wax (March 1980)]]\nIn 1977, Burns formed a band with contemporaries [[Julian Cope]], [[Pete Wylie]], and Phil Hurst, calling themselves The Mystery Girls. They played only one gig (opening for [[Sham 69]] at [[Eric's Club|Eric's]] in Liverpool in November 1977) before disintegrating.<ref name=\"Greene\">Greene, Jo-Ann \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p481612|pure_url=yes}} Nightmares in Wax Biography]\", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> Burns returned in early 1979 with a new band, Nightmares in Wax (original name: 'Rainbows Over Nagasaki'), featuring a [[Gothic rock|gothic post-punk]] sound, with backing from keyboardist Martin Healy, guitarist Mick Reid (ex-Crash Course and Glass Torpedoes), bassist Rob Jones, who left soon afterwards to be replaced by Walter Ogden, and drummer Paul Hornby, formerly of 051 and [[Pink Military]], who also exited soon after the band's formation to be replaced by Phil Hurst.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> Nightmares in Wax played their first gig supporting Wire at Eric's in July 1979,<ref>Jonathan Buckley, Mark Ellingham, Justin Lewis, and Jill Furmanovsky (1996) ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|978-1-85828-201-5}}</ref> and, around the same time, recorded demos which included a cover of the Simon Dupree song \"Kites\", a feature of their early shows. Although signed to the Eric's Records label, their only release, a three-track 7\" EP entitled ''Birth of a Nation'', appeared in March 1980 on Inevitable Records. A 12-inch single featuring two of the tracks from the EP, \"Black Leather\" and \"Shangri-La\", was released in 1985.<ref>Gimarc, George (2005) ''Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide to Underground Rock 1970\u20131982'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-848-6}}, p.312</ref> The EP featured \"Black Leather\", which halfway through turned into [[K.C. & the Sunshine Band]]'s \"[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]\" (a song later revived by Dead or Alive).<ref name=\"Greene\" />\n\nOgden left the band at the beginning of November 1979 shortly before the recording of demos for the planned Inevitable Records release. Bassist Ambrose Reynolds helped out on both these sessions and those for the EP a month later. Pete Lloyd joined in January 1980 and the band returned to playing live shows early in February. Lloyd and Reid left the band in March 1980, and Hurst followed a month or so later. Burns and Healy were then joined by bassist Sue James, guitarist Adrian Mitchley, and drummer Joe Musker and,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nightmares-in-wax-mn0001296867|title=Nightmares in Wax - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> in May 1980, just before they were to record a radio session for [[John Peel]], Burns changed the name of the band to Dead or Alive.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> The band went through several line-up changes over the next three years while recording a series of independent singles. Burns' eccentric and [[androgynous]] appearance began attracting attention, often leading to comparisons with [[Culture Club]] and its lead singer [[Boy George]].\n\nDead or Alive's singles started charting on the [[UK Indie Chart]], beginning with 1982's \"The Stranger\" reaching No.&nbsp;7 on that chart.<ref name=\"Lazell\">Lazell, Barry (1997) ''Indie Hits 1980\u20131989'', Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}, p.61</ref> This prompted major label [[Epic Records]] to sign the band in 1983. Their first release for Epic was the single \"[[Misty Circles]]\", which appeared at No.&nbsp;100 on the major UK Singles Chart in 1983. At this point, the band was a five-piece consisting of Burns, Mike Percy (bass), Tim Lever (keyboards/sax), Steve Coy (drums), and [[Wayne Hussey]] (guitar). Two more singles, \"What I Want\" and \"I'd Do Anything\", attracted club play, but mainstream success continued to elude the band.\n\nDead or Alive's debut album, ''[[Sophisticated Boom Boom]]'', was released in May 1984 and featured their first Top 40 UK single, \"[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]\", a remake of the 1975 hit by [[KC and the Sunshine Band]].

The lead single \"[[Brand New Lover]]\" became a modest UK hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;31, but was more successful in the US where it reached No.&nbsp;15 on the US Hot 100, and number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play|''Billboard'' dance chart]].<ref name=UScharts/> Three more singles from the album were released, although none saw any notable US success on the pop charts. All of these singles caused some sort of controversy in the UK. The most successful in the UK was \"Something in My House\" (UK No.&nbsp;12), tonally Gothic and with a sleeve depicting Burns in front of what appears to be a [[Satan]]ic altar, featuring an inverted cross. A 12\" version of the song, the 'Mortevicar Mix', featured scenes from Nosferatu and sampling of dialogue from the soundtrack of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and a sampling from the ''[[George A. Romero]]'' American movie trailer from his film ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' ([[1985 in film|1985]]) and other '80s horror films. A third single, \"Hooked on Love\", failed to make the UK Top 40 and had a \"Gothic\" overtone that had been added in a post-production remix.\n\nAfter the release of the album, Tim Lever and Mike Percy left the band to form careers as mixers and producers aka 'One World Productions'. The pair currently own and operate [[Steelworks Studios]] in [[Sheffield]], UK.<ref>[http://home.btconnect.com/freedom-manageme/steelworks-studios/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629050935/http://home.btconnect.com/freedom-manageme/steelworks-studios/index.html |date=29 June 2007 }}</ref> As mixers and producers, Lever and Percy experienced success writing and mixing songs for acts like [[S Club 7]], [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]], and [[Robbie Williams]]. In 1987, Dead or Alive released their greatest hits album ''[[Rip It Up (Dead or Alive album)|Rip It Up]]'', and a concert tour of the same name. In mid 1988, Dead or Alive, now pared down to a duo of Burns and Coy, released the self-produced ''[[Nude (Dead or Alive album)|Nude]]'', which featured the single \"[[Turn Around and Count 2 Ten]]\". It was followed by \"[[Come Home with Me Baby]]\". The single was a US club hit, including number one on the US dance charts.<ref name=UScharts/>\n\n===1990s===\n1990 saw the release of ''[[Fan the Flame (Part 1)]]''; an album released only in Japan. The album had three singles, \"Your Sweetness (Is Your Weakness)\", \"Gone Too Long\", and \"Unhappy Birthday\". The band had planned to release ''Fan the Flame (Part 2)'' in 1992, which was similar in style to Part 1, but with the modest sales of Part 1 in UK, Part 2 was never released. It would have featured tracks such as \"I Don't Care About Your Heart\", as well as a cover of Barry White's \"[[It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me]]\". Some tracks were later re-recorded for the band's ''[[Nukleopatra]]'' album. It is often confused with the acoustic ''Love, Pete'' album, which was sold in cassette form on the band's 1992 tour (during which tracks from Part 2 were previewed).\n\nFor a few years, Dead or Alive were mostly inactive in the recording studio. Burns resurfaced in 1994 as vocalist on a single for the Italian [[techno]] outfit Glam. Burns helped write the single, \"Sex Drive\", which was a return to the dance floor. Burns and Coy flirted with the idea of recording under the name International Chrysis, named after the late transsexual nightclub performer, and released a single as such in 1994, a [[cover version]] of [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".\n\nThe year 1995 saw new work from Dead or Alive with new keyboardists Jason Alburey and Dean Bright, joining Burns and Coy for the album ''[[Nukleopatra]]''. The album featured a smattering of previously released material, including \"Rebel Rebel\", \"Sex Drive\", and two tracks that originally appeared on ''Fan the Flame (Part 1)'', \"Gone Too Long\" and \"Unhappy Birthday\". The album also featured a cover of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"Picture This\". Initially released in Japan only, ''Nukleopatra'' was later released in Australia, Singapore, South Africa, France and the United States, and each release sported different cover art, track listings, and song versions. Many releases of ''Nukleopatra'' also included one or more remixes of \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\".\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, Dead or Alive released ''[[Fragile (Dead or Alive album)|Fragile]]'', a collection of remakes with several new tracks and covers including [[U2]]'s \"[[Even Better Than the Real Thing]]\" and [[Nick Kamen]]'s \"I Promised Myself\". This would eventually be their seventh and final studio album. A new remix album, ''[[Unbreakable (Dead or Alive album)|Unbreakable]]'', was released in 2001. This was followed by a greatest hits album entitled ''[[Evolution: the Hits]]'', released in 2003 which featured yet another remix of \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\"; both of them enjoyed, for the first time since ''Nude'', a UK release, with \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" re-entering the Top 40. Later on in 2003, Alburey and Bright departed the band, leaving Dead or Alive once again a duo of Burns and Coy.\n\nIn 2004, Burns enjoyed solo success with the [[Pet Shop Boys]]-produced track \"Jack and Jill Party\". Although only released through the Pet Shop Boys website, the track reached number 75 in the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Official Charts Company \u2013 Pete Burns |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=2004-06-19 |accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn September 2010, Burns released a new single, \"Never Marry an Icon\".

Dead or Alive were featured at Gay Pride in Los Angeles in 1995.\n\n==''Celebrity Big Brother''==\nIn 2006, Pete Burns took part in the TV show ''Celebrity Big Brother'' in the UK. Burns became known for openly insulting actress [[Traci Bingham]] and performing modern dance with [[Respect Party|Respect]]<!-- Not yet a 'Party' in 2006. --> MP [[George Galloway]].

The band found success in the mid-1980s, releasing seven singles that made the [[UK Top 40]] and three albums on the UK Top 30. They were the first band under the production team of [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] to have a number-one single. At the peak of their success, the lineup consisted of [[Pete Burns]] (vocals), Mike Percy (bass), Steve Coy (drums) and Tim Lever (keyboards).\n\nTwo of the band's singles reached the U.S. Top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] -- \"[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]\" (No.&nbsp;11 in 1985) and \"[[Brand New Lover]]\" (No.&nbsp;15 in 1986). \n\n\"You Spin Me Round\" peaked at number one for two weeks in 1985 in the UK, then charted again in 2006 following Burns' appearance on the television reality show ''[[Big Brother (UK)#Celebrity Big Brother|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. It also became the first of two singles to top the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]'' ranked them as the 96th most successful \"dance artist\" of all-time. As of 2017 Dead or Alive had sold over 30 million albums and 28 million singles worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> The band was discontinued following Pete Burns' death in 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early career of band===\n[[File:Nightmares In wax 1980.jpg|thumb|Nightmares In Wax (March 1980)]]\nIn 1977, Burns formed a band with contemporaries [[Julian Cope]], [[Pete Wylie]], and Phil Hurst, calling themselves The Mystery Girls. They played only one gig (opening for [[Sham 69]] at [[Eric's Club|Eric's]] in Liverpool in November 1977) before disintegrating.<ref name=\"Greene\">Greene, Jo-Ann \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p481612|pure_url=yes}} Nightmares in Wax Biography]\", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> Burns returned in early 1979 with a new band, Nightmares in Wax (original name: 'Rainbows Over Nagasaki'), featuring a [[Gothic rock|gothic post-punk]] sound, with backing from keyboardist Martin Healy, guitarist Mick Reid (ex-Crash Course and Glass Torpedoes), bassist Rob Jones, who left soon afterwards to be replaced by Walter Ogden, and drummer Paul Hornby, formerly of 051 and [[Pink Military]], who also exited soon after the band's formation to be replaced by Phil Hurst.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> Nightmares in Wax played their first gig supporting Wire at Eric's in July 1979,<ref>Jonathan Buckley, Mark Ellingham, Justin Lewis, and Jill Furmanovsky (1996) ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|978-1-85828-201-5}}</ref> and, around the same time, recorded demos which included a cover of the Simon Dupree song \"Kites\", a feature of their early shows. Although signed to the Eric's Records label, their only release, a three-track 7\" EP entitled ''Birth of a Nation'', appeared in March 1980 on Inevitable Records. A 12-inch single featuring two of the tracks from the EP, \"Black Leather\" and \"Shangri-La\", was released in 1985.<ref>Gimarc, George (2005) ''Punk Diary: The Ultimate Trainspotter's Guide to Underground Rock 1970\u20131982'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-848-6}}, p.312</ref> The EP featured \"Black Leather\", which halfway through turned into [[K.C. & the Sunshine Band]]'s \"[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]\" (a song later revived by Dead or Alive).<ref name=\"Greene\" />\n\nOgden left the band at the beginning of November 1979 shortly before the recording of demos for the planned Inevitable Records release. Bassist Ambrose Reynolds helped out on both these sessions and those for the EP a month later. Pete Lloyd joined in January 1980 and the band returned to playing live shows early in February. Lloyd and Reid left the band in March 1980, and Hurst followed a month or so later. Burns and Healy were then joined by bassist Sue James, guitarist Adrian Mitchley, and drummer Joe Musker and,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nightmares-in-wax-mn0001296867|title=Nightmares in Wax - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=22 January 2018}}</ref> in May 1980, just before they were to record a radio session for [[John Peel]], Burns changed the name of the band to Dead or Alive.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> The band went through several line-up changes over the next three years while recording a series of independent singles. Burns' eccentric and [[androgynous]] appearance began attracting attention, often leading to comparisons with [[Culture Club]] and its lead singer [[Boy George]].\n\nDead or Alive's singles started charting on the [[UK Indie Chart]], beginning with 1982's \"The Stranger\" reaching No.&nbsp;7 on that chart.<ref name=\"Lazell\">Lazell, Barry (1997) ''Indie Hits 1980\u20131989'', Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}, p.61</ref> This prompted major label [[Epic Records]] to sign the band in 1983. Their first release for Epic was the single \"[[Misty Circles]]\", which appeared at No.&nbsp;100 on the major UK Singles Chart in 1983. At this point, the band was a five-piece consisting of Burns, Mike Percy (bass), Tim Lever (keyboards/sax), Steve Coy (drums), and [[Wayne Hussey]] (guitar). Two more singles, \"What I Want\" and \"I'd Do Anything\", attracted club play, but mainstream success continued to elude the band.\n\nDead or Alive's debut album, ''[[Sophisticated Boom Boom]]'', was released in May 1984 and featured their first Top 40 UK single, \"[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]\", a remake of the 1975 hit by [[KC and the Sunshine Band]]. Hussey departed Dead or Alive just before the album's release. The single peaked at No.&nbsp;22 in the UK and the album at No.&nbsp;29.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Official Charts Company \u2013 Dead Or Alive |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===1980s chart success===\nNow a four-piece following the departure of Hussey, in May 1985 the band released its second album ''[[Youthquake (album)|Youthquake]]'' (US No.&nbsp;31, UK No.&nbsp;9), produced by the then-fledgling songwriting/production team of [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]], [[Matt Aitken]], and [[Pete Waterman]] known as [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] (SAW).

They all reached the UK Top 30.\n\nIn late 1986, Dead or Alive released their third album, ''[[Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know (Dead or Alive album)|Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know]]'' (US No.&nbsp;52, UK No.&nbsp;27), also produced by SAW. The lead single \"[[Brand New Lover]]\" became a modest UK hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;31, but was more successful in the US where it reached No.&nbsp;15 on the US Hot 100, and number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play|''Billboard'' dance chart]].<ref name=UScharts/> Three more singles from the album were released, although none saw any notable US success on the pop charts. All of these singles caused some sort of controversy in the UK. The most successful in the UK was \"Something in My House\" (UK No.&nbsp;12), tonally Gothic and with a sleeve depicting Burns in front of what appears to be a [[Satan]]ic altar, featuring an inverted cross. A 12\" version of the song, the 'Mortevicar Mix', featured scenes from Nosferatu and sampling of dialogue from the soundtrack of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and a sampling from the ''[[George A. Romero]]'' American movie trailer from his film ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' ([[1985 in film|1985]]) and other '80s horror films. A third single, \"Hooked on Love\", failed to make the UK Top 40 and had a \"Gothic\" overtone that had been added in a post-production remix.\n\nAfter the release of the album, Tim Lever and Mike Percy left the band to form careers as mixers and producers aka 'One World Productions'. The pair currently own and operate [[Steelworks Studios]] in [[Sheffield]], UK.<ref>[http://home.btconnect.com/freedom-manageme/steelworks-studios/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629050935/http://home.btconnect.com/freedom-manageme/steelworks-studios/index.html |date=29 June 2007 }}</ref> As mixers and producers, Lever and Percy experienced success writing and mixing songs for acts like [[S Club 7]], [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]], and [[Robbie Williams]]. In 1987, Dead or Alive released their greatest hits album ''[[Rip It Up (Dead or Alive album)|Rip It Up]]'', and a concert tour of the same name. In mid 1988, Dead or Alive, now pared down to a duo of Burns and Coy, released the self-produced ''[[Nude (Dead or Alive album)|Nude]]'', which featured the single \"[[Turn Around and Count 2 Ten]]\". It was followed by \"[[Come Home with Me Baby]]\". The single was a US club hit, including number one on the US dance charts.<ref name=UScharts/>\n\n===1990s===\n1990 saw the release of ''[[Fan the Flame (Part 1)]]''; an album released only in Japan. The album had three singles, \"Your Sweetness (Is Your Weakness)\", \"Gone Too Long\", and \"Unhappy Birthday\". The band had planned to release ''Fan the Flame (Part 2)'' in 1992, which was similar in style to Part 1, but with the modest sales of Part 1 in UK, Part 2 was never released. It would have featured tracks such as \"I Don't Care About Your Heart\", as well as a cover of Barry White's \"[[It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me]]\". Some tracks were later re-recorded for the band's ''[[Nukleopatra]]'' album. It is often confused with the acoustic ''Love, Pete'' album, which was sold in cassette form on the band's 1992 tour (during which tracks from Part 2 were previewed).\n\nFor a few years, Dead or Alive were mostly inactive in the recording studio. Burns resurfaced in 1994 as vocalist on a single for the Italian [[techno]] outfit Glam. Burns helped write the single, \"Sex Drive\", which was a return to the dance floor. Burns and Coy flirted with the idea of recording under the name International Chrysis, named after the late transsexual nightclub performer, and released a single as such in 1994, a [[cover version]] of [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".\n\nThe year 1995 saw new work from Dead or Alive with new keyboardists Jason Alburey and Dean Bright, joining Burns and Coy for the album ''[[Nukleopatra]]''. The album featured a smattering of previously released material, including \"Rebel Rebel\", \"Sex Drive\", and two tracks that originally appeared on ''Fan the Flame (Part 1)'', \"Gone Too Long\" and \"Unhappy Birthday\". The album also featured a cover of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"Picture This\". Initially released in Japan only, ''Nukleopatra'' was later released in Australia, Singapore, South Africa, France and the United States, and each release sported different cover art, track listings, and song versions. Many releases of ''Nukleopatra'' also included one or more remixes of \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\".\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, Dead or Alive released ''[[Fragile (Dead or Alive album)|Fragile]]'', a collection of remakes with several new tracks and covers including [[U2]]'s \"[[Even Better Than the Real Thing]]\" and [[Nick Kamen]]'s \"I Promised Myself\". This would eventually be their seventh and final studio album. A new remix album, ''[[Unbreakable (Dead or Alive album)|Unbreakable]]'', was released in 2001. This was followed by a greatest hits album entitled ''[[Evolution: the Hits]]'', released in 2003 which featured yet another remix of \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\"; both of them enjoyed, for the first time since ''Nude'', a UK release, with \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" re-entering the Top 40. Later on in 2003, Alburey and Bright departed the band, leaving Dead or Alive once again a duo of Burns and Coy.\n\nIn 2004, Burns enjoyed solo success with the [[Pet Shop Boys]]-produced track \"Jack and Jill Party\". Although only released through the Pet Shop Boys website, the track reached number 75 in the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Official Charts Company \u2013 Pete Burns |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=2004-06-19 |accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nIn September 2010, Burns released a new single, \"Never Marry an Icon\".

Dead or Alive were featured at Gay Pride in Los Angeles in 1995.\n\n==''Celebrity Big Brother''==\nIn 2006, Pete Burns took part in the TV show ''Celebrity Big Brother'' in the UK. Burns became known for openly insulting actress [[Traci Bingham]] and performing modern dance with [[Respect Party|Respect]]<!-- Not yet a 'Party' in 2006. --> MP [[George Galloway]]. Following the end of the show (Burns finished in fifth place), \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" (from 1985's ''Youthquake'' album) was re-released.\n\n==Personnel - Nightmares in Wax/Dead or Alive==\n===Members===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Pete Burns]]&nbsp;\u2013 vocals <small>(1979\u20132016;
