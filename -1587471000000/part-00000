The church register of [[Church of St Nicholas of Myra Without, Dublin (Roman Catholic)|St. Nicholas of Myra]], Francis Street, Dublin, shows that he was baptised there on Monday, 17 December 1849. His father was Peter Bermingham and his mother was Ellen Flood. The sponsors at his baptism were James D'Arcy and Bridget Daly. The officiating priest was Fr. Nicholas O'Farrell, curate.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn his personal life, James Bermingham was a Plumber and Sanitary Contractor living at 26 Cuffe Street, Dublin.<ref>Thoms Directory 1895</ref> He married Margaret Byrne, a native of [[County Wicklow]], in [[St. Andrew's Church, Westland Row, Dublin]] on 21 September 1873.<ref>The General Register Office, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1</ref>\n\n==Membership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood==\n\nJames Bermingham was a veteran of the 1867 [[Fenian Rising]].

Kelly (Secretary of the Amnesty Association) to [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] (alias Henry Wilson) to Portland Prison, Dorset. The report was as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"What Is Being Done to Secure the Release of Irishmen Confined In British Prisons \u2013 Their Condition.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"The usual weekly meeting of the Irish Amnesty Committee was held on Monday evening in Dublin, Mr. Troy presiding. Messrs. Bermingham and Kelly reported as to their visit to Mr. Henry Wilson [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|(Tom Clarke)]] in [[HM Prison Portland|Portland jail]] on Thursday last. Mr. Wilson is in fairly good health, much better than he was, on account of being is allowed now to work in the open air. He is to be released in November next, having spent fifteen years and six months in prison, the six months being extra punishment for breaches of prison discipline, which Mr. Wilson states was for whispering to his poor comrades to keep their hearts up.\n\nMr. Wilson latterly complains of the action of the Government in his case, as it was conveyed to him two years ago by a visitor that he would be released soon. The Home Secretary had promised as much, and instead of being released, the Government had made him complete the full fifteen years and an additional six months as above stated. Mr. Wilson is very much concerned about the men who will be left in jail after his release. These poor men are not in as good health spirits as Mr. Wilson is, and a special effort should be made to have them all released at the same time, as the effect of their comrade being gone would perhaps be the means of adding melancholy to their already prolonged sufferings.\n\nThe committee, having considered this report, decided that the Home Secretary should be written to and asked his intentions as to the remaining prisoners now in Portland. If his reply is not satisfactory, a vigorous agitation will be commenced for the purpose of effecting their release.\" </blockquote>\n\nIn September 1896, James Bermingham visited [[Cobh|Queenstown]] (Cobh), County Cork to make arrangements for the departure of the released prisoner James Murphy (alias Alfred George Whitehead) for America. (In 1883 Murphy, with [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] and others, was sentenced to penal servitude for life at the Old Bailey for allegedly planning a [[Fenian dynamite campaign|bombing campaign]] in England. He was released in 1896.) Murphy sailed from [[Cobh|Queenstown]] for New York on 13 September on board the Cunard Line steamer [[RMS Lucania|Lucania]]. On 19 September [[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]], published Bermingham's report to the Amnesty Association of his visit to Cork:\n\n<blockquote> \"Mr Bermingham arrived on Thursday and stayed until the ex-political prisoner sailed yesterday (Sunday). He reported that Mr. Whitehead has been well cared for by the local men, and the Executive desire to thank Mr. Meade T.C. for his efforts, also Mr. Deane, agent for the Cunard Company, for the great kindness and interest that he took in seeing that Mr. Whitehead would be properly cared for on his voyage. The remittance which Mr. Bermingham was entrusted with was forwarded to Mr. Egan in New York payable to Mr. Whitehead on his arrival\" </blockquote>\n\nIn early October 1898 James Bermingham and Michael Lambert, on behalf of the Amnesty Association, welcomed [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] (alias Henry Wilson) back to Ireland on his arrival at the North Wall, Dublin, on board the [[PS Banshee (1884)|SS Banshee]] after Clarke's release for prison in England.<ref>Southern Star, Skibbereen, Co. Cork, Ireland 8 October 1898</ref> Tom Clarke was later to be the first signatory of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|1916 Proclamation]].\n\nOn 21 October 1898 the Irish National Amnesty Association paraded [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Clarke]] and two other released prisoners (John Henry O'Connor and Edward O'Brien Kennedy) from 41 York Street through the city to the Round Room of the Rotunda. James Bermingham with the executive committee of the Amnesty Association accompanied Clarke and the other ex-prisoners as they crossed the city. The [[Freeman's Journal]] (22 October 1898) described the procession as follows:\n\n<blockquote> \"National music was rendered by several fife and drum bands, and flags and banners were borne by many of the contingents taking part. Hundreds of torches were carried in the procession, and their brilliant glare lighted up the streets and showed the great dimensions of the meeting and the immense crowds of spectators that gathered on either side of the roadway\"</blockquote>\n\n==1798 Centenary Celebrations==\n\nThe centenary celebrations of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rising]] was seen by advanced nationalists as an opportunity to revive republican sentiment, and United Irishmen Centennial committees were set up throughout the country to organise commemorative events. The main event was planned for Dublin. A big demonstration culminating in the laying of the foundation stone of a proposed Wolfe Tone memorial in the middle of the road at the junction of Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green took place on Monday 15 August 1898. James Bermingham was active in the Central Branch of the United Irishmen Centennial Association.<ref>Freeman's Journal report of meeting of the Central Branch under the heading \"United Irishmen Centennial Association Central Branch\" 2 February 1898</ref>\n\n[[Maud Gonne]] wrote of meeting James Bermingham at the laying of the foundation stone of the [[Wolfe Tone]] Memorial in [[St Stephen's Green|St. Stephen's Green]], Dublin, on 15 August 1898. She said that she was standing in the crowd because she did not want to join the platform party with parliamentarians who \"were eulogising Wolfe Tone and trying to keep the people from following his teaching\". James Bermingham (\"an old Fenian workingman member of the Dublin Amnesty Association\") took her hand and, along with Michael Lambert, \"the two old Fenians\" brought Maud Gonne to the back of the platform to where the foundation stone had been lowered. Maud Gonne later wrote: \"...in a low voice I promised for the Irish people that we would achieve Wolfe Tone's work, \u2013 an Independent Irish Republic\". When one of the meeting stewards noticed Maud Gonne with Bermingham and Lambert and asked what they were doing behind the platform, James Bermingham responded: \"None of your business. Go back and listen to [[John Redmond|Mr. Redmond]] and [[John Dillon|Mr. Dillon]]!\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QUBNeYDyXXsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false The autobiography of Maud Gonne: ''A Servant of the Queen'']</ref>\n\nThe foundation stone of the proposed memorial was removed by the Commissioners of the County Borough of Dublin as a traffic obstruction in November 1925 and is now on display in the 1798 Memorial Park on Wolfe Tone Quay, Dublin.\n\n==Campaign to win a Municipal Post for Tom Clarke==\n\nJames Bermingham was a prominent member of a committee which was set up to lobby in support of [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke's]] application for two municipal posts in Ireland, the clerkship of [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown County Council|Rathdown]] Union (1899) and a post as supervisor of an abattoir (1900), the second after Clarke had gone to New York.<ref>See telegrams from James Bermingham to Tom Clarke in New York (National Library of Ireland, Dublin)</ref> Clarke was unsuccessful in both applications.\n\n==Dublin Municipal Politics==\n\nIn the 1890s and early 1900s \"advanced nationalists\" began to stand for election to county councils and other municipal bodies \u2013 particularly after the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|Local Government Act 1898]] which radically extended the local government franchise by entitling all householders and occupants of a portion of a house to vote in local elections including all women over the age of thirty, provided they satisfied the same criteria as men.\n\nIn May 1902 James Bermingham was elected from the Mansion House Ward to the position of Poor Law Guardian on the South Dublin Board of Guardians. He was re-elected in May 1905 and remained a Poor Law Guardian until his death in 1907.<ref>Weekly Irish Times, Saturday 31 May 1902 and Irish Times, Wednesday 31 May 1905</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Photograph of James Bermingham's Grave.jpg|thumb|right|James Bermingham's grave in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin]]\n\nJames Bermingham died on 4 June 1907 at Jervis Street Hospital, Dublin. His funeral from [[Newman University Church|University Church]], St. Stephen's Green,<ref>[http://www.universitychurch.ie Newman University Church]</ref> to Glasnevin Cemetery was a large public event. Many of his old Fenian comrades were present along with a number of Nationalist members of parliament, Trade Union representatives and Dublin City Council officials and public representatives.<ref>Irish Independent ''Funeral of Mr. J. Bermingham'', 7 June 1907</ref> He was laid to rest beside his wife Margaret who died during the previous year.<ref>Irish Independent ''The Late Mrs. Bermingham'', 19 January 1906</ref>\n\nIn James Bermingham's obituary in the [[Irish Independent]] headed '''Dublin Nationalist's Death''' it was said of him: <blockquote>\"Yesterday there passed away in Dublin, in the person of Mr. James Bermingham, P.L.G.,<ref>Poor Law Guardian</ref> Cuffe street, another of the veterans of the \u201967 movement. As a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, he was present at the attack on the police barracks at Tallaght in \u201967. He was widely known and deeply respected in Nationalist circles in Dublin. But the work in which, perhaps, he was most prominent, however, was the later Amnesty movement started in 1892. From the start of the Irish National Amnesty Association in the Workmen\u2019s Club, York street, of which latter he was always one of the mainstays, he was one of its most earnest members. He was, with the late [[Madeleine ffrench-Mullen|Fleet Surgeon Ffrench-Mullen, R.N.]], for many years an honorary treasurer of the Association, and in the cause of Amnesty no one did more unsparing or more untiring work, the true worth of which was only known to those intimately associated with him. In later years the deceased gentleman acted as a member of the South Dublin Board of Guardians, in which he rendered quiet but effective work. The funeral will take place from the Catholic University Church, Stephen\u2019s green, on to-morrow morning.\"</blockquote><ref>Irish Independent obituary ''Dublin Nationalist's Death'', 5 June 1907</ref>\n\n[[P. T.

The church register of [[Church of St Nicholas of Myra Without, Dublin (Roman Catholic)|St. Nicholas of Myra]], Francis Street, Dublin, shows that he was baptised there on Monday, 17 December 1849. His father was Peter Bermingham and his mother was Ellen Flood. The sponsors at his baptism were James D'Arcy and Bridget Daly. The officiating priest was Fr. Nicholas O'Farrell, curate.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn his personal life, James Bermingham was a Plumber and Sanitary Contractor living at 26 Cuffe Street, Dublin.<ref>Thoms Directory 1895</ref> He married Margaret Byrne, a native of [[County Wicklow]], in [[St. Andrew's Church, Westland Row, Dublin]] on 21 September 1873.<ref>The General Register Office, Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1</ref>\n\n==Membership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood==\n\nJames Bermingham was a veteran of the 1867 [[Fenian Rising]]. As a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] he was present at the attack on the police barracks at [[Tallaght]].<ref>Irish Independent obituary 5 June 1907</ref> At the funeral of [[James Stephens (Fenian)|James Stephens]] the founder of the Irish Republican Brotherhood on 31 March 1901, James Bermingham was one of the pall bearers along with [[Michael Davitt]], C.

Kelly (Secretary of the Amnesty Association) to [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] (alias Henry Wilson) to Portland Prison, Dorset. The report was as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"What Is Being Done to Secure the Release of Irishmen Confined In British Prisons \u2013 Their Condition.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"The usual weekly meeting of the Irish Amnesty Committee was held on Monday evening in Dublin, Mr. Troy presiding. Messrs. Bermingham and Kelly reported as to their visit to Mr. Henry Wilson [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|(Tom Clarke)]] in [[HM Prison Portland|Portland jail]] on Thursday last. Mr. Wilson is in fairly good health, much better than he was, on account of being is allowed now to work in the open air. He is to be released in November next, having spent fifteen years and six months in prison, the six months being extra punishment for breaches of prison discipline, which Mr. Wilson states was for whispering to his poor comrades to keep their hearts up.\n\nMr. Wilson latterly complains of the action of the Government in his case, as it was conveyed to him two years ago by a visitor that he would be released soon. The Home Secretary had promised as much, and instead of being released, the Government had made him complete the full fifteen years and an additional six months as above stated. Mr. Wilson is very much concerned about the men who will be left in jail after his release. These poor men are not in as good health spirits as Mr. Wilson is, and a special effort should be made to have them all released at the same time, as the effect of their comrade being gone would perhaps be the means of adding melancholy to their already prolonged sufferings.\n\nThe committee, having considered this report, decided that the Home Secretary should be written to and asked his intentions as to the remaining prisoners now in Portland. If his reply is not satisfactory, a vigorous agitation will be commenced for the purpose of effecting their release.\" </blockquote>\n\nIn September 1896, James Bermingham visited [[Cobh|Queenstown]] (Cobh), County Cork to make arrangements for the departure of the released prisoner James Murphy (alias Alfred George Whitehead) for America. (In 1883 Murphy, with [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] and others, was sentenced to penal servitude for life at the Old Bailey for allegedly planning a [[Fenian dynamite campaign|bombing campaign]] in England. He was released in 1896.) Murphy sailed from [[Cobh|Queenstown]] for New York on 13 September on board the Cunard Line steamer [[RMS Lucania|Lucania]]. On 19 September [[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]], published Bermingham's report to the Amnesty Association of his visit to Cork:\n\n<blockquote> \"Mr Bermingham arrived on Thursday and stayed until the ex-political prisoner sailed yesterday (Sunday). He reported that Mr. Whitehead has been well cared for by the local men, and the Executive desire to thank Mr. Meade T.C. for his efforts, also Mr. Deane, agent for the Cunard Company, for the great kindness and interest that he took in seeing that Mr. Whitehead would be properly cared for on his voyage. The remittance which Mr. Bermingham was entrusted with was forwarded to Mr. Egan in New York payable to Mr. Whitehead on his arrival\" </blockquote>\n\nIn early October 1898 James Bermingham and Michael Lambert, on behalf of the Amnesty Association, welcomed [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] (alias Henry Wilson) back to Ireland on his arrival at the North Wall, Dublin, on board the [[PS Banshee (1884)|SS Banshee]] after Clarke's release for prison in England.<ref>Southern Star, Skibbereen, Co. Cork, Ireland 8 October 1898</ref> Tom Clarke was later to be the first signatory of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|1916 Proclamation]].\n\nOn 21 October 1898 the Irish National Amnesty Association paraded [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Clarke]] and two other released prisoners (John Henry O'Connor and Edward O'Brien Kennedy) from 41 York Street through the city to the Round Room of the Rotunda. James Bermingham with the executive committee of the Amnesty Association accompanied Clarke and the other ex-prisoners as they crossed the city. The [[Freeman's Journal]] (22 October 1898) described the procession as follows:\n\n<blockquote> \"National music was rendered by several fife and drum bands, and flags and banners were borne by many of the contingents taking part. Hundreds of torches were carried in the procession, and their brilliant glare lighted up the streets and showed the great dimensions of the meeting and the immense crowds of spectators that gathered on either side of the roadway\"</blockquote>\n\n==1798 Centenary Celebrations==\n\nThe centenary celebrations of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rising]] was seen by advanced nationalists as an opportunity to revive republican sentiment, and United Irishmen Centennial committees were set up throughout the country to organise commemorative events. The main event was planned for Dublin. A big demonstration culminating in the laying of the foundation stone of a proposed Wolfe Tone memorial in the middle of the road at the junction of Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green took place on Monday 15 August 1898. James Bermingham was active in the Central Branch of the United Irishmen Centennial Association.<ref>Freeman's Journal report of meeting of the Central Branch under the heading \"United Irishmen Centennial Association Central Branch\" 2 February 1898</ref>\n\n[[Maud Gonne]] wrote of meeting James Bermingham at the laying of the foundation stone of the [[Wolfe Tone]] Memorial in [[St Stephen's Green|St. Stephen's Green]], Dublin, on 15 August 1898. She said that she was standing in the crowd because she did not want to join the platform party with parliamentarians who \"were eulogising Wolfe Tone and trying to keep the people from following his teaching\". James Bermingham (\"an old Fenian workingman member of the Dublin Amnesty Association\") took her hand and, along with Michael Lambert, \"the two old Fenians\" brought Maud Gonne to the back of the platform to where the foundation stone had been lowered. Maud Gonne later wrote: \"...in a low voice I promised for the Irish people that we would achieve Wolfe Tone's work, \u2013 an Independent Irish Republic\". When one of the meeting stewards noticed Maud Gonne with Bermingham and Lambert and asked what they were doing behind the platform, James Bermingham responded: \"None of your business. Go back and listen to [[John Redmond|Mr. Redmond]] and [[John Dillon|Mr. Dillon]]!\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QUBNeYDyXXsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false The autobiography of Maud Gonne: ''A Servant of the Queen'']</ref>\n\nThe foundation stone of the proposed memorial was removed by the Commissioners of the County Borough of Dublin as a traffic obstruction in November 1925 and is now on display in the 1798 Memorial Park on Wolfe Tone Quay, Dublin.\n\n==Campaign to win a Municipal Post for Tom Clarke==\n\nJames Bermingham was a prominent member of a committee which was set up to lobby in support of [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke's]] application for two municipal posts in Ireland, the clerkship of [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown County Council|Rathdown]] Union (1899) and a post as supervisor of an abattoir (1900), the second after Clarke had gone to New York.<ref>See telegrams from James Bermingham to Tom Clarke in New York (National Library of Ireland, Dublin)</ref> Clarke was unsuccessful in both applications.\n\n==Dublin Municipal Politics==\n\nIn the 1890s and early 1900s \"advanced nationalists\" began to stand for election to county councils and other municipal bodies \u2013 particularly after the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|Local Government Act 1898]] which radically extended the local government franchise by entitling all householders and occupants of a portion of a house to vote in local elections including all women over the age of thirty, provided they satisfied the same criteria as men.\n\nIn May 1902 James Bermingham was elected from the Mansion House Ward to the position of Poor Law Guardian on the South Dublin Board of Guardians. He was re-elected in May 1905 and remained a Poor Law Guardian until his death in 1907.<ref>Weekly Irish Times, Saturday 31 May 1902 and Irish Times, Wednesday 31 May 1905</ref>\n\n==Death of James Bermingham==\n[[File:Photograph of James Bermingham's Grave.jpg|thumb|right|James Bermingham's grave in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin]]\n\nJames Bermingham died on 4 June 1907 at Jervis Street Hospital, Dublin. His funeral from [[Newman University Church|University Church]], St. Stephen's Green,<ref>[http://www.universitychurch.ie Newman University Church]</ref> to Glasnevin Cemetery was a large public event. Many of his old Fenian comrades were present along with a number of Nationalist members of parliament, Trade Union representatives and Dublin City Council officials and public representatives.<ref>Irish Independent ''Funeral of Mr. J. Bermingham'', 7 June 1907</ref> He was laid to rest beside his wife Margaret who died during the previous year.<ref>Irish Independent ''The Late Mrs. Bermingham'', 19 January 1906</ref>\n\nIn James Bermingham's obituary in the [[Irish Independent]] headed '''Dublin Nationalist's Death''' it was said of him: <blockquote>\"Yesterday there passed away in Dublin, in the person of Mr. James Bermingham, P.L.G.,<ref>Poor Law Guardian</ref> Cuffe street, another of the veterans of the \u201967 movement. As a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, he was present at the attack on the police barracks at Tallaght in \u201967. He was widely known and deeply respected in Nationalist circles in Dublin. But the work in which, perhaps, he was most prominent, however, was the later Amnesty movement started in 1892. From the start of the Irish National Amnesty Association in the Workmen\u2019s Club, York street, of which latter he was always one of the mainstays, he was one of its most earnest members. He was, with the late [[Madeleine ffrench-Mullen|Fleet Surgeon Ffrench-Mullen, R.N.]], for many years an honorary treasurer of the Association, and in the cause of Amnesty no one did more unsparing or more untiring work, the true worth of which was only known to those intimately associated with him. In later years the deceased gentleman acted as a member of the South Dublin Board of Guardians, in which he rendered quiet but effective work. The funeral will take place from the Catholic University Church, Stephen\u2019s green, on to-morrow morning.\"</blockquote><ref>Irish Independent obituary ''Dublin Nationalist's Death'', 5 June 1907</ref>\n\n[[P.

[[Nirav Shah]] is the cinematographer of the film, while Gokul Chandran is the editor.\n\nThe film's soundtrack and background score was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and was released under the label of [[Zee Music Company]]. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed {{INR|108}} crores.<ref name=\"gross\"/><ref name=\"FPGross\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n\nMeera Krishnan, Famitha Banu and Andrea Tariang are three independent young women living in Chennai who are best friends. One night, they happen to attend a party, enjoying themselves. On the other hand, rich boys Vishwa and Venkatesh take their friend, an injured Adhik Ramajayam, to the hospital. Adhik had been hit in the head and is bleeding profusely. However, the boys decide not to file a police complaint. Meanwhile, the women hurriedly return home from the party, agitated over something, but they try to forget it and carry on with their lives.\n\nDuring her morning exercise, Meera is observed by Bharath Subramaniam, a grim man living in their neighbourhood who was a successful lawyer and a loving husband to his wife Kalyani years ago. Kalyani had died due to pregnancy complications when Bharath had to leave her alone at home due to an important case. This causes Bharath to break down mentally and retire from his profession, coping up with his depression through the use of medications. Bharath senses from the look on Meera's face that something unpleasant had been going on in her life. Later, Meera files a complaint against Adhik and his friend as they had started causing misery in her friends' lives. Learning of this, Adhik orchestrates a gang to kidnap Meera and molest her, while threatening her to withdraw the complaint. She is later dropped back at home, but is arrested the next day on charges of prostitution and attempted murder by Adhik.\n\nBharath learns of Meera's plight from her friends and fights the gang that aided Adhik's friends, capturing the main goon and handing him over to the police. He also returns to his profession by offering to help the women by representing them in their case. Soon a case is filed. Adhik's side is represented by Sathyamoorthy.\n\nSathyamoorthy presents the events from Adhik's allegations that Meera and her friends were encountered by Adhik and his friends who then slept with them after having drinks. Adhik is hit on the head by Meera as a result of nonpayment, labelling the women as prostitutes. He bases this on the fact that Meera has a family but lives alone, Famitha having a relationship with an older man, and Andrea moving to Chennai from North India. Meera and her friends deny the allegations and state that the men tried to sexually assault them, prompting Meera to hit Adhik on the head with a bottle in self-defense.\n\nBharath represents the women and bases their statement on the fact that a woman has the right to say no. Bharath and Sathyamoorthy question the witnesses and the women individually in the subsequent days, with Bharath's investigation proving successful in favour of the women. Towards the end of the trial, Bharath questions Adhik, who arrogantly says that \"girls born in good families don't party or drink.\" Bharath, however, holds a photo of Adhik's sister attending a party and having drinks in the courtroom, causing Adhik to lose his cool and curse Meera and her friends, stating that they \"reaped what they sowed.\" Consequently, he blurts out that he tried to rape Meera, shocking Sathyamoorthy. Bharath concludes the case by criticising the regressed views of the society where women are stereotyped as prostitutes if they come home late, yearn to be independent, drink and so on, but men are not affected by this. He also puts forth the fact that a wrong done is wrong; be it a man or a woman, there is no partiality before the law.\n\nThe case ends with Adhik and his friends getting arrested.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Lawyer Bharath Subramaniam\n* [[Shraddha Srinath]] as Meera Krishnan\n* Abhirami Venkatachalam as Famitha Banu\n* Andrea Tariang as Andrea Tariang\n* Arjun Chidambaram as Adhik\n* [[Adhik Ravichandran]] as Vishwa\n* Ashwin Rao as Venkatesh \n* [[Rangaraj Pandey]] as Advocate Sathyamoorthy\n* [[Sujith Shankar]] as Gavaskar\n* [[Delhi Ganesh]] as Krishnan\n* [[Jayaprakash]] as Jameen Ramajayam\n* D.

[[Nirav Shah]] is the cinematographer of the film, while Gokul Chandran is the editor.\n\nThe film's soundtrack and background score was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and was released under the label of [[Zee Music Company]]. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed {{INR|108-181.45}} crores.<ref name=\"gross\"/><ref name=\"FPGross\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n\nMeera Krishnan, Famitha Banu and Andrea Tariang are three independent young women living in Chennai who are best friends. One night, they happen to attend a party, enjoying themselves. On the other hand, rich boys Vishwa and Venkatesh take their friend, an injured Adhik Ramajayam, to the hospital. Adhik had been hit in the head and is bleeding profusely. However, the boys decide not to file a police complaint. Meanwhile, the women hurriedly return home from the party, agitated over something, but they try to forget it and carry on with their lives.\n\nDuring her morning exercise, Meera is observed by Bharath Subramaniam, a grim man living in their neighbourhood who was a successful lawyer and a loving husband to his wife Kalyani years ago. Kalyani had died due to pregnancy complications when Bharath had to leave her alone at home due to an important case. This causes Bharath to break down mentally and retire from his profession, coping up with his depression through the use of medications. Bharath senses from the look on Meera's face that something unpleasant had been going on in her life. Later, Meera files a complaint against Adhik and his friend as they had started causing misery in her friends' lives. Learning of this, Adhik orchestrates a gang to kidnap Meera and molest her, while threatening her to withdraw the complaint. She is later dropped back at home, but is arrested the next day on charges of prostitution and attempted murder by Adhik.\n\nBharath learns of Meera's plight from her friends and fights the gang that aided Adhik's friends, capturing the main goon and handing him over to the police. He also returns to his profession by offering to help the women by representing them in their case. Soon a case is filed. Adhik's side is represented by Sathyamoorthy.\n\nSathyamoorthy presents the events from Adhik's allegations that Meera and her friends were encountered by Adhik and his friends who then slept with them after having drinks. Adhik is hit on the head by Meera as a result of nonpayment, labelling the women as prostitutes. He bases this on the fact that Meera has a family but lives alone, Famitha having a relationship with an older man, and Andrea moving to Chennai from North India. Meera and her friends deny the allegations and state that the men tried to sexually assault them, prompting Meera to hit Adhik on the head with a bottle in self-defense.\n\nBharath represents the women and bases their statement on the fact that a woman has the right to say no. Bharath and Sathyamoorthy question the witnesses and the women individually in the subsequent days, with Bharath's investigation proving successful in favour of the women. Towards the end of the trial, Bharath questions Adhik, who arrogantly says that \"girls born in good families don't party or drink.\" Bharath, however, holds a photo of Adhik's sister attending a party and having drinks in the courtroom, causing Adhik to lose his cool and curse Meera and her friends, stating that they \"reaped what they sowed.\" Consequently, he blurts out that he tried to rape Meera, shocking Sathyamoorthy. Bharath concludes the case by criticising the regressed views of the society where women are stereotyped as prostitutes if they come home late, yearn to be independent, drink and so on, but men are not affected by this. He also puts forth the fact that a wrong done is wrong; be it a man or a woman, there is no partiality before the law.\n\nThe case ends with Adhik and his friends getting arrested.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Lawyer Bharath Subramaniam\n* [[Shraddha Srinath]] as Meera Krishnan\n* Abhirami Venkatachalam as Famitha Banu\n* Andrea Tariang as Andrea Tariang\n* Arjun Chidambaram as Adhik\n* [[Adhik Ravichandran]] as Vishwa\n* Ashwin Rao as Venkatesh \n* [[Rangaraj Pandey]] as Advocate Sathyamoorthy\n* [[Sujith Shankar]] as Gavaskar\n* [[Delhi Ganesh]] as Krishnan\n* [[Jayaprakash]] as Jameen Ramajayam\n* D.
