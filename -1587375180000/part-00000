In 1957, the wheatsheaf was replaced with a third hawk's bell.

A black vertical band (\"pale\") down the centre displayed two silver hawk's bells, between which was a small blue shield displaying a golden sheaf of wheat.  The crest was a black eagle, and the motto ''Prendre sa belle''.  Some time later, the blue shield was removed, and the wheatsheaf was placed directly on the black pale.  In 1957, the wheatsheaf was replaced with a third hawk's bell.

Built on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]], Dumbarton, Scotland in 1869 for the [[Jock Willis Shipping Line]], she was one of the last [[Clipper|tea clippers]] to be built and one of the fastest, coming at the end of a long period of design development, which halted as sailing ships gave way to steam propulsion.\n\nThe opening of the [[Suez Canal]] (also in 1869) meant that steamships now enjoyed a much shorter route to [[China]], so ''Cutty Sark'' spent only a few years on the tea trade before turning to the trade in [[wool]] from [[Australia]], where she held the record time to Britain for ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=1883\u201395 The Australian Wool Years|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/explore/1883-95-australian-wool-years|date=9 October 2015}}</ref> Improvements in steam technology meant that gradually steamships also came to dominate the longer sailing route to Australia, and the ship was sold to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] company Ferreira and Co. in 1895 and renamed ''Ferreira''. She continued as a cargo ship until purchased in 1922 by retired sea captain Wilfred Dowman, who used her as a training ship operating from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], [[Cornwall]]. After his death, ''Cutty Sark'' was transferred to the [[Thames Nautical Training College]], Greenhithe in 1938 where she became an auxiliary cadet training ship alongside [[HMS Frederick William (1860)|HMS ''Worcester'']]. By 1954, she had ceased to be useful as a cadet ship and was transferred to permanent dry dock at [[Greenwich]], [[London]], for public display.\n\n''Cutty Sark'' is listed by [[National Historic Ships]] as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]] (the nautical equivalent of a [[Grade 1 Listed Building]]). She is one of only three remaining original [[Composite ship|composite construction]] (wooden hull on an iron frame) clipper ships from the nineteenth century in part or whole, the others being the {{ship||City of Adelaide|1864|2}}, which arrived in [[Port Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on 3 February 2014 for preservation, and the beached skeleton of ''[[Ambassador (clipper)|Ambassador]]'' of 1869 near [[Punta Arenas]], Chile.\n\nThe ship has been damaged by fire twice in recent years, first on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation. She was restored and was reopened to the public on 25 April 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cutty Sark: Queen reopens Greenwich tea clipper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17835225|work=[[BBC News]]|date=25 April 2012}}</ref> On 19 October 2014 she was damaged in a smaller fire.<ref name=FireOnDeck>{{cite news|title=Cutty Sark damaged in fire on deck|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29680243|date=19 October 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n[[Cutty Sark (whisky)|''Cutty Sark'' whisky]] derives its name from the ship. An image of the clipper appears on the label, and the maker formerly sponsored the [[Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race]]. The ship also inspired the name of the [[Saunders-Roe|Saunders Roe]] [[Saro Cutty Sark|Cutty Sark]] flying boat.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Cutty Sark (ship, 1869) - SLV H91.250-164.jpg|thumb|left|''Cutty Sark'' with sails set. Photograph taken at sea by Captain Woodget with a camera balanced on two of the ship's boats lashed together.]]\n''Cutty Sark'' was ordered by shipping magnate John Willis, who operated a shipping company founded by his father. The company had a fleet of clippers and regularly took part in the tea trade from China to Britain. Speed was a clear advantage to a merchant ship, but it also created prestige for the owners: the 'tea race' was widely reported in contemporary newspapers and had become something of a national sporting event, with money being gambled against a winning ship. In earlier years, Willis had commanded his father's ships at a time when American designed ships were the fastest in the tea trade, and then had owned British designed ships, which were amongst the best available in the world but had never won the tea race. In 1868 the brand new [[Aberdeen]] built clipper ''[[Thermopylae (clipper)|Thermopylae]]'' set a record time of 61 days port to port on her maiden voyage from London to [[Melbourne]] and it was this design that Willis set out to better.<ref name=\"Lubbock 21-22\">Lubbock, pp. 20\u201321{{clarify |reason=Title?|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Dear |editor-first=I.C.B |editor-last2=Kemp |editor-first2=Peter |editor-link=I. C. B. Dear |title=Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2005 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-19-860616-1}}</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain how the hull shape for ''Cutty Sark'' was chosen. Willis chose [[Hercules Linton]] to design and build the ship but Willis already possessed another ship, ''[[Punjaub (ship)|The Tweed]]'', which he considered to have exceptional performance. ''The Tweed'' (originally ''Punjaub'') was a [[frigate]] designed by Oliver Lang based on the lines of an old French frigate, built in [[Bombay]] for the [[East India Company]] as a combination sail/paddle steamer. She and a sister ship were purchased by Willis, who promptly sold the second ship plus engines from ''The Tweed'' for more than he paid for both. ''The Tweed'' was then lengthened and operated as a fast sailing vessel, but was considered too big for the tea runs. Willis also commissioned two all-iron clippers with designs based upon ''The Tweed'', [[Hallowe'en (clipper)|''Hallowe'en'']] and [[Blackadder (clipper)|''Blackadder'']]. Linton was taken to view ''The Tweed'' in [[dry dock]].\n\nWillis considered that ''The Tweed''{{'}}s [[bow (ship)|bow]] shape was responsible for its notable performance, and this form seems to have been adopted for ''Cutty Sark''. Linton, however, felt that the [[stern]] was too [[barrel]] shaped and so gave ''Cutty Sark'' a squarer stern with less [[tumblehome]]. The broader stern increased the buoyancy of the ship's stern, making it lift more in heavy seas so it was less likely that waves would break over the stern, and over the helmsman at the wheel. The square [[bilge]] was carried forward through the centre of the ship.<ref name=\"Lubbock 21-22\" /><ref>Villiers p. 17\u201319</ref> ''Cutty Sark'' was given masts that followed the design of ''The Tweed'', with similar good rake and the foremast on both placed further aft than usual.<ref>Lubbock, ''China Clippers'', p. 291</ref>\n\nA contract for ''Cutty Sark's'' construction was signed on 1 February 1869 with the firm of [[Scott & Linton]], which had only been formed in May 1868. Their shipyard was at [[Dumbarton]] on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]] on a site previously occupied by shipbuilders [[William Denny & Brothers]]. The contract required the ship to be completed within six months at a contracted price of \u00a317 per ton and maximum weight of 950 tons. This was a highly competitive price for an experimental, state-of-the-art vessel, and for a customer requiring the highest standards. Payment would be made in seven instalments as the ship progressed, but with a penalty of \u00a35 for every day the ship was late. The ship was to be built to [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's]] A1 standard and her construction was supervised on behalf of Willis by Captain George Moodie, who would command her when completed. Construction delays occurred when the Lloyd's inspectors required additional strengthening in the ship.<ref>Brettle</ref>\n\nWork on the ship was suspended when Scott and Linton ran out of money to continue. Rather than simply liquidate the company, an arrangement was made for Denny's to take over the contract and complete the ship, which was finally launched on 22 November 1869 by Captain Moodie's wife. The ship was moved to Denny's yard to have her masts fitted, and then on 20 December towed downriver to [[Greenock]] to have her running rigging installed. In the event, completing the ship meant the company's creditors were owed even more money than when work had first been halted.<ref name=Ships>{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=W H |last2=Sawyer |first2=L A |date=1995 |title=The Empire Ships |page=49 |publisher=Lloyd's of London Press Ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85044-275-4}}</ref>\n\n''Cutty Sark'''s length was {{convert|212|ft|5|in|m|2}}, with a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|21|ft|m|2}} and a [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] of 921 tons.<ref name=\"Sankey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsankey.ca/willis.html |title=Jock Willis' Specification for the Cutty Sark |website=John Sankey}}</ref> Broadly, the parts of the ship visible above the waterline were constructed from East India [[teak]], while American [[Ulmus thomasii|rock elm]] was used for the ship's bottom.

The [[erotic]] sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam to cry out \"[[:wikt:weel#Scots|Weel]] done, Cutty-sark\", which subsequently became a well known [[catchphrase]]. Originally, carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow, but these were removed by Willis in deference to 'good taste'.

Her first trip encountered significant competition with steamships. The route from the Far East to London (and many other European ports) through the Suez Canal was shorter by about {{convert|3300|nmi|abbr=on}}, compared to sailing round the Cape of Good Hope.<ref name=\"suezcanal.gov.eg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/English/About/Pages/WhySuezCanal.aspx |title=Why Suez Canal? |website=Suez Canal Authority}}</ref>  The route round Africa is in excess of {{convert|14000|nmi|abbr=on}}. Typically a clipper might log significantly more than that by planning her route for favourable winds. Whilst it was possible for a sailing vessel to take a tug through the canal, this was difficult and expensive. Furthermore, sailing conditions in the northern [[Red Sea]] were unsuited to the design of a tea clipper,<ref name=Jarvis/> so they still had to sail around Africa.\n\nLess obviously, steamship design had taken a large step forward in 1866 with [[SS Agamemnon (1865)|''Agamemnon'']], using higher boiler pressure and a compound engine, so obtaining a large improvement in fuel efficiency. Ships of this type could compete with clippers before the Suez Canal opened.<ref name=\"Jarvis\">{{cite book |last=Jarvis |first=Adrian |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Gardiner |editor2-first=Basil |editor2-last= Greenhill\n|title=The Advent of Steam \u2013 The Merchant Steamship before 1900 |publisher=Conway Maritime Press |date=1993 |pages=158\u2013159 |chapter=Chapter 9: Alfred Holt and the Compound Engine |isbn=0-85177-563-2}}</ref>\n\nWhen the tea clippers arrived in China in 1870, they found a big increase in the number of steamers, which were in high demand. The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships. Additionally, the insurance premium for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially less than for a sailing vessel. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade.<ref name=\"MacGregor\"/>\n\nThe numbers of tea clippers sailing to China each year steadily reduced, with many ships being sold and moving to general cargo work. Costs were kept to a minimum and rigs were often reduced to [[barque]] so that a smaller crew was needed.\n\n===''Thermopylae''===\n''Cutty Sark''{{'}}s well known race against ''[[Thermopylae (clipper)|Thermopylae]]'' took place in 1872, the two ships leaving [[Shanghai]] together on 18 June. Both ships were of similar size: length, beam and depths were within {{convert|1|ft}} of each other. The ''Thermopylae'' had a slightly larger capacity: 991 compared to 963 (GRT) or 948 compared to 921 (net).{{sfn|Carr|1964|p=5}}  Two weeks later ''Cutty Sark'' had built up a lead of some {{convert|400|nmi|mi km}}, but then lost her rudder<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/15131.html|title=The tea clipper Thermopylae|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]}}</ref> in a heavy gale after passing through the [[Sunda Strait]]. John Willis's brother was on board the ship and ordered Moodie to put into [[Cape Town]] for repairs. Moodie refused, and instead the ship's carpenter Henry Henderson constructed a new rudder from spare timbers and iron. This took six days, working in gales and heavy seas which meant the men were tossed about as they worked and the brazier used to heat the metal for working was spilled out, burning the captain's son. The ship finally arrived in London on 18 October a week after ''Thermopylae'', a total passage of 122 days. The captain and crew were commended for their performance and Henderson received a \u00a350 bonus for his work. This was the closest ''Cutty Sark'' came to being first ship home but it was Moodie's last trip as her captain before he transferred to steamships. He was replaced by Captain F. W. Moore.\n\n{{Quote box |title=Life at Sea |width=30% |quote=A little east of the longitude of the Cape we were favoured by a great fair wind blow, that tested all the resources of ship and crew. At the first spurt, heavy squalls came up from S.W., that threatened to take toll of our masts, but later it steadied down to a hurricane straight from the west.\n\nCaptain Wallace was sure in his element now. It was 'Stand by!' the whole time, not knowing whether the sticks would go, but the splendid rigging and equipment of sails in the ''Cutty Sark'' stood the strain. We lost two brand new topgallant sails and one lower fore topsail.\n\nA tremendous sea was running and needs must we carry on or be pooped. The partial becalming of the lower sails by the stern seas was a great danger, as they filled again with a bang that threatened to burst them into tatters. It was some trick rebending sails. I had a time on the fore topsail yard for two hours. The ship took a green sea over the stern, and it appeared as if there were just three sticks set in the ocean, as it swept the length of the deck. |source=\u2014A crew member writing of life on board<ref>Lubbock, p. 9{{clarify|reason=Title?|date=August 2014}}, correspondence with an unnamed master mariner</ref>}}\n\n===Later tea seasons===\nMoore remained captain only for one round trip to China, taking 117 days for the return trip. This was 14 days longer than ''Thermopylae'' and 27 days longer than achieved by the iron ship ''[[Hallowe'en (clipper)|Hallowe'en]]'' a few months later. Captain W. E. Tiptaft assumed command in 1873 achieving 118 days on his first return trip, but after the ship had to travel 600 miles{{clarify|reason=What kind of miles? nautical or statute?|date=August 2014}} up the [[Yangtze River]] in search of a cargo. Steamships were now taking most of the tea. The following year the return journey took 122 days, but on the outward journey ''Cutty Sark'' set a record time of 73 days from London to Sydney. In November 1877 the ship was anchored off [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] in the [[English Channel]] along with sixty other vessels, waiting out a great storm. The anchor failed to hold and ''Cutty Sark'' was blown through the ships, damaging two others before grounding on a mud bank. Fortunately she was pulled clear by the tug ''Macgregor'' before too much damage was caused and she was towed to the [[Thames]] for repairs.\n\nIn December 1877 the ship sailed from London to Sydney, where she took on coal for Shanghai, arriving there in April. However, the ship was unable to find any cargo of tea for a return trip to London\u2014the days of the tea race were over. The master, Captain Tiptaft, died in October while still in Shanghai and was replaced by the first mate, James Wallace. The ship now had to take different cargoes around the world, including coal, jute, castor oil and tea to Australia.\n\nIn 1880 yards were shortened and the stun'sails removed.{{sfn|Carr|1964|p=5}}  Also in 1880 an incident occurred on board during which the First Mate Sidney Smith killed seaman John Francis. Smith was allowed to leave the ship at [[Anjer]] by Captain Wallace, causing the crew to cease work in protest. Wallace continued the voyage with six apprentices and four tradesmen but became becalmed in the [[Java Sea]] for three days. In desperation as matters moved from bad to worse, he committed suicide by jumping overboard and disappeared. He was replaced as Master by William Bruce, who proved to be a drunken incompetent who claimed pay for non-existent crewmen and managed to set sail with inadequate provisions, resulting in the crew starving. An inquiry in New York in April 1882 resulted in the captain and mate being suspended and replaced by Captain Moore, previously of [[Blackadder (clipper)|''Blackadder'']].\n\n===Wool trade===\n[[File:Cutty Sark - waiting in Sydney Harbour for the new season's wool.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Cutty Sark'' in Sydney Harbour awaiting a cargo of new season's wool, c.1890]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nIn December 1883, ''Cutty Sark'' departed [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], New South Wales with 4,289 bales of wool and 12 casks of tallow, arriving in London in just 83 days. This was 25 days faster than her nearest rival that year and heralded the start of a new career taking Australian wool to Britain in time for the January wool sales.\n\nIn 1885 [[Richard Woodget]] was appointed captain on a salary of \u00a3186 per year (\u00a323,729.80 in 2019 when adjusted for inflation) and continued to improve on the fastest trip record, achieving 77 days on his first outward trip and 73 days returning to Britain from Australia. He achieved this by taking a more southerly route than previously, to catch the strongest winds in the [[Roaring Forties]] despite having to face icebergs, gales and storms whipped up by the winds he sought. ''Cutty Sark'' was the fastest ship on the wool trade for ten years. In July 1889 the log of the modern passenger steamship {{SS|Britannia|1887|6}} recorded that when steaming at 15\u201316 knots she was overtaken in the night by a sailing ship doing 17 knots, which proved to be ''Cutty Sark''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Cutty Sark'''s wool runs{{sfn|Carr|1964|p=5}}\n!

In May 1916 she was dismasted off the [[Cape of Good Hope]] because of the rolling of the ship in bad weather and had to be towed into [[Table Bay]] off [[Cape Town]]. Because of World War I, it was impossible to obtain suitable materials to replace the masts so she was re-rigged over 18 months to a [[barquentine]] sail arrangement.\n\nIn 1922 ''Ferreira'' was the last clipper operating anywhere in the world. Caught in a storm in the [[English Channel]] she put into [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] harbour where she was spotted by retired merchant navy captain Wilfred Dowman of [[Flushing, Cornwall|Flushing]], Cornwall, who was then operating the training ship ''Lady of Avenel''. The ship returned to Lisbon, where she was sold to new owners and renamed ''Maria do Amparo'' (Mary of the Refuge, a name associated with the devotion of Our Lady of the Refuge; in Portuguese, \"''Nossa Senhora do Amparo''\").\n\n===As cadet training ship===\nDowman persevered in his determination to buy the ship, which he did for \u00a33,750 and she was returned to Falmouth harbour. The purchase was made with the support of Dowman's wife, artist Catharine Dowman ({{nee|Courtauld}}),<ref>[https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/catharine-dowman-and-preservation-cutty-sark Catharine Dowman and the preservation of Cutty Sark] 06 March 2018, ''rmg.co.uk'', Retrieved 16 April 2019</ref> heiress daughter of [[Sydney Courtauld]], crepe and silk manufacturer.\n\nThe rigging was restored to an approximation of the original arrangement and the ship was used as a cadet training ship.

As a historic survivor, the ship was opened to the public and visitors would be rowed out to inspect her.

An extensive conservation project was planned to overcome this, including repair and anti-[[corrosion]] painting of the framework and the addition of some additional steel ribs to add strength, and a new method of supporting the ship.\n\nOn the morning of 21 May 2007, ''Cutty Sark'', which had been closed and partly dismantled for conservation work, caught fire, and burned for several hours before the [[London Fire Brigade]] could bring the fire under control. Initial reports indicated that the damage was extensive, with most of the wooden structure in the centre having been lost.<ref name=BBC_News_Story1>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6675381.stm|title=Blaze ravages historic Cutty Sark|work=[[BBC News]]|date=21 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview the next day, Richard Doughty, the chief executive of the Cutty Sark Trust, revealed that at least half of the \"fabric\" (timbers, etc.) of the ship had not been on site as it had been removed during the preservation work.

A fire officer present at the scene said in a BBC interview that when they arrived, there had been \"a well-developed fire throughout the ship\".

Unfortunately it was discovered that the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ship's hull which would effectively mask the hull's shape from view. An alternate design for the support of the ship had to be developed; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel. Horizontal tubular steel struts passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled.\n\nA new steelwork lower deck of contemporary design incorporating an amphitheatre feature was installed in the main hold while a glass-encased lift installed within the ship terminates in a new steel-and-glass housing structure on the weather deck. A second new steel-and-glass box has been installed above the forehold to enclose a new staircase. Access to the ship is through a new opening cut through the hull below the waterline in the ship's starboard quarter. The new access hole has required the addition of new steel framing. Visitors arriving on board the ship now do so via this entrance, which leads to the lower hold. Maldwin Drummond, Chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust, has explained in ''Classic Boat'' magazine's September 2010 issue the need to retain the spirit of the ship and he quotes the ideal that \"The visitor should see the ship as though for some unexplained reason the crew had gone ashore\". Doubts over the wisdom of Grimshaw's proposals have been raised by many ship conservationists including the Cutty Sark Trust's own engineer Peter Mason.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7173900/Cutty-Sark-restoration-turning-into-a-fiasco.html|title=Cutty Sark restoration turning into a fiasco|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, UK|date=6 February 2010|first=Andrew|last=Gilligan}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cutty Sark 2012 landscaping.JPG|thumb|right|''Cutty Sark'' in February 2012, repairs nearing completion.

The painstaking investigation was conducted by the Fire Brigade, along with London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]], Forensic Science Services, and electrical examination experts Dr. Burgoyne's & Partners. They said that the most likely cause was the failure of an industrial vacuum cleaner that may have been left switched on over the weekend before the fire started. The report revealed no evidence that the ship was subjected to arson attack and concluded that the fire started accidentally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk//CuttySarkFireReport-29Sep08.pdf|title=Report on the investigation into the fire on board the clipper ship Cutty Sark, King William Walk, Greenwich, London SE10 on Monday 21st May 2007|author1=London Fire Brigade|author2-link=Metropolitan Police Service|author2=Metropolitan Police Service|date=29 September 2008|accessdate=16 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128063551/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/CuttySarkFireReport-29Sep08.pdf|archive-date=28 November 2011|url-status=dead|author1-link=London Fire Brigade}}</ref><ref name=\"vacuum\">{{cite news |last1=Justin |first1=Davenport |title=Vacuum cleaner caused \u00a310m Cutty Sark fire as guard slept |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/vacuum-cleaner-caused-10m-cutty-sark-fire-as-guard-slept-6872360.html |work=Evening Standard |date=30 September 2008 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nPhysical evidence and CCTV footage of the fire showed that it probably started towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off at the end of each day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.\n\n[[File:Cutty sark detail.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Fine lines of the [[Bow (ship)|bow]]]]\nOn the basis of witness evidence, the joint investigation team considered it unlikely that the fire was caused by the hot work (welding) that was being carried out as part of the renovation or by carelessly discarded smokers' materials. No one had visited this part of the ship since work stopped on Friday evening, and it was considered unlikely that a fire could have smouldered all weekend before finally breaking out Monday morning. However, it was discovered that although all hot work was supposed to be recorded and someone was supposed to check afterwards to ensure of no fires, there was no record that such checks had ever been made, and on at least one occasion hot work had been conducted with no records made.\n\nThe ship was patrolled by two security guards, both of whom were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour, or once every two hours later in the night, one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock. The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols, but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book. It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 am when the guards would have gone off duty. The alarm was raised when one of the guards called the fire brigade; before this the two reported that they had smelled burning plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source.\n\nA carpenter had visited the site on Sunday to collect some tools, but after 20 minutes attempting to contact a security guard to let him in, had climbed the fence, collected his tools and climbed out again. The carpenter reported that he had heard machinery operating towards the stern of the ship, but it was not clear whether this might have been the site diesel generator which ran at all times.\n\nThe ship was fitted with a temporary fire alarm system but it was unclear whether this had operated. A separate alarm within the pavilion did sound when smoke and heat reached that area, but the guards reported no ringing alarm before the fire was seen. Investigation afterwards discovered a faulty relay in the alarm panel which failed to switch power to the siren circuits when an alarm was triggered. However, the panel also contained a failed fuse in one siren circuit which suggested that the siren had activated but the fire shorted it out, and this might have also caused the relay to fail. The failed relay would have shut off power to the second siren circuit. Statements from workers suggested that weekly tests of the alarm system had not been carried out.\n\n==Mast specifications==\n{{Main|Mast (sailing)}}{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nThe original mast specifications as laid down by the ship's designer still exist and are listed below as \"tea rig\". This arrangement was used during the ship's time on the tea trade route, where it was necessary to maximise the area of sail to get the greatest possible propulsion when the ship might be becalmed in the doldrums. For the route to Australia it was not necessary to carry such a large area of sail and the masts and yards were reduced. The tradewinds required great strength in masts, but the wind could best be captured by relatively small, high sails. A smaller rig also represented a saving in maintenance costs. Each of the three masts (fore, main and mizzen) is in three overlapping sections.\n[[File:Cutty Sark stern.jpg|thumb|The restored stern, sheathed in [[Muntz metal]], elevated three metres above its dry dock under its glass-roofed visitors' centre in June 2012.]]\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block; vertical-align:top;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mast heights above deck in metres\n! !!

Built on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]], Dumbarton, Scotland in 1869 for the [[Jock Willis Shipping Line]], she was one of the last [[Clipper|tea clippers]] to be built and one of the fastest, coming at the end of a long period of design development, which halted as sailing ships gave way to steam propulsion.\n\nThe opening of the [[Suez Canal]] (also in 1869) meant that steamships now enjoyed a much shorter route to [[China]], so ''Cutty Sark'' spent only a few years on the tea trade before turning to the trade in [[wool]] from [[Australia]], where she held the record time to Britain for ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=1883\u201395 The Australian Wool Years|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/explore/1883-95-australian-wool-years|date=9 October 2015}}</ref> Improvements in steam technology meant that gradually steamships also came to dominate the longer sailing route to Australia, and the ship was sold to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] company Ferreira and Co. in 1895 and renamed ''Ferreira''. She continued as a cargo ship until purchased in 1922 by retired sea captain Wilfred Dowman, who used her as a training ship operating from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], [[Cornwall]]. After his death, ''Cutty Sark'' was transferred to the [[Thames Nautical Training College]], Greenhithe in 1938 where she became an auxiliary cadet training ship alongside [[HMS Frederick William (1860)|HMS ''Worcester'']]. By 1954, she had ceased to be useful as a cadet ship and was transferred to permanent dry dock at [[Greenwich]], [[London]], for public display.\n\n''Cutty Sark'' is listed by [[National Historic Ships]] as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]] (the nautical equivalent of a [[Grade 1 Listed Building]]). She is one of only three remaining original [[Composite ship|composite construction]] (wooden hull on an iron frame) clipper ships from the nineteenth century in part or whole, the others being the {{ship||City of Adelaide|1864|2}}, which arrived in [[Port Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on 3 February 2014 for preservation, and the beached skeleton of ''[[Ambassador (clipper)|Ambassador]]'' of 1869 near [[Punta Arenas]], Chile.\n\nThe ship has been damaged by fire twice in recent years, first on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation. She was restored and was reopened to the public on 25 April 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cutty Sark: Queen reopens Greenwich tea clipper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17835225|work=[[BBC News]]|date=25 April 2012}}</ref> On 19 October 2014 she was damaged in a smaller fire.<ref name=FireOnDeck>{{cite news|title=Cutty Sark damaged in fire on deck|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29680243|date=19 October 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n[[Cutty Sark (whisky)|''Cutty Sark'' whisky]] derives its name from the ship. An image of the clipper appears on the label, and the maker formerly sponsored the [[Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Race]]. The ship also inspired the name of the [[Saunders-Roe|Saunders Roe]] [[Saro Cutty Sark|Cutty Sark]] flying boat.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Cutty Sark (ship, 1869) - SLV H91.250-164.jpg|thumb|left|''Cutty Sark'' with sails set. Photograph taken at sea by Captain Woodget with a camera balanced on two of the ship's boats lashed together.]]\n''Cutty Sark'' was ordered by shipping magnate John Willis, who operated a shipping company founded by his father. The company had a fleet of clippers and regularly took part in the tea trade from China to Britain. Speed was a clear advantage to a merchant ship, but it also created prestige for the owners: the 'tea race' was widely reported in contemporary newspapers and had become something of a national sporting event, with money being gambled against a winning ship. In earlier years, Willis had commanded his father's ships at a time when American designed ships were the fastest in the tea trade, and then had owned British designed ships, which were amongst the best available in the world but had never won the tea race. In 1868 the brand new [[Aberdeen]] built clipper ''[[Thermopylae (clipper)|Thermopylae]]'' set a record time of 61 days port to port on her maiden voyage from London to [[Melbourne]] and it was this design that Willis set out to better.<ref name=\"Lubbock 21-22\">Lubbock, pp. 20\u201321{{clarify |reason=Title?|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Dear |editor-first=I.C.B |editor-last2=Kemp |editor-first2=Peter |editor-link=I. C. B. Dear |title=Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2005 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-19-860616-1}}</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain how the hull shape for ''Cutty Sark'' was chosen. Willis chose [[Hercules Linton]] to design and build the ship but Willis already possessed another ship, ''[[Punjaub (ship)|The Tweed]]'', which he considered to have exceptional performance. ''The Tweed'' (originally ''Punjaub'') was a [[frigate]] designed by Oliver Lang based on the lines of an old French frigate, built in [[Bombay]] for the [[East India Company]] as a combination sail/paddle steamer. She and a sister ship were purchased by Willis, who promptly sold the second ship plus engines from ''The Tweed'' for more than he paid for both. ''The Tweed'' was then lengthened and operated as a fast sailing vessel, but was considered too big for the tea runs. Willis also commissioned two all-iron clippers with designs based upon ''The Tweed'', [[Hallowe'en (clipper)|''Hallowe'en'']] and [[Blackadder (clipper)|''Blackadder'']]. Linton was taken to view ''The Tweed'' in [[dry dock]].\n\nWillis considered that ''The Tweed''{{'}}s [[bow (ship)|bow]] shape was responsible for its notable performance, and this form seems to have been adopted for ''Cutty Sark''. Linton, however, felt that the [[stern]] was too [[barrel]] shaped and so gave ''Cutty Sark'' a squarer stern with less [[tumblehome]]. The broader stern increased the buoyancy of the ship's stern, making it lift more in heavy seas so it was less likely that waves would break over the stern, and over the helmsman at the wheel. The square [[bilge]] was carried forward through the centre of the ship.<ref name=\"Lubbock 21-22\" /><ref>Villiers p. 17\u201319</ref> ''Cutty Sark'' was given masts that followed the design of ''The Tweed'', with similar good rake and the foremast on both placed further aft than usual.<ref>Lubbock, ''China Clippers'', p. 291</ref>\n\nA contract for ''Cutty Sark's'' construction was signed on 1 February 1869 with the firm of [[Scott & Linton]], which had only been formed in May 1868. Their shipyard was at [[Dumbarton]] on the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]] on a site previously occupied by shipbuilders [[William Denny & Brothers]]. The contract required the ship to be completed within six months at a contracted price of \u00a317 per ton and maximum weight of 950 tons. This was a highly competitive price for an experimental, state-of-the-art vessel, and for a customer requiring the highest standards. Payment would be made in seven instalments as the ship progressed, but with a penalty of \u00a35 for every day the ship was late. The ship was to be built to [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's]] A1 standard and her construction was supervised on behalf of Willis by Captain George Moodie, who would command her when completed. Construction delays occurred when the Lloyd's inspectors required additional strengthening in the ship.<ref>Brettle</ref>\n\nWork on the ship was suspended when Scott and Linton ran out of money to continue. Rather than simply liquidate the company, an arrangement was made for Denny's to take over the contract and complete the ship, which was finally launched on 22 November 1869 by Captain Moodie's wife. The ship was moved to Denny's yard to have her masts fitted, and then on 20 December towed downriver to [[Greenock]] to have her running rigging installed. In the event, completing the ship meant the company's creditors were owed even more money than when work had first been halted.<ref name=Ships>{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=W H |last2=Sawyer |first2=L A |date=1995 |title=The Empire Ships |page=49 |publisher=Lloyd's of London Press Ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85044-275-4}}</ref>\n\n''Cutty Sark'''s length was {{convert|212|ft|5|in|m|2}}, with a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|21|ft|m|2}} and a [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] of 921 tons.<ref name=\"Sankey\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsankey.ca/willis.html |title=Jock Willis' Specification for the Cutty Sark |website=John Sankey}}</ref> Broadly, the parts of the ship visible above the waterline were constructed from East India [[teak]], while American [[Ulmus thomasii|rock elm]] was used for the ship's bottom.

The [[erotic]] sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam to cry out \"[[:wikt:weel#Scots|Weel]] done, Cutty-sark\", which subsequently became a well known [[catchphrase]]. Originally, carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow, but these were removed by Willis in deference to 'good taste'.

Her first trip encountered significant competition with steamships. The route from the Far East to London (and many other European ports) through the Suez Canal was shorter by about {{convert|3300|nmi|abbr=on}}, compared to sailing round the Cape of Good Hope.<ref name=\"suezcanal.gov.eg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/English/About/Pages/WhySuezCanal.aspx |title=Why Suez Canal? |website=Suez Canal Authority}}</ref>  The route round Africa is in excess of {{convert|14000|nmi|abbr=on}}. Typically a clipper might log significantly more than that by planning her route for favourable winds. Whilst it was possible for a sailing vessel to take a tug through the canal, this was difficult and expensive. Furthermore, sailing conditions in the northern [[Red Sea]] were unsuited to the design of a tea clipper,<ref name=Jarvis/> so they still had to sail around Africa.\n\nLess obviously, steamship design had taken a large step forward in 1866 with [[SS Agamemnon (1865)|''Agamemnon'']], using higher boiler pressure and a compound engine, so obtaining a large improvement in fuel efficiency. Ships of this type could compete with clippers before the Suez Canal opened.<ref name=\"Jarvis\">{{cite book |last=Jarvis |first=Adrian |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Gardiner |editor2-first=Basil |editor2-last= Greenhill\n|title=The Advent of Steam \u2013 The Merchant Steamship before 1900 |publisher=Conway Maritime Press |date=1993 |pages=158\u2013159 |chapter=Chapter 9: Alfred Holt and the Compound Engine |isbn=0-85177-563-2}}</ref>\n\nWhen the tea clippers arrived in China in 1870, they found a big increase in the number of steamers, which were in high demand. The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships. Additionally, the insurance premium for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially less than for a sailing vessel. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade.<ref name=\"MacGregor\"/>\n\nThe numbers of tea clippers sailing to China each year steadily reduced, with many ships being sold and moving to general cargo work. Costs were kept to a minimum and rigs were often reduced to [[barque]] so that a smaller crew was needed.\n\n===''Thermopylae''===\n''Cutty Sark''{{'}}s well known race against ''[[Thermopylae (clipper)|Thermopylae]]'' took place in 1872, the two ships leaving [[Shanghai]] together on 18 June. Both ships were of similar size: length, beam and depths were within {{convert|1|ft}} of each other. The ''Thermopylae'' had a slightly larger capacity: 991 compared to 963 (GRT) or 948 compared to 921 (net).{{sfn|Carr|1964|p=5}}  Two weeks later ''Cutty Sark'' had built up a lead of some {{convert|400|nmi|mi km}}, but then lost her rudder<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/15131.html|title=The tea clipper Thermopylae|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]}}</ref> in a heavy gale after passing through the [[Sunda Strait]]. John Willis's brother was on board the ship and ordered Moodie to put into [[Cape Town]] for repairs. Moodie refused, and instead the ship's carpenter Henry Henderson constructed a new rudder from spare timbers and iron. This took six days, working in gales and heavy seas which meant the men were tossed about as they worked and the brazier used to heat the metal for working was spilled out, burning the captain's son. The ship finally arrived in London on 18 October a week after ''Thermopylae'', a total passage of 122 days. The captain and crew were commended for their performance and Henderson received a \u00a350 bonus for his work. This was the closest ''Cutty Sark'' came to being first ship home but it was Moodie's last trip as her captain before he transferred to steamships. He was replaced by Captain F. W. Moore.\n\n{{Quote box |title=Life at Sea |width=30% |quote=A little east of the longitude of the Cape we were favoured by a great fair wind blow, that tested all the resources of ship and crew. At the first spurt, heavy squalls came up from S.W., that threatened to take toll of our masts, but later it steadied down to a hurricane straight from the west.\n\nCaptain Wallace was sure in his element now. It was 'Stand by!' the whole time, not knowing whether the sticks would go, but the splendid rigging and equipment of sails in the ''Cutty Sark'' stood the strain. We lost two brand new topgallant sails and one lower fore topsail.\n\nA tremendous sea was running and needs must we carry on or be pooped. The partial becalming of the lower sails by the stern seas was a great danger, as they filled again with a bang that threatened to burst them into tatters. It was some trick rebending sails. I had a time on the fore topsail yard for two hours. The ship took a green sea over the stern, and it appeared as if there were just three sticks set in the ocean, as it swept the length of the deck. |source=\u2014A crew member writing of life on board<ref>Lubbock, p. 9{{clarify|reason=Title?|date=August 2014}}, correspondence with an unnamed master mariner</ref>}}\n\n===Later tea seasons===\nMoore remained captain only for one round trip to China, taking 117 days for the return trip. This was 14 days longer than ''Thermopylae'' and 27 days longer than achieved by the iron ship ''[[Hallowe'en (clipper)|Hallowe'en]]'' a few months later. Captain W. E. Tiptaft assumed command in 1873 achieving 118 days on his first return trip, but after the ship had to travel 600 miles{{clarify|reason=What kind of miles? nautical or statute?|date=August 2014}} up the [[Yangtze River]] in search of a cargo. Steamships were now taking most of the tea. The following year the return journey took 122 days, but on the outward journey ''Cutty Sark'' set a record time of 73 days from London to Sydney. In November 1877 the ship was anchored off [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] in the [[English Channel]] along with sixty other vessels, waiting out a great storm. The anchor failed to hold and ''Cutty Sark'' was blown through the ships, damaging two others before grounding on a mud bank. Fortunately she was pulled clear by the tug ''Macgregor'' before too much damage was caused and she was towed to the [[Thames]] for repairs.\n\nIn December 1877 the ship sailed from London to Sydney, where she took on coal for Shanghai, arriving there in April. However, the ship was unable to find any cargo of tea for a return trip to London\u2014the days of the tea race were over. The master, Captain Tiptaft, died in October while still in Shanghai and was replaced by the first mate, James Wallace. The ship now had to take different cargoes around the world, including coal, jute, castor oil and tea to Australia.\n\nIn 1880 yards were shortened and the stun'sails removed.{{sfn|Carr|1964|p=5}}  Also in 1880 an incident occurred on board during which the First Mate Sidney Smith killed seaman John Francis. Smith was allowed to leave the ship at [[Anjer]] by Captain Wallace, causing the crew to cease work in protest. Wallace continued the voyage with six apprentices and four tradesmen but became becalmed in the [[Java Sea]] for three days. In desperation as matters moved from bad to worse, he committed suicide by jumping overboard and disappeared. He was replaced as Master by William Bruce, who proved to be a drunken incompetent who claimed pay for non-existent crewmen and managed to set sail with inadequate provisions, resulting in the crew starving. An inquiry in New York in April 1882 resulted in the captain and mate being suspended and replaced by Captain Moore, previously of [[Blackadder (clipper)|''Blackadder'']].\n\n===Wool trade===\n[[File:Cutty Sark - waiting in Sydney Harbour for the new season's wool.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Cutty Sark'' in Sydney Harbour awaiting a cargo of new season's wool, c.1890]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nIn December 1883, ''Cutty Sark'' departed [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], New South Wales with 4,289 bales of wool and 12 casks of tallow, arriving in London in just 83 days. This was 25 days faster than her nearest rival that year and heralded the start of a new career taking Australian wool to Britain in time for the January wool sales.\n\nIn 1885 [[Richard Woodget]] was appointed captain on a salary of \u00a3186 per year (\u00a323,729.80 in 2019 when adjusted for inflation) and continued to improve on the fastest trip record, achieving 77 days on his first outward trip and 73 days returning to Britain from Australia. He achieved this by taking a more southerly route than previously, to catch the strongest winds in the [[Roaring Forties]] despite having to face icebergs, gales and storms whipped up by the winds he sought. ''Cutty Sark'' was the fastest ship on the wool trade for ten years. In July 1889 the log of the modern passenger steamship {{SS|Britannia|1887|6}} recorded that when steaming at 15\u201316 knots she was overtaken in the night by a sailing ship doing 17 knots, which proved to be ''Cutty Sark''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Cutty Sark'''s wool runs{{sfn|Carr|1964|p=5}}\n!

Another clipper can be seen in the background]]\nThe ship traded various cargoes between Portugal, Rio de Janeiro, New Orleans, Mozambique, Angola, and Britain. In May 1916 she was dismasted off the [[Cape of Good Hope]] because of the rolling of the ship in bad weather and had to be towed into [[Table Bay]] off [[Cape Town]]. Because of World War I, it was impossible to obtain suitable materials to replace the masts so she was re-rigged over 18 months to a [[barquentine]] sail arrangement.\n\nIn 1922 ''Ferreira'' was the last clipper operating anywhere in the world. Caught in a storm in the [[English Channel]] she put into [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] harbour where she was spotted by retired merchant navy captain Wilfred Dowman of [[Flushing, Cornwall|Flushing]], Cornwall, who was then operating the training ship ''Lady of Avenel''. The ship returned to Lisbon, where she was sold to new owners and renamed ''Maria do Amparo'' (Mary of the Refuge, a name associated with the devotion of Our Lady of the Refuge; in Portuguese, \"''Nossa Senhora do Amparo''\").\n\n===As cadet training ship===\nDowman persevered in his determination to buy the ship, which he did for \u00a33,750 and she was returned to Falmouth harbour. The purchase was made with the support of Dowman's wife, artist Catharine Dowman ({{nee|Courtauld}}),<ref>[https://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-the-scenes/blog/catharine-dowman-and-preservation-cutty-sark Catharine Dowman and the preservation of Cutty Sark] 06 March 2018, ''rmg.co.uk'', Retrieved 16 April 2019</ref> heiress daughter of [[Sydney Courtauld]], crepe and silk manufacturer.\n\nThe rigging was restored to an approximation of the original arrangement and the ship was used as a cadet training ship.

As a historic survivor, the ship was opened to the public and visitors would be rowed out to inspect her.

A fire officer present at the scene said in a BBC interview that when they arrived, there had been \"a well-developed fire throughout the ship\". The bow section looked to be relatively unscathed and the [[stern]] also appeared to have survived without major damage; the fire seemed to have been concentrated in the centre of the ship. The chairman of Cutty Sark Enterprises said after inspecting the site: \"The decks are unsalvageable but around 50% of the planking had already been removed; however, the damage is not as bad as originally expected.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAs part of the restoration work planned before the fire, it was proposed that the ship be raised {{convert|3|m|sigfig=1}}, to allow the construction of a state-of-the-art museum space beneath.

Proponents of making her fit to go to sea advocated that the fire repairs be done in such a manner to enable her to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bymnews.com/may/cutty-sark.html|title=BYM News May Cutty Sark|website=BYM News & Magazine|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the state of the timbers, especially the keel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hnsa.org/conf2004/papers/davies.htm|title=The ''Cutty Sark'', The Trials and Tribulations of a Restoration Project|website=Historic Naval Ships Association|first=Wyn|last=Davies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910060330/http://www.hnsa.org/conf2004/papers/davies.htm|archivedate=10 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the fact that a hole had been cut through the hull in the 1950s for an access door, made this difficult. The Cutty Sark Trust said that less than five percent of the original fabric was lost in the fire, as the decks which were destroyed were additions not present at the original building.\n\nThe restoration work was criticised by The Victorian Society saying that the needs of the corporate hospitality market were put ahead of the preservation of the historic fabric of the ship.<ref name=BBC19598868>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19598868|title=Cutty Sark refit 'damaging', says The Victorian Society|work=[[BBC News]] |date=14 September 2012}}</ref> ''[[Building Design]]'' magazine awarded the project its [[Carbuncle Cup]] for the worst new building completed in 2012 saying \"The scheme's myriad failings stem from one calamitous choice: the decision to hoick the 144-year-old clipper close to three metres into the air on canted steel props.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/carbuncle-cup/carbuncle-cup-winner-2012-ship-in-a-throttle/5042493.article|title=Carbuncle Cup winner 2012: Ship in a throttle |magazine=[[Building Design]]|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Fundraising====\n[[File:Cutty Sark under restoration after being damaged by fire - geograph.org.uk - 906599.jpg|thumb|left|''Cutty Sark'' during repairs after the fire]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nThe design for the renovation project by Grimshaw architects with, during design development stage, newly established Youmeheshe architects and [[Buro Happold]] engineers involved raising the ship out of her dry berth using a [[Kevlar]] web, allowing visitors to pass under the hull to view it. Unfortunately it was discovered that the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ship's hull which would effectively mask the hull's shape from view. An alternate design for the support of the ship had to be developed; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel. Horizontal tubular steel struts passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled.\n\nA new steelwork lower deck of contemporary design incorporating an amphitheatre feature was installed in the main hold while a glass-encased lift installed within the ship terminates in a new steel-and-glass housing structure on the weather deck. A second new steel-and-glass box has been installed above the forehold to enclose a new staircase. Access to the ship is through a new opening cut through the hull below the waterline in the ship's starboard quarter. The new access hole has required the addition of new steel framing. Visitors arriving on board the ship now do so via this entrance, which leads to the lower hold. Maldwin Drummond, Chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust, has explained in ''Classic Boat'' magazine's September 2010 issue the need to retain the spirit of the ship and he quotes the ideal that \"The visitor should see the ship as though for some unexplained reason the crew had gone ashore\". Doubts over the wisdom of Grimshaw's proposals have been raised by many ship conservationists including the Cutty Sark Trust's own engineer Peter Mason.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7173900/Cutty-Sark-restoration-turning-into-a-fiasco.html|title=Cutty Sark restoration turning into a fiasco|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, UK|date=6 February 2010|first=Andrew|last=Gilligan}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cutty Sark 2012 landscaping.JPG|thumb|right|''Cutty Sark'' in February 2012, repairs nearing completion.

The painstaking investigation was conducted by the Fire Brigade, along with London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]], Forensic Science Services, and electrical examination experts Dr. Burgoyne's & Partners. They said that the most likely cause was the failure of an industrial vacuum cleaner that may have been left switched on over the weekend before the fire started. The report revealed no evidence that the ship was subjected to arson attack and concluded that the fire started accidentally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk//CuttySarkFireReport-29Sep08.pdf|title=Report on the investigation into the fire on board the clipper ship Cutty Sark, King William Walk, Greenwich, London SE10 on Monday 21st May 2007|author1=London Fire Brigade|author2-link=Metropolitan Police Service|author2=Metropolitan Police Service|date=29 September 2008|accessdate=16 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128063551/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/CuttySarkFireReport-29Sep08.pdf|archive-date=28 November 2011|url-status=dead|author1-link=London Fire Brigade}}</ref><ref name=\"vacuum\">{{cite news |last1=Justin |first1=Davenport |title=Vacuum cleaner caused \u00a310m Cutty Sark fire as guard slept |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/vacuum-cleaner-caused-10m-cutty-sark-fire-as-guard-slept-6872360.html |work=Evening Standard |date=30 September 2008 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nPhysical evidence and CCTV footage of the fire showed that it probably started towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off at the end of each day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.\n\n[[File:Cutty sark detail.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Fine lines of the [[Bow (ship)|bow]]]]\nOn the basis of witness evidence, the joint investigation team considered it unlikely that the fire was caused by the hot work (welding) that was being carried out as part of the renovation or by carelessly discarded smokers' materials. No one had visited this part of the ship since work stopped on Friday evening, and it was considered unlikely that a fire could have smouldered all weekend before finally breaking out Monday morning. However, it was discovered that although all hot work was supposed to be recorded and someone was supposed to check afterwards to ensure of no fires, there was no record that such checks had ever been made, and on at least one occasion hot work had been conducted with no records made.\n\nThe ship was patrolled by two security guards, both of whom were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour, or once every two hours later in the night, one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock. The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols, but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book. It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 am when the guards would have gone off duty. The alarm was raised when one of the guards called the fire brigade; before this the two reported that they had smelled burning plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source.\n\nA carpenter had visited the site on Sunday to collect some tools, but after 20 minutes attempting to contact a security guard to let him in, had climbed the fence, collected his tools and climbed out again. The carpenter reported that he had heard machinery operating towards the stern of the ship, but it was not clear whether this might have been the site diesel generator which ran at all times.\n\nThe ship was fitted with a temporary fire alarm system but it was unclear whether this had operated. A separate alarm within the pavilion did sound when smoke and heat reached that area, but the guards reported no ringing alarm before the fire was seen. Investigation afterwards discovered a faulty relay in the alarm panel which failed to switch power to the siren circuits when an alarm was triggered. However, the panel also contained a failed fuse in one siren circuit which suggested that the siren had activated but the fire shorted it out, and this might have also caused the relay to fail. The failed relay would have shut off power to the second siren circuit. Statements from workers suggested that weekly tests of the alarm system had not been carried out.\n\n==Mast specifications==\n{{Main|Mast (sailing)}}{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\nThe original mast specifications as laid down by the ship's designer still exist and are listed below as \"tea rig\". This arrangement was used during the ship's time on the tea trade route, where it was necessary to maximise the area of sail to get the greatest possible propulsion when the ship might be becalmed in the doldrums. For the route to Australia it was not necessary to carry such a large area of sail and the masts and yards were reduced. The tradewinds required great strength in masts, but the wind could best be captured by relatively small, high sails. A smaller rig also represented a saving in maintenance costs. Each of the three masts (fore, main and mizzen) is in three overlapping sections.\n[[File:Cutty Sark stern.jpg|thumb|The restored stern, sheathed in [[Muntz metal]], elevated three metres above its dry dock under its glass-roofed visitors' centre in June 2012.]]\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block; vertical-align:top;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mast heights above deck in metres\n! !!
