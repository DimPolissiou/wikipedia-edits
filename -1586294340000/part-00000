The failure was due to reduced support from the Soviet Union when North Korea aligned more with China, and military pressure from the U.S. leading to increased defence spending.

Encouraged by [[Kim Jong-il]]'s call to strengthen the implementation of the independent accounting system ({{lang|ko|\ub3c5\ub9bd\ucc44\uc0b0\uc81c}}, ''tongnip ch'aesanje'') of enterprises in March 1984, interest in enterprise management and the independent accounting system increased, as evidenced by increasing coverage of the topic in North Korean journals.<ref name=\"traveldocs1\"/> Under the system, factory managers still are assigned output targets but are given more discretion in decisions about labour, equipment, materials, and funds.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn addition to fixed capital, each enterprise is allocated a minimum of [[working capital]] from the state through the [[Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Central Bank]] and is required to meet operating expenses with the proceeds from sales of its output. Up to 50% of the \"profit\" is taxed, the remaining half being kept by the enterprise for purchase of equipment, introduction of new technology, welfare benefits, and bonuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/ |title=North Korean Economy Watch |publisher=Nkeconwatch.com |date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206221010/http://www.nkeconwatch.com/ |archivedate=December 6, 2011 }}</ref> As such, the system provides some built-in incentives and a degree of micro-level autonomy, unlike the budget allocation system, under which any surplus is turned over to the government in its entirety.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nAnother innovation, the August Third People's Consumer Goods Production Movement, is centred on consumer goods production. This measure was so named after Kim Jong-il made an inspection tour of an exhibition of light industrial products held in [[Pyongyang]] on August 3, 1984. The movement charges workers to use locally available resources and production facilities to produce needed consumer goods. On the surface, the movement does not appear to differ much from the local industry programs in existence since the 1960s, although some degree of local autonomy is allowed. However, a major departure places output, pricing, and purchases outside central planning. In addition, direct sales stores were established to distribute goods produced under the movement directly to consumers. The movement is characterized as a third sector in the production of consumer goods, alongside centrally controlled light industry and locally controlled traditional light industry. Moreover, there were some reports in the mid-1980s of increasing encouragement of small-scale private handicrafts and farm markets. As of 1992, however, no move was reported to expand the size of private garden plots.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nAll these measures appear to be minor stop-gap measures to alleviate severe shortages of consumer goods by infusing some degree of incentives. In mid-1993, no significant moves signalling a fundamental deviation from the existing system had occurred. The reluctance to initiate reform appears to be largely political. This concern is based on the belief that economic reform will produce new interests that will demand political expression and that demands for the institutionalization of such pluralism eventually will lead to political liberalization.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s and particularly around the end of the decade, North Korea slowly began to modify its rigid self-reliant policy. The changes, popularly identified as the open-door policy, included an increasing emphasis on foreign trade, a readiness to accept direct foreign investment by enacting a joint venture law, the decision to open the country to international tourism, and economic cooperation with South Korea.\n\nThe main targets of the Third Seven-Year Plan of 1987\u20131993 were to achieve the \"Ten Long-Range Major Goals of the 1980s for the Construction of the Socialist Economy\". These goals, conceived in 1980, were to be fulfilled by the end of the decade. The fact that these targets were rolled over to the end of the Third Seven-Year Plan is another indication of the disappointing economic performance during the Second Seven-Year Plan. The three policy goals of self-reliance, modernization, and scientification were repeated. Economic growth was set at 7.9% annually, lower than the previous plan. Although achieving the ten major goals of the 1980s was the main thrust of the Third Seven-Year Plan, some substantial changes have been made in specific quantitative targets. For example, the target for the annual output of steel was reduced by a third: from 15 million tons to 10 million tons. The output targets of cement and non-ferrous metals\u2014two major export items\u2014have been increased significantly. The June 1989 introduction of the Three-Year Plan for Light Industry as part of the Third Seven-Year Plan is intended to boost the [[standard of living]] by addressing consumer needs.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe Third Seven-Year Plan gave a great deal of attention to developing foreign trade and joint ventures, the first time a plan has addressed these issues. By the end of 1991, however, two years before the termination of the plan, no quantitative plan targets were made public, an indication that the plan has not fared well.{{Original research inline|date=January 2008}} The diversion of resources to build highways, theatres, hotels, airports, and other facilities to host the Thirteenth World Festival of Youth and Students in July 1989 must have had a negative impact on industrial and agricultural development, although the expansion and improvement of social infrastructure have resulted in some long-term economic benefits.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\n====State Planning Commission====\nAlthough general economic policy objectives are decided by the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central People's Committee]] (CPC), it is the task of the [[State Planning Committee]] to translate the broad goals into specific annual and long-term development plans and quantitative targets for the economy as a whole, as well as for each industrial sector and enterprise. Under the basic tenets of the 1964 reforms, the planning process is guided by the principles of \"unified planning\" ({{lang|ko|\uc77c\uc6d0\ud654}}, ''ilw\u014fnhwa'') and of \"detailed planning\" ({{lang|ko|\uc0c8\ubd84\ud654}}, ''saebunhwa'').<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nUnder \"unified planning\", regional committees are established in each province, city, and county to systematically coordinate planning work. These committees do not belong to any regional organization and are directly supervised by the State Planning Committee. As a result of a reorganization in 1969, they are separated into provincial planning committees, city/county committees, and enterprise committees (for large-scale enterprises).<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe planning committees, under the auspices of the State Planning Committee, coordinate their work with the planning offices of the economy-related government organizations the corresponding regional and local areas. The system attempts to enable the regional planning staff to better coordinate with economic establishments in their areas, which are directly responsible to them in planning, as well as communicating directly with staff at the CPC. \"Detailed planning\" seeks to construct plans with precision and scientific methods based on concrete assessment of the resources, labour, funds, plant capacities, and other necessary information.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\n[[File:Nkorea-economic-planning-2.svg|thumb|upright=2|Simplified diagram showing the process of economic policy planning.]]\n\nThere are four stages in drafting the final national economic plan.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* The first is collecting and compiling preliminary statistical data. These figures, which are used as the basic planning data on the productive capacities of economic sectors, originally are prepared by lower-level economic units and aggregated on a national level by respective departments and committees. Simultaneously, the regional, local, and enterprise planning committees prepare their own data and forward them to the CPC. Through this two-channel system of simultaneous, separate, and independent preparation of statistical data by economic units and planning committees, the government seeks to ensure an accurate, objective, and realistic data base unfettered by local and bureaucratic bias.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* The second stage is preparing the control figures by the CPC based on the preliminary data in accordance with the basic plan goals presented by the Central People's Committee.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* In the third stage, a draft plan is prepared. The draft plan, prepared by the CPC, is the result of coordinating all draft figures submitted by the lower-level economic units, which, in turn, base their drafts on the control figures handed down from the committee.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* In the fourth stage, the CPC submits a unified national draft plan to the Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council for confirmation. After approval by the Supreme People's Assembly, the draft becomes final and is distributed to all economic units and regional and local planning committees.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe plan then becomes legal and compulsory. Frequent directives from the central government contain changes in the plan targets or incentives for meeting the plan objectives.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nAlthough the central government is most clearly involved in the formulation and evaluation of the yearly and long-term plans, it also reviews summaries of quarterly or monthly progress. Individual enterprises divide the production time into daily, weekly, ten-day, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. In general, the monthly plan is the basic factory planning period.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe success of an economic plan depends on the quality and detail of information received, the establishment of realistic targets, coordination among sectors, and correct implementation. High initial growth during the Three-Year Plan and, to a lesser extent, during the Five-Year Plan contributed to a false sense of confidence among the planners. Statistical over reporting\u2014an inherent tendency in an economy where rewards lie in fulfilling the quantitative targets, particularly when the plan target year approaches\u2014leads to overestimation of economic potential, poor product quality, and eventually to plan errors. Inefficient use of plants, equipment, and raw materials add to planning errors. Lack of coordination in planning and production competition among sectors and regions cause imbalances and disrupt input-output relationships. The planning reforms in 1964 were supposed to solve these problems, but the need for correct and detailed planning and strict implementation of plans was so great that their importance was emphasized in the report unveiling the Second Seven-Year Plan, indicating that planning problems persisted in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1990s North Korea abandoned firm directive planning, and multi-year plans became more of a long-term economic strategy.<ref name=\"38north-20160726\"/>\n\nIn 2016, Kim Jong Un announced the first \"Five Year Plan\" since the 1980s, which aims to further develop the economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-announces-economic-plan-after-unprecedentedly-grim-struggle/2016/05/08/c84088e2-1214-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_story.html|title=North Korea announces five-year economic plan, its first since the 1980s|last=https://www.facebook.com/annafifield|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}</ref>\n\n====Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method====\nThe ''[[Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method]]'' ({{lang|ko|\uccad\uc0b0\ub9ac\ubc29\ubc95}}) of management was born out of Kim Il-sung's February 1960 visit to the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Cooperative Farm in [[South Pyongan|South P'y\u014fngan]] Province. Influenced by Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward Policy, Kim and other members of the KWP Central Committee offered \"[[on-the-spot guidance]]\" ({{lang|ko|\ud604\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub3c4}}, ''hy\u014fnji chido'') and spent two months instructing and interacting with the workers. The avowed objective of this new method is to combat \"[[Bureaucracy|bureaucratism]]\" and \"formalism\" in the farm management system.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe leadership claimed that farm workers were unhappy and produced low output because low-ranking functionaries of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (who expounded abstract [[Marxism|Marxist]] theories and slogans) were using tactics that failed to motivate. To correct this, the leadership recommended that the workers receive specific guidance in solving production problems and be promised readily available material incentives. The Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method called for high-ranking party officials, party cadres, and administrative officials to emulate [[Kim Il-sung]] by making field inspections. The system provided opportunities for farmers to present their grievances and ideas to leading cadres and managers.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nPerhaps more important than involving administrative personnel in on-site inspections was the increased use of material incentives, such as paid vacations, special bonuses, honorific titles, and monetary rewards. In fact, the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method appeared to accommodate almost any expedient to spur production. The method, subsequently, was undercut by heavy-handed efforts to increase farm production and amalgamate farms into ever-larger units. Actual improvement in the agricultural sector began with the adoption of the subteam contract system as a means of increasing peasant productivity by adjusting individual incentives to those of the immediate, small working group. Thus the increasing scale of collective farms was somewhat offset by the reduction in the size of the working unit. \"On-the-spot guidance\" by high government functionaries, however, continued in the early 1990s, as exemplified by Kim Il-sung's visits to such places as the Wangjaesan Cooperative Farm in [[Onsong|Ons\u014fng County]] and the Ky\u014fngs\u014fn Branch Experimental Farm of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences between August 20 and 30, 1991.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/> Kim Jong-il carried on the tradition, despite having refused to do so before, and even expanded it to the Korean People's Army. Today Kim Jong-un continues the practices of the method.\n\n====Taean work system====\nThe [[Industrial organization|industrial management system]] developed in three distinct stages. The first was a period of enterprise autonomy that lasted until December 1946. The second stage was a transitional system based on local autonomy, with each enterprise managed by the enterprise management committee under the direction of the local people's committee. This system was replaced by the \"one-man management system\" ({{lang|ko|\uc9c0\ubc30\uc778 \ub2e8\ub3c5 \ucc45\uc784\uc81c}}), with management patterned along Soviet lines as large enterprises were nationalized and came under central control. The third stage, the ''Taean'' Work System ({{lang|ko|\ub300\uc548\uc758 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uccb4\uacc4}}, ''Taean\u016di sa\u014fpch'e''), was introduced in December 1961 as an application and refinement of agricultural management techniques to industry. The Taean industrial management system grew out of the ''Ch'\u014fngsan-ni'' Method.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nThe highest managerial authority under the Taean system is the party committee. Each committee has approximately 25 to 35 members elected from the ranks of managers, workers, engineers, and the leadership of \"working people's organizations\" at the factory. A smaller \"executive committee\", about one-quarter the size of the regular committee, has practical responsibility for day-to-day plant operations and major factory decisions. The most important staff members, including the party committee secretary, factory manager, and chief engineer, make up its membership. The system focuses on co-operation among workers, technicians, and party functionaries at the factory level.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nEach factory has two major lines of administration, one headed by the manager, the other by the party committee secretary. A chief engineer and his or her assistants direct a general staff in charge of all aspects of production, planning, and technical guidance. Depending on the size of the factory, varying numbers of deputies oversee factory logistics, marketing, and workers' services. The supply of materials includes securing, storing, and distributing all materials for factory use, as well as storing finished products and shipping them from the factory.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nDeputies are assign workers to their units and handle factory accounts and payroll. Providing workers' services requires directing any farming done on factory lands, stocking factory retail shops, and taking care of all staff amenities. Deputies in charge of workers' services are encouraged to meet as many of the factory's needs as possible using nearby agricultural cooperatives and local industries.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nThe secretary of the party committee organizes all political activities in each of the factory party cells and attempts to ensure loyalty to the party's production targets and management goals. According to official claims, all management decisions are arrived at by consensus among the members of the party committee. Given the overwhelming importance of the party in the country's affairs, it seems likely that the party secretary has the last say in any major factory disputes.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nThe Taean system heralded a more rational approach to industrial management than that practised previously. Although party functionaries and workers became more important to management under the new system, engineers and technical staff received more responsibility in areas where their expertise could contribute the most. The system recognizes the importance of material as well as \"politico-moral\" incentives for managing the factory workers. The \"internal accounting system\", a spin-off of the \"independent accounting system\", grants bonuses to work teams and workshops that use raw materials and equipment most efficiently. These financial rewards come out of enterprise profits.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nA measure of the success of the Taean work system is its longevity and its continued endorsement by the leadership.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}} In his 1991 New Year's address marking the 13th anniversary of the creation of the system, Kim Il-sung said that the\n<blockquote>\nTaean work system is the best system of economic management. It enables the producer masses to fulfill their responsibility and role as masters and to manage the economy in a scientific and rational manner by implementing the mass line in economic management, and by combining party leadership organically with administrative, economic, and technical guidance.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}</blockquote>\n\n====Mass production campaigns====\nParallel to management techniques such as the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method and the Taean work system, which were designed to increase output in more normalized and regularized operations of farms and enterprises, the leadership continuously resorts to exhortations and mass campaigns to motivate the workers to meet output targets. The earliest and the most pervasive mass production campaign was the [[Chollima Movement|Ch'\u014fllima Movement]]. Introduced in 1958 and fashioned after China's [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u20131960), the Ch'\u014fllima Movement organized the labour force into work teams and brigades to compete at increasing production. The campaign was aimed at industrial and agricultural workers and at organizations in education, science, sanitation and health, and culture.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nIn addition to work teams, units eligible for Ch'\u014fllima citations included entire factories, factory workshops, and such self-contained units as a ship or a railroad station. The \"[[socialist emulation]]\" among the industrial sectors, enterprises, farms, and work teams under the Ch'\u014fllima Movement frantically sought to complete the [[First Five-Year Plan (North Korea)|First Five-Year Plan]] (1957\u20131960) but instead created chaotic disruptions in the economy. This made it necessary to set aside 1959 as a \"buffer year\" to restore balance in the economy.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nAlthough the Ch'\u014fllima Movement was replaced in the early 1960s by the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method and the Taean Work System, the regime's reliance on mass campaigns continued into the early 1990s. Campaigns conducted after the Ch'\u014fllima to speed battles toward the end of a period (such as a month, a year, or an economic plan) to reach production targets to carry out the economic goals of the decade.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\n===Efforts at modernization since 1991===\nFollowing the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the principal source of external support, North Korea announced in December 1993 a three-year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade. However, lack of fertilizer, natural disasters, and poor storage and transportation practices the country fell more than a million tons per year short of grain self-sufficiency.<ref name=Bloomberg2016 /><ref name=UPI2016 /> Moreover, lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts and oil for [[electricity generation]] left many factories idle.<ref name=RandPark2010Dissertation />\n\nThe shortage of foreign exchange because of a chronic trade deficit, a large foreign debt, and dwindling foreign aid has constrained economic development. In addition, North Korea has been diverting scarce resources from developmental projects to defence; it spent more than 20% of GNP on defence toward the end of the 1980s, a proportion among the highest in the world. These negative factors, compounded by the declining efficiency of the central planning system and the failure to modernize the economy, have slowed the pace of growth since the 1960s. The demise of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and East European countries\u2014North Korea's traditional trade partners and benefactors\u2014has compounded the economic difficulties in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nEconomically, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Soviet support to North Korean industries caused a contraction of the North Korea's economy by 25% during the 1990s.

He described the recent rise of entrepreneurial groups through \"socialist cooperation\", where groups of individuals could start small enterprises as cooperative groups. Managers in state-owned industries or farms were also free to sell or trade production beyond state plan targets, providing incentives to increase production.

The government will provide fuel and materials for the factory, and the factory will manufacture the required products and quantities according to the government's requirements.\n\nNorth Korea's self-reliant development strategy assigned top priority to developing heavy industry, with parallel development in agriculture and light industry. This policy was achieved mainly by giving heavy industry preferential allocation of state investment funds. More than 50% of state investment went to the industrial sector during the 1954\u20131976 period (47.6%, 51.3%, 57.0%, and 49.0%, respectively, during the [[Three-Year Plan]], Five-Year Plan, First Seven-Year Plan, and Six-Year Plan). As a result, gross industrial output grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Savada1994\" />{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nAs was the case with the growth in national output, the pace of growth has slowed markedly since the 1960s. The rate declined from 41.7% and 36.6% a year during the Three-Year Plan and Five-Year Plan, respectively, to 12.8%, 16.3%, and 12.2%, respectively, during the First Seven Year Plan, Six-Year Plan, and Second Seven-Year Plan. As a result of faster growth in industry, that sector's share in total national output increased from 16.8% in 1946 to 57.3% in 1970. Since the 1970s, industry's share in national output has remained relatively stable. From all indications, the pace of industrialization during the Third Seven-Year Plan up to 1991 is far below the planned rate of 9.6%. In 1990 it was estimated that the industrial sector's share of national output was 56%.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nIndustry's share of the combined total of gross agricultural and industrial output climbed from 28% in 1946 to well over 90% in 1980. Heavy industry received more than 80% of the total state investment in industry between 1954 and 1976 (81.1%, 82.6%, 80%, and 83%, respectively, during the [[Three-Year Plan]], Five-Year Plan, First Seven-Year Plan, and Six-Year Plan), and was overwhelmingly favored over light industry.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nNorth Korea claims to have fulfilled the Second Seven-Year Plan (1978\u20131984) target of raising the industrial output in 1984 to 120% of the 1977 target, equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 12.2%. Judging from the production of major commodities that form the greater part of industrial output, however, it is unlikely that this happened. For example, the increase during the 1978\u20131984 plan period for electric power, coal, steel, metal-cutting machines, tractors, passenger cars, chemical fertilizers, chemical fibers, cement, and textiles, respectively, was 78%, 50%, 85%, 67%, 50%, 20%, 56%, 80%, 78%, and 45%.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\nRaw materials were in short supply and so were energy and hard currency. Infrastructure decayed and machinery became obsolete. Unlike other [[Eastern Bloc|socialist countries in the Eastern Europe]], North Korea kept planning in a highly centralized manner and refused to liberalize economic management.\n\n[[File:Fabrica de cristal duro Huichon4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Huichon#Huichon Hard Glassware Factory|Huichon Hard Glass Factory]]]]\nIn the mid-1980s, the speculation that North Korea would emulate China in establishing Chinese-style [[special economic zone]]s was flatly denied by then deputy chairman of the Economic Policy Commission [[Yun Ki-pok]] (Yun became chairman as of June 1989). China's special economic zones typically are coastal areas established to promote economic development and the introduction of advanced technology through [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. Investors are offered preferential tax terms and facilities. The zones, which allow greater reliance on market forces, have more decision making power in economic activities than do provincial-level units. Over the years, China has tried to convince the North Korean leadership of the advantages of these zones by giving tours of the various zones and explaining their values to visiting high-level officials.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn April 1982, [[Kim Il-sung]] announced a new economic policy giving priority to increased agricultural production through [[land reclamation]], development of the country's infrastructure\u2014especially power plants and transportation facilities\u2014and reliance on domestically produced equipment. There also was more emphasis on trade.\n\nIn September 1984, North Korea promulgated a [[joint venture]] law to attract foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[technology]]. The new emphasis on expanding [[trade]] and acquiring technology was not, however, accompanied by a shift in priorities away from support of the military. In 1991, North Korea announced the creation of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the northeast regions of [[Rason]] ([[Rason Special Economic Zone]]) and [[Chongjin|Ch'\u014fngjin]]. Investment in this SEZ has been slow in coming. Problems with [[infrastructure]], [[bureaucracy]], uncertainties about the security of investments, and viability have hindered growth and development.

Having Soviet origins (the subsequent practice of cloning foreign specimens, and a recent automobile joint-venture), North Korea has developed a wide-range automotive industry with production of all types of vehicles. The basis for production is in urban and off-road minis; luxury cars; SUV cars; small, medium, heavy, and super-heavy cargo; construction and off-road trucks; minibuses/minivans, coach buses, civilian and articulated buses, trolleybuses, and trams. However, North Korea produces far fewer vehicles than its production capability due to the ongoing economic crisis. North Korea has not joined or collaborated with the [[Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles|OICA]], or with any other automotive organization, so any critical information about its motor vehicle industry is limited.\n\n===Power and energy===\n{{Main|Energy in North Korea}}[[File:Electrical engineering components.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Electrical engineering components]]\nThe energy sector is one of the most serious bottlenecks in the North Korean economy. Since 1990, the supply of oil, coal, and electricity declined steadily, and seriously affected all sectors of the economy. [[Crude oil]] was formerly imported by pipeline at \"friendship prices\" from the former Soviet Union or China, but the withdrawal of Russian concessions and the reduction of imports from China brought down annual imports from about {{convert|23|Moilbbl}} in 1988 to less than {{convert|4|Moilbbl}} by 1997. As the imported oil was refined for fuels for transportation and agricultural machinery, a serious cutback in oil imports caused critical problems in transportation and agriculture.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by the South Korean agency Statistics Korea based on [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) data, per capita electricity consumption fell from its peak in 1990 of 1247 kilowatt hours to a low of 712 kilowatt hours in 2000.

The PDS requires farmers in agricultural regions to hand over a portion of their production to the government and then reallocates the surplus to urban regions, which cannot grow their own foods. About 70% of the [[Demographics of North Korea|North Korean population]], including the entire [[urban population]], receives food through this government-run system.<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/>\n\nBefore the floods, recipients were generally allotted 600\u2013700&nbsp;grams per day while high officials, military men, heavy laborers, and public security personnel were allotted slightly larger portions of 700\u2013800&nbsp;grams per day.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As of 2013, the target average distribution was 573 grams of cereal equivalent per person per day, but varied according to age, occupation, and whether rations are received elsewhere (such as school meals).<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/> However, as of 2019, this number has been reduced to 312 grams per day according to an investigation conducted by the [[United Nations]] between March 29 and April 12.<ref>https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/north-korea-food-insecurity-food-aid/</ref>\n\nDecreases in production affected the quantity of food available through the public distribution system. Shortages were compounded when the North Korean government imposed further restrictions on collective farmers. When farmers, who had never been covered by the PDS, were mandated by the government to reduce their own food allotments from 167 kilograms to 107 kilograms of grain per person each year, they responded by withholding portions of the required amount of grain. [[North Korean famine|Famine refugees]] reported{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} that the government decreased PDS rations to 150&nbsp;grams in 1994 and to as low as 30&nbsp;grams by 1997. It was further reported that the PDS failed to provide any food from April to August 1998 (the \"lean\" season) as well as from March to June 1999. In January 1998, the North Korean government publicly announced that the PDS would no longer distribute [[ration]]s and that families needed to somehow procure their own food supplies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} By 2005, the PDS was only supplying households with approximately one half of an absolute minimum caloric need.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} By 2008, the system had significantly recovered, and, from 2009 to 2013, daily per person rations averaged at 400 grams per day for much of the year, though in 2011 it dropped to 200 grams per day from May to September.<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/>\n\nIt is estimated that in the early 2000s, the average North Korean family drew some 80% of its income from small businesses that were technically illegal (though unenforced) in North Korea.

Since North Korea is a closed country, the number of specific deaths in the incident is difficult to know. According to different literature, the starved or malnourished death toll is estimated to be between 240,000 and 480,000. Since 1998 there has been a gradual recovery in agriculture production, which by 2013 brought North Korea back close to self-sufficiency in [[staple food]]s. However, as of 2013, most households have borderline or poor food consumption, and consumption of protein remains inadequate.<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the North Korean economy saw stagnation turning into crisis. [[Aid|Economic assistance]] received from the Soviet Union and China was an important factor of its economic growth. Upon its collapse in 1991, the Soviet Union withdrew its support and demanded payment in hard currency for imports. China stepped in to provide some assistance and supplied food and oil, most of it reportedly at concessionary prices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The North Korean economy was undermined and its industrial output began to decline in 1990. Deprived of industrial inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides, and electricity for irrigation, agricultural output also started to decrease even before North Korea had a series of [[natural disaster]]s in the mid-1990s. This evolution, combined with a series of natural disasters including record floods in 1995, caused one of the worst economic crises in North Korea's history. Other causes of this crisis were high defense spending (about 25% of GDP) and bad governance.\n\nIn December 1991, North Korea established a \"zone of free economy and trade\" to include the northeastern port cities of Unggi ([[Sonbong|S\u014fnbong]]), Ch'\u014fngjin, and Najin. The establishment of this zone also had ramifications on the questions of how far North Korea would go in opening its economy to the West and to South Korea, the future of the development scheme for the [[Tumen River]] area, and, more important, how much North Korea would reform its economic system.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nNorth Korea announced in December 1993 a three-year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade. However, lack of fertilizer, natural disasters, and poor storage and transportation practices have left the country more than a million tons per year short of grain self-sufficiency.<ref name=\"Bloomberg2016\">{{cite web|last1=McFerron|first1=Whitney|title=North Korea Food Supply Imperiled by Drought, UN Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/north-korea-s-food-supply-imperiled-by-water-shortages-un-says|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=February 23, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710111621/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/north-korea-s-food-supply-imperiled-by-water-shortages-un-says|archivedate=July 10, 2016|date=April 27, 2016|quote=North Korea\u2019s already-low food supplies are about to get worse after poor rainfall in the past year slashed the nation's critical rice crop, the United Nations said.

The government pursued Kim Jong-il's ''[[Songun]]'' policy, under which the military is deployed to direct production and infrastructure projects. As a consequence of the government's policy of establishing economic self-sufficiency, the North Korean economy has become increasingly isolated from that of the rest of the world, and its industrial development and structure do not reflect its international competitiveness. Domestic firms are shielded from international as well as domestic competition; the result is chronic inefficiency, poor quality, limited product diversity, and underutilization of plants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This [[protectionism]] also limits the size of the market for North Korean producers,<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/> which prevents taking advantage of [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]].\n\n====Food shortages====\nThe food shortage was primarily precipitated by the loss of fuel and other raw materials imports from China and the Soviet Union which had been essential to support an energy intensive and energy inefficient farming system.

Industrial and power output have declined in parallel.\nDuring what North Korea called the \"peaceful construction\" period before the Korean War, the fundamental task of the economy was to overtake the level of output and efficiency attained toward the end of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]]; to restructure and develop a viable economy reoriented toward the communist-bloc countries; and to begin the process of socializing the economy. Nationalization of key industrial enterprises and land reform, both of which were carried out in 1946, laid the groundwork for two successive one-year plans in 1947 and 1948, respectively, and the Two-Year Plan of 1949\u201350. It was during this period that the piece-rate wage system and the independent accounting system began to be applied and that the commercial network increasingly came under state and cooperative ownership.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe basic goal of the Three-Year Plan, officially named \"The Three-Year Post-war Reconstruction Plan of 1954\u201356\",<!-- abbreviation in original name --> was to reconstruct an economy torn by the Korean War. The plan stressed more than merely regaining the prewar output levels. The Soviet Union, other East European countries and China provided reconstruction assistance. The highest priority was developing heavy industry, but an earnest effort to collectivize farming also was begun. At the end of 1957, output of most industrial commodities had returned to 1949 levels, except for a few items such as chemical fertilizers, carbides, and [[sulfuric acid]], whose recovery took longer.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nHaving basically completed the task of reconstruction, the state planned to lay a solid foundation for industrialization while completing the socialization process and solving the basic problems of food and shelter during the Five-Year Plan of 1957\u20131960. The socialization process was completed by 1958 in all sectors of the economy, and the Ch'\u014fllima Movement was introduced. Although growth rates reportedly were high, there were serious imbalances among the different economic sectors. Because rewards were given to individuals and enterprises that met [[production quota]]s, frantic efforts to fulfill plan targets in competition with other enterprises and industries caused disproportionate growth among various enterprises, between [[industry]] and [[agriculture]] and between light and heavy industries. Because resources were limited and the transportation system suffered bottlenecks, resources were diverted to politically well-connected enterprises or those whose managers complained the loudest. An enterprise or industry that performed better than others often did so at the expense of others. Such disruptions intensified as the target year of the plan approached.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nUntil the 1960s, North Korea's economy grew much faster than South Korea's. Although North Korea was behind in total national output, it was ahead of South Korea in per capita national output, because of its smaller population relative to South Korea. For example, in 1960 North Korea's population was slightly over 10 million people, while South Korea's population was almost 25 million people. Annual economic growth rates of 30% and 21% during the Three-Year Plan of 1954\u20131956 and the Five-Year Plan of 1957\u20131960, respectively, were reported. After claiming early fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan in 1959, North Korea officially designated 1960 a \"buffer year\"\u2014a year of adjustment to restore balances among sectors before the next plan became effective in 1961. Not surprisingly the same phenomenon recurred in subsequent plans. Because the Five-Year Plan was fulfilled early, it became a de facto four-year plan. Beginning in the early 1960s, however, North Korea's economic growth slowed until it was stagnant at the beginning of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nVarious factors explain the very high rate of economic development of the country in the 1950s and the general slowdown since the 1960s. During the reconstruction period after the Korean War, there were opportunities for extensive economic growth\u2014attainable through the communist regime's ability to marshall idle resources and labor and to impose a low rate of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. This general pattern of initially high growth resulting in a high rate of capital formation was mirrored in other Soviet-type economies. Toward the end of the 1950s, as reconstruction work was completed and idle capacity began to diminish, the economy had to shift from the extensive to the intensive stage, where the simple communist discipline of marshaling underutilized resources became less effective. In the new stage, inefficiency arising from emerging bottlenecks led to [[diminishing returns]]. Further growth would only be attained by increasing efficiency and technological progress.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, a series of serious bottlenecks began to impede development. Bottlenecks were pervasive and generally were created by the lack of arable land, skilled [[Labour (economics)|labor]], [[energy]], and [[transportation]], and deficiencies in the [[extractive industries]]. Moreover, both land and marine transportation lacked modern equipment and modes of transportation. The inability of the energy and extractive industries as well as of the transportation network to supply power and raw materials as rapidly as the manufacturing plants could absorb them began to slow industrial growth.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe First Seven-Year Plan (initially 1961\u20131967) built on the groundwork of the earlier plans but changed the focus of [[industrialization]]. Heavy industry, with the machine tool industry as its linchpin, was given continuing priority. During the plan, however, the economy experienced widespread slowdowns and reverses for the first time, in sharp contrast to the rapid and uninterrupted growth during previous plans. Disappointing performance forced the planners to extend the plan three more years, until 1970. During the last part of the ''[[de facto]]'' ten-year plan, emphasis shifted to pursuing parallel development of the economy and of defense capabilities. This shift was prompted by concern over the military takeover in South Korea by General [[Park Chung-hee]] (1961\u20131979), escalation of the United States involvement in [[Vietnam]], and the widening [[Sino-Soviet split]]. It was thought that stimulating a technological revolution in the munitions industry was one means to achieve these parallel goals. In the end, the necessity to divert resources to defense became the official explanation for the plan's failure.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe Six-Year Plan of 1971\u20131976 followed immediately in 1971. In the aftermath of the poor performance of the preceding plan, growth targets of the Six-Year Plan were scaled down substantially. Because some of the proposed targets in the First Seven-Year Plan had not been attained even by 1970, the Six-Year Plan did not deviate much from its predecessor in basic goals. The Six-Year Plan placed more emphasis on technological advance, self-sufficiency (''[[Juche]]'') in industrial raw materials, improving product quality, correcting imbalances among different sectors, and developing the power and extractive industries; the last of these had been deemed largely responsible for slowdowns during the First Seven-Year Plan. The plan called for attaining a self- sufficiency rate of 60\u201370% in all industrial sectors by substituting domestic raw materials wherever possible and by organizing and renovating technical processes to make the substitution feasible. Improving transport capacity was seen as one of the urgent tasks in accelerating economic development\u2014it was one of the major bottlenecks of the Six-Year Plan.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nNorth Korea claimed to have fulfilled the Six-Year Plan by the end of August 1975, a full year and four months ahead of schedule. Under the circumstances, it was expected that the next plan would start without delay in 1976, a year early, as was the case when the First Seven-Year Plan was instituted in 1961. Even if the Six-Year Plan had been completed on schedule, the next plan should have started in 1977. However, it was not until nearly two years and four months later that the long-awaited plan was unveiled\u20141977 had become a \"buffer year\".<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe inability of the planners to continuously formulate and institute economic plans reveals as much about the inefficacy of planning itself as the extent of the economic difficulties and administrative disruptions facing the country. For example, targets for successive plans have to be based on the accomplishments of preceding plans. If these targets are underfulfilled, all targets of the next plan\u2014initially based on satisfaction of the plan\u2014have to be reformulated and adjusted. Aside from underfulfillment of the targets, widespread disruptions and imbalances among various sectors of the economy further complicate plan formulation.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe basic thrust of the Second Seven-Year Plan (1978\u20131984) was to achieve the three-pronged goals of self-reliance, modernization, and \"scientification\". Although the emphasis on self-reliance was not new, it had not previously been the explicit focus of an economic plan. This new emphasis might have been a reaction to mounting foreign debt originating from large-scale imports of Western machinery and equipment in the mid-1970s. Through modernization North Korea hoped to increase mechanization and automation in all sectors of the economy. \"Scientification\" means the adoption of up-to-date production and management techniques. The specific objectives of the economic plan were to strengthen the fuel, energy, and resource bases of industry through priority development of the energy and extractive industries; to modernize industry; to substitute domestic resources for certain imported raw materials; to expand freight-carrying capacity in railroad, road, and marine transportation systems; to centralize and containerize the transportation system; and to accelerate a technical revolution in agriculture.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn order to meet the manpower and technology requirements of an expanding economy, the education sector also was targeted for improvements. The quality of the comprehensive eleven-year compulsory education system was to be enhanced to train more technicians and specialists, and to expand the training of specialists, particularly in the fields of fuel, mechanical, electronic, and [[automation engineering]].<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nSuccessful fulfillment of the so-called nature-remaking projects also was part of the Second Seven-Year Plan. These projects referred to the five-point program for nature transformation unveiled by Kim Il-sung in 1976: completing the irrigation of non-paddy fields; reclaiming 1,000 square kilometres of new land; building 1,500 to 2,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} of terraced fields; carrying out afforestation and water conservation work; and reclaiming tidal land.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nFrom all indications, the Second Seven-Year Plan was not successful. North Korea generally downplayed the accomplishments of the plan, and no other plan received less official fanfare. It was officially claimed that the economy had grown at an annual rate of 8.8% during the plan, somewhat below the planned rate of 9.6%. The reliability of this aggregate measure, however, is questionable. During the plan, the target annual output of 10 million tons of [[Food grain|grains]] (cereals and pulses) was attained. However, by official admission, the targets of only five other commodities were fulfilled. Judging from the growth rates announced for some twelve industrial products, it is highly unlikely that the total industrial output increased at an average rate of 12.2% as claimed. After the plan concluded, there was no new economic plan for two years, indications of both the plan's failure and the severity of the economic and planning problems confronting the economy in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/> From 1998 to 2003, the government implemented a plan for scientific and technical development, which focused on the nation's IT and electronic industry.<ref>Schwekendiek, Daniel, ''A socioeconomic history of North Korea'', Jefferson and London: McFarland Publishers, 2011, p.122</ref>\n\n==Labor==\nGrowth and changes in the structure and ownership pattern of the economy also have changed the labor force. By 1958 individual private farmers, who once constituted more than 70% of the labor force, had been transformed into or replaced by state or collective farmers. Private artisans, merchants, and entrepreneurs had joined state or cooperative enterprises. In the industrial sector in 1963, the last year for which such data are available, there were 2,295 state enterprises and 642 cooperative enterprises. The size and importance of the state enterprises can be surmised by the fact that state enterprises, which constituted 78% of the total number of industrial enterprises, contributed 91% of total industrial output.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nLabor force (12.6 million)\u2014by occupation:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=CIA |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703175031/https://www.cia.gov/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n*Agricultural: 35%\n*Industry and services: 65% (2008 est.)\n\n==External trade==\n[[File:Kore DR Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|upright=2|A proportional representation of North Korean exports.]]\n\nStatistics from North Korea's trade partners is collected by international organizations like the United Nations and the [[International Monetary Fund]], and by the South Korean [[Ministry of Unification]].\n\nIt has also been estimated that imports of arms from the Soviet Union in the period 1988 to 1990 accounted for around 30% of the North Korea's total imports, and that between 1981 and 1989 North Korea earned approximately $4 billion from the export of arms, approximately 30% of North Korea's total exports in that period.

These figures exclude intra-Korean trade, deemed internal, which rose in 2002 to $641 million.

Encouraged by [[Kim Jong-il]]'s call to strengthen the implementation of the independent accounting system ({{lang|ko|\ub3c5\ub9bd\ucc44\uc0b0\uc81c}}, ''tongnip ch'aesanje'') of enterprises in March 1984, interest in enterprise management and the independent accounting system increased, as evidenced by increasing coverage of the topic in North Korean journals.<ref name=\"traveldocs1\"/> Under the system, factory managers still are assigned output targets but are given more discretion in decisions about labour, equipment, materials, and funds.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn addition to fixed capital, each enterprise is allocated a minimum of [[working capital]] from the state through the [[Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Central Bank]] and is required to meet operating expenses with the proceeds from sales of its output. Up to 50% of the \"profit\" is taxed, the remaining half being kept by the enterprise for purchase of equipment, introduction of new technology, welfare benefits, and bonuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/ |title=North Korean Economy Watch |publisher=Nkeconwatch.com |date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206221010/http://www.nkeconwatch.com/ |archivedate=December 6, 2011 }}</ref> As such, the system provides some built-in incentives and a degree of micro-level autonomy, unlike the budget allocation system, under which any surplus is turned over to the government in its entirety.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nAnother innovation, the August Third People's Consumer Goods Production Movement, is centred on consumer goods production. This measure was so named after Kim Jong-il made an inspection tour of an exhibition of light industrial products held in [[Pyongyang]] on August 3, 1984. The movement charges workers to use locally available resources and production facilities to produce needed consumer goods. On the surface, the movement does not appear to differ much from the local industry programs in existence since the 1960s, although some degree of local autonomy is allowed. However, a major departure places output, pricing, and purchases outside central planning. In addition, direct sales stores were established to distribute goods produced under the movement directly to consumers. The movement is characterized as a third sector in the production of consumer goods, alongside centrally controlled light industry and locally controlled traditional light industry. Moreover, there were some reports in the mid-1980s of increasing encouragement of small-scale private handicrafts and farm markets. As of 1992, however, no move was reported to expand the size of private garden plots.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nAll these measures appear to be minor stop-gap measures to alleviate severe shortages of consumer goods by infusing some degree of incentives. In mid-1993, no significant moves signalling a fundamental deviation from the existing system had occurred. The reluctance to initiate reform appears to be largely political. This concern is based on the belief that economic reform will produce new interests that will demand political expression and that demands for the institutionalization of such pluralism eventually will lead to political liberalization.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s and particularly around the end of the decade, North Korea slowly began to modify its rigid self-reliant policy. The changes, popularly identified as the open-door policy, included an increasing emphasis on foreign trade, a readiness to accept direct foreign investment by enacting a joint venture law, the decision to open the country to international tourism, and economic cooperation with South Korea.\n\nThe main targets of the Third Seven-Year Plan of 1987\u20131993 were to achieve the \"Ten Long-Range Major Goals of the 1980s for the Construction of the Socialist Economy\". These goals, conceived in 1980, were to be fulfilled by the end of the decade. The fact that these targets were rolled over to the end of the Third Seven-Year Plan is another indication of the disappointing economic performance during the Second Seven-Year Plan. The three policy goals of self-reliance, modernization, and scientification were repeated. Economic growth was set at 7.9% annually, lower than the previous plan. Although achieving the ten major goals of the 1980s was the main thrust of the Third Seven-Year Plan, some substantial changes have been made in specific quantitative targets. For example, the target for the annual output of steel was reduced by a third: from 15 million tons to 10 million tons. The output targets of cement and non-ferrous metals\u2014two major export items\u2014have been increased significantly. The June 1989 introduction of the Three-Year Plan for Light Industry as part of the Third Seven-Year Plan is intended to boost the [[standard of living]] by addressing consumer needs.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe Third Seven-Year Plan gave a great deal of attention to developing foreign trade and joint ventures, the first time a plan has addressed these issues. By the end of 1991, however, two years before the termination of the plan, no quantitative plan targets were made public, an indication that the plan has not fared well.{{Original research inline|date=January 2008}} The diversion of resources to build highways, theatres, hotels, airports, and other facilities to host the Thirteenth World Festival of Youth and Students in July 1989 must have had a negative impact on industrial and agricultural development, although the expansion and improvement of social infrastructure have resulted in some long-term economic benefits.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\n====State Planning Commission====\nAlthough general economic policy objectives are decided by the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central People's Committee]] (CPC), it is the task of the [[State Planning Committee]] to translate the broad goals into specific annual and long-term development plans and quantitative targets for the economy as a whole, as well as for each industrial sector and enterprise. Under the basic tenets of the 1964 reforms, the planning process is guided by the principles of \"unified planning\" ({{lang|ko|\uc77c\uc6d0\ud654}}, ''ilw\u014fnhwa'') and of \"detailed planning\" ({{lang|ko|\uc0c8\ubd84\ud654}}, ''saebunhwa'').<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nUnder \"unified planning\", regional committees are established in each province, city, and county to systematically coordinate planning work. These committees do not belong to any regional organization and are directly supervised by the State Planning Committee. As a result of a reorganization in 1969, they are separated into provincial planning committees, city/county committees, and enterprise committees (for large-scale enterprises).<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe planning committees, under the auspices of the State Planning Committee, coordinate their work with the planning offices of the economy-related government organizations the corresponding regional and local areas. The system attempts to enable the regional planning staff to better coordinate with economic establishments in their areas, which are directly responsible to them in planning, as well as communicating directly with staff at the CPC. \"Detailed planning\" seeks to construct plans with precision and scientific methods based on concrete assessment of the resources, labour, funds, plant capacities, and other necessary information.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\n[[File:Nkorea-economic-planning-2.svg|thumb|upright=2|Simplified diagram showing the process of economic policy planning.]]\n\nThere are four stages in drafting the final national economic plan.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* The first is collecting and compiling preliminary statistical data. These figures, which are used as the basic planning data on the productive capacities of economic sectors, originally are prepared by lower-level economic units and aggregated on a national level by respective departments and committees. Simultaneously, the regional, local, and enterprise planning committees prepare their own data and forward them to the CPC. Through this two-channel system of simultaneous, separate, and independent preparation of statistical data by economic units and planning committees, the government seeks to ensure an accurate, objective, and realistic data base unfettered by local and bureaucratic bias.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* The second stage is preparing the control figures by the CPC based on the preliminary data in accordance with the basic plan goals presented by the Central People's Committee.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* In the third stage, a draft plan is prepared. The draft plan, prepared by the CPC, is the result of coordinating all draft figures submitted by the lower-level economic units, which, in turn, base their drafts on the control figures handed down from the committee.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n* In the fourth stage, the CPC submits a unified national draft plan to the Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council for confirmation. After approval by the Supreme People's Assembly, the draft becomes final and is distributed to all economic units and regional and local planning committees.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe plan then becomes legal and compulsory. Frequent directives from the central government contain changes in the plan targets or incentives for meeting the plan objectives.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nAlthough the central government is most clearly involved in the formulation and evaluation of the yearly and long-term plans, it also reviews summaries of quarterly or monthly progress. Individual enterprises divide the production time into daily, weekly, ten-day, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. In general, the monthly plan is the basic factory planning period.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe success of an economic plan depends on the quality and detail of information received, the establishment of realistic targets, coordination among sectors, and correct implementation. High initial growth during the Three-Year Plan and, to a lesser extent, during the Five-Year Plan contributed to a false sense of confidence among the planners. Statistical over reporting\u2014an inherent tendency in an economy where rewards lie in fulfilling the quantitative targets, particularly when the plan target year approaches\u2014leads to overestimation of economic potential, poor product quality, and eventually to plan errors. Inefficient use of plants, equipment, and raw materials add to planning errors. Lack of coordination in planning and production competition among sectors and regions cause imbalances and disrupt input-output relationships. The planning reforms in 1964 were supposed to solve these problems, but the need for correct and detailed planning and strict implementation of plans was so great that their importance was emphasized in the report unveiling the Second Seven-Year Plan, indicating that planning problems persisted in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1990s North Korea abandoned firm directive planning, and multi-year plans became more of a long-term economic strategy.<ref name=\"38north-20160726\"/>\n\nIn 2016, Kim Jong Un announced the first \"Five Year Plan\" since the 1980s, which aims to further develop the economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-announces-economic-plan-after-unprecedentedly-grim-struggle/2016/05/08/c84088e2-1214-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_story.html|title=North Korea announces five-year economic plan, its first since the 1980s|last=https://www.facebook.com/annafifield|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}</ref>\n\n====Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method====\nThe ''[[Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method]]'' ({{lang|ko|\uccad\uc0b0\ub9ac\ubc29\ubc95}}) of management was born out of Kim Il-sung's February 1960 visit to the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Cooperative Farm in [[South Pyongan|South P'y\u014fngan]] Province. Influenced by Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward Policy, Kim and other members of the KWP Central Committee offered \"[[on-the-spot guidance]]\" ({{lang|ko|\ud604\uc9c0\uc9c0\ub3c4}}, ''hy\u014fnji chido'') and spent two months instructing and interacting with the workers. The avowed objective of this new method is to combat \"[[Bureaucracy|bureaucratism]]\" and \"formalism\" in the farm management system.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe leadership claimed that farm workers were unhappy and produced low output because low-ranking functionaries of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (who expounded abstract [[Marxism|Marxist]] theories and slogans) were using tactics that failed to motivate. To correct this, the leadership recommended that the workers receive specific guidance in solving production problems and be promised readily available material incentives. The Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method called for high-ranking party officials, party cadres, and administrative officials to emulate [[Kim Il-sung]] by making field inspections. The system provided opportunities for farmers to present their grievances and ideas to leading cadres and managers.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nPerhaps more important than involving administrative personnel in on-site inspections was the increased use of material incentives, such as paid vacations, special bonuses, honorific titles, and monetary rewards. In fact, the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method appeared to accommodate almost any expedient to spur production. The method, subsequently, was undercut by heavy-handed efforts to increase farm production and amalgamate farms into ever-larger units. Actual improvement in the agricultural sector began with the adoption of the subteam contract system as a means of increasing peasant productivity by adjusting individual incentives to those of the immediate, small working group. Thus the increasing scale of collective farms was somewhat offset by the reduction in the size of the working unit. \"On-the-spot guidance\" by high government functionaries, however, continued in the early 1990s, as exemplified by Kim Il-sung's visits to such places as the Wangjaesan Cooperative Farm in [[Onsong|Ons\u014fng County]] and the Ky\u014fngs\u014fn Branch Experimental Farm of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences between August 20 and 30, 1991.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/> Kim Jong-il carried on the tradition, despite having refused to do so before, and even expanded it to the Korean People's Army. Today Kim Jong-un continues the practices of the method.\n\n====Taean work system====\nThe [[Industrial organization|industrial management system]] developed in three distinct stages. The first was a period of enterprise autonomy that lasted until December 1946. The second stage was a transitional system based on local autonomy, with each enterprise managed by the enterprise management committee under the direction of the local people's committee. This system was replaced by the \"one-man management system\" ({{lang|ko|\uc9c0\ubc30\uc778 \ub2e8\ub3c5 \ucc45\uc784\uc81c}}), with management patterned along Soviet lines as large enterprises were nationalized and came under central control. The third stage, the ''Taean'' Work System ({{lang|ko|\ub300\uc548\uc758 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uccb4\uacc4}}, ''Taean\u016di sa\u014fpch'e''), was introduced in December 1961 as an application and refinement of agricultural management techniques to industry. The Taean industrial management system grew out of the ''Ch'\u014fngsan-ni'' Method.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nThe highest managerial authority under the Taean system is the party committee. Each committee has approximately 25 to 35 members elected from the ranks of managers, workers, engineers, and the leadership of \"working people's organizations\" at the factory. A smaller \"executive committee\", about one-quarter the size of the regular committee, has practical responsibility for day-to-day plant operations and major factory decisions. The most important staff members, including the party committee secretary, factory manager, and chief engineer, make up its membership. The system focuses on co-operation among workers, technicians, and party functionaries at the factory level.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nEach factory has two major lines of administration, one headed by the manager, the other by the party committee secretary. A chief engineer and his or her assistants direct a general staff in charge of all aspects of production, planning, and technical guidance. Depending on the size of the factory, varying numbers of deputies oversee factory logistics, marketing, and workers' services. The supply of materials includes securing, storing, and distributing all materials for factory use, as well as storing finished products and shipping them from the factory.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nDeputies are assign workers to their units and handle factory accounts and payroll. Providing workers' services requires directing any farming done on factory lands, stocking factory retail shops, and taking care of all staff amenities. Deputies in charge of workers' services are encouraged to meet as many of the factory's needs as possible using nearby agricultural cooperatives and local industries.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nThe secretary of the party committee organizes all political activities in each of the factory party cells and attempts to ensure loyalty to the party's production targets and management goals. According to official claims, all management decisions are arrived at by consensus among the members of the party committee. Given the overwhelming importance of the party in the country's affairs, it seems likely that the party secretary has the last say in any major factory disputes.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nThe Taean system heralded a more rational approach to industrial management than that practised previously. Although party functionaries and workers became more important to management under the new system, engineers and technical staff received more responsibility in areas where their expertise could contribute the most. The system recognizes the importance of material as well as \"politico-moral\" incentives for managing the factory workers. The \"internal accounting system\", a spin-off of the \"independent accounting system\", grants bonuses to work teams and workshops that use raw materials and equipment most efficiently. These financial rewards come out of enterprise profits.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nA measure of the success of the Taean work system is its longevity and its continued endorsement by the leadership.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}} In his 1991 New Year's address marking the 13th anniversary of the creation of the system, Kim Il-sung said that the\n<blockquote>\nTaean work system is the best system of economic management. It enables the producer masses to fulfill their responsibility and role as masters and to manage the economy in a scientific and rational manner by implementing the mass line in economic management, and by combining party leadership organically with administrative, economic, and technical guidance.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}</blockquote>\n\n====Mass production campaigns====\nParallel to management techniques such as the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method and the Taean work system, which were designed to increase output in more normalized and regularized operations of farms and enterprises, the leadership continuously resorts to exhortations and mass campaigns to motivate the workers to meet output targets. The earliest and the most pervasive mass production campaign was the [[Chollima Movement|Ch'\u014fllima Movement]]. Introduced in 1958 and fashioned after China's [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958\u20131960), the Ch'\u014fllima Movement organized the labour force into work teams and brigades to compete at increasing production. The campaign was aimed at industrial and agricultural workers and at organizations in education, science, sanitation and health, and culture.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nIn addition to work teams, units eligible for Ch'\u014fllima citations included entire factories, factory workshops, and such self-contained units as a ship or a railroad station. The \"[[socialist emulation]]\" among the industrial sectors, enterprises, farms, and work teams under the Ch'\u014fllima Movement frantically sought to complete the [[First Five-Year Plan (North Korea)|First Five-Year Plan]] (1957\u20131960) but instead created chaotic disruptions in the economy. This made it necessary to set aside 1959 as a \"buffer year\" to restore balance in the economy.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nAlthough the Ch'\u014fllima Movement was replaced in the early 1960s by the Ch'\u014fngsan-ni Method and the Taean Work System, the regime's reliance on mass campaigns continued into the early 1990s. Campaigns conducted after the Ch'\u014fllima to speed battles toward the end of a period (such as a month, a year, or an economic plan) to reach production targets to carry out the economic goals of the decade.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\n===Efforts at modernization since 1991===\nFollowing the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the principal source of external support, North Korea announced in December 1993 a three-year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade. However, lack of fertilizer, natural disasters, and poor storage and transportation practices the country fell more than a million tons per year short of grain self-sufficiency.<ref name=Bloomberg2016 /><ref name=UPI2016 /> Moreover, lack of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts and oil for [[electricity generation]] left many factories idle.<ref name=RandPark2010Dissertation />\n\nThe shortage of foreign exchange because of a chronic trade deficit, a large foreign debt, and dwindling foreign aid has constrained economic development. In addition, North Korea has been diverting scarce resources from developmental projects to defence; it spent more than 20% of GNP on defence toward the end of the 1980s, a proportion among the highest in the world. These negative factors, compounded by the declining efficiency of the central planning system and the failure to modernize the economy, have slowed the pace of growth since the 1960s. The demise of the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and East European countries\u2014North Korea's traditional trade partners and benefactors\u2014has compounded the economic difficulties in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nEconomically, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Soviet support to North Korean industries caused a contraction of the North Korea's economy by 25% during the 1990s. While, by some accounts, North Korea had a higher per capita income than South Korea in the 1970s, by 2006 its per capita income was estimated to be only $1108, one seventeenth that of South Korea.<ref>Amal Mattoo, ''Power, Ideology, and Resistance to Reform in North Korea'' (May 2015): 3.</ref>\n\nExperimentation in small scale entrepreneurship took place from 2009 to 2013, and although there continue to be legal uncertainties this has developed into a significant sector.<ref name=\"38north-20170329\">{{cite news|url=http://38north.org/2017/03/aabrahamian032917/|title=A Eulogy to Women in Business Training|last=Abrahamian|first=Andray|date=March 29, 2017|work=38 North|accessdate=April 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419102256/http://38north.org/2017/03/aabrahamian032917/|archivedate=April 19, 2017|url-status=live|publisher=U.S.\u2013Korea Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies}}</ref> By 2016 economic liberalisation had progressed to the extent that both locally-responsible and state industrial enterprises gave the state 20% to 50% of their output, selling the remainder to buy raw materials with market-based prices in akin to a free market.<ref name=\"38north-20160726\">{{cite news|url=http://38north.org/2016/07/gtoloraya072616/ |title=Deciphering North Korean Economic Policy Intentions |author=Georgy Toloraya |publisher=U.S.-Korea Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies |work=38 North |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=August 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730061744/http://38north.org/2016/07/gtoloraya072616/ |archivedate=July 30, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 the Enterprise Act was amended to allow state-owned enterprise managers to engage in foreign trade and joint ventures, and to accept investment from non-government domestic sources.

He described the recent rise of entrepreneurial groups through \"socialist cooperation\", where groups of individuals could start small enterprises as cooperative groups. Managers in state-owned industries or farms were also free to sell or trade production beyond state plan targets, providing incentives to increase production. Managers could also find investment for expansion of successful operations, in a process he called \"socialist competition\".

Under this system, provincial authorities are responsible for the operating costs of institutions and enterprises not under direct central government control, such as schools, hospitals, shops, and local consumer goods production. In return, they are expected to organize as many profitable ventures as possible and to turn over profits to the central government.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nAround December of every year, the state budget for the following calendar year is drafted, subject to revision around March.

After remaining around 30% until 1971, the defense share decreased abruptly to 17% in 1972, and continued to decline throughout the 1980s. Officially, in both 1989 and 1990 the defense share remained at 12%, and for 1991 it was 12.3% with 11.6% planned for 1992. The declining trend was consistent with the government's announced intentions to stimulate economic development and increase the social benefits. However, Western experts have estimated that actual military expenditures are higher than budget figures indicate.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn the 1999 budget, expenditures for the farming and power sectors were increased by 15% and 11%, respectively, compared with those of 1998.\n\nIn the 2007 budget, it was estimated an increase in revenue at 433.2bn won ($3.072bn, $1 = 141 won). In 2006, 5.9% were considered the public revenue, whereas this year, this figure was raised to 7.1%.\n\nNorth Korea claims that it is the only state in the world that does not levy [[tax]]es.

It started in earnest in February 2018, during the [[2018 Winter Olympics|Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games]], when top musicians from North Korea were sent to perform in South Korea. This included a female quintet who performed in black shorts and red tops. After two months, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un saw the performance of South Korean girl group, [[Red Velvet (group)|Red Velvet]]. This is the first ever [[K-Pop]] show to be held in Pyongyang. The North Korean musicians that performed in South Korea were highly praised for their performance that leader Kim decided to send them to Beijing for another goodwill tour in January, 2019. Part of the revolution was the introduction of other cultures, including Western, which was previously believed to be vulgar and quite corrupt in the past, but is now slowly making its way to the North Korean people. Second-hand [[Harry Potter]] books can now be read at the National Library, and [[Bollywood|Bollywood films]] like the ''[[Three Idiots]]'' had just had a run in their cinemas. The changes have also found their way to the economic sector with factories that are also producing products that are associated more with the West, like [[Air Jordan|Air Jordan shoes]], for national consumption.\n<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.scmp.com/culture/music/article/2185987/harry-potter-bollywood-hot-pants-and-k-pop-north-korea-kim-jong-uns |title=Harry Potter, Bollywood, hot pants and K-pop: in North Korea, Kim Jong-un's cultural revolution gathers speed  |website= South China Morning Post  }}</ref>\n\nPer the amendments made to the Constitution in 2019, the former economic methods of management, Ch'\u014fngsan-ni in agriculture and Taean in the industries, were now phased out altogether.\n\n==Economic sectors==\n\n===Manufacturing===\n[[File:F\u00e1brica m\u00e1quinas-herramienta Huich\u00f3n (5).jpg|thumb|Tool-machine factory in [[Huichon]]]]\n\nNorth Korea also implements planned economy in industry. The government will provide fuel and materials for the factory, and the factory will manufacture the required products and quantities according to the government's requirements.\n\nNorth Korea's self-reliant development strategy assigned top priority to developing heavy industry, with parallel development in agriculture and light industry. This policy was achieved mainly by giving heavy industry preferential allocation of state investment funds. More than 50% of state investment went to the industrial sector during the 1954\u20131976 period (47.6%, 51.3%, 57.0%, and 49.0%, respectively, during the [[Three-Year Plan]], Five-Year Plan, First Seven-Year Plan, and Six-Year Plan). As a result, gross industrial output grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Savada1994\" />{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nAs was the case with the growth in national output, the pace of growth has slowed markedly since the 1960s. The rate declined from 41.7% and 36.6% a year during the Three-Year Plan and Five-Year Plan, respectively, to 12.8%, 16.3%, and 12.2%, respectively, during the First Seven Year Plan, Six-Year Plan, and Second Seven-Year Plan. As a result of faster growth in industry, that sector's share in total national output increased from 16.8% in 1946 to 57.3% in 1970. Since the 1970s, industry's share in national output has remained relatively stable. From all indications, the pace of industrialization during the Third Seven-Year Plan up to 1991 is far below the planned rate of 9.6%. In 1990 it was estimated that the industrial sector's share of national output was 56%.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\n\nIndustry's share of the combined total of gross agricultural and industrial output climbed from 28% in 1946 to well over 90% in 1980. Heavy industry received more than 80% of the total state investment in industry between 1954 and 1976 (81.1%, 82.6%, 80%, and 83%, respectively, during the [[Three-Year Plan]], Five-Year Plan, First Seven-Year Plan, and Six-Year Plan), and was overwhelmingly favored over light industry.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nNorth Korea claims to have fulfilled the Second Seven-Year Plan (1978\u20131984) target of raising the industrial output in 1984 to 120% of the 1977 target, equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 12.2%. Judging from the production of major commodities that form the greater part of industrial output, however, it is unlikely that this happened. For example, the increase during the 1978\u20131984 plan period for electric power, coal, steel, metal-cutting machines, tractors, passenger cars, chemical fertilizers, chemical fibers, cement, and textiles, respectively, was 78%, 50%, 85%, 67%, 50%, 20%, 56%, 80%, 78%, and 45%.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>{{rp|123\u2013127}}\nRaw materials were in short supply and so were energy and hard currency. Infrastructure decayed and machinery became obsolete. Unlike other [[Eastern Bloc|socialist countries in the Eastern Europe]], North Korea kept planning in a highly centralized manner and refused to liberalize economic management.\n\n[[File:Fabrica de cristal duro Huichon4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Huichon#Huichon Hard Glassware Factory|Huichon Hard Glass Factory]]]]\nIn the mid-1980s, the speculation that North Korea would emulate China in establishing Chinese-style [[special economic zone]]s was flatly denied by then deputy chairman of the Economic Policy Commission [[Yun Ki-pok]] (Yun became chairman as of June 1989). China's special economic zones typically are coastal areas established to promote economic development and the introduction of advanced technology through [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. Investors are offered preferential tax terms and facilities. The zones, which allow greater reliance on market forces, have more decision making power in economic activities than do provincial-level units. Over the years, China has tried to convince the North Korean leadership of the advantages of these zones by giving tours of the various zones and explaining their values to visiting high-level officials.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn April 1982, [[Kim Il-sung]] announced a new economic policy giving priority to increased agricultural production through [[land reclamation]], development of the country's infrastructure\u2014especially power plants and transportation facilities\u2014and reliance on domestically produced equipment. There also was more emphasis on trade.\n\nIn September 1984, North Korea promulgated a [[joint venture]] law to attract foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[technology]]. The new emphasis on expanding [[trade]] and acquiring technology was not, however, accompanied by a shift in priorities away from support of the military. In 1991, North Korea announced the creation of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the northeast regions of [[Rason]] ([[Rason Special Economic Zone]]) and [[Chongjin|Ch'\u014fngjin]]. Investment in this SEZ has been slow in coming. Problems with [[infrastructure]], [[bureaucracy]], uncertainties about the security of investments, and viability have hindered growth and development.

Having Soviet origins (the subsequent practice of cloning foreign specimens, and a recent automobile joint-venture), North Korea has developed a wide-range automotive industry with production of all types of vehicles. The basis for production is in urban and off-road minis; luxury cars; SUV cars; small, medium, heavy, and super-heavy cargo; construction and off-road trucks; minibuses/minivans, coach buses, civilian and articulated buses, trolleybuses, and trams. However, North Korea produces far fewer vehicles than its production capability due to the ongoing economic crisis. North Korea has not joined or collaborated with the [[Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles|OICA]], or with any other automotive organization, so any critical information about its motor vehicle industry is limited.\n\n===Power and energy===\n{{Main|Energy in North Korea}}[[File:Electrical engineering components.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Electrical engineering components]]\nThe energy sector is one of the most serious bottlenecks in the North Korean economy. Since 1990, the supply of oil, coal, and electricity declined steadily, and seriously affected all sectors of the economy. [[Crude oil]] was formerly imported by pipeline at \"friendship prices\" from the former Soviet Union or China, but the withdrawal of Russian concessions and the reduction of imports from China brought down annual imports from about {{convert|23|Moilbbl}} in 1988 to less than {{convert|4|Moilbbl}} by 1997. As the imported oil was refined for fuels for transportation and agricultural machinery, a serious cutback in oil imports caused critical problems in transportation and agriculture.\n\nAccording to statistics compiled by the South Korean agency Statistics Korea based on [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) data, per capita electricity consumption fell from its peak in 1990 of 1247 kilowatt hours to a low of 712 kilowatt hours in 2000. It slowly rose since then to 819 kilowatt hours in 2008, a level below that of 1970.<ref name=DNK8612>{{cite news|title=Economic Collapse Reflected in Scarce Electricity |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&num=9629 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |newspaper=Daily NK |date=August 6, 2012 |author=Kim Tae Hong |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904031624/http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&num=9629 |archivedate=September 4, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=YN8612>{{cite news|title=N.

As coal was used mainly for industry and electricity generation, decrease in coal production caused serious problems in industrial production and electricity generation. Coal production may not necessarily increase significantly until North Korea imports modern mining technology.{{Original research inline|date=January 2008}}\n\nElectricity generation of North Korea peaked in 1989 at about 30 TWh.

The PDS requires farmers in agricultural regions to hand over a portion of their production to the government and then reallocates the surplus to urban regions, which cannot grow their own foods. About 70% of the [[Demographics of North Korea|North Korean population]], including the entire [[urban population]], receives food through this government-run system.<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/>\n\nBefore the floods, recipients were generally allotted 600\u2013700&nbsp;grams per day while high officials, military men, heavy laborers, and public security personnel were allotted slightly larger portions of 700\u2013800&nbsp;grams per day.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As of 2013, the target average distribution was 573 grams of cereal equivalent per person per day, but varied according to age, occupation, and whether rations are received elsewhere (such as school meals).<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/> However, as of 2019, this number has been reduced to 312 grams per day according to an investigation conducted by the [[United Nations]] between March 29 and April 12.<ref>https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/north-korea-food-insecurity-food-aid/</ref>\n\nDecreases in production affected the quantity of food available through the public distribution system. Shortages were compounded when the North Korean government imposed further restrictions on collective farmers. When farmers, who had never been covered by the PDS, were mandated by the government to reduce their own food allotments from 167 kilograms to 107 kilograms of grain per person each year, they responded by withholding portions of the required amount of grain. [[North Korean famine|Famine refugees]] reported{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} that the government decreased PDS rations to 150&nbsp;grams in 1994 and to as low as 30&nbsp;grams by 1997. It was further reported that the PDS failed to provide any food from April to August 1998 (the \"lean\" season) as well as from March to June 1999. In January 1998, the North Korean government publicly announced that the PDS would no longer distribute [[ration]]s and that families needed to somehow procure their own food supplies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} By 2005, the PDS was only supplying households with approximately one half of an absolute minimum caloric need.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} By 2008, the system had significantly recovered, and, from 2009 to 2013, daily per person rations averaged at 400 grams per day for much of the year, though in 2011 it dropped to 200 grams per day from May to September.<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/>\n\nIt is estimated that in the early 2000s, the average North Korean family drew some 80% of its income from small businesses that were technically illegal (though unenforced) in North Korea.

Since North Korea is a closed country, the number of specific deaths in the incident is difficult to know. According to different literature, the starved or malnourished death toll is estimated to be between 240,000 and 480,000. Since 1998 there has been a gradual recovery in agriculture production, which by 2013 brought North Korea back close to self-sufficiency in [[staple food]]s. However, as of 2013, most households have borderline or poor food consumption, and consumption of protein remains inadequate.<ref name=\"FAO-WFP-2013\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the North Korean economy saw stagnation turning into crisis. [[Aid|Economic assistance]] received from the Soviet Union and China was an important factor of its economic growth. Upon its collapse in 1991, the Soviet Union withdrew its support and demanded payment in hard currency for imports. China stepped in to provide some assistance and supplied food and oil, most of it reportedly at concessionary prices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The North Korean economy was undermined and its industrial output began to decline in 1990. Deprived of industrial inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides, and electricity for irrigation, agricultural output also started to decrease even before North Korea had a series of [[natural disaster]]s in the mid-1990s. This evolution, combined with a series of natural disasters including record floods in 1995, caused one of the worst economic crises in North Korea's history. Other causes of this crisis were high defense spending (about 25% of GDP) and bad governance.\n\nIn December 1991, North Korea established a \"zone of free economy and trade\" to include the northeastern port cities of Unggi ([[Sonbong|S\u014fnbong]]), Ch'\u014fngjin, and Najin. The establishment of this zone also had ramifications on the questions of how far North Korea would go in opening its economy to the West and to South Korea, the future of the development scheme for the [[Tumen River]] area, and, more important, how much North Korea would reform its economic system.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nNorth Korea announced in December 1993 a three-year transitional economic policy placing primary emphasis on agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade. However, lack of fertilizer, natural disasters, and poor storage and transportation practices have left the country more than a million tons per year short of grain self-sufficiency.<ref name=\"Bloomberg2016\">{{cite web|last1=McFerron|first1=Whitney|title=North Korea Food Supply Imperiled by Drought, UN Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/north-korea-s-food-supply-imperiled-by-water-shortages-un-says|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=February 23, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710111621/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/north-korea-s-food-supply-imperiled-by-water-shortages-un-says|archivedate=July 10, 2016|date=April 27, 2016|quote=North Korea\u2019s already-low food supplies are about to get worse after poor rainfall in the past year slashed the nation's critical rice crop, the United Nations said.

The government pursued Kim Jong-il's ''[[Songun]]'' policy, under which the military is deployed to direct production and infrastructure projects. As a consequence of the government's policy of establishing economic self-sufficiency, the North Korean economy has become increasingly isolated from that of the rest of the world, and its industrial development and structure do not reflect its international competitiveness.

Industrial and power output have declined in parallel.\nDuring what North Korea called the \"peaceful construction\" period before the Korean War, the fundamental task of the economy was to overtake the level of output and efficiency attained toward the end of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]]; to restructure and develop a viable economy reoriented toward the communist-bloc countries; and to begin the process of socializing the economy. Nationalization of key industrial enterprises and land reform, both of which were carried out in 1946, laid the groundwork for two successive one-year plans in 1947 and 1948, respectively, and the Two-Year Plan of 1949-50. It was during this period that the piece-rate wage system and the independent accounting system began to be applied and that the commercial network increasingly came under state and cooperative ownership.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe basic goal of the Three-Year Plan, officially named \"The Three-Year Post-war Reconstruction Plan of 1954\u201356\",<!-- abbreviation in original name --> was to reconstruct an economy torn by the Korean War. The plan stressed more than merely regaining the prewar output levels. The Soviet Union, other East European countries and China provided reconstruction assistance. The highest priority was developing heavy industry, but an earnest effort to collectivize farming also was begun. At the end of 1957, output of most industrial commodities had returned to 1949 levels, except for a few items such as chemical fertilizers, carbides, and [[sulfuric acid]], whose recovery took longer.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nHaving basically completed the task of reconstruction, the state planned to lay a solid foundation for industrialization while completing the socialization process and solving the basic problems of food and shelter during the Five-Year Plan of 1957\u20131960. The socialization process was completed by 1958 in all sectors of the economy, and the Ch'\u014fllima Movement was introduced. Although growth rates reportedly were high, there were serious imbalances among the different economic sectors. Because rewards were given to individuals and enterprises that met [[production quota]]s, frantic efforts to fulfill plan targets in competition with other enterprises and industries caused disproportionate growth among various enterprises, between [[industry]] and [[agriculture]] and between light and heavy industries. Because resources were limited and the transportation system suffered bottlenecks, resources were diverted to politically well-connected enterprises or those whose managers complained the loudest. An enterprise or industry that performed better than others often did so at the expense of others. Such disruptions intensified as the target year of the plan approached.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nUntil the 1960s, North Korea's economy grew much faster than South Korea's. Although North Korea was behind in total national output, it was ahead of South Korea in per capita national output, because of its smaller population relative to South Korea. For example, in 1960 North Korea's population was slightly over 10 million people, while South Korea's population was almost 25 million people. Annual economic growth rates of 30% and 21% during the Three-Year Plan of 1954\u20131956 and the Five-Year Plan of 1957\u20131960, respectively, were reported. After claiming early fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan in 1959, North Korea officially designated 1960 a \"buffer year\"\u2014a year of adjustment to restore balances among sectors before the next plan became effective in 1961. Not surprisingly the same phenomenon recurred in subsequent plans. Because the Five-Year Plan was fulfilled early, it became a de facto four-year plan. Beginning in the early 1960s, however, North Korea's economic growth slowed until it was stagnant at the beginning of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nVarious factors explain the very high rate of economic development of the country in the 1950s and the general slowdown since the 1960s. During the reconstruction period after the Korean War, there were opportunities for extensive economic growth\u2014attainable through the communist regime's ability to marshall idle resources and labor and to impose a low rate of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. This general pattern of initially high growth resulting in a high rate of capital formation was mirrored in other Soviet-type economies. Toward the end of the 1950s, as reconstruction work was completed and idle capacity began to diminish, the economy had to shift from the extensive to the intensive stage, where the simple communist discipline of marshaling underutilized resources became less effective. In the new stage, inefficiency arising from emerging bottlenecks led to [[diminishing returns]]. Further growth would only be attained by increasing efficiency and technological progress.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nBeginning in the early 1960s, a series of serious bottlenecks began to impede development. Bottlenecks were pervasive and generally were created by the lack of arable land, skilled [[Labour (economics)|labor]], [[energy]], and [[transportation]], and deficiencies in the [[extractive industries]]. Moreover, both land and marine transportation lacked modern equipment and modes of transportation. The inability of the energy and extractive industries as well as of the transportation network to supply power and raw materials as rapidly as the manufacturing plants could absorb them began to slow industrial growth.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe First Seven-Year Plan (initially 1961\u20131967) built on the groundwork of the earlier plans but changed the focus of [[industrialization]]. Heavy industry, with the machine tool industry as its linchpin, was given continuing priority. During the plan, however, the economy experienced widespread slowdowns and reverses for the first time, in sharp contrast to the rapid and uninterrupted growth during previous plans. Disappointing performance forced the planners to extend the plan three more years, until 1970. During the last part of the ''[[de facto]]'' ten-year plan, emphasis shifted to pursuing parallel development of the economy and of defense capabilities. This shift was prompted by concern over the military takeover in South Korea by General [[Park Chung-hee]] (1961\u20131979), escalation of the United States involvement in [[Vietnam]], and the widening [[Sino-Soviet split]]. It was thought that stimulating a technological revolution in the munitions industry was one means to achieve these parallel goals. In the end, the necessity to divert resources to defense became the official explanation for the plan's failure.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe Six-Year Plan of 1971\u20131976 followed immediately in 1971. In the aftermath of the poor performance of the preceding plan, growth targets of the Six-Year Plan were scaled down substantially. Because some of the proposed targets in the First Seven-Year Plan had not been attained even by 1970, the Six-Year Plan did not deviate much from its predecessor in basic goals. The Six-Year Plan placed more emphasis on technological advance, self-sufficiency (''[[Juche]]'') in industrial raw materials, improving product quality, correcting imbalances among different sectors, and developing the power and extractive industries; the last of these had been deemed largely responsible for slowdowns during the First Seven-Year Plan. The plan called for attaining a self- sufficiency rate of 60\u201370% in all industrial sectors by substituting domestic raw materials wherever possible and by organizing and renovating technical processes to make the substitution feasible. Improving transport capacity was seen as one of the urgent tasks in accelerating economic development\u2014it was one of the major bottlenecks of the Six-Year Plan.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nNorth Korea claimed to have fulfilled the Six-Year Plan by the end of August 1975, a full year and four months ahead of schedule. Under the circumstances, it was expected that the next plan would start without delay in 1976, a year early, as was the case when the First Seven-Year Plan was instituted in 1961. Even if the Six-Year Plan had been completed on schedule, the next plan should have started in 1977. However, it was not until nearly two years and four months later that the long-awaited plan was unveiled\u20141977 had become a \"buffer year\".<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe inability of the planners to continuously formulate and institute economic plans reveals as much about the inefficacy of planning itself as the extent of the economic difficulties and administrative disruptions facing the country. For example, targets for successive plans have to be based on the accomplishments of preceding plans. If these targets are underfulfilled, all targets of the next plan\u2014initially based on satisfaction of the plan\u2014have to be reformulated and adjusted. Aside from underfulfillment of the targets, widespread disruptions and imbalances among various sectors of the economy further complicate plan formulation.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nThe basic thrust of the Second Seven-Year Plan (1978\u20131984) was to achieve the three-pronged goals of self-reliance, modernization, and \"scientification\". Although the emphasis on self-reliance was not new, it had not previously been the explicit focus of an economic plan. This new emphasis might have been a reaction to mounting foreign debt originating from large-scale imports of Western machinery and equipment in the mid-1970s. Through modernization North Korea hoped to increase mechanization and automation in all sectors of the economy. \"Scientification\" means the adoption of up-to-date production and management techniques. The specific objectives of the economic plan were to strengthen the fuel, energy, and resource bases of industry through priority development of the energy and extractive industries; to modernize industry; to substitute domestic resources for certain imported raw materials; to expand freight-carrying capacity in railroad, road, and marine transportation systems; to centralize and containerize the transportation system; and to accelerate a technical revolution in agriculture.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nIn order to meet the manpower and technology requirements of an expanding economy, the education sector also was targeted for improvements. The quality of the comprehensive eleven-year compulsory education system was to be enhanced to train more technicians and specialists, and to expand the training of specialists, particularly in the fields of fuel, mechanical, electronic, and [[automation engineering]].<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nSuccessful fulfillment of the so-called nature-remaking projects also was part of the Second Seven-Year Plan. These projects referred to the five-point program for nature transformation unveiled by Kim Il-sung in 1976: completing the irrigation of non-paddy fields; reclaiming 1,000 square kilometres of new land; building 1,500 to 2,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} of terraced fields; carrying out afforestation and water conservation work; and reclaiming tidal land.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/>\n\nFrom all indications, the Second Seven-Year Plan was not successful. North Korea generally downplayed the accomplishments of the plan, and no other plan received less official fanfare. It was officially claimed that the economy had grown at an annual rate of 8.8% during the plan, somewhat below the planned rate of 9.6%. The reliability of this aggregate measure, however, is questionable. During the plan, the target annual output of 10 million tons of [[Food grain|grains]] (cereals and pulses) was attained. However, by official admission, the targets of only five other commodities were fulfilled. Judging from the growth rates announced for some twelve industrial products, it is highly unlikely that the total industrial output increased at an average rate of 12.2% as claimed. After the plan concluded, there was no new economic plan for two years, indications of both the plan's failure and the severity of the economic and planning problems confronting the economy in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Savada1994\"/> From 1998 to 2003, the government implemented a plan for scientific and technical development, which focused on the nation's IT and electronic industry.<ref>Schwekendiek, Daniel, ''A socioeconomic history of North Korea'', Jefferson and London: McFarland Publishers, 2011, p.122</ref>\n\n==Labor==\nGrowth and changes in the structure and ownership pattern of the economy also have changed the labor force. By 1958 individual private farmers, who once constituted more than 70% of the labor force, had been transformed into or replaced by state or collective farmers.

It is also the name used by the international [[Association Football]] team.\n::The terms ''Irish Republic'', ''Southern Ireland'', the ''Irish Free State'', the ''Free State'', the ''26 Counties'' and ''\u00c9ire'' (in English-language texts) have been used synonymously with the ''Republic of Ireland''. Of these, ''Southern Ireland'' and ''Irish Free State'', in particular, are seen as outdated. \"Eire\" (spelt without the Irish ''[[Acute accent|fada]]'') was the British legal spelling from the [[Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] until the [[Ireland Act 1949]], and informally for some years after.\n:*'''[[Northern Ireland]]''' 1922\u2013present.

The name of one of Ireland's four traditional [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces]]. The area contains nine northern counties, six of which make up [[Northern Ireland]], and three of which are part of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is also often used by [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]] to refer to the smaller [[Northern Ireland]]. Though [[Ulster]] has not been a political entity since the ancient Gaelic provincial kingdoms, it remains associated with a geographical area and is used in sporting and cultural contexts. See [[Ulster (disambiguation)]].\n:''In sport''\n:*In [[Gaelic games]], no distinction is recognised between the [[GAA county|GAA counties]] of the Republic and those of Northern Ireland. County teams play in their provincial championships (where the six counties of Ulster within Northern Ireland and three within the Republic all play in the Ulster championship) and the winners of these play in the All-Ireland championship.

Many sports organisations are subdivided along provincial lines e.g. [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], [[golf]].\n* The '''[[British Isles]]''' is a term used to mean the island of Great Britain plus the island of Ireland and many smaller surrounding islands, including the [[Isle of Man]] and, in some contexts, the [[Channel Islands]] ([[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]]). See [[British Isles naming dispute]] for details of the conflict over use of this term.\n* ''Great Britain and Ireland'', or variants like \"Britain and Ireland\" or \"The UK and Ireland\" are sometimes used as alternatives to the term [[British Isles]].\n* '''Anglo-Celtic Isles''' is an alternative term (in limited use) for the geographic region comprising Britain & Ireland, more commonly referred to as the 'British Isles'. 'Anglo-Celtic Islands' is a derivative of this. It is intended as a geographic term free of any political implication and uses the macro-cultural grouping term [[Anglo-Celtic]], referring to the peoples from which the majority of the island group's population are descended\u2014the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and the [[Celt]]s (it can also be inclusive of the [[Anglo-Normans]]).\n* '''[[Islands of the North Atlantic]]''' is another suggested replacement term for 'British Isles', without the same political connotations. However, its convolution and impracticality due to implying inclusion of fellow North Atlantic islands such as Iceland have made it unworkable and it has not come into common use. The term was used as part of the Strand 3 level of negotiations for the Belfast agreement. (Its acronym, IONA, is also the name of the small but historically important island of [[Iona]] off the coast of Scotland.)\n* '''[[British Islands]]''' (a legal term not in common usage) is the UK, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.\n* '''[[Brittany]]''', itself a corruption of 'Britain', and sometimes formerly known as 'Little Britain' is a historical [[Duchy]] in the West of [[France]], now a French region; for this modern administrative sense, see [[Brittany (administrative region)]].\n\n==Geographical distinctions==\n\n===The British Isles===\n{|\n|-\n| [[File:British Isles all.svg|50px]]\n|\nThe [[British Isles]] is a group of islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of [[Continental Europe]].

Its four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] are sometimes considered to be of different status.

Northern Ireland also had, until 1972, a far greater degree of [[self-government]] than the other constituent parts of the UK.\n\n''Great Britain'' is both a geographical and a political entity. Geographically, it is one island, but [[Great Britain#Political definition|as a political entity]] it also includes the smaller offshore islands that are administered as part of its constituent nations \u2013 England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 such as England's [[Isle of Wight]], Wales' [[Anglesey]] and Scotland's [[Inner Hebrides]], [[Outer Hebrides]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]].\n\nThe abbreviation ''GB'' is sometimes officially used for the United Kingdom, for example in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], or as the [[vehicle registration plate#International codes|vehicle registration plate]] [[List of international license plate codes|country identification code]] for UK-registered cars ''(see also [[British car number plates]])''. ''SCO'' in Scotland, ''CYM'' for Wales (Cymru), ''NI'' for Northern Ireland, or ''ENG'' for England can also be used.<ref name=\"numberplates\">{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1731653.stm\n|title=Flag day for patriotic drivers\n|date=2001-12-28\n|accessdate=2007-10-22\n|author=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[internet code]] ''[[.gb]],'' although allocated to the UK, is virtually unused and UK web domains use ''[[.uk]]''.\n\nThe four constituent parts of the UK are also known, particularly in sporting contexts, as ''[[Home Nations]]'' or the \"Four Nations\".

Sporting contests between the Four Nations are known as \"Home internationals\" (an example is the [[British Home Championship]] in football).\n\nThe governing body for football in Northern Ireland is called the [[Irish Football Association]] (the IFA), having been in existence since some forty years before [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]]. Its counterpart in the Republic (plus [[Derry City FC]]) is the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the FAI). The [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland national team]] retained the name \"Ireland\" for some fifty years after partition. Since around 1970 the two teams have been consistently referred to as \"Northern Ireland\" and \"[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]\" respectively. The UK competes as Great Britain at the Olympic Games.

The term ''Unionists'' may also be used, sometimes [[pejoratively]], for example by supporters of [[Scottish independence]] when referring to supporters of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union]]. Some older slang names for Britons are ''Tommy'' (for British soldiers) and ''Anglo''. [[Anglo]] properly refers only to England, but it is sometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives: for example, \"Anglo-French relations\" may be used in newspaper articles when referring to relations between the political entities [[France]] and the United Kingdom. ''Anglo-Saxon'' may be used (particularly in Continental European languages) when referring to the whole [[English-speaking world]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main|Names of the Irish state}}\n[[File:Republic of Ireland.svg|left|80px]]\n[[File:Eirepas.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|An Irish passport]]\nSince the adoption of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, '''[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]''' has been the [[English (language)|English]] name of the state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of [[Ireland]]. The name '''[[\u00c9ire]]''' is used when writing in [[Irish (language)|Irish]].\n\nSince the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], the term \"Republic of Ireland\" is the term used as the additional ''description'' of the state. This term is useful in avoiding ambiguity between the name of the island and the name of the state.  However, the term \"Ireland\" is always used in formal diplomatic contexts such as the [[European Union]] or the [[United Nations]]. The passport of the Republic of Ireland bears the name ''\u00c9ire \u2013 Ireland''.\n\nBefore the introduction of the 1937 constitution and the new name, the [[Irish Free State]] occupied the same territory as the modern state of Ireland. The Irish Free State became an autonomous [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1922 when it seceded from the United Kingdom through the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. The King ceased to be its Head of State [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|in 1936]] and the state ceased to be a Dominion and left the Commonwealth [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|in 1948]].\n\nTraditionally, the island of Ireland is divided into four [[Provinces of Ireland|provinces]] \u2013 [[Leinster]], [[Connacht]], [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]], with each of the provinces further divided into counties. The Republic of Ireland takes up 83% of the island, twenty-six of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland. Northern Ireland takes up the remaining area, six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster.\n\nOn the island of Ireland the naming of places often raises political issues. The usage of \"Ireland\" as the [[Constitution of Ireland|official name]] of the state causes offence to some [[unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] in [[Northern Ireland]], who believe it implies that the state [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|still]] has a territorial claim to the whole island \u2013 the terminology of \"Republic of Ireland\" or \"[[\u00c9ire]]\" is much preferred by Northern Irish unionists when referring to that political state. Similarly, some [[Nationalists (Ireland)|Nationalists]] in Northern Ireland also prefer to reserve the usage of \"Ireland\" to refer to the whole island.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Irishness is a highly contested identity, with fundamentally different perceptions of national identity between unionists (who generally perceive themselves as being British) and nationalists (who generally consider both communities to be part of the Irish nation).<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm CAIN: Democratic Dialogue: With all due respect \u2013 pluralism and parity of esteem (Report No. 7)] by Tom Hennessey and Robin Wilson, Democratic Dialogue (1997)</ref>\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is often referred to by the [[Irish nationalists|Nationalist]] and [[Irish Republicans|Republican]] communities by the term \"the Twenty-six Counties\", with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the [[Irish Republic]], which would consist of all of the [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] into which the island is divided.  The term \"the Six Counties\" (of Northern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include \"the North of Ireland\" and \"the North\". These latter are terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include \"the occupied six counties\" or \"occupied Ireland\", which are often used by people who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe [[Irish passport]] is available to Irish citizens and can also be applied for abroad through Irish Consular services and the local Irish Embassy. As per the [[Irish nationality law]], any person born on the island of Ireland before 2005, or otherwise a first generation descendant of such a person, is allowed to apply for an Irish passport. As such, people born in Northern Ireland and their children may be Irish citizens and hold an Irish passport if they choose.\n\n===British Islands===\n{{main|British Islands}}\n[[File:British Islands.svg|left|80px]]\n[[File:Jersey passport new.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A Jersey passport]]\nUnder the [[Interpretation Act 1978]] of the United Kingdom, the legal term [[British Islands]] (as opposed to the geographical term ''British Isles'') refers to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], together with the [[Crown dependencies]]: the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and of [[Guernsey]] (which in turn includes the smaller islands of [[Alderney]], [[Herm]] and [[Sark]]) in the [[Channel Islands]]; and the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nSpecial British passports are issued to citizens of the Crown dependencies. On the front of passports issued to residents of the Crown dependencies, the words ''\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\"'' are replaced with ''\"British Islands\"'' followed by the name of the issuing state or island. This design applies to [[Jersey passport]], [[Guernsey passport]] and [[Isle of Man passport]].  Pre-[[Brexit]], Crown dependency also bore the title ''\"European Union\"'' for border control purposes, like UK passports. Crown dependency citizens who have no family ties to the United Kingdom were granted a special limited 'Islander Status' under EU law (article 6 of Protocol 3 in the [[Treaty of Accession 1972|Treaty of Accession of the UK to the European Community]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status|title=What is Islander status?  |year=2013  |website=States of Guernsey  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007233859/http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status  |archivedate= 7 October 2013  |url-status=dead  |accessdate=8 December 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jersey|first1=States of |title=Islander status and your right to live and work in Europe|url=https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|website=www.gov.je|accessdate=8 December 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171208112536/https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|archivedate=8 December 2017 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Historical aspects==\n{{Further|Britain (name)}}\nSome suggest an early known  for the term might be  from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writings.

For example, in Geography 2.1.18, ''\u2026\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd \u03b2\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03bd'' (\"\u2026the most southern of the Brettans are further north than this\").<ref name=\"Roseman\">Translation by Roseman, ''op.cit.''</ref> He was writing around AD 10, although the earliest surviving copy of his work dates from the 6th century.\n[[Pliny the Elder]] writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section 4.102 of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]''. He writes of Great Britain: ''Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus.'' (\"Albion was its own name, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them in a moment\"). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands he considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands.\nIn his ''Geography'' written in the mid 2nd century and probably describing the position around AD 100,<ref name=ohi/> [[Ptolemy]] includes both Great Britain (Albion) and Ireland ([[Hibernia|Iwernia]]) in the so called ''Bretanic'' island group.

The earliest [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] source to use a collective term for the archipelago is the ''[[Life of Saint Columba]]'', a [[hagiography]] recording the missionary activities of the sixth century Irish monk [[Saint Columba]] among the peoples of what is now Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by [[Adomn\u00e1n of Iona|Adomn\u00e1n]] of [[Iona]], an Irish monk living on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is '''Oceani Insulae''' meaning \"Islands of the Ocean\" (Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition), it is used sparingly and no ''Priteni''-derived collective reference is made.\n\nAnother early native source to use a collective term is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]] written in the early eighth century. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is ''insularum'' meaning \"islands\" (Book 1, 8) and it too is used sparingly. He stated that Britain \"studies and confesses one and the same knowledge of the highest truth in the tongues of five nations, namely the Angles, the Britons, the Scots, the Picts, and the Latins\", distinguishing between the [[Brythonic languages]] of the \"ancient Britons\" or [[Old Welsh]] speakers and other language groups.<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm General survey of Lothian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925082819/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}</ref>\n\n[[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Viking]] kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], [[Wessex]], and [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] amalgamated, leading to the formation of [[Scotland]], and [[England]]. [[Wales]] was sometimes united under princes or kings such as [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]]. Between 854 and 1171, a kingship of Ireland was established by kings of the regional kingdoms such as [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac M\u00e1ele Ruanaid]], [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]], [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]], and [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]], something not achieved in Britain until 1707. In subsequent [[Norman Ireland]], local lords gained considerable autonomy from the [[Lordship of Ireland]] until it became the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] under direct English rule.\n\n===Renaissance mapmakers===\n[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - INSULAE ALBION ET HIBERNIA - Old Great Britain.jpg|thumb|right|The 1654 Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, ''Insulae Albion Et Hibernia'']]\n[[Abraham Ortelius]] makes clear his understanding that England, Scotland and Ireland were politically separate in 1570  by the full title of his map: ''Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio'' ('A representation of England, Scotland and Ireland, or the Britannic islands'). [[George Lily]]'s 1546 map divides Britain into the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, with Ireland alongside. Some maps from this period also appear to mark Wales, and sometimes Cornwall, as separate areas within Britain, while the history of England created by [[Polydore Vergil]]<ref>Map Collectors' Series, Issue 9, Map Collectors' Circle, 1972.</ref> for [[Henry VIII]] states, \"The whole country of Britain is divided into four parts, whereof the one is inhabited by Englishmen, the other of Scots, the third Welshmen and the fourth of Cornish people.\"<ref>Thomas Kingston Derry, Michael G.

This archaic term was originally used by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] to mean the island of Great Britain. In later centuries its meaning changed to refer only to the area we now call Scotland (''Albany'', or ''[[Alba]]'' in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]). ''Albion'' has survived as a poetic name for Britain but it is not in everyday use.\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n[[File:Moll - The north part of Great Britain called Scotland.png|thumb|A 1726 map showing \"The north part of Great Britain called Scotland\"]]\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], a fashion arose, particularly in Scotland, for referring to Scotland and England as ''[[North Britain]]'' and ''[[South Britain]]'' respectively. These terms gained in popularity during the 19th century. The most lasting example of this usage was in the name of the [[North British Railway]], which became part of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] in 1923, and in the name of the North British Hotel, built by the railway in [[Edinburgh]] in 1902, which retained the name until it reopened in 1991 as the Balmoral Hotel.\n\n===Evolution of kingdoms and states===\n[[File:Nations of the UK.png|400px|thumb|right|A timeline of [[Sovereign state|states]] in the British Isles. (''Ireland'' continues to exist, but the description \"Republic of Ireland\" is used as a disambiguator in this case).]]\nThe diagram on the right gives an indication of the further evolution of kingdoms and states. In 1603 the [[Scottish King]] [[James I of England|James VI]] inherited the [[English throne]] as \"James I of England\". He styled himself as ''James I of Great Britain'', although both states retained their sovereignty and independent parliaments, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. (The term \"Great Britain\" itself reportedly dates from as early as 1474, and was in common usage from the mid-16th century onwards.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalstyle_uk.htm Royal Styles and Titles in England and Great Britain], heraldica.org</ref>)\n\nThe 1707 [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] united England and Scotland in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], then in 1800 Ireland was brought under British government control by the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Irish unrest culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]] and the 1922 separation of the [[Irish Free State]], which later became a republic with the name Ireland. The majority Protestant [[Northern Ireland|northeast]] continued to be part of what became the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].\n\n[[British overseas territories]] such as [[Bermuda]], [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] have various relationships with the UK. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]], initially formalised in 1931 (the British Commonwealth until 1949), is an association of independent states roughly corresponding to the former [[British Empire]]. (This has no connection with the [[Commonwealth of England]], a short-lived [[republic]] replacing the previous kingdoms during the [[English Interregnum]] (1649\u20131660).)\n\n==Adjectives==\nThe [[adjectives]] used to describe the contents and attributes of the various constituent parts of the British Isles also cause confusion.\n\nIn the absence of a single adjective to refer to the [[United Kingdom]], ''British'' is generally used to refer to the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole. However, in a specifically physical geographical sense, ''British'' is used to refer to the island of [[Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=British|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/british?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>  The adjectival phrase ''Great British'' is very rarely used to refer to [[Great Britain]], other than to contrive a [[pun]] on the word ''great'', as in \"Great British Food\".\n\n''Irish'', refers to people or a characteristic \"of Ireland\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Irish|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/irish?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>  As such, its meaning is contextual on the meaning of \"Ireland\" being used: it can relate both to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish state]], and to the [[Ireland (island)|island of Ireland]]. [[Northern Ireland]], as a constituent part of the [[United Kingdom]], can thus be both ''British'' or ''Irish'', reflected in the ability  for residents of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|title=British-Irish Agreement|date=12 December 2011|url=http://www.britishirishcouncil.org/about/british-irish-agreement|publisher=British-Irish|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref> In order to be more specific, ''Northern Irish'' is therefore in common usage. Members of the [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist]] communities would not describe themselves as ''British'' and would only use the terms ''Irish'', or specifically ''Northern Irish'' where needed.\n\nThe term ''Ulster'' can also be used as an adjective (e.g. \"[[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]\"), but this is more likely to be used by [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] and has political connotations in the same fashion as its use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of [[Ulster]], namely [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], are included in Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] forming part of the Republic).  The term ''Ulsterman'' (or ''Ulsterwoman'') is common and holds no such political connotation. Likewise, [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] might describe, say, a lake in Northern Ireland as ''Irish''.\n\nNote that the geographical term [[Irish Sea]] thus far appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial control of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of Ireland and the UK, and also includes a British [[Crown dependency]], the [[Isle of Man]]\u2014as yet there appears to be no controversy with the term\u2019s usage to mirror that of \"British Isles\". The \"Northern\" in \"Northern Ireland\" is not completely accurate.  The most northerly point on the island, [[Malin Head]], is in the Republic of Ireland\u2014in [[County Donegal]]'s [[Inishowen]] Peninsula.\n\n==Problems with use of terms==\n\n===British Isles===\n{{Main|British Isles naming dispute}}\n\nThe dictionary definition of [[British Isles]] is that it is a geographical term that refers to the whole of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] as well as the surrounding islands. It is sometimes incorrectly used as if identical to the UK;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} or to refer to [[Great Britain]] and the surrounding islands, excluding the island of [[Ireland]] entirely.<ref>\"[http://www.megalithics.com/] Website on Megalithic Monuments in the British Isles and Ireland.

In [[Germany]], the term \"England\" is often used to mean Great Britain or even the entire United Kingdom. In many other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, the word for \"English\" is synonymous with \"British\"\u2014see the article on [[Alternative words for British#Other languages|Alternative words for British]] for more detail.\n\n===Europe===\nThe term \"[[Europe]]\" may be used in one of several different contexts by British and Irish people: either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to [[Mainland Europe]], sometimes called \"continental Europe\" or simply \"the Continent\" by some people in the archipelago. ''Europe'' may also be used in reference to the [[European Union]] (or, historically, to the [[European Economic Community]]). A comedic treatment of the different uses of this word appears in an episode of the BBC sitcom ''[[To the Manor Born]]''. When tradesmen are taking measurements in metric, and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton objects on the grounds that the house was built \"in feet and inches\", a tradesman says \"We're in Europe now\", referring to the European Economic Community. Audrey fforbes-Hamilton retorts \"Well you may be, but I'm staying here!\" - implying that to her, the word \"Europe\" referred only to mainland Europe, excluding Britain and Ireland.\n\n===Great Britain===\n\nThe word \"Great\" means \"larger\", in comparison with [[Brittany]] in modern-day [[France]].  One historical term for the [[peninsula]] in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is ''Lesser'' or ''Little Britain''.  That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migration into Britain, and named \"Little Britain\" by them. The [[French language|French]] term \"Bretagne\" now refers to the French \"Little Britain\", not to the British \"Great Britain\", which in French is called ''Grande-Bretagne''. In classical times, the [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] geographer [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' also called the larger island ''megale Brettania'' (great Britain). At that time, it was in contrast to the smaller island of [[Ireland]], which he called ''mikra Brettania'' (little Britain).<ref>{{cite book|title=Claudii Ptolemaei Opera quae exstant omnia|author=Claudius Ptolemy|authorlink=Ptolemy|editor1-last=Heiberg|editor1-first=J.L.|publisher=in aedibus B.G.Teubneri|location=Leipzig|date=1898|volume=vol.1 Syntaxis Mathematica|chapter-url=http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/HeibergAlmagestComplete.pdf|pages=112\u2013113|chapter=\u1f1d\u03ba\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f30\u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd: \u03ba\u03b2', \u03ba\u03b5'}}</ref> In his later work ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as ''Albion'' and to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iwernia]]''.

However, its convolution and impracticality due to implying inclusion of fellow North Atlantic islands such as Iceland have made it unworkable and it has not come into common use. The term was used as part of the Strand 3 level of negotiations for the Belfast agreement.

Some older slang names for Britons are ''Tommy'' (for British soldiers) and ''Anglo''. [[Anglo]] properly refers only to England, but it is sometimes used as a broader reference as an element in compound adjectives: for example, \"Anglo-French relations\" may be used in newspaper articles when referring to relations between the political entities [[France]] and the United Kingdom. ''Anglo-Saxon'' may be used (particularly in Continental European languages) when referring to the whole [[English-speaking world]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main|Names of the Irish state}}\n[[File:Republic of Ireland.svg|left|80px]]\n[[File:Eirepas.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|An Irish passport]]\nSince the adoption of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] in 1937, '''[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]''' has been the [[English (language)|English]] name of the state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of [[Ireland]]. The name '''[[\u00c9ire]]''' is used when writing in [[Irish (language)|Irish]].\n\nSince the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948]], the term \"Republic of Ireland\" is the term used as the additional ''description'' of the state. This term is useful in avoiding ambiguity between the name of the island and the name of the state.  However, the term \"Ireland\" is always used in formal diplomatic contexts such as the [[European Union]] or the [[United Nations]]. The passport of the Republic of Ireland bears the name ''\u00c9ire \u2013 Ireland''.\n\nBefore the introduction of the 1937 constitution and the new name, the [[Irish Free State]] occupied the same territory as the modern state of Ireland. The Irish Free State became an autonomous [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]] in 1922 when it seceded from the United Kingdom through the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. The King ceased to be its Head of State [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|in 1936]] and the state ceased to be a Dominion and left the Commonwealth [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|in 1948]].\n\nTraditionally, the island of Ireland is divided into four [[Provinces of Ireland|province]]s \u2013 [[Leinster]], [[Connacht]], [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]], with each of the provinces further divided into counties. The Republic of Ireland takes up 83% of the island, twenty-six of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland. Northern Ireland takes up the remaining area, six of the traditional nine counties of Ulster.\n\nOn the island of Ireland the naming of places often raises political issues. The usage of \"Ireland\" as the [[Constitution of Ireland|official name]] of the state causes offence to some [[unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] in [[Northern Ireland]], who believe it implies that the state [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|still]] has a territorial claim to the whole island \u2013 the terminology of \"Republic of Ireland\" or \"[[\u00c9ire]]\" is much preferred by Northern Irish unionists when referring to that political state. Similarly, some [[Nationalists (Ireland)|Nationalists]] in Northern Ireland also prefer to reserve the usage of \"Ireland\" to refer to the whole island.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Irishness is a highly contested identity, with fundamentally different perceptions of national identity between unionists (who generally perceive themselves as being British) and nationalists (who generally consider both communities to be part of the Irish nation).<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/dd/report7/report7c.htm CAIN: Democratic Dialogue: With all due respect \u2013 pluralism and parity of esteem (Report No. 7)] by Tom Hennessey and Robin Wilson, Democratic Dialogue (1997)</ref>\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is often referred to by the [[Irish nationalists|Nationalist]] and [[Irish Republicans|Republican]] communities by the term \"the Twenty-six Counties\", with the connotation that the state constituted as such forms only a portion of the ideal political unit of the [[Irish Republic]], which would consist of all of the [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] into which the island is divided.  The term \"the Six Counties\" (of Northern Ireland) is also used. Other Nationalist terms in use include \"the North of Ireland\" and \"the North\". These latter are terms also used by the Irish national broadcaster [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  More extreme terms for Northern Ireland include \"the occupied six counties\" or \"occupied Ireland\", which are often used by people who reject the idea of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe [[Irish passport]] is available to Irish citizens and can also be applied for abroad through Irish Consular services and the local Irish Embassy. As per the [[Irish nationality law]], any person born on the island of Ireland before 2005, or otherwise a first generation descendant of such a person, is allowed to apply for an Irish passport. As such, people born in Northern Ireland and their children may be Irish citizens and hold an Irish passport if they choose.\n\n===British Islands===\n{{main|British Islands}}\n[[File:British Islands.svg|left|80px]]\n[[File:Jersey passport new.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A Jersey passport]]\nUnder the [[Interpretation Act 1978]] of the United Kingdom, the legal term [[British Islands]] (as opposed to the geographical term ''British Isles'') refers to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], together with the [[Crown dependencies]]: the [[Bailiwick]]s of [[Jersey]] and of [[Guernsey]] (which in turn includes the smaller islands of [[Alderney]], [[Herm]] and [[Sark]]) in the [[Channel Islands]]; and the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nSpecial British passports are issued to citizens of the Crown dependencies. On the front of passports issued to residents of the Crown dependencies, the words ''\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\"'' are replaced with ''\"British Islands\"'' followed by the name of the issuing state or island. This design applies to [[Jersey passport]], [[Guernsey passport]] and [[Isle of Man passport]].  Pre-[[Brexit]], Crown dependency also bore the title ''\"European Union\"'' for border control purposes, like UK passports. Crown dependency citizens who have no family ties to the United Kingdom were granted a special limited 'Islander Status' under EU law (article 6 of Protocol 3 in the [[Treaty of Accession 1972|Treaty of Accession of the UK to the European Community]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status|title=What is Islander status?  |year=2013  |website=States of Guernsey  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007233859/http://www.gov.gg/article/2822/What-is-Islander-status  |archivedate= 7 October 2013  |url-status=dead  |accessdate=8 December 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jersey|first1=States of |title=Islander status and your right to live and work in Europe|url=https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|website=www.gov.je|accessdate=8 December 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171208112536/https://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/ApplyFirstAdult/Pages/islanderstatus.aspx|archivedate=8 December 2017 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Historical aspects==\n{{Further|Britain (name)}}\nSome suggest an early known  for the term might be  from [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writings.

Nevertheless, Roman administration later incorporated the province of Britannia into the [[praetorian prefecture of Gaul]], in common with Hispania, which had Celtiberians. [[Armorica]], where the Bretons would settle{{when|date=June 2014}}, was part of ''Gallia Celtica'', so there were tertiary relations between the Britons and Gallic Celts at least. In addition, the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] of Gallia Celtica are thought to have founded Aldborough in Britain. [[Belgae]] and [[Silures]] also came from Gallic areas, although not strictly \"Celtic\", but from ''Gallia Belgica'' and ''Aquitainia''.\n\n''Priteni'' is the source of the [[Welsh language]] term [[Prydain]], ''Britain'',<ref name=ohi/> and has the same source as the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] term [[Cruithne (people)|Cruithne]].

Throughout Book 4 of his ''Geography'', [[Strabo]] is consistent in spelling the island Britain (transliterated) as ''Prettanik\u0113''; he uses the terms ''Prettans'' or ''Brettans'' loosely to refer to the islands as a group \u2013 a common generalisation used by classical geographers. For example, in Geography 2.1.18, ''\u2026\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd \u03b2\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03bd'' (\"\u2026the most southern of the Brettans are further north than this\").<ref name=\"Roseman\">Translation by Roseman, ''op.cit.''</ref> He was writing around AD 10, although the earliest surviving copy of his work dates from the 6th century.\n[[Pliny the Elder]] writing around AD 70 uses a Latin version of the same terminology in section 4.102 of his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]''. He writes of Great Britain: ''Albion ipsi nomen fuit, cum Britanniae vocarentur omnes de quibus mox paulo dicemus.'' (\"Albion was its own name, when all [the islands] were called the Britannias; I will speak of them in a moment\"). In the following section, 4.103, Pliny enumerates the islands he considers to make up the Britannias, listing Great Britain, Ireland, and many smaller islands.\nIn his ''Geography'' written in the mid 2nd century and probably describing the position around AD 100,<ref name=ohi/> [[Ptolemy]] includes both Great Britain (Albion) and Ireland ([[Hibernia|Iwernia]]) in the so called ''Bretanic'' island group.

With the visit of [[Hadrian]] in AD 121 coins introduced a female figure with the label <small>BRITANNIA</small> as a personification or goddess of the place.

The earliest [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] source to use a collective term for the archipelago is the ''[[Life of Saint Columba]]'', a [[hagiography]] recording the missionary activities of the sixth century Irish monk [[Saint Columba]] among the peoples of what is now Scotland. It was written in the late seventh century by [[Adomn\u00e1n of Iona|Adomn\u00e1n]] of [[Iona]], an Irish monk living on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is '''Oceani Insulae''' meaning \"Islands of the Ocean\" (Book 2, 46 in the Sharpe edition = Book 2, 47 in Reeves edition), it is used sparingly and no ''Priteni''-derived collective reference is made.\n\nAnother early native source to use a collective term is the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' of [[Bede]] written in the early eighth century. The collective term for the archipelago used within this work is ''insularum'' meaning \"islands\" (Book 1, 8) and it too is used sparingly. He stated that Britain \"studies and confesses one and the same knowledge of the highest truth in the tongues of five nations, namely the Angles, the Britons, the Scots, the Picts, and the Latins\", distinguishing between the [[Brythonic languages]] of the \"ancient Britons\" or [[Old Welsh]] speakers and other language groups.<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm General survey of Lothian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925082819/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/institutes/sassi/spns/watsloth.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}</ref>\n\n[[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Viking]] kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], [[Wessex]], and [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] amalgamated, leading to the formation of [[Scotland]], and [[England]]. [[Wales]] was sometimes united under princes or kings such as [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]]. Between 854 and 1171, a kingship of Ireland was established by kings of the regional kingdoms such as [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac M\u00e1ele Ruanaid]], [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]], [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]], and [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]], something not achieved in Britain until 1707. In subsequent [[Norman Ireland]], local lords gained considerable autonomy from the [[Lordship of Ireland]] until it became the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] under direct English rule.\n\n===Renaissance mapmakers===\n[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - INSULAE ALBION ET HIBERNIA - Old Great Britain.jpg|thumb|right|The 1654 Blaeu Atlas of Scotland, ''Insulae Albion Et Hibernia'']]\n[[Abraham Ortelius]] makes clear his understanding that England, Scotland and Ireland were politically separate in 1570  by the full title of his map: ''Angliae, Scotiae et Hiberniae, sive Britannicar. insularum descriptio'' ('A representation of England, Scotland and Ireland, or the Britannic islands'). [[George Lily]]'s 1546 map divides Britain into the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, with Ireland alongside. Some maps from this period also appear to mark Wales, and sometimes Cornwall, as separate areas within Britain, while the history of England created by [[Polydore Vergil]]<ref>Map Collectors' Series, Issue 9, Map Collectors' Circle, 1972.</ref> for [[Henry VIII]] states, \"The whole country of Britain is divided into four parts, whereof the one is inhabited by Englishmen, the other of Scots, the third Welshmen and the fourth of Cornish people.\"<ref>Thomas Kingston Derry, Michael G.

This archaic term was originally used by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] to mean the island of Great Britain. In later centuries its meaning changed to refer only to the area we now call Scotland (''Albany'', or ''[[Alba]]'' in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]). ''Albion'' has survived as a poetic name for Britain but it is not in everyday use.\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n[[File:Moll - The north part of Great Britain called Scotland.png|thumb|A 1726 map showing \"The north part of Great Britain called Scotland\"]]\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], a fashion arose, particularly in Scotland, for referring to Scotland and England as ''[[North Britain]]'' and ''[[South Britain]]'' respectively. These terms gained in popularity during the 19th century. The most lasting example of this usage was in the name of the [[North British Railway]], which became part of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] in 1923, and in the name of the North British Hotel, built by the railway in [[Edinburgh]] in 1902, which retained the name until it reopened in 1991 as the Balmoral Hotel.\n\n===Evolution of kingdoms and states===\n[[File:Nations of the UK.png|400px|thumb|right|A timeline of [[Sovereign state|states]] in the British Isles. (''Ireland'' continues to exist, but the description \"Republic of Ireland\" is used as a disambiguator in this case).]]\nThe diagram on the right gives an indication of the further evolution of kingdoms and states. In 1603 the [[Scottish King]] [[James I of England|James VI]] inherited the [[English throne]] as \"James I of England\". He styled himself as ''James I of Great Britain'', although both states retained their sovereignty and independent parliaments, the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. (The term \"Great Britain\" itself reportedly dates from as early as 1474, and was in common usage from the mid-16th century onwards.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalstyle_uk.htm Royal Styles and Titles in England and Great Britain], heraldica.org</ref>)\n\nThe 1707 [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] united England and Scotland in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], then in 1800 Ireland was brought under British government control by the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Irish unrest culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]] and the 1922 separation of the [[Irish Free State]], which later became a republic with the name Ireland. The majority Protestant [[Northern Ireland|northeast]] continued to be part of what became the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].\n\n[[British overseas territories]] such as [[Bermuda]], [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Falkland Islands]] have various relationships with the UK. The [[Commonwealth of Nations]], initially formalised in 1931 (the British Commonwealth until 1949), is an association of independent states roughly corresponding to the former [[British Empire]]. (This has no connection with the [[Commonwealth of England]], a short-lived [[republic]] replacing the previous kingdoms during the [[English Interregnum]] (1649\u20131660).)\n\n==Adjectives==\nThe [[adjectives]] used to describe the contents and attributes of the various constituent parts of the British Isles also cause confusion.\n\nIn the absence of a single adjective to refer to the [[United Kingdom]], ''British'' is generally used to refer to the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole. However, in a specifically physical geographical sense, ''British'' is used to refer to the island of [[Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=British|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/british?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>  The adjectival phrase ''Great British'' is very rarely used to refer to [[Great Britain]], other than to contrive a [[pun]] on the word ''great'', as in \"Great British Food\".\n\n''Irish'', refers to people or a characteristic \"of Ireland\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Irish|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/irish?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>  As such, its meaning is contextual on the meaning of \"Ireland\" being used: it can relate both to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish state]], and to the [[Ireland (island)|island of Ireland]]. [[Northern Ireland]], as a constituent part of the [[United Kingdom]], can thus be both ''British'' or ''Irish'', reflected in the ability  for residents of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|title=British-Irish Agreement|url=http://www.britishirishcouncil.org/about/british-irish-agreement|publisher=British-Irish|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref> In order to be more specific, ''Northern Irish'' is therefore in common usage. Members of the [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist]] communities would not describe themselves as ''British'' and would only use the terms ''Irish'', or specifically ''Northern Irish'' where needed.\n\nThe term ''Ulster'' can also be used as an adjective (e.g. \"[[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]\"), but this is more likely to be used by [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]] and has political connotations in the same fashion as its use as a proper noun (because only six of the traditional nine counties of [[Ulster]], namely [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], are included in Northern Ireland with the remaining three counties [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] forming part of the Republic).  The term ''Ulsterman'' (or ''Ulsterwoman'') is common and holds no such political connotation. Likewise, [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] might describe, say, a lake in Northern Ireland as ''Irish''.\n\nNote that the geographical term [[Irish Sea]] thus far appears to have escaped political connotations, even though territorial control of the waters of the Irish Sea is divided between both the Republic of Ireland and the UK, and also includes a British [[Crown dependency]], the [[Isle of Man]]\u2014as yet there appears to be no controversy with the term\u2019s usage to mirror that of \"British Isles\". The \"Northern\" in \"Northern Ireland\" is not completely accurate.  The most northerly point on the island, [[Malin Head]], is in the Republic of Ireland\u2014in [[County Donegal]]'s [[Inishowen]] Peninsula.\n\n==Problems with use of terms==\n\n===British Isles===\n{{Main|British Isles naming dispute}}\n\nThe dictionary definition of [[British Isles]] is that it is a geographical term that refers to the whole of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] as well as the surrounding islands.

In [[Germany]], the term \"England\" is often used to mean Great Britain or even the entire United Kingdom. In many other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean, the word for \"English\" is synonymous with \"British\"\u2014see the article on [[Alternative words for British#Other languages|Alternative words for British]] for more detail.\n\n===Europe===\nThe term \"[[Europe]]\" may be used in one of several different contexts by British and Irish people: either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to [[Mainland Europe]], sometimes called \"continental Europe\" or simply \"the Continent\" by some people in the archipelago. ''Europe'' may also be used in reference to the [[European Union]] (or, historically, to the [[European Economic Community]]). A comedic treatment of the different uses of this word appears in an episode of the BBC sitcom ''[[To the Manor Born]]''. When tradesmen are taking measurements in metric, and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton objects on the grounds that the house was built \"in feet and inches\", a tradesman says \"We're in Europe now\", referring to the European Economic Community. Audrey fforbes-Hamilton retorts \"Well you may be, but I'm staying here!\" - implying that to her, the word \"Europe\" referred only to mainland Europe, excluding Britain and Ireland.\n\n===Great Britain===\n\nThe word \"Great\" means \"larger\", in comparison with [[Brittany]] in modern-day [[France]].  One historical term for the [[peninsula]] in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is ''Lesser'' or ''Little Britain''.  That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migration into Britain, and named \"Little Britain\" by them. The [[French language|French]] term \"Bretagne\" now refers to the French \"Little Britain\", not to the British \"Great Britain\", which in French is called ''Grande-Bretagne''. In classical times, the [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] geographer [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' also called the larger island ''megale Brettania'' (great Britain). At that time, it was in contrast to the smaller island of [[Ireland]], which he called ''mikra Brettania'' (little Britain).<ref>{{cite book|title=Claudii Ptolemaei Opera quae exstant omnia|author=Claudius Ptolemy|authorlink=Ptolemy|editor1-last=Heiberg|editor1-first=J.L.|publisher=in aedibus B.G.Teubneri|location=Leipzig|date=1898|volume=vol.1 Syntaxis Mathematica|chapter-url=http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/HeibergAlmagestComplete.pdf|pages=112\u2013113|chapter=\u1f1d\u03ba\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f30\u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd: \u03ba\u03b2', \u03ba\u03b5'}}</ref> In his later work ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as ''Albion'' and to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iwernia]]''.

It originates from NBC's bureau in [[Washington, D.C.]] ([[WRC-TV]]).\n\nThe longevity of ''Meet the Press'' is attributable in part to the fact that the program debuted during what was only the second official \"network television season\" for American television. It was the first [[live television]] [[network news]] program on which a sitting [[President of the United States]] appeared; this occurred on the November 9, 1975, broadcast, which featured [[Gerald Ford]].\n\nThe program has been hosted by 12 different [[Discussion moderator|moderators]] to date, beginning with creator [[Martha Rountree]]. The show's moderator since 2014 is [[Chuck Todd]], who also serves as political director for [[NBC News]].<ref name=\"nbcnews1\">{{cite web|title=Chuck Todd Takes Helm of 'Meet the Press'|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chuck-todd-takes-helm-meet-press-n180916 |publisher=NBC News|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the hour-long program airs in most markets on Sundays at 9:00 a.m. live in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere. ''Meet the Press'' is also occasionally pre-empted due to network coverage of sports events held outside the U.S. The program is also rebroadcast on Sundays at 2:00 p.m., and Mondays at 2:00 a.m., and sometimes 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time on [[MSNBC]], whose audio feed is also [[simulcast]] on [[Sirius/XM Satellite Radio]]. The program is also [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] by [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]] to various radio stations around the United States, as well as on [[WCSP-FM|C-SPAN Radio]] as part of its replays of the Sunday morning talk shows.\n\n==Format==\nThe program's format consists of an extended one-on-one interview with the host, and is sometimes followed by a roundtable discussion or one-on-two interview with figures in adversarial positions, either Congressional members from opposite sides of the aisle or political commentators. Originally a half-hour program for most of its history, the show expanded to 60 minutes starting with the September 20, 1992, broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorable Tim Russert moments|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/11076.html|author=David Paul Kuhn|publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref>\n\nThe program also features in-depth examinations of facts behind political and general news stories (particularly as part of a segment called the \"Data Download\", introduced after Chuck Todd assumed duties as moderator, which is conducted on a [[touchscreen]] within the main set).\n\n==History==\n[[File:meetthepress110975.jpg|right|thumb|''Meet the Press'' set, November 1975.

Its first guest was [[James Farley]], who served as [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman and campaign manager to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] under the first two terms of the [[New Deal]] Administration.

The next week, [[Bill Monroe (journalist)|Bill Monroe]], previously a weekly panelist like Spivak had been years before, took over as moderator and stayed until June 2, 1984.\n\nFor the next seven and a half years, the program then went through a series of hosts as it struggled in the ratings against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with David Brinkley]]''. [[Roger Mudd]] and [[Marvin Kalb]], as co-moderators, followed Monroe for a year, followed by [[Chris Wallace]] (who would later to go on to a much longer run as host of the rival program ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'') from 1987 to 1988. [[Garrick Utley]], then hosting ''[[Weekend Today]]'', concurrently hosted ''Meet the Press'' from 1989 through December 1, 1991. All this occurred despite the increasing ratings of NBC News' other programs (and those of the network generally) during that period. The program originally aired at noon Eastern Time every Sunday, before moving to a 9:00 a.m. slot by the early 1990s.\n\n===Under Russert===\n[[File:Tv nbc meet the press with tim russert logo.jpg|thumb|right|''Meet the Press'' logo used from September 10, 1995 to June 8, 2008.]]\n[[File:US Navy 060305-F-0193C-009 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Marine Corps, Gen.

It originates from NBC's bureau in [[Washington, D.C.]] ([[WRC-TV]]).\n\nThe longevity of ''Meet the Press'' is attributable in part to the fact that the program debuted during what was only the second official \"network television season\" for American television. It was the first [[live television]] [[network news]] program on which a sitting [[President of the United States]] appeared; this occurred on the November 9, 1975, broadcast, which featured [[Gerald Ford]].\n\nThe program has been hosted by 12 different [[Discussion moderator|moderators]] to date, beginning with creator [[Martha Rountree]].

''Meet the Press'' is also occasionally pre-empted due to network coverage of sports events held outside the U.S. The program is also rebroadcast on Sundays at 2:00 p.m., and Mondays at 2:00 a.m., and sometimes 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time on [[MSNBC]], whose audio feed is also [[simulcast]] on [[Sirius/XM Satellite Radio]].

Originally a half-hour program for most of its history, the show expanded to 60 minutes starting with the September 20, 1992, broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorable Tim Russert moments|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0608/11076.html|author=David Paul Kuhn|publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-06-14}}</ref>\n\nThe program also features in-depth examinations of facts behind political and general news stories (particularly as part of a segment called the \"Data Download\", introduced after Chuck Todd assumed duties as moderator, which is conducted on a [[touchscreen]] within the main set).\n\n==History==\n[[File:meetthepress110975.jpg|right|thumb|''Meet the Press'' set, November 1975.

The next week, [[Bill Monroe (journalist)|Bill Monroe]], previously a weekly panelist like Spivak had been years before, took over as moderator and stayed until June 2, 1984.\n\nFor the next seven and a half years, the program then went through a series of hosts as it struggled in the ratings against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with David Brinkley]]''. [[Roger Mudd]] and [[Marvin Kalb]], as co-moderators, followed Monroe for a year, followed by [[Chris Wallace]] (who would later to go on to a much longer run as host of the rival program ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'') from 1987 to 1988. [[Garrick Utley]], then hosting ''[[Weekend Today]]'', concurrently hosted ''Meet the Press'' from 1989 through December 1, 1991. All this occurred despite the increasing ratings of NBC News' other programs (and those of the network generally) during that period.
