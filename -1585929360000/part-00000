While pop-ups appear only when audiences are on the site they belong to, push messages are independent of sites. They are associated with web browsers and apps. \n\n'''Push technology''', or '''server push''', is a style of [[Internet]]-based communication where the request for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central [[server (computing)|server]]. It is contrasted with [[pull technology|pull]]/get, where the request for the transmission of information is initiated by the receiver or [[client (computing)|client]].\n\nPush services are often based on information preferences expressed in advance. This is called a [[publish/subscribe]] model. A client \"subscribes\" to various information \"channels\" provided by a server; whenever new content is available on one of those channels, the server pushes that information out to the client.\n\nPush is sometimes emulated with a [[polling (computer science)|polling]] technique, particularly under circumstances where a real push is not possible, such as sites with security policies that require rejection of incoming HTTP/S requests.\n\n== General use ==\n[[Synchronous conferencing]] and [[instant messaging]] are typical examples of push services. Chat messages and sometimes [[Computer file|files]] are pushed to the user as soon as they are received by the messaging service. Both decentralised [[peer-to-peer]] programs (such as [[WASTE]]) and centralised programs (such as [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] or [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]]) allow pushing files, which means the sender initiates the data transfer rather than the recipient.\n\n[[Email]] may also be a push system: [[SMTP]] is a push protocol (see [[Push e-mail]]). However, the last step\u2014from mail server to desktop computer\u2014typically uses a pull protocol like [[POP3]] or [[IMAP]]. Modern e-mail clients make this step seem instantaneous by repeatedly [[polling (computer science)|polling]] the mail server, frequently checking it for new mail. The IMAP protocol includes the [[IMAP IDLE|IDLE]] command, which allows the server to tell the client when new messages arrive. The original [[BlackBerry]] was the first popular example of push-email in a wireless context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAnother example is the [[PointCast (dotcom)|PointCast Network]], which was widely covered in the 1990s. It delivered news and stock market data as a screensaver. Both [[Netscape]] and [[Microsoft]] integrated push technology through the [[Channel Definition Format]] (CDF) into their software at the height of the [[browser wars]], but it was never very popular. CDF faded away and was removed from the browsers of the time, replaced in the 2000s with [[RSS]] (a pull system.)\n\nOther uses of push-enabled [[web application]]s include software updates distribution (\"push updates\"), market data distribution (stock tickers), online chat/messaging systems ([[webchat]]), auctions, online betting and gaming, sport results, monitoring consoles, and [[sensor network]] monitoring.\n\n== Examples ==\n===Webpush===\n\nThe Webpush proposal of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] is a simple protocol using [[HTTP/2|HTTP version 2]] to deliver realtime events, such as incoming calls or messages, which can be delivered (or \u201cpushed\u201d) in a timely fashion. The protocol consolidates all [[Real-time computing|real-time]] events into a single session which ensures more efficient use of network and radio resources.  A single service consolidates all events, distributing those events to applications as they arrive.  This requires just one session, avoiding duplicated overhead costs.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Generic Event Delivery Using HTTP Push |author= M. Thomson, E. Damaggio and B.

A notification allows alerting the user outside the context of a web page of an occurrence, such as the delivery of email.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Web Notifications |url= https://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/}}</ref> As part of this standard Push API defined by W3C, is now being implemented by Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Web Push API |url= https://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/}}</ref>\n\n=== HTTP server push ===\nHTTP server push (also known as HTTP streaming) is a mechanism for sending unsolicited (asynchronous) data from a [[web server]] to a [[web browser]]. HTTP server push can be achieved through any of several mechanisms.\n\nAs a part of HTML5 the [[WebSocket]] API allows a web server and client to communicate over a [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]] TCP connection.\n\nGenerally the web server does not terminate a connection after response data has been served to a client. The web server leaves the connection open so that if an event occurs (for example, a change in internal data which needs to be reported to one or multiple clients), it can be sent out immediately; otherwise, the event would have to be queued until the client's next request is received. Most web servers offer this functionality via [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] (e.g., Non-Parsed Headers scripts on [[Apache HTTP Server]]). The underlying mechanism for this approach is [[chunked transfer encoding]].\n\nAnother mechanism is related to a special [[MIME]] type called <code>[[MIME#Mixed-Replace|multipart/x-mixed-replace]]</code>, which was introduced by [[Netscape]] in 1995. Web browsers interpret this as a document that changes whenever the server pushes a new version to the client.<ref>[http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/cgi/ch06_06.html CGI Programming on the World Wide Web] O'Reilly book explaining how to use Netscape server-push</ref> It is still supported by [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] today, but it is ignored by [[Internet Explorer]]<ref>[http://victor.transformadora.com/Oreilly/wdesign/xhtml/ch13_03.htm Server-Push Documents (HTML & XHTML: The Definitive Guide)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417004248/http://victor.transformadora.com/Oreilly/wdesign/xhtml/ch13_03.htm |date=2008-04-17 }} O'Reilly book explaining server-push</ref> and is only partially supported by [[Google Chrome]].<ref>[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=249132 Remove support for multipart/x-mixed-replace main resources]</ref> It can be applied to [[HTML]] documents, and also for streaming images in [[webcam]] applications.\n\nThe [[WHATWG]] Web Applications 1.0 proposal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#scs-server-sent|title=Web Applications 1.0 specification}}</ref> includes a mechanism to push content to the client. On September 1, 2006, the Opera web browser implemented this new experimental system in a feature called \"[[Server-sent events|Server-Sent Events]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/WebApplications/blog/show.dml/438711|accessdate=2007-03-23|date=2006-09-01|title=Event Streaming to Web Browsers}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://operawatch.com/news/2006/09/opera-takes-the-lead-with-ajax-support-among-browsers-more-efficient-streaming.html|accessdate=2007-03-23|date=2006-09-01|title=Opera takes the lead with AJAX support among browsers: More efficient streaming|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318013327/http://operawatch.com/news/2006/09/opera-takes-the-lead-with-ajax-support-among-browsers-more-efficient-streaming.html|archivedate=2007-03-18}}</ref> It is now being standardized as part of [[HTML5]].<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/ Server-Sent Events]</ref>\n\n=== Pushlet ===\nIn this technique, the server takes advantage of [[HTTP persistent connection|persistent HTTP connections]], leaving the response perpetually \"open\" (i.e., the server never terminates the response), effectively fooling the browser to remain in \"loading\" mode after the initial page load could be considered complete. The server then periodically sends snippets of JavaScript to update the content of the page, thereby achieving push capability. By using this technique, the client doesn't need [[Java applet]]s or other plug-ins in order to keep an open connection to the server; the client is automatically notified about new events, pushed by the server.<ref>[http://www.pushlets.com/doc/whitepaper-toc.html Pushlets introduction]</ref><ref>[http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-2000/jw-03-pushlet.html JavaWorld article about pushlets]\n</ref> One serious drawback to this method, however, is the lack of control the server has over the browser timing out; a page refresh is always necessary if a timeout occurs on the browser end.\n\n{{[[]]}}=== Long polling ===\nLong polling is itself not a true push; long polling is a variation of the traditional [[polling (computer science)|polling]] technique, but it allows emulating a push mechanism under circumstances where a real push is not possible, such as sites with security policies that require rejection of incoming HTTP/S Requests.\n\nWith long polling, the client requests information from the server exactly as in normal polling, but with the expectation the server may not respond immediately. If the server has no new information for the client when the poll is received, instead of sending an empty response, the server holds the request open and waits for response information to become available. Once it does have new information, the server immediately sends an HTTP/S response to the client, completing the open HTTP/S Request.  Upon receipt of the server response, the client often immediately issues another server request.  In this way the usual response latency (the time between when the information first becomes available and the next client request) otherwise associated with polling clients is eliminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6202#section-2.1|accessdate=2016-05-14|title=RFC6202 - Known Issues and Best Practices for the Use of Long Polling and Streaming in Bidirectional HTTP}}</ref>\n\nFor example, [[BOSH (protocol)|BOSH]] is a popular, long-lived HTTP technique used as a long-polling alternative to a continuous TCP connection when such a connection is difficult or impossible to employ directly (e.g., in a web browser);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html#intro|accessdate=2012-06-26|title=XEP-0124: Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)}}</ref> it is also an underlying technology in the [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]], which Apple uses for its iCloud push support.\n\n=== Flash XMLSocket relays ===\nThis technique, used by [[Cbox]] and other [[online chat|chat]] applications, makes use of the [[XMLSocket]] object in a single-pixel [[Adobe Flash]] movie. Under the control of [[JavaScript]], the client establishes a [[TCP connection]] to a [[unidirectional network|unidirectional]] relay on the server. The relay server does not read anything from this [[network socket|socket]]; instead it immediately sends the client a [[unique identifier]]. Next, the client makes an [[HTTP request]] to the web server, including with it this identifier. The web application can then push messages addressed to the client to a local interface of the relay server, which relays them over the Flash socket. The advantage of this approach is that it appreciates the natural read-write asymmetry that is typical of many web applications, including chat, and as a consequence it offers high efficiency. Since it does not accept data on outgoing sockets, the relay server does not need to poll outgoing TCP connections ''at all'', making it possible to hold open tens of thousands of concurrent connections. In this model, the limit to scale is the TCP stack of the underlying server operating system.\n\n=== Reliable Group Data Delivery (RGDD) ===\nIn services such as Cloud Computing, to increase reliability and availability of data, it is usually pushed (replicated) to several machines. For example, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) makes 2 extra copies of any object stored. RGDD focuses on efficiently casting an object from one location to many while saving bandwidth by sending minimal number of copies (only one in the best case) of the object over any link across the network. For example, Datacast <ref>{{Cite journal |title= Datacast: A Scalable and Efficient Reliable Group Data Delivery Service For Data Centers |journal= Microsoft Research|author= C. Guo|display-authors=etal|date= November 1, 2012 |publisher= ACM |url= https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/datacast-a-scalable-and-efficient-reliable-group-data-delivery-service-for-data-centers-2/ |accessdate= Jun 6, 2017 }}</ref> is a scheme for delivery to many nodes inside datacenters that relies on regular and structured topologies and DCCast <ref>{{Cite web |title= DCCast: Efficient Point to Multipoint Transfers Across Datacenters |author= M.

Push notifications were first introduced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/iphone-push-notification-service-for-devs-announced/|title=iPhone push notification service for devs announced|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>\nIn 2010 [[Google]] released its own service, Google Cloud to Device Messaging. (It has since been replaced by [[Google Cloud Messaging]] and then [[Firebase Cloud Messaging]].)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/GoogleCMReplacesC2Dm|title=Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM) Unveiled, to Replace C2DM Framework|website=InfoQ|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>\nNovember 2015, [[Microsoft]] announced that the [[Windows Notification Service]] would be expanded to make use of the Universal Windows Platform architecture, allowing for push data to be sent to Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox, as well as other supported platforms using universal API calls and POST requests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/tiles-and-notifications-windows-push-notification-services--wns--overview|title=Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) overview|last=mijacobs|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-20}}</ref>\n\nPush notifications are mainly divided into 2 approaches, local notifications and remote notifications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/|title=Local and Remote Notifications in Depth|last=|first=|date=|website=developer.apple.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> For local notifications, the application schedules the notification with the local device's OS, or, alternatively, sets as a timer in the application itself if it is able to continuously run in the background. When the event's scheduled time is reached, or the event's programmed condition is met, the message is displayed in the application's user interface.\n\nRemote notifications are handled by a remote server. Under this scenario, the client application needs to be registered on the server with a unique key (e.g., a [[UUID]]). The server then fires the message against the unique key to deliver the message to the client application via an agreed client/server protocol such as [[HTTP]] or [[XMPP]] and the client displays the message received. When the push notification arrives, it can transmit short notifications and messages, set badges on application icons, blink or continuously light up the [[notification LED]], or play alert sounds to attract user's attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jatapp.com/blog/android-ios-push-notifications/|title=Android and iOS Push Notifications \u2013 Blog \u2013 JatApp|website=jatapp.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}</ref> Push notifications are usually used by applications to bring information to users' attention.

In this model, the limit to scale is the TCP stack of the underlying server operating system.\n\n=== Reliable Group Data Delivery (RGDD) ===\nIn services such as Cloud Computing, to increase reliability and availability of data, it is usually pushed (replicated) to several machines. For example, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) makes 2 extra copies of any object stored. RGDD focuses on efficiently casting an object from one location to many while saving bandwidth by sending minimal number of copies (only one in the best case) of the object over any link across the network. For example, Datacast <ref>{{Cite journal |title= Datacast: A Scalable and Efficient Reliable Group Data Delivery Service For Data Centers |journal= Microsoft Research|author= C. Guo|display-authors=etal|date= November 1, 2012 |publisher= ACM |url= https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/datacast-a-scalable-and-efficient-reliable-group-data-delivery-service-for-data-centers-2/ |accessdate= Jun 6, 2017 }}</ref> is a scheme for delivery to many nodes inside datacenters that relies on regular and structured topologies and DCCast <ref>{{Cite web |title= DCCast: Efficient Point to Multipoint Transfers Across Datacenters |author= M.

Push notifications were first introduced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/iphone-push-notification-service-for-devs-announced/|title=iPhone push notification service for devs announced|website=Engadget|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>\nIn 2010 [[Google]] released its own service, Google Cloud to Device Messaging. (It has since been replaced by [[Google Cloud Messaging]] and then [[Firebase Cloud Messaging]].)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/GoogleCMReplacesC2Dm|title=Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM) Unveiled, to Replace C2DM Framework|website=InfoQ|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>\nNovember 2015, [[Microsoft]] announced that the [[Windows Notification Service]] would be expanded to make use of the Universal Windows Platform architecture, allowing for push data to be sent to Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox, as well as other supported platforms using universal API calls and POST requests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/tiles-and-notifications-windows-push-notification-services--wns--overview|title=Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) overview|last=mijacobs|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-20}}</ref>\n\nPush notifications are mainly divided into 2 approaches, local notifications and remote notifications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/|title=Local and Remote Notifications in Depth|last=|first=|date=|website=developer.apple.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> For local notifications, the application schedules the notification with the local device's OS, or, alternatively, sets as a timer in the application itself if it is able to continuously run in the background. When the event's scheduled time is reached, or the event's programmed condition is met, the message is displayed in the application's user interface.\n\nRemote notifications are handled by a remote server. Under this scenario, the client application needs to be registered on the server with a unique key (e.g., a [[UUID]]). The server then fires the message against the unique key to deliver the message to the client application via an agreed client/server protocol such as [[HTTP]] or [[XMPP]] and the client displays the message received. When the push notification arrives, it can transmit short notifications and messages, set badges on application icons, blink or continuously light up the [[notification LED]], or play alert sounds to attract user's attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jatapp.com/blog/android-ios-push-notifications/|title=Android and iOS Push Notifications \u2013 Blog \u2013 JatApp|website=jatapp.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}</ref> Push notifications are usually used by applications to bring information to users' attention.

{"title_page": "Electrical ballast", "text_new": "{{other uses|Ballast (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Fulham Workhorse 4 ballast.jpg|thumb|350px|A modern ballast for powering four F32T8 office lamps.]]\nAn '''electrical ballast''' is a device placed in series with a load to limit the amount of [[electric current|current]] in an  [[electrical network|electrical circuit]]. \n\nA familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in [[fluorescent lamp]]s to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to a destructive level due to the [[negative resistance|negative differential resistance]] of the tube's voltage-current characteristic.\n\nBallasts vary greatly in complexity. They may be as simple as a [[resistor]], [[inductor]], or [[capacitor]] (or a combination of these) wired in series with the lamp; or as complex as the electronic ballasts used in [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) and [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s (HID lamps).\n\n== Current limiting ==\n[[Image:Tanning-chokeballast.jpg|thumbnail|upright|250px|A ''choke ballast'' (inductor) used in older lighting. This example is from a tanning bed. It requires a starter switch (below).]] \n[[Image:Tanning-starter.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|lamp starter]], required with some inductor type ballasts.  It connects the two ends of the lamp to preheat them for one second before lighting.]]\nAn electrical ballast is a device that limits the current through an [[electrical load]]. These are most often used when a load (such as an arc discharge) has its terminal voltage decline when current through the load increases.  If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it is destroyed or causes the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive [[electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.\n\nBallasts can also be used simply to limit the current in an ordinary, positive-resistance circuit. Prior to the advent of solid-state ignition, automobile [[ignition system]]s commonly included a ballast resistor to regulate the voltage applied to the ignition system.\n\nSeries resistors are used as ballasts to control the current through LEDs.\n\n== Resistors ==\n=== Fixed resistors ===\nFor simple, low-powered loads such as a [[neon lamp]] or a [[LED lamp]], a fixed resistor is commonly used. Because the resistance of the ballast resistor is large it determines the current in the circuit, even in the face of [[negative resistance]] introduced by the neon lamp.\n\nBallast was also a component used in early model [[automobile]] [[internal combustion engine|engines]] that lowered the supply [[voltage]] to the [[ignition system]] after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires a significant amount of electrical current from the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system, resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and ignition systems.\n\nOccasionally, this ballast resistor would fail and the classic symptom of this failure was that the engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a ballast resistor as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.\n\nAnother common use of a ballast resistor in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10&nbsp;A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.\n\nIn some consumer electronic equipment, notably in [[television sets]] in the era of valves ([[vacuum tube]]s), but also in some low-cost record players, the vacuum tube heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both [[alternating current]] (AC) and [[direct current]] (DC).\n\n=== Self-variable resistors ===\nSome ballast resistors have the property of increasing in [[electrical resistance|resistance]] as current through them increases, and decreasing in resistance as current decreases. Physically, some such devices are often built quite like [[incandescent lamp]]s. Like the [[tungsten]] filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp, if [[electric current|current]] increases, the ballast resistor gets hotter, its resistance goes up, and its voltage drop increases. If [[electric current|current]] decreases, the ballast resistor gets colder, its resistance drops, and the [[voltage drop]] decreases. Therefore, the ballast resistor reduces variations in current, despite variations in applied voltage or changes in the rest of an electric circuit. These devices are sometimes called \"[[iron\u2013hydrogen resistor|barretters]]\" and were used in the series heating circuits of 1930s to 1960s [[AC/DC receiver design#Series tube heaters|AC/DC]] [[All American Five|radio]] and TV home receivers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThis property can lead to more precise current control than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost in the resistive ballast is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped in the ballast compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.\n\nEarlier{{When|date=March 2019}}, household [[clothes dryer]]s sometimes incorporated a [[germicidal lamp]] in series with an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220\u2013240&nbsp;V countries was a circular tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.\n\n== Reactive ballasts ==\n[[File:Fluorescent light strip 2 tube.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|A [[fluorescent lamp]], a device with negative differential resistance.<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite book\n  | last = Sinclair\n  | first = Ian Robertson\n  | title = Sensors and transducers, 3rd Ed.\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 2001\n  | location =\n  | pages = 69\u201370\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s_WIb91uKK8C&pg=PA69&dq=%22gas+discharge%22+%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750649322}}</ref><ref name=\"Kularatna\">{{cite book\n  | last = Kularatna\n  | first = Nihal\n  | title = Power Electronics Design Handbook\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 1998\n  | location =\n  | pages = 232\u2013233\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IBx801tIgjYC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750670739}}</ref> In operation, an increase in current through the fluorescent tube causes a drop in voltage across it.

Sign ballasts are heavier duty than other ballasts because the cooler outdoor temperatures increase the energy required to start a fluorescent tube. They are sized based on how many feet of tube is used.]]\nBecause of the power that would be lost, resistors are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, on the order of 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.\n\nAn [[inductor]] is very common in line-frequency ballasts to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a fluorescent lamp, neon lamp, or HID lamp. (Because of the use of the inductor, such ballasts are usually called ''magnetic ballasts''.) The inductor has two benefits:\n# Its reactance limits the power available to the lamp with only minimal power losses in the inductor\n# The [[voltage spike]] produced when current through the inductor is rapidly interrupted is used in some circuits to first strike the arc in the lamp.\n\nA disadvantage of the inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor [[power factor]]. In more expensive ballasts, a [[capacitor]] is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called ''lead-lag'' ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.\n\nIn Europe, and most 220-240&nbsp;V territories, the line voltage is sufficient to start lamps over 20W with a series inductor. In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120&nbsp;V or 100&nbsp;V respectively) may not be sufficient to start lamps over 20&nbsp;W with a series inductor, so an [[autotransformer]] winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage. The autotransformer is designed with enough [[leakage inductance]] ([[short-circuit inductance]]) so that the current is appropriately limited.\n\nBecause of the large inductors and capacitors that must be used, reactive ballasts operated at line frequency tend to be large and heavy. They commonly also produce acoustic [[noise]] (line-frequency [[mains hum|hum]]).\n\nPrior to 1980 in the United States, [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB)-based oils were used as an insulating oil in many ballasts to provide cooling and electrical isolation (see [[Transformer oil]]).\n\n==Electronic ballasts{{anchor|Electronic_ballasts}}==\n{{see also|Fluorescent lamp#Electronic ballasts}}\nAn electronic ballast uses [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] [[electronic circuit]]ry to provide the proper starting and operating electrical conditions to power discharge lamps. An electronic ballast can be smaller and lighter than a comparably-rated magnetic one. An electronic ballast is usually quieter than a magnetic one, which produces a line-frequency hum by vibration of the transformer laminations.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=Understanding Transformer Noise\n | url=http://federalpacific.com/literature/dry-type-literature/10transformernoise.pdf\n | website=federalpacific.com\n | publisher=Federal Pacific\n | accessdate=8 August 2015\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315002829/http://federalpacific.com/literature/dry-type-literature/10transformernoise.pdf\n | archive-date=15 March 2015\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nElectronic ballasts are often based on [[switched-mode power supply]] (SMPS) topology, first rectifying the input power and then chopping it at a high frequency. Advanced electronic ballasts may allow dimming via [[pulse-width modulation]] or via changing the frequency to a higher value. Ballasts incorporating a [[microcontroller]] (digital ballasts) may offer remote control and monitoring via networks such as [[LonWorks]], [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface]] (DALI), [[DMX512]], [[Digital Serial Interface]] (DSI) or simple analog control using a [[0-10 V lighting control|0-10&nbsp;V]] DC brightness control signal.

The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04\u20130.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.<ref name=\"nlpip\">[http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/PDF/VIEW/SREB2.pdf Specifier Reports: Electronic Ballasts p.18], National Lighting Product Information Program, Volume 8 Number 1, May 2000.

Lamp efficiency increases sharply at about 10&nbsp;kHz and continues to improve until approximately 20&nbsp;kHz.<ref>IES Lighting Handbook 1984</ref> Electronic ballast retrofits to existing street lights had been tested in some Canadian provinces circa 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/Roads/Pages/Traffic/Traffic-signals-and-streetlights/Streetlighting-Digital-Ballast-pilot-project.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729141605/http://www.calgary.ca/Transportation/Roads/Pages/Traffic/Traffic-signals-and-streetlights/Streetlighting-Digital-Ballast-pilot-project.aspx |archivedate=2013-07-29 }}</ref>; since then LED retrofits have become more common.\n\nWith the higher efficiency of the ballast itself and the higher lamp efficacy at higher frequency, electronic ballasts offer higher system efficacy for low pressure lamps like the fluorescent lamp. For HID lamps, there is no improvement of the lamp efficacy in using higher frequency, but for these lamps the ballast losses are lower at higher frequencies and also the light depreciation is lower, meaning the lamp produces more light over its entire lifespan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Some HID lamp types like the [[ceramic discharge metal halide lamp]] have reduced reliability when operated at high frequencies in the range of {{nowrap|20 \u2013 200 kHz}}; for these lamps a square wave low frequency current drive is mostly used with frequency in the range of {{nowrap|100 \u2013 400 Hz}}, with the same advantage of lower light depreciation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nApplication of electronic ballasts to HID lighting is growing in popularity. Most newer generation electronic ballasts can operate both [[Sodium-vapor lamp#High-pressure sodium|high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps]] as well as [[metal-halide lamp]]s, reducing costs for building managers who use both types of lamps. The ballast initially works as a starter for the arc, supplying a high-voltage impulse and, later, it works as a limiter/regulator of the electric flow inside the circuit. Electronic ballasts also run much cooler and are lighter than their magnetic counterparts.<ref name=\"nlpip\" />\n\n==Fluorescent lamp ballasts==\n{{Main article|Fluorescent lamp}}\n===Preheating===\nThis technique uses a combination [[electrical filament|filament]]\u2013[[cathode]] at each end of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic or electronic) switch that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them. When filaments are disconnected, an inductive pulse from the ballast starts the lamp. This system is described as \"Preheat\" in North America and \"Switch Start\" in the UK, and have no specific name in the rest part of the world. This systems is common in 200\u2013240 V countries (and for 100\u2013120 V lamps up to about 30 watts).\n\nAlthough an inductive pulse makes it more likely that the lamp will start when the starter switch opens, it is not actually necessary. The ballast in such systems can equally be a resistor. A number of fluorescent lamp fittings used a filament lamp as the ballast in the late 1950s through to the 1960s.  Special lamps were manufactured that were rated at 170&nbsp;volts and 120&nbsp;watts.  The lamp had a thermal starter built into the 4 pin base. The power requirements were much larger than using an inductive ballast (though the consumed current was the same), but the warmer light from the lamp type of ballast was often preferred by users particularly in a domestic environment.\n\nResistive ballasts were the only type that was usable when the only supply available to power the fluorescent lamp was DC. Such fittings used the thermal type of starter (mostly because they had gone out of use long before the [[glow switch starter|glow starter]] was invented), but it was possible to include a choke in the circuit whose sole purpose was to provide a pulse on opening of the starter switch to improve starting. DC fittings were complicated by the need to reverse the polarity of the supply to the tube each time it started. Failure to do so vastly shortened the life of the tube.\n\n===Instant start===\nAn instant start ballast does not preheat the electrodes, instead using a relatively high voltage (~600&nbsp;V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted from the surface of the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120&nbsp;volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40&nbsp;W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.\n\n===Rapid start===\nA rapid start ballast applies voltage and heats the cathodes simultaneously. It provides superior lamp life and more cycle life, but uses slightly more energy as the electrodes in each end of the lamp continue to consume heating power as the lamp operates. Again, although popular in 100-120&nbsp;volt countries for lamps of 40&nbsp;W and above, rapid start is sometimes used in other countries particularly where the flicker of switch start systems is undesirable. This ballast is incompatible with the European energy saver T8 fluorescent lamps, that retrofits the older T12 lamps, since these lamps have much higher starting voltage than the [[open-circuit voltage]] of rapid start ballasts.\n\n===Dimmable ballast===\nA dimmable ballast is very similar to a rapid start ballast, but usually has a capacitor incorporated to give a [[power factor]] nearer to unity than a standard rapid start ballast. A [[quadrac]] type light dimmer can be used with a dimming ballast, which maintains the heating current while allowing lamp current to be controlled.  A resistor of about 10&nbsp;k\u03a9 is required to be connected in parallel with the fluorescent tube to allow reliable firing of the quadrac at low light levels.\n\n===Programmed start===\nUsed in high end electronic fluorescent ballasts. This ballast applies power to the filaments first, it allows the cathodes to preheat and then applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc. Lamp life typically operates up to 100,000 on/off cycles when using programmed start ballasts. Once started, filament voltage is reduced to increase operating efficiency.\n\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title = What Are Fluorescent Ballast Starting Methods?\n | website = \n | publisher = Bulbsdepot.com\n | date = 2014-02-14\n | url = http://www.bulbsdepot.com/blog/what-are-fluorescent-ballast-starting-methods.html\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 2014-03-11\n}}</ref> This ballast gives the best life and most starts from lamps, and so is preferred for applications with very frequent power cycling such as vision examination rooms and restrooms with a motion detector switch.\n\n===Emergency===\nAn electronic ballast with an integrated battery is designed to provide emergency egress lighting in the event of a power failure (typically less than 2 hours). These can be used as an alternative to egress lighting powered by a back-up electrical generator. However, emergency ballasts require regular testing and have a useful life of 10-12 years.\n\n===Hybrid===\nA hybrid ballast has a magnetic core-and-coil [[transformer]] and an electronic switch for the [[electrode]]-heating circuit.

They may be as simple as a [[resistor]], [[inductor]], or [[capacitor]] (or a combination of these) wired in series with the lamp; or as complex as the electronic ballasts used in [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) and [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s (HID lamps).\n\n== Current limiting ==\n[[Image:Tanning-chokeballast.jpg|thumbnail|upright|250px|A ''choke ballast'' (inductor) used in older lighting. This example is from a tanning bed. It requires a starter switch (below).]] \n[[Image:Tanning-starter.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|lamp starter]], required with some inductor type ballasts.  It connects the two ends of the lamp to preheat them for one second before lighting.]]\nAn electrical ballast is a device that limits the current through an [[electrical load]]. These are most often used when a load (such as an arc discharge) has its terminal voltage decline when current through the load increases.  If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it is destroyed or causes the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive [[electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.\n\nBallasts can also be used simply to limit the current in an ordinary, positive-resistance circuit. Prior to the advent of solid-state ignition, automobile [[ignition system]]s commonly included a ballast resistor to regulate the voltage applied to the ignition system.\n\nSeries resistors are used as ballasts to control the current through LEDs.\n\n== Resistors ==\n=== Fixed resistors ===\nFor simple, low-powered loads such as a [[neon lamp]] or a [[LED lamp]], a fixed resistor is commonly used. Because the resistance of the ballast resistor is large it determines the current in the circuit, even in the face of [[negative resistance]] introduced by the neon lamp.\n\nBallast was also a component used in early model [[automobile]] [[internal combustion engine|engines]] that lowered the supply [[voltage]] to the [[ignition system]] after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires a significant amount of electrical current from the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system, resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and ignition systems.\n\nOccasionally, this ballast resistor would fail and the classic symptom of this failure was that the engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a ballast resistor as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.\n\nAnother common use of a ballast resistor in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10&nbsp;A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.\n\nIn some consumer electronic equipment, notably in [[television sets]] in the era of valves ([[vacuum tube]]s), but also in some low-cost record players, the vacuum tube heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both [[AC]] and [[DC]].\n\n=== Self-variable resistors ===\nSome ballast resistors have the property of increasing in [[electrical resistance|resistance]] as current through them increases, and decreasing in resistance as current decreases. Physically, some such devices are often built quite like [[incandescent lamp]]s. Like the [[tungsten]] filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp, if [[electric current|current]] increases, the ballast resistor gets hotter, its resistance goes up, and its voltage drop increases. If [[electric current|current]] decreases, the ballast resistor gets colder, its resistance drops, and the [[voltage drop]] decreases. Therefore, the ballast resistor reduces variations in current, despite variations in applied voltage or changes in the rest of an electric circuit. These devices are sometimes called \"[[iron\u2013hydrogen resistor|barretters]]\" and were used in the series heating circuits of 1930s to 1960s [[AC/DC receiver design#Series tube heaters|AC/DC]] [[All American Five|radio]] and TV home receivers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThis property can lead to more precise current control than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost in the resistive ballast is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped in the ballast compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.\n\nEarlier{{When|date=March 2019}}, household [[clothes dryer]]s sometimes incorporated a [[germicidal lamp]] in series with an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220\u2013240&nbsp;V countries was a circular tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.\n\n== Reactive ballasts ==\n[[File:Fluorescent light strip 2 tube.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|A [[fluorescent lamp]], a device with negative differential resistance.<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite book\n  | last = Sinclair\n  | first = Ian Robertson\n  | title = Sensors and transducers, 3rd Ed.\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 2001\n  | location =\n  | pages = 69\u201370\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s_WIb91uKK8C&pg=PA69&dq=%22gas+discharge%22+%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750649322}}</ref><ref name=\"Kularatna\">{{cite book\n  | last = Kularatna\n  | first = Nihal\n  | title = Power Electronics Design Handbook\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 1998\n  | location =\n  | pages = 232\u2013233\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IBx801tIgjYC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750670739}}</ref> In operation, an increase in current through the fluorescent tube causes a drop in voltage across it.

Sign ballasts are heavier duty than other ballasts because the cooler outdoor temperatures increase the energy required to start a fluorescent tube. They are sized based on how many feet of tube is used.]]\nBecause of the power that would be lost, resistors are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, on the order of 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.\n\nAn [[inductor]] is very common in line-frequency ballasts to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a fluorescent lamp, neon lamp, or HID lamp. (Because of the use of the inductor, such ballasts are usually called ''magnetic ballasts''.) The inductor has two benefits:\n# Its reactance limits the power available to the lamp with only minimal power losses in the inductor\n# The [[voltage spike]] produced when current through the inductor is rapidly interrupted is used in some circuits to first strike the arc in the lamp.\n\nA disadvantage of the inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor [[power factor]]. In more expensive ballasts, a [[capacitor]] is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called ''lead-lag'' ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.\n\nIn Europe, and most 220-240&nbsp;V territories, the line voltage is sufficient to start lamps over 20W with a series inductor. In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120&nbsp;V or 100&nbsp;V respectively) may not be sufficient to start lamps over 20&nbsp;W with a series inductor, so an [[autotransformer]] winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage. The autotransformer is designed with enough [[leakage inductance]] ([[short-circuit inductance]]) so that the current is appropriately limited.\n\nBecause of the large inductors and capacitors that must be used, reactive ballasts operated at line frequency tend to be large and heavy. They commonly also produce acoustic [[noise]] (line-frequency [[mains hum|hum]]).\n\nPrior to 1980 in the United States, [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB)-based oils were used as an insulating oil in many ballasts to provide cooling and electrical isolation (see [[Transformer oil]]).\n\n==Electronic ballasts{{anchor|Electronic_ballasts}}==\n{{see also|Fluorescent lamp#Electronic ballasts}}\nAn electronic ballast uses [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] [[electronic circuit]]ry to provide the proper starting and operating electrical conditions to power discharge lamps. An electronic ballast can be smaller and lighter than a comparably-rated magnetic one. An electronic ballast is usually quieter than a magnetic one, which produces a line-frequency hum by vibration of the transformer laminations.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=Understanding Transformer Noise\n | url=http://federalpacific.com/literature/dry-type-literature/10transformernoise.pdf\n | website=federalpacific.com\n | publisher=Federal Pacific\n | accessdate=8 August 2015\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315002829/http://federalpacific.com/literature/dry-type-literature/10transformernoise.pdf\n | archive-date=15 March 2015\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nElectronic ballasts are often based on [[switched-mode power supply]] (SMPS) topology, first rectifying the input power and then chopping it at a high frequency.

The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04\u20130.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.<ref name=\"nlpip\">[http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/PDF/VIEW/SREB2.pdf Specifier Reports: Electronic Ballasts p.18], National Lighting Product Information Program, Volume 8 Number 1, May 2000.

For HID lamps, there is no improvement of the lamp efficacy in using higher frequency, but for these lamps the ballast losses are lower at higher frequencies and also the light depreciation is lower, meaning the lamp produces more light over its entire lifespan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Some HID lamp types like the [[ceramic discharge metal halide lamp]] have reduced reliability when operated at high frequencies in the range of {{nowrap|20 \u2013 200 kHz}}; for these lamps a square wave low frequency current drive is mostly used with frequency in the range of {{nowrap|100 \u2013 400 Hz}}, with the same advantage of lower light depreciation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nApplication of electronic ballasts to HID lighting is growing in popularity. Most newer generation electronic ballasts can operate both [[Sodium-vapor lamp#High-pressure sodium|high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps]] as well as [[metal-halide lamp]]s, reducing costs for building managers who use both types of lamps. The ballast initially works as a starter for the arc, supplying a high-voltage impulse and, later, it works as a limiter/regulator of the electric flow inside the circuit. Electronic ballasts also run much cooler and are lighter than their magnetic counterparts.<ref name=\"nlpip\" />\n\n==Fluorescent lamp ballasts==\n{{Main article|Fluorescent lamp}}\n===Preheating===\nThis technique uses a combination [[electrical filament|filament]]\u2013[[cathode]] at each end of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic or electronic) switch that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them. When filaments are disconnected, an inductive pulse from the ballast starts the lamp. This system is described as \"Preheat\" in North America and \"Switch Start\" in the UK, and have no specific name in the rest part of the world.

They play their home matches at [[United Park]].\n\nThe current club is the amalgamation of two former clubs in the town: Drogheda United, a non-league club founded in 1919; and Drogheda F.C., founded in 1962. The clubs merged their operations to form the current club in 1975 and have achieved success since 2005 by winning two [[Setanta Sports Cup]]s, an [[FAI Cup]], and their first league title, the [[2007 League of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1919\u20131975: Early years ===\nFounded in 1919 the original Drogheda United were a non-league club for all of their early years of existence but on Saturday 22 June 1963 another Drogheda Club \u2013 '''Drogheda F.C.''' (founded in 1962) were elected to the [[League of Ireland]] when the league was expanded to include twelve teams rather than ten. In their first season there they finished tenth and also in each of the next three seasons finished in the bottom three. In the 1967\u201368 season they achieved a respectable fifth-place finish and the following season finished in sixth place. When the league expanded to include fourteen teams the club dropped down the table again finishing in the bottom five in each of the next six seasons and also recording their heaviest league defeat 8\u20131 to [[Cork Hibernians F.C.|Cork Hibernians]] in the 1970\u201371 season. They did, however, get to [[FAI Cup]] final that season where they were beaten 3\u20130 by [[Limerick F.C.|Limerick]] in a replay after the first match ended 00..\n\n=== 1975\u20132003 ===\nIn 1975 Drogheda F.C. amalgamated with Drogheda United to form Drogheda United F.C. and the 1975\u201376 season saw an improvement in fortunes on the field as they finished sixth in the league and they also reached the FAI Cup Final for the second time, this time losing 1\u20130 to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]]. For the next three seasons, quite the opposite at what had happened before, they finished in third place. During these seasons Drogheda United also achieved two club records \u2013 their biggest league victory (7\u20131 v [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]]) and [[Cathal Muckian]] scoring 21 league goals in a season. The club then endured another tough spell in the league finishing in the bottom half for the next five seasons bar the 1982\u201383 season when they managed to achieve their second highest ever league placing of second-place (they later won the league in 2007) finishing sixteen points behind [[Athlone Town A.F.C.|Athlone Town]]. They did win their first ever trophy during these seasons also, the [[League of Ireland Cup]] in the 1983\u201384 season.\n\nThe 1984\u201385 season saw the introduction of the [[League of Ireland First Division]] to begin the following season with Drogheda United among the four clubs who were relegated from the Premier Division but in this season also Drogheda United entered European Competition for the first time where they were destroyed against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] First Round 14\u20130 on aggregate. They remained in the First Division until the 1988\u201389 season when they went up as First Division Champions. Their joy was short-lived, however, as the following season they were relegated although this time they achieved promotion at the first time of asking. In the next two seasons Drogheda battled bravely against relegation surviving by one point and on goal difference in the respective seasons. However, they were relegated for the third time in the 1993\u201394 season.\n\nDrogheda United were very much becoming a [[yo-yo club]], swapping divisions every season between the 1993\u201394 and 2000\u201301 seasons when in 2000\u201301 they finished a disappointing ninth in the ten-team First Division. In 2002\u201303 they were promoted to the Premier Division under [[Harry McCue]] and were there until the 2016 season, as they got relegated in 2015, coming in twelfth place.\n\n=== 2003\u20132008: Paul Doolin ===\nIn 2003, McCue was sacked as manager of Drogheda United. Paul Doolin took over and upped the standard of training and fitness levels. However, he found that to compete with the big clubs like [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] he would need a professional squad. In 2004, he made the squad fully professional and gave part-time players the option to turn professional or leave the club. The change to full-time saw the club's fortunes drastically improve. They won their first [[FAI Cup]] in [[2005 FAI Cup|2005]], beating [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] in the final and won back-to-back [[Setanta Cup]]s in [[2006 Setanta Sports Cup|2006]] and [[2007 Setanta Sports Cup|2007]].\n\nThey also qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]] for the 2006\u201307 season thanks to their 2005 FAI Cup success. This time they fared better than in their first foray into Europe as they defeated [[HJK Helsinki]] 4\u20132 on aggregate in the First Qualifying Round and were just eliminated 11\u201310 in an epic penalty shoot-out in the next round against [[IK Start]] of [[Norway]]. They were also in the UEFA Cup Qualifying stages for the 2007\u201308 campaign, losing to [[Helsingborgs IF]] in the second round.\n\nUnited finally won the League of Ireland for the first time in 2007, beating Cork City 2\u20131 at United Park with three games to go. [[Guy Bates]] scored the winning goal for Drogheda that day, shooting himself into Drogs folklore. Drogheda were dominant in the league, only losing three games and winning the title by seven points.\n\nThe league win meant that Drogheda would be playing in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] Qualifiers for the first time in their history in the 2008\u201309 season. They succeeded in their first qualifier against [[FC Levadia Tallinn|Levadia Tallinn]], beating them 3\u20131 on aggregate. They played the Second Qualifying Round against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] which, they ended up losing 4\u20133 on aggregate. In the first a late goal for [[Kiev]] secured a 2\u20131 victory at [[Dalymount Park]]. In the second game, an early Kiev goal after 13 minutes seemed to have finished the tie, but remarkably, on 41 minutes, Drogheda were awarded a penalty. [[Shane Robinson (footballer)|Shane Robinson]] stepped up and slotted home the spot-kick. Drogheda then worked tirelessly trying to get the second goal, but they gave away a penalty on 72 minutes, which was converted. 2\u20131 down, it seemed the tie was over now. Amazingly however, [[Graham Gartland]] scored an 88th-minute goal to make it 2\u20132. [[Adam Hughes (footballer)|Adam Hughes]] got a further chance when he had an open goal, but miskicked the ball and it flew over the bar. Then, [[Shane Robinson (footballer)|Shane Robinson]] hit a shot from a tight angle which hit the post. Despite Drogheda's late rally, they were knocked out by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].\n\n=== 2008 (Examinership) ===\n[[File:Hanaphy DUFC Huskie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Darragh Hanaphy in action for Drogheda United April 2011|Darragh Hanaphy in action for Drogheda United, April 2011]] In October 2008 Drogheda went into [[examinership]], like Cork City, after failing to pay back a \u20ac500,000 loan to the Revenue Commissioners and  \u20ac10,000 rent to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] for their use of [[Dalymount Park]] in their [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] Qualifiers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/drogs-need-500000-to-avoid-extinction-1559879.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905235538/http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/drogs-need-500000-to-avoid-extinction-1559879.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 September 2012 |work=Irish Independent |title=Drogs need \u20ac500,000 to avoid extinction |date=3 December 2012 }}</ref> Their plans for a new \u20ac35m stadium fell through and in November 2008 they were deduced 10 points. After successfully raising money through various fund raisers arranged by the supporters, the club escaped extinction in January 2009 when a judge ruled in Drogheda's favour to the delight of the teary eyed chairman Vincent Hoey.\n\n=== 2009\u20132011 ===\nIn the 2009 season Drogheda got off to a difficult start. Due to bankruptcy, the club went part-time and lost their entire league-winning squad, and manager, [[Paul Doolin]], who took over [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]]. Former [[Cork City Football Club|Cork]] and [[Longford Town F.C.|Longford]] boss [[Alan Mathews]] took over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2009/0204/1224240566254.html|title=Mathews appointed Drogheda boss|author=|date=|website=irishtimes.com}}</ref> Mathews had to sign a side of semi-pros and free agents. Drogheda were in the bottom half of the table for the whole season, despite some shock wins. On 10 November 2009 they beat Bray Wanderers 2\u20130 in a relegation play-off.\n\nThe 2010 season was disastrous on and off the pitch. Drogheda started terribly and after a 6\u20130 loss at the hands of [[Sligo Rovers F.C|Sligo Rovers]] on 15 May, Alan Mathews quit his managerial post. The club appointed youth team coach and Drogheda native Darius Kierans as manager even though he had yet to complete his Europa A licence which is an FAI requirement for league managers. After much objection from the FAI, Kierans became Director of Football and the club appointed Paul Lumsden as Interim Manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/manager-chaos-may-see-drogs-licence-revoked-2232500.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802082703/http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/manager-chaos-may-see-drogs-licence-revoked-2232500.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |work=Irish Independent |title=Manager chaos may see Drogs' licence revoked |date=30 November 2012 }}</ref> Lumsden took the team for only one game before resigning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/valuable-three-points-for-drogheda-463996.html|title=Valuable three points for Drogheda|author=|date=2 July 2010 |website=breakingnews.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113132806/https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0705/267639-dundalk_drogheda/\n|archivedate=13 November 2018 |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0705/267639-dundalk_drogheda/ |title=Dundalk 2-1 Drogheda United |accessdate=13 November 2018 |website=[[RTE.ie]] |date=5 July 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Brian Donnelly was then appointed as the second Interim Manager of the season but he too resigned in September. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drogheda-independent.ie/sport/soccer/donnelly-named-as-drogheda-manager-2258199.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729140146/http://www.drogheda-independent.ie/sport/soccer/donnelly-named-as-drogheda-manager-2258199.html|url-status=dead|title=Donnelly named as Drogheda manager - Soccer, Sport - Drogheda-Indepen\u2026|date=29 July 2012|archivedate=29 July 2012|website=drogheda-independent.ie}}</ref> On 27 September, the club announced the imminent arrival as manager of another former player \u2013 [[Bobby Browne (footballer born 1962)|Bobby Browne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_018.php|title=Drogheda United Football Club - Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.droghedaunited.ie|access-date=28 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111600/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_018.php|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite finishing rock-bottom of the table with only four wins and nine draws (a total of 21 points) in 2010 and being relegated, Drogheda United were reprieved after the extinction of [[Sporting Fingal F.C.|Sporting Fingal]] in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0214/premierdivision.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Drogheda back in the Premier Division |date=14 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215125710/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0214/premierdivision.html |archivedate=15 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== 2011\u20132013: Mick Cooke ===\n\n[[Mick Cooke (football manager)|Mick Cooke]], manager of [[Monaghan United F.C.|Monaghan]] took over as manager on 27 February 2011, becoming the sixth Drogheda manager in nine months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0228/1224291008747.html|title=Drogheda turn to Cooke as Browne leaves the club|author=|date=|website=irishtimes.com}}</ref> Cooke appointed former Drogs goalkeeper, [[Robbie Horgan]] as his assistant, and inherited the players who had been signed by Bobby Browne to play in the First Division so hopes weren't high. After an awful start, Drogheda beat local rivals Dundalk 2\u20131 in Oriel Park. The win turned their season around and despite operating on the lowest playing budget in the league, Drogheda managed to avoid relegation. Shortly after, Cooke put pen to paper on a new three-year deal with the club.\n\nIn 2012, Cooke and Horgan set about building on the foundations of the previous season. Cooke finally had his own team of players and despite having less than a tenth of the budget that the club had in the glory days under Paul Doolin, Drogheda have had their best season by far since then. Between 1 June and 4 August, Drogheda went on an eight-game winning run in the league and cup \u2013 the longest winning run in the club's history. On 23 September 2012, Drogheda won the final of the [[EA Sports Cup]] beating Shamrock Rovers 3\u20131<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2012/0922/338646-shamrock-rovers-drogheda-united/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | title=Shamrock Rovers 1\u20133 Drogheda United | date=22 September 2012}}</ref> \u2013 their first trophy since 2007. The icing on the cake came on 19 October when Drogheda beat the newly crowned 2012 League Champions Sligo Rovers 2\u20131 at United Park through a first half Alan McNally header and 88th minute Brian Gannon chip to qualify for the Europa League. \n\nIn 2013, Drogheda reached three finals and despite failing to add to their silverware, reflected the club's rise under Cooke. They were beaten 7\u20131 in the Setanta Cup final by [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and 2\u20130 in the League Cup final by the same opponent. They also reached their first [[2013 FAI Cup Final|FAI Cup final]] since winning the competition in 2005, narrowly losing out on a 3-2 thriller against [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]]. In the Europa League qualifying rounds that season, the club were drawn against Swedish giants [[Malm\u00f6 FF|Malm\u00f6]] and only lost by a single goal over two legs after a battling performance. Despite this success, Mick Cooke left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nIn November 2015 Drogheda appointed former UCD manager Peter Mahon as manager of the club. John Gill took over as assistant manager with Mark Kinsella ex Irish international remaining part of the coaching staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/drogheda-united-announce-pete-mahon-as-new-manager-34188432.html|title=Drogheda United announce Pete Mahon as new manager - Independent.ie|author=|date=|website=independent.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2015 League of Ireland Premier Division|2015]], Drogheda were relegated after finishing bottom of the league. The following season they finished second in the [[2016 League of Ireland First Division|First Division]], achieving promotion through the play-offs, before being relegated again after another 12th-place finish in 2017. In 2018, [[Tim Clancy]] was appointed as manager after the departure of Mahon\n\n== The Claret & Blue Club ==\nIn response to the economic difficulties facing the country, a group of supporters established The Claret & Blue Club in June 2009 with the aim of providing a steady income stream to Drogheda United FC. Supporters who join the Claret & Blue Club donate at least \u20ac5 per week to the club, and in return, they receive a membership card entitling them to discounts of up to 10% in a range of local businesses, including restaurants, tile shops, shoe shops and many more. Each member is also entered in a monthly prize draw, with a top prize every month of a sun holiday courtesy of Panorama Holidays. Other prizes include hotel vouchers, tickets to Irish World Cup qualifier games, betting vouchers etc. Publicity on the Derek Mooney Show on RT\u00c9 Radio one and full-page ads in the Drogheda Independent and Drogheda People resulted in a surge of membership, and after only four weeks of existence, the Claret & Blue Club was in a position to bring in over \u20ac35,000 to the club annually, with membership figures rising daily. It was hoped that the Claret & Blue Club will take full ownership of the club in 2010 and run the club similar to the way [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] is run by the Shamrock Rovers Members Club. However the target of 500 members was not reached and membership levels settled at just over half that target.\n\n=== Share Issue ===\nIn January 2011, a Claret and Blue Club steering committee announced new plans for a share issue. It was hoped that 200 shares would be sold at \u20ac1000 each and that this new revenue would provide stability for 2011\u201312 and allow the club to finally become a supporter-owned community club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2011/february/news_001.php|title=Drogheda United Football Club - Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.droghedaunited.ie|access-date=15 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705093111/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2011/february/news_001.php|archive-date=5 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In early 2012 Drogheda United became a member's owned and run club when a new company Drogheda Utd FC Limited was formed consisting of members who paid \u20ac1,000 each into the company.\n\n== Emblem ==\n[[File:Drogheda crest.svg|65px|thumb|right|Drogheda coat of arms.]] The crest of Drogheda United is an adaptation of the [[Drogheda#History#town arms|town arms of Drogheda]], which feature the [[heraldic]] symbols of a [[Star (heraldry)|star]] and [[crescent]] over a shield depicting St. Lawrence's Gate, [[Lion (heraldry)|three lions]] and a ship.

His own crest was the source of the star and crescent symbols, which he had taken from the [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s standard of Governor [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]] after capturing [[Cyprus]].\n\nThey share the same club colours as [[Trabzonspor]], in [[Turkey]] \u2013 and in 2011 the two sides became sister clubs. These were given in favor of the [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdulmejid I]]'s great assistance during the [[Irish famine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_022.php|title=Drogheda United Football Club - Welcome|website=www.droghedaunited.ie|access-date=9 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004114628/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_022.php|archive-date=4 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsoccer.com/forum/showthread.php?p=21924602|title=Trabzonspor 2010/2011 season {R}|author=|date=|website=bigsoccer.com}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n'''Drogs''' is a nickname for supporters of the club. When the name '''Drogs''' started to appear in two newspapers in the late 1990s, The Sun and the Drogheda Leader, the club wrote to the Drogheda Leader Newspaper demanding that the name not be used adding that it was not used in the stadium by the fans. The newspaper argued that it had not invented the name and that the fans in the '''shed''' side of the stadium often sing a song called '''Super Drogs'''. The club considered the name was degrading and was purely a Drogheda Leader nickname not used by the supporters. In recent years the club officially embraced the nickname.\n\nThe most vocal supporters stand on \"the shed side\" of [[United Park]]. Many Drogs attend every home match while a smaller group travel around the country to support the team at away matches. They sing football/Drogheda United chants, wear club colours (claret and blue), wave banners and flags and generally try to help lift the team and demonstrate fervent support. One section of their supporters are known as 'F45U' (Famous 45 [[Ultras]].)\n\nDrogheda United Supporters Club (DUSC) was formed more than two years ago. Its main aim is to promote Drogheda United F.C. throughout the community. The supporters club works hand-in-hand with the football club in various ways including contributing to the match day programme, organising fund raising nights like quizzes and race nights and by organising buses to away matches.<ref>[http://www.droghedaunited.ie/Scripts/SupportersClub.asp Supporters Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823193003/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/Scripts/SupportersClub.asp |date=23 August 2007 }}, ''Drogheda United Official Website'', 2007.

They play their home matches at [[United Park]].\n\nThe current club is the amalgamation of two former clubs in the town: Drogheda United, a non-league club founded in 1919; and Drogheda F.C., founded in 1962. The clubs merged their operations to form the current club in 1975 and have achieved success since 2005 by winning two [[Setanta Sports Cup]]s, an [[FAI Cup]], and their first league title, the [[2007 League of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1919\u20131975: Early Years ===\nFounded in 1919 the original Drogheda United were a non-league club for all of their early years of existence but on Saturday 22 June 1963 another Drogheda Club \u2013 '''Drogheda F.C.''' (founded in 1962) were elected to the [[League of Ireland]] when the league was expanded to include twelve teams rather than ten. In their first season there they finished tenth and also in each of the next three seasons finished in the bottom three. In the 1967\u201368 season they achieved a respectable fifth-place finish and the following season finished in sixth place. When the league expanded to include fourteen teams the club dropped down the table again finishing in the bottom five in each of the next six seasons and also recording their heaviest league defeat 8\u20131 to [[Cork Hibernians F.C.|Cork Hibernians]] in the 1970\u201371 season. They did, however, get to [[FAI Cup]] final that season where they were beaten 3\u20130 by [[Limerick F.C.|Limerick]] in a replay after the first match ended 00..\n\n=== 1975\u20132003 ===\nIn 1975 Drogheda F.C. amalgamated with Drogheda United to form Drogheda United F.C. and the 1975\u201376 season saw an improvement in fortunes on the field as they finished sixth in the league and they also reached the FAI Cup Final for the second time, this time losing 1\u20130 to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]]. For the next three seasons, quite the opposite at what had happened before, they finished in third place. During these seasons Drogheda United also achieved two club records \u2013 their biggest league victory (7\u20131 v [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]]) and [[Cathal Muckian]] scoring 21 league goals in a season. The club then endured another tough spell in the league finishing in the bottom half for the next five seasons bar the 1982\u201383 season when they managed to achieve their second highest ever league placing of second-place (they later won the league in 2007) finishing sixteen points behind [[Athlone Town A.F.C.|Athlone Town]]. They did win their first ever trophy during these seasons also, the [[League of Ireland Cup]] in the 1983\u201384 season.\n\nThe 1984\u201385 season saw the introduction of the [[League of Ireland First Division]] to begin the following season with Drogheda United among the four clubs who were relegated from the Premier Division but in this season also Drogheda United entered European Competition for the first time where they were destroyed against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] First Round 14\u20130 on aggregate. They remained in the First Division until the 1988\u201389 season when they went up as First Division Champions. Their joy was short-lived, however, as the following season they were relegated although this time they achieved promotion at the first time of asking. In the next two seasons Drogheda battled bravely against relegation surviving by one point and on goal difference in the respective seasons. However, they were relegated for the third time in the 1993\u201394 season.\n\nDrogheda United were very much becoming a [[yo-yo club]], swapping divisions every season between the 1993\u201394 and 2000\u201301 seasons when in 2000\u201301 they finished a disappointing ninth in the ten-team First Division. In 2002\u201303 they were promoted to the Premier Division under [[Harry McCue]] and were there until the 2016 season, as they got relegated in 2015, coming in twelfth place.\n\n=== 2003\u20132008: Paul Doolin ===\nIn 2003, McCue was sacked as manager of Drogheda United. Paul Doolin took over and upped the standard of training and fitness levels. However, he found that to compete with the big clubs like [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] he would need a professional squad. In 2004, he made the squad fully professional and gave part-time players the option to turn professional or leave the club. The change to full-time saw the club's fortunes drastically improve. They won their first [[FAI Cup]] in [[2005 FAI Cup|2005]], beating [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] in the final and won back-to-back [[Setanta Cup]]s in [[2006 Setanta Sports Cup|2006]] and [[2007 Setanta Sports Cup|2007]].\n\nThey also qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]] for the 2006\u201307 season thanks to their 2005 FAI Cup success. This time they fared better than in their first foray into Europe as they defeated [[HJK Helsinki]] 4\u20132 on aggregate in the First Qualifying Round and were just eliminated 11\u201310 in an epic penalty shoot-out in the next round against [[IK Start]] of [[Norway]]. They were also in the UEFA Cup Qualifying stages for the 2007\u201308 campaign, losing to [[Helsingborgs IF]] in the second round.\n\nUnited finally won the League of Ireland for the first time in 2007, beating Cork City 2\u20131 at United Park with three games to go. [[Guy Bates]] scored the winning goal for Drogheda that day, shooting himself into Drogs folklore. Drogheda were dominant in the league, only losing three games and winning the title by seven points.\n\nThe league win meant that Drogheda would be playing in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] Qualifiers for the first time in their history in the 2008\u201309 season. They succeeded in their first qualifier against [[FC Levadia Tallinn|Levadia Tallinn]], beating them 3\u20131 on aggregate. They played the Second Qualifying Round against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] which, they ended up losing 4\u20133 on aggregate. In the first a late goal for [[Kiev]] secured a 2\u20131 victory at [[Dalymount Park]]. In the second game, an early Kiev goal after 13 minutes seemed to have finished the tie, but remarkably, on 41 minutes, Drogheda were awarded a penalty. [[Shane Robinson (footballer)|Shane Robinson]] stepped up and slotted home the spot-kick. Drogheda then worked tirelessly trying to get the second goal, but they gave away a penalty on 72 minutes, which was converted. 2\u20131 down, it seemed the tie was over now. Amazingly however, [[Graham Gartland]] scored an 88th-minute goal to make it 2\u20132. [[Adam Hughes (footballer)|Adam Hughes]] got a further chance when he had an open goal, but miskicked the ball and it flew over the bar. Then, [[Shane Robinson (footballer)|Shane Robinson]] hit a shot from a tight angle which hit the post. Despite Drogheda's late rally, they were knocked out by [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].\n\n=== 2008 (Examinership) ===\n[[File:Hanaphy DUFC Huskie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Darragh Hanaphy in action for Drogheda United April 2011|Darragh Hanaphy in action for Drogheda United, April 2011]] In October 2008 Drogheda went into [[examinership]], like Cork City, after failing to pay back a \u20ac500,000 loan to the Revenue Commissioners and  \u20ac10,000 rent to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] for their use of [[Dalymount Park]] in their [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] Qualifiers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/drogs-need-500000-to-avoid-extinction-1559879.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905235538/http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/drogs-need-500000-to-avoid-extinction-1559879.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 September 2012 |work=Irish Independent |title=Drogs need \u20ac500,000 to avoid extinction |date=3 December 2012 }}</ref> Their plans for a new \u20ac35m stadium fell through and in November 2008 they were deduced 10 points. After successfully raising money through various fund raisers arranged by the supporters, the club escaped extinction in January 2009 when a judge ruled in Drogheda's favour to the delight of the teary eyed chairman Vincent Hoey.\n\n=== 2009\u20132011 ===\nIn the 2009 season Drogheda got off to a difficult start. Due to bankruptcy, the club went part-time and lost their entire league-winning squad, and manager, [[Paul Doolin]], who took over [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]]. Former [[Cork City Football Club|Cork]] and [[Longford Town F.C.|Longford]] boss [[Alan Mathews]] took over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2009/0204/1224240566254.html|title=Mathews appointed Drogheda boss|author=|date=|website=irishtimes.com}}</ref> Mathews had to sign a side of semi-pros and free agents. Drogheda were in the bottom half of the table for the whole season, despite some shock wins. On 10 November 2009 they beat Bray Wanderers 2\u20130 in a relegation play-off.\n\nThe 2010 season was disastrous on and off the pitch. Drogheda started terribly and after a 6\u20130 loss at the hands of [[Sligo Rovers F.C|Sligo Rovers]] on 15 May, Alan Mathews quit his managerial post. The club appointed youth team coach and Drogheda native Darius Kierans as manager even though he had yet to complete his Europa A licence which is an FAI requirement for league managers. After much objection from the FAI, Kierans became Director of Football and the club appointed Paul Lumsden as Interim Manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/manager-chaos-may-see-drogs-licence-revoked-2232500.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802082703/http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/manager-chaos-may-see-drogs-licence-revoked-2232500.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |work=Irish Independent |title=Manager chaos may see Drogs' licence revoked |date=30 November 2012 }}</ref> Lumsden took the team for only one game before resigning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/valuable-three-points-for-drogheda-463996.html|title=Valuable three points for Drogheda|author=|date=2 July 2010 |website=breakingnews.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113132806/https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0705/267639-dundalk_drogheda/\n|archivedate=13 November 2018 |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2010/0705/267639-dundalk_drogheda/ |title=Dundalk 2-1 Drogheda United |accessdate=13 November 2018 |website=[[RTE.ie]] |date=5 July 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Brian Donnelly was then appointed as the second Interim Manager of the season but he too resigned in September. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drogheda-independent.ie/sport/soccer/donnelly-named-as-drogheda-manager-2258199.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729140146/http://www.drogheda-independent.ie/sport/soccer/donnelly-named-as-drogheda-manager-2258199.html|url-status=dead|title=Donnelly named as Drogheda manager - Soccer, Sport - Drogheda-Indepen\u2026|date=29 July 2012|archivedate=29 July 2012|website=drogheda-independent.ie}}</ref> On 27 September, the club announced the imminent arrival as manager of another former player \u2013 [[Bobby Browne (footballer born 1962)|Bobby Browne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_018.php|title=Drogheda United Football Club - Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.droghedaunited.ie|access-date=28 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111600/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_018.php|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite finishing rock-bottom of the table with only four wins and nine draws (a total of 21 points) in 2010 and being relegated, Drogheda United were reprieved after the extinction of [[Sporting Fingal F.C.|Sporting Fingal]] in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0214/premierdivision.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Drogheda back in the Premier Division |date=14 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215125710/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0214/premierdivision.html |archivedate=15 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== 2011\u20132013: Mick Cooke ===\n\n[[Mick Cooke (football manager)|Mick Cooke]], manager of [[Monaghan United F.C.|Monaghan]] took over as manager on 27 February 2011, becoming the sixth Drogheda manager in nine months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2011/0228/1224291008747.html|title=Drogheda turn to Cooke as Browne leaves the club|author=|date=|website=irishtimes.com}}</ref> Cooke appointed former Drogs goalkeeper, [[Robbie Horgan]] as his assistant, and inherited the players who had been signed by Bobby Browne to play in the First Division so hopes weren't high. After an awful start, Drogheda beat local rivals Dundalk 2\u20131 in Oriel Park. The win turned their season around and despite operating on the lowest playing budget in the league, Drogheda managed to avoid relegation. Shortly after, Cooke put pen to paper on a new three-year deal with the club.\n\nIn 2012, Cooke and Horgan set about building on the foundations of the previous season. Cooke finally had his own team of players and despite having less than a tenth of the budget that the club had in the glory days under Paul Doolin, Drogheda have had their best season by far since then. Between 1 June and 4 August, Drogheda went on an eight-game winning run in the league and cup \u2013 the longest winning run in the club's history. On 23 September 2012, Drogheda won the final of the [[EA Sports Cup]] beating Shamrock Rovers 3\u20131<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2012/0922/338646-shamrock-rovers-drogheda-united/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | title=Shamrock Rovers 1\u20133 Drogheda United | date=22 September 2012}}</ref> \u2013 their first trophy since 2007. The icing on the cake came on 19 October when Drogheda beat the newly crowned 2012 League Champions Sligo Rovers 2\u20131 at United Park through a first half Alan McNally header and 88th minute Brian Gannon chip to qualify for the Europa League. \n\nIn 2013, Drogheda reached three finals and despite failing to add to their silverware, reflected the club's rise under Cooke. They were beaten 7\u20131 in the Setanta Cup final by [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and 2\u20130 in the League Cup final by the same opponent. They also reached their first [[2013 FAI Cup Final|FAI Cup final]] since winning the competition in 2005, narrowly losing out on a 3-2 thriller against [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]]. In the Europa League qualifying rounds that season, the club were drawn against Swedish giants [[Malm\u00f6 FF|Malm\u00f6]] and only lost by a single goal over two legs after a battling performance. Despite this success, Mick Cooke left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nIn November 2015 Drogheda appointed former UCD manager Peter Mahon as manager of the club. John Gill took over as assistant manager with Mark Kinsella ex Irish international remaining part of the coaching staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/drogheda-united-announce-pete-mahon-as-new-manager-34188432.html|title=Drogheda United announce Pete Mahon as new manager - Independent.ie|author=|date=|website=independent.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2015 League of Ireland Premier Division|2015]], Drogheda were relegated after finishing bottom of the league. The following season they finished second in the [[2016 League of Ireland First Division|First Division]], achieving promotion through the play-offs, before being relegated again after another 12th-place finish in 2017. In 2018, [[Tim Clancy]] was appointed as manager after the departure of Mahon\n\n== The Claret & Blue Club ==\nIn response to the economic difficulties facing the country, a group of supporters established The Claret & Blue Club in June 2009 with the aim of providing a steady income stream to Drogheda United FC. Supporters who join the Claret & Blue Club donate at least \u20ac5 per week to the club, and in return, they receive a membership card entitling them to discounts of up to 10% in a range of local businesses, including restaurants, tile shops, shoe shops and many more. Each member is also entered in a monthly prize draw, with a top prize every month of a sun holiday courtesy of Panorama Holidays. Other prizes include hotel vouchers, tickets to Irish World Cup qualifier games, betting vouchers etc. Publicity on the Derek Mooney Show on RT\u00c9 Radio one and full-page ads in the Drogheda Independent and Drogheda People resulted in a surge of membership, and after only four weeks of existence, the Claret & Blue Club was in a position to bring in over \u20ac35,000 to the club annually, with membership figures rising daily. It was hoped that the Claret & Blue Club will take full ownership of the club in 2010 and run the club similar to the way [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] is run by the Shamrock Rovers Members Club. However the target of 500 members was not reached and membership levels settled at just over half that target.\n\n=== Share Issue ===\nIn January 2011, a Claret and Blue Club steering committee announced new plans for a share issue. It was hoped that 200 shares would be sold at \u20ac1000 each and that this new revenue would provide stability for 2011\u201312 and allow the club to finally become a supporter-owned community club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2011/february/news_001.php|title=Drogheda United Football Club - Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.droghedaunited.ie|access-date=15 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705093111/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2011/february/news_001.php|archive-date=5 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In early 2012 Drogheda United became a member's owned and run club when a new company Drogheda Utd FC Limited was formed consisting of members who paid \u20ac1,000 each into the company.\n\n== Emblem ==\n[[File:Drogheda crest.svg|65px|thumb|right|Drogheda coat of arms.]] The crest of Drogheda United is an adaptation of the [[Drogheda#History#town arms|town arms of Drogheda]], which feature the [[heraldic]] symbols of a [[Star (heraldry)|star]] and [[crescent]] over a shield depicting St. Lawrence's Gate, [[Lion (heraldry)|three lions]] and a ship.

His own crest was the source of the star and crescent symbols, which he had taken from the [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s standard of Governor [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]] after capturing [[Cyprus]].\n\nThey share the same club colours as [[Trabzonspor]], in [[Turkey]] \u2013 and in 2011 the two sides became sister clubs. These were given in favor of the [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdulmejid I]]'s great assistance during the [[Irish famine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_022.php|title=Drogheda United Football Club - Welcome|website=www.droghedaunited.ie|access-date=9 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004114628/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/news/2010/september/news_022.php|archive-date=4 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsoccer.com/forum/showthread.php?p=21924602|title=Trabzonspor 2010/2011 season {R}|author=|date=|website=bigsoccer.com}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n'''Drogs''' is a nickname for supporters of the club. When the name '''Drogs''' started to appear in two newspapers in the late 1990s, The Sun and the Drogheda Leader, the club wrote to the Drogheda Leader Newspaper demanding that the name not be used adding that it was not used in the stadium by the fans. The newspaper argued that it had not invented the name and that the fans in the '''shed''' side of the stadium often sing a song called '''Super Drogs'''. The club considered the name was degrading and was purely a Drogheda Leader nickname not used by the supporters. In recent years the club officially embraced the nickname.\n\nThe most vocal supporters stand on \"the shed side\" of [[United Park]]. Many Drogs attend every home match while a smaller group travel around the country to support the team at away matches. They sing football/Drogheda United chants, wear club colours (claret and blue), wave banners and flags and generally try to help lift the team and demonstrate fervent support. One section of their supporters are known as 'F45U' (Famous 45 [[Ultras]].)\n\nDrogheda United Supporters Club (DUSC) was formed more than two years ago. Its main aim is to promote Drogheda United F.C. throughout the community. The supporters club works hand-in-hand with the football club in various ways including contributing to the match day programme, organising fund raising nights like quizzes and race nights and by organising buses to away matches.<ref>[http://www.droghedaunited.ie/Scripts/SupportersClub.asp Supporters Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823193003/http://www.droghedaunited.ie/Scripts/SupportersClub.asp |date=23 August 2007 }}, ''Drogheda United Official Website'', 2007.

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings.  \n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in [[Theravada]] Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. \u015a\u0101riputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist [[Vinaya|monastic rules]], as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmasenapati''; Pali: ''Dhammasen\u0101pati''). \u015a\u0101riputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]]. His female counterpart was [[Khema|K\u1e63em\u0101]].{{sfn|Krey|2010|p=19}} \n\n== Background ==\nAccording to [[Buddhist texts]], when a fully enlightened [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] arrives in the world, he always has a set of chief disciples.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=31-32}} For the current Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]], his chief male disciples were \u015a\u0101riputra and [[Maudgalyayana|Maudgaly\u0101yana]], while his chief female disciples were [[Khema|K\u1e63em\u0101]] and [[Utpalavar\u1e47\u0101]].{{sfn|Mahathera|1998|p=235}}{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=376-377}} According to the [[Buddhava\u1e43sa]], all Buddhas of the past followed this pattern of selecting two chief male disciples and two chief female disciples.{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=455}} German Buddhist scholar monk [[Nyanaponika Thera]] states that the reason Buddhas always select two chief disciples is to balance responsibilities according to each disciple's specific skills.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=67}}\n\nAccording to the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]], in the distant past \u015a\u0101riputra was born a wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] named Sarada who gave away his wealth to become an ascetic who developed a large following. At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

Some Mahayana sutras portray him as great Buddhist disciple while others portray him as a counterpoint with insufficient understanding of Mahayana doctrine, representative of the [[Hinayana]] tradition.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Irons|2007|p=428}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=1904}} Buddhist studies scholar [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.]] describes the latter as \"intentional irony\" aimed at depicting how profound Mahayana doctrine is by showing that even the wisest \"Hinayana\" disciple had difficulty understanding it.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=51}} Migot states that it is significant that \u015a\u0101riputra has a continuity in Mahayana texts, as most of the Buddha's great disciples are usually absent from Mahayana literature.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=537}} Migot credits the importance of \u015a\u0101riputra in the early ''Vatsiputriya'' Buddhist school with why \u015a\u0101riputra often appeared in Mahayana texts.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=538}}\n\nIn the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalak\u012brti S\u016btra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is depicted as being unable to grasp [[Mahayana]] doctrines such as [[Nondualism|non-duality]] and [[Emptiness (Buddhism)|emptiness]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} In the sutra, a goddess listening to [[Vimalakirti|Vimalak\u012brti]] scatters flowers which fall onto \u015a\u0101riputra's robes.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} Not wanting to break the monastic rules, which forbid decorating oneself with flowers, he tries to remove them but is unable to.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} The goddess then accuses \u015a\u0101riputra of being attached to the duality of what is proper and improper.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} Later in the sutra, \u015a\u0101riputra asks that if the goddess is so spiritually advanced, why doesn't she transform out of her female state, indicative of cultural sexism.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} The goddess responds by using her powers to switch bodies with \u015a\u0101riputra to demonstrate that male and female is just an illusion because, according to Mahayana doctrine, all things are empty and so male and female don't really exist.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}\n\nIn the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'', \u015a\u0101riputra is portrayed as being unable to understand the ultimate meaning of ''[[prajnaparamita]]'' and instead must be instructed by the disciple [[Subh\u016bti]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} According to Buddhist scholar [[Edward Conze]], the sutra depicts \u015a\u0101riputra as being preoccupied with dualities, making him unable to grasp the true meaning of ''prajnaparamita''.{{sfn|Conze|1983|p=5}} In the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is one of the principal interlocutors, asking questions and being instructed.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=17,25,28,29}} Conze states that \u015a\u0101riputra has to be instructed in this sutra because, despite his great wisdom, ''prajnaparamita'' doctrine was too advanced for his comprehension.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=56}} The ''[[Da zhidu lun]]'' commentary to the sutra describes \u015a\u0101riputra as someone who pursued the [[bodhisattva]] path in a past life but gave up and turned to the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka]]'' path after donating his eye to a beggar who threw the eye on the ground.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}[[File:Lotus Sutra (Chokokan).jpg|thumb|Japanese depiction of the Lotus Sutra, where \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the Buddha to preach.|alt=|left]]\u015a\u0101riputra plays a major role in the [[Heart Sutra]], where the teaching is directed at him. \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the teaching of the sutra by asking the Mahayana bodhisattva [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] how to practice [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom]].{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=52}} Avalokite\u015bvara's response to \u015a\u0101riputra, then makes up the body of the sutra.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=49}} When Avalokite\u015bvara finishes the sutra the Buddha shows approval of the teaching, and \u015a\u0101riputra, Avalokite\u015bvara, and the audience then rejoice.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=121}} In the [[Saddharmapundarika|Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha starts talking about the higher wisdom of [[buddhas]] and his use of skillful means (Sanskrit: [[Up\u0101ya|''up\u0101ya'']]) to teach the Dharma, which leaves the arhats in the assembly confused.{{sfn|Lopez|2016|p=12-13}} \u015a\u0101riputra then asks the Buddha to explain his teachings for the benefit of other beings, prompting the Buddha to teach the ''Lotus Sutra''.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=38}}  Later in the sutra, the Buddha explains that \u015a\u0101riputra had followed the [[bodhisattva]] path in past lives but had forgotten and followed the ''\u015ar\u0101vaka'' path in this life.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=46}} The Buddha then assures \u015a\u0101riputra that he will also achieve buddhahood and declares that \u015a\u0101riputra will become the future Buddha Padmaprabha.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=47}} In the

as well as Maudgaly\u0101yana's relics could be found in the Indian city of [[Mathura]] in stupas built by King [[Asoka]].{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=215}} However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports have confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Lieutenant Fred. C. Maisey discovered a pair of sandstone boxes with encased bone fragments inside during an excavation of one of the [[Sanchi Stupa|stupas]] in the city of [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], with \u015a\u0101riputra's and Maudgaly\u0101yana's names inscribed on them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} \u015a\u0101riputra's casket contained pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was part of \u015a\u0101riputra's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Another excavation by Cunningham and Maisey at st\u016bpas in the nearby town of [[Satdh\u0101ra]] found another pair of caskets with encased bone fragments with the two chief disciples' names inscribed.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} Cunningham concluded that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of King Asoka, who then redistributed them in stupas throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have redistributed the relics of the Buddha and his leading disciples and built stupas such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}}\n\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and eventually loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} However, historian Torkel Brekke argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britian along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} In the early 20th century, Buddhist organizations in India and Burma began pressuring the British government to return the relics to India, where they can be properly venerated. The British government conceded and transferred the relics to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in 1947 in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations. In 1949, the relics were sent to India where they were put on tour around northern India before being enshrined in Sanchi in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} In 1950, the relics were sent on tour to Burma, with Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] later asking India for a portion of the relics. Indian Prime Minister [[Nehru]] agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma where they were enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:BACC - Bangkok - 2017-11-02 (008).jpg|thumb|Image of the Buddha with his chief disciples at [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]]. \u015a\u0101riputra is traditionally depicted on the right side of the Buddha while Maudgaly\u0101yana is traditionally depicted on the left.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} |alt=]]\nAs the chief disciple of the Buddha, \u015a\u0101riputra is considered to be a particularly important figure in Buddhism, especially in the [[Theravada]] tradition. According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings.  \n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in [[Theravada]] Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. \u015a\u0101riputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist [[Vinaya|monastic rules]], as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmasenapati''; Pali: ''Dhammasen\u0101pati''). \u015a\u0101riputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]]. His female counterpart was [[Khema|K\u1e63em\u0101]].{{sfn|Krey|2010|p=19}} \n\n== Background ==\nAccording to [[Buddhist texts]], when a fully enlightened [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] arrives in the world, he always has a set of chief disciples.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=31-32}} For the current Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]], his chief male disciples were \u015a\u0101riputra and [[Maudgalyayana|Maudgaly\u0101yana]], while his chief female disciples were [[Khema|K\u1e63em\u0101]] and [[Utpalavar\u1e47\u0101]].{{sfn|Mahathera|1998|p=235}}{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=376-377}} According to the [[Buddhava\u1e43sa]], all Buddhas of the past followed this pattern of selecting two chief male disciples and two chief female disciples.{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=455}} German Buddhist scholar monk [[Nyanaponika Thera]] states that the reason Buddhas always select two chief disciples is to balance responsibilities according to each disciple's specific skills.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=67}}\n\nAccording to the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]], in the distant past \u015a\u0101riputra was born a wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] named Sarada who gave away his wealth to become an ascetic who developed a large following. At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

Some Mahayana sutras portray him as great Buddhist disciple while others portray him as a counterpoint with insufficient understanding of Mahayana doctrine, representative of the [[Hinayana]] tradition.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Irons|2007|p=428}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=1904}} Buddhist studies scholar [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.]] describes the latter as \"intentional irony\" aimed at depicting how profound Mahayana doctrine is by showing that even the wisest \"Hinayana\" disciple had difficulty understanding it.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=51}} Migot states that it is significant that \u015a\u0101riputra has a continuity in Mahayana texts, as most of the Buddha's great disciples are usually absent from Mahayana literature.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=537}} Migot credits the importance of \u015a\u0101riputra in the early ''Vatsiputriya'' Buddhist school with why \u015a\u0101riputra often appeared in Mahayana texts.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=538}}\n\nIn the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalak\u012brti S\u016btra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is depicted as being unable to grasp [[Mahayana]] doctrines such as [[Nondualism|non-duality]] and [[Emptiness (Buddhism)|emptiness]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} In the sutra, a goddess listening to [[Vimalakirti|Vimalak\u012brti]] scatters flowers which fall onto \u015a\u0101riputra's robes.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} Not wanting to break the monastic rules, which forbid decorating oneself with flowers, he tries to remove them but is unable to.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} The goddess then accuses \u015a\u0101riputra of being attached to the duality of what is proper and improper.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} Later in the sutra, \u015a\u0101riputra asks that if the goddess is so spiritually advanced, why doesn't she transform out of her female state, indicative of cultural sexism.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} The goddess responds by using her powers to switch bodies with \u015a\u0101riputra to demonstrate that male and female is just an illusion because, according to Mahayana doctrine, all things are empty and so male and female don't really exist.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}\n\nIn the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'', \u015a\u0101riputra is portrayed as being unable to understand the ultimate meaning of ''[[prajnaparamita]]'' and instead must be instructed by the disciple [[Subh\u016bti]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} According to Buddhist scholar [[Edward Conze]], the sutra depicts \u015a\u0101riputra as being preoccupied with dualities, making him unable to grasp the true meaning of ''prajnaparamita''.{{sfn|Conze|1983|p=5}} In the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is one of the principal interlocutors, asking questions and being instructed.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=17,25,28,29}} Conze states that \u015a\u0101riputra has to be instructed in this sutra because, despite his great wisdom, ''prajnaparamita'' doctrine was too advanced for his comprehension.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=56}} The ''[[Da zhidu lun]]'' commentary to the sutra describes \u015a\u0101riputra as someone who pursued the [[bodhisattva]] path in a past life but gave up and turned to the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka]]'' path after donating his eye to a beggar who threw the eye on the ground.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}[[File:Lotus Sutra (Chokokan).jpg|thumb|Japanese depiction of the Lotus Sutra, where \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the Buddha to preach.|alt=|left]]\u015a\u0101riputra plays a major role in the [[Heart Sutra]], where the teaching is directed at him. \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the teaching of the sutra by asking the Mahayana bodhisattva [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] how to practice [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom]].{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=52}} Avalokite\u015bvara's response to \u015a\u0101riputra, then makes up the body of the sutra.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=49}} When Avalokite\u015bvara finishes the sutra the Buddha shows approval of the teaching, and \u015a\u0101riputra, Avalokite\u015bvara, and the audience then rejoice.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=121}} In the [[Saddharmapundarika|Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha starts talking about the higher wisdom of [[buddhas]] and his use of skillful means (Sanskrit: [[Up\u0101ya|''up\u0101ya'']]) to teach the Dharma, which leaves the arhats in the assembly confused.{{sfn|Lopez|2016|p=12-13}} \u015a\u0101riputra then asks the Buddha to explain his teachings for the benefit of other beings, prompting the Buddha to teach the ''Lotus Sutra''.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=38}}  Later in the sutra, the Buddha explains that \u015a\u0101riputra had followed the [[bodhisattva]] path in past lives but had forgotten and followed the ''\u015ar\u0101vaka'' path in this life.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=46}} The Buddha then assures \u015a\u0101riputra that he will also achieve buddhahood and declares that \u015a\u0101riputra will become the future Buddha Padmaprabha.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=47}} In the

as well as Maudgaly\u0101yana's relics could be found in the Indian city of [[Mathura]] in stupas built by King [[Asoka]].{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=215}} However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports have confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Lieutenant Fred. C. Maisey discovered a pair of sandstone boxes with encased bone fragments inside during an excavation of one of the [[Sanchi Stupa|stupas]] in the city of [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], with \u015a\u0101riputra's and Maudgaly\u0101yana's names inscribed on them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} \u015a\u0101riputra's casket contained pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was part of \u015a\u0101riputra's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Another excavation by Cunningham and Maisey at st\u016bpas in the nearby town of [[Satdh\u0101ra]] found another pair of caskets with encased bone fragments with the two chief disciples' names inscribed.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} Cunningham concluded that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of King Asoka, who then redistributed them in stupas throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have redistributed the relics of the Buddha and his leading disciples and built stupas such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}}\n\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and eventually loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} However, historian Torkel Brekke argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britian along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} In the early 20th century, Buddhist organizations in India and Burma began pressuring the British government to return the relics to India, where they can be properly venerated. The British government conceded and transferred the relics to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in 1947 in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations. In 1949, the relics were sent to India where they were put on tour around northern India before being enshrined in Sanchi in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} In 1950, the relics were sent on tour to Burma, with Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] later asking India for a portion of the relics. Indian Prime Minister [[Nehru]] agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma where they were enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:BACC - Bangkok - 2017-11-02 (008).jpg|thumb|Image of the Buddha with his chief disciples at [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]]. \u015a\u0101riputra is traditionally depicted on the right side of the Buddha while Maudgaly\u0101yana is traditionally depicted on the left.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} |alt=]]\nAs the chief disciple of the Buddha, \u015a\u0101riputra is considered to be a particularly important figure in Buddhism, especially in the [[Theravada]] tradition. According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

Hampered by his bullet wound, Hagan was grabbed by several members of the crowd who witnessed the shooting and physically beaten before policemen arrived and arrested Hagan at the scene.

He said that one of his accomplices distracted Malcolm&nbsp;X's bodyguards by starting an argument about having been pickpocketed. When the bodyguards moved toward the diversion and away from Malcolm&nbsp;X, a man with a shotgun stepped up to him and shot him in the chest.

From 1988, Hagan was in a [[work release]] program, which allowed him to seek work outside prison and required him to spend only two days a week in a [[Lincoln Correctional Facility|minimum-security facility]] in Manhattan. The rest of the week, he was allowed to stay with his wife and children. Among other places, he worked at the Crown Heights Youth Collective, as a counselor at a homeless shelter on [[Wards Island]], and in a fast-food restaurant. Hagan was granted parole in March 2010 and was released from prison at the end of April.
