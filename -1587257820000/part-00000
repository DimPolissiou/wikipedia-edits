He is also the owner of the Slovak football club [[AS Trencin]]. \n\nHe currently is the creator and owner of Fitshape, which sells professional sport supplementation for athletes.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[The Hague]] to a Chinese father and a Dutch Mother, Ling began his career with his hometown team [[ADO Den Haag|Den Haag]] in the 1973-74 and 1974-75 seasons. He joined [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the 1975\u201376 season. Ajax won the [[Eredivisie]] title in the 4 seasons 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380 and 1981-82, and reached 4 Dutch Cup finals in the 4 consecutive seasons 1977-78, 1978-79, 1979-80 and 1980-81, but these feats paled in comparison to the European successes during the early 1970s, when Ajax, with players like [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Johan Neeskens]], [[Johnny Rep]], [[Ruud Krol]], [[Barry Hulshoff]], [[Horst Blankenburg]], [[Arie Haan]], [[Gerrie M\u00fchren]] and [[Piet Keizer]] won 3 European Cups I in the 1970-71, 1971-72 and 1972-73 seasons. Only in 1979-80 Ajax was able to reach a \u00bd final European Cup I for champions. Ling played together with players like [[Ruud Krol]], [[Frank Arnesen]], [[Soren Lerby]], [[Simon Tahamata]] and [[Martin van Geel]], and later also with [[Wim Kieft]], [[Frank Rijkaard]], [[Gerald Vanenburg]], [[Jesper Olsen]] and [[Sonny Silooy]]. In December 1981, [[Johan Cruijff]] returned to Ajax. The team was built around him, and Ling lost his place in the starting line-up to [[Gerald Vanenburg]]. He moved to [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]] in July 1982, and then [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in July 1984. He spent a year with Ajax's bitter rival [[Feyenoord]] for the 1985\u201386 season and moved back to Den Haag for one season before retiring.\n\n==International career==\nLing played for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] team during qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 1980]].

{"title_page": "Copper in health", "text_new": "[[Image:Copper metabolism.png|thumb|Normal absorption and distribution of copper. Cu = copper, CP = [[ceruloplasmin]], green = ATP7B carrying copper.]]\n[[Copper]] is an essential [[trace element]] that is vital to the health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]]). In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport.\n\nCopper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing. Copper also helps to neutralize \"[[free-radical]]s\", which can cause severe damage to cells.\n\nCopper's essentiality was first discovered in 1928, when it was demonstrated that rats fed a copper-deficient milk diet were unable to produce sufficient red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hart |first1=E.

New York: International Copper Association{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its [[liver]] during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_13|pages=451\u2013478|pmid=23595680 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the [[trans-Golgi network]] to the proteins [[dopamine beta-monooxygenase]], [[peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase]], [[lysyl oxidase]], and [[tyrosinase]], depending on the cell type.

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion. These symptoms abate when the high copper food source is no longer ingested.\n\nIn 1996, the International Program on Chemical Safety, a World Health Organization-associated agency, stated \"there is greater risk of health effects from deficiency of copper intake than from excess copper intake.\" This conclusion was confirmed in recent multi-route exposure surveys.<ref name=\"Steven S 2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Georgopoulos |first1=Panos G |last2=Wang |first2=Sheng Wei |last3=Georgopoulos |first3=Ioannis G |last4=Yonone-Lioy |first4=Mary Jean |last5=Lioy |first5=Paul J |title=Assessment of human exposure to copper: A case study using the NHEXAS database |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397\u2013409 |year=2006 |pmid=16249795 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500462 }}</ref>\n\nThe health conditions of non-genetic copper deficiency and copper excess are described below.\n\n===Copper deficiency===\nThere are conflicting reports on the extent of deficiency in the U.S. One review indicates approximately 25% of adolescents, adults, and people over 65, do not meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for copper.<ref name=pmid17454552/> Another source states less common: a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 1.11 and 1.54&nbsp;mg/day, respectively.

In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport.\n\nCopper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing.

New York: International Copper Association{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its [[liver]] during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_13|pages=451\u2013478|pmid=23595680 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

Copper transport at the cellular level involves the movement of extracellular copper across the [[cell membrane]] and into the cell by specialized transporters.<ref name=pmid20077283/> In the bloodstream, copper is carried throughout the body by [[albumin]], [[ceruloplasmin]], and other proteins. The majority of blood copper (or serum copper) is bound to ceruloplasmin. The proportion of ceruloplasmin-bound copper can range from 70-95% and differs between individuals, depending, for example, on hormonal cycle, season, and copper status. Intracellular copper is routed to sites of synthesis of copper-requiring [[enzymes]] and to [[organelles]] by specialized proteins called [[metallochaperones]].<ref name=pmid10425169>{{cite journal |last1=Camakaris |first1=J. |last2=Voskoboinik |first2=I. |last3=Mercer |first3=J.F. |title=Molecular Mechanisms of Copper Homeostasis |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=261 |issue=2 |pages=225\u201332 |year=1999 |pmid=10425169 |doi=10.1006/bbrc.1999.1073 }}</ref><ref name=\"Harris2000\">{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Edward D. |title=Cellular copper transport and metabolism |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=291\u2013310 |year=2000 |pmid=10940336 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.20.1.291 }}</ref><ref name=\"Harris2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Edward D. |title=Copper Homeostasis: The Role of Cellular Transporters |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=281\u20135 |year=2001 |pmid=11570430 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb07017.x }}</ref> Another set of these transporters carries copper into subcellular compartments.<ref name=\"Harris2001\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bertinato |first1=Jesse |last2=L'Abb\u00e9 |first2=Mary R. |title=Maintaining copper homeostasis: regulation of copper-trafficking proteins in response to copper deficiency or overload |journal=The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=316\u201322 |year=2004 |pmid=15157936 |doi=10.1016/j.jnutbio.2004.02.004 }}</ref> Certain mechanisms exist to release copper from the cell.

Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the [[trans-Golgi network]] to the proteins [[dopamine beta-monooxygenase]], [[peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase]], [[lysyl oxidase]], and [[tyrosinase]], depending on the cell type.

Nuts, including [[peanut]]s and [[pecan]]s, are especially rich in copper, as are grains such as [[wheat]] and [[rye]], and several fruits including [[lemon]]s and [[raisin]]s. Other food sources that contain copper include [[cereal]]s, [[potato]]es, [[pea]]s, [[red meat]], [[mushroom]]s, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as [[kale]]), and fruits ([[coconut]]s, [[papaya]] and [[apple]]s).

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion.

Much attention has focused on the potential consequences of copper toxicity in normal and potentially susceptible populations. Potentially susceptible subpopulations include [[hemodialysis]] patients and individuals with chronic liver disease. Recently, concern was expressed about the potential sensitivity to liver disease of individuals who are [[heterozygote]] carriers of Wilson disease genetic defects (i.e., those having one normal and one mutated Wilson copper ATPase gene) but who do not have the disease (which requires defects in both relevant genes).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=George J. |title=Editorial: Is heterozygosity for a Wilson's disease gene defect an important underlying cause of infantile and childhood copper toxicosis syndromes? |journal=The Journal of Trace Elements in Experimental Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2000 |pages=249\u201354 |doi=10.1002/1520-670X(2000)13:3<249::AID-JTRA1>3.0.CO;2-L |hdl=2027.42/35050 }}</ref> However, to date, no data are available that either support or refute this hypothesis.\n\n===Acute exposures===\nIn case reports of humans intentionally or accidentally ingesting high concentrations of copper salts (doses usually not known but reported to be 20\u201370&nbsp;grams of copper), a progression of symptoms was observed including abdominal pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea, [[tachycardia]], respiratory difficulty, [[hemolytic anemia]], [[hematuria]], massive gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, and death.\n\nEpisodes of acute gastrointestinal upset following single or repeated ingestion of drinking water containing elevated levels of copper (generally above 3\u20136&nbsp;mg/L) are characterized by nausea, vomiting, and stomach irritation.

Increased serum copper or ceruolplasmin levels are not reliably associated with copper toxicity as elevations in concentrations can be induced by inflammation, infection, disease, malignancies, pregnancy, and other biological stressors. Levels of copper-containing enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and diaminase oxidase, vary not only in response to copper state but also in response to a variety of other physiological and biochemical factors and therefore are inconsistent markers of excess copper status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=David B |title=Copper intake and assessment of copper status |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=67 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=1041S\u20131045S |year=1998 |pmid=9587149 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/67.5.1041S }}</ref>\n\nA new candidate biomarker for copper excess as well as deficiency has emerged in recent years.

Formerly, he was a [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] of [[British Columbia]] following the [[2009 British Columbia general election|2009]] and [[2013 British Columbia general election|2013]] provincial elections, for the riding of [[Maple Ridge-Mission]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nDalton previously ran as a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] candidate in [[Burnaby\u2014New Westminster]] in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]], losing to incumbent MP [[Peter Julian]].\n\nPrevious to his time in elected office, Dalton worked as a teacher in [[School District 42 Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows]] at both the elementary and high school levels. He caused much ire among fellow staff when he crossed union picket lines in 2005, midway through the BC teacher's strike.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mapleridgenews.com/opinion/letters-which-is-it-mr-dalton/|title=Letters: Which is it, Mr. Dalton? on Marc Dalton crossing the picket lines in 2005|last=Opinion|first=|date=2014-09-09|website=Maple Ridge News|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nIn Dalton's first term as [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|MLA]], he served as parliamentary secretary for independent schools, a position created by former [[Christy Clark|British Columbia Premier Christy Clark]] in 2012. Having been a retired public school teacher for [[School District 42 Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows]], he had this to say on the appointment. \"I think this position of parliamentary secretary is a reflection of the emphasis the government places on family choice -- choice of education,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2014/07/15/BC-Libs-Privatize-Education/|title=Why BC Libs Push to Privatize Public Education|last=Tieleman|first=Bill|date=2014-07-15|website=The Tyee|language=English|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> On the privatization of school system's in British Columbia, Dalton further added more than 11 per cent of the student population is enrolled in independent schools, and because tuition fees are paid by parents, the education ministry saves money.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mapleridgenews.com/news/maple-ridge-mla-dalton-to-help-in-education/|title=Maple Ridge MLA Dalton to help in education|date=2012-09-06|website=Maple Ridge News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> \n\nDalton was on the Experience the Fraser steering committee, a trails and tourism project.<ref>[http://www.bclocalnews.com/tri_city_maple_ridge/mapleridgenews/news/122539334.html Experience the Fraser Project Progressing]</ref> \n\nIn 2012, Dalton campaigned to have the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberals]] name changed as he felt it was confusing for voters who may not know it is a centre-right wing party. \u201cThere is still a lot of confusion with name brand. People who are federal Conservatives, such as myself, they just have a hard time voting (BC) Liberal,\" Dalton said, \"Whether it\u2019s the BC Liberals or some new name party, or the Christy party, or whatever it is they come up with, the people are not going to be fooled by it.

Time to start moving Canada back to work?\" The post was removed after being up for several minutes. When questioned about the incident by media organizations, Dalton's office responded with the following, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the hundreds of Canadians who have lost loved ones because of COVID-19. I personally have an uncle in a care home who I love dearly who has contracted coronavirus,\" [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] MP [[Scott Duvall]], party critic for Senior's policy has called on Dalton to issue a public apology. \"I think it's actually disgusting. It's ruthless, it's heartless and it's a disrespectful comment, I'm not sure if he would be saying that if his parents were in the same situation.\" Duvall said, \"I just don't know where his mind was to say something as idiotic as that.\" As of April 14, 2020, Dalton has released no apology.\n\n== Recall Campaigns ==\nOver Dalton's tenure as [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] for [[Maple Ridge-Mission|Maple Ridge - Mission]], there had been two campaigns to recall and \"fire\" the politician from office. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bclocalnews.com/news/dalton-facing-another-recall-campaign/|title=Dalton facing another recall campaign|last=News|date=2015-04-05|website=BC Local News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> In 2011, the group Maple Ridge FightHST, led by Wilf McIntyre and Corisa Bell<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mapleridgenews.com/news/bell-wont-seek-third-term-on-maple-ridge-council/|title=Bell won\u2019t seek third term on Maple Ridge council see FightHST campaign|last=News|first=|date=2018-07-11|website=Maple Ridge News|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>, launched the first push garnering roughly 2500 signatures, short of the 14,882 or 40% of required voters to begin the recall process. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.missioncityrecord.com/news/second-dalton-recall-stalls/|title=Second Dalton recall stalls|date=2015-05-26|website=Mission City Record|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Dalton attempted to undermine the process claiming locals thought they were signing a petition to halt the passage of the [[Harmonized sales tax|Harmonized Sales Tax]] in BC. Then campaign organizer Wilf McIntyre said the group could have collected enough names to oust Dalton. In defense of the petition McIntyre claimed, \u201cWe were very specific because we had to be.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.missioncityrecord.com/news/dalton-checking-recall-list/|title=Dalton checking recall list|date=2011-04-14|website=Mission City Record|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nFour years later, Dalton faced a second recall attempt in 2015. <ref name=\":0\" /> The campaign began shortly after he decided to take a failed second run for a federal seat with the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and sit as an independent MLA. Organizer Yvonne Hale said regarding the representatives run, \u201cI think that goes to show that he\u2019s [Dalton] more focused on himself than his constituents.\" The call to remove Dalton from office ended up stalling following allegations of interference from his supporters and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|B.C. Liberal Party]]. Recall spokesperson Jennifer Heighton says interruptions began at the [[Maple Ridge Home Show]] where people with \"Marc Dalton observer\" name tags would argue and scare off potential signers from their booth. Heighton further claims observers would stand close to canvassers and pretend to be part of the conversation. Claims of harassment also took place at Maple Ridge's downtown Haney Farmer's Market and other City locations where they would discourage the public from signing the petition. Heighton and the group called for an investigation by [[Elections BC|Elections B.C.]] regarding the matter: \u201cRegardless of the Maple Ridge recall withdrawal, it is critically important that the legislation be respected and the right of democratic dissent be upheld. That\u2019s why we want Elections B.C. to fully investigate this situation.\u201d Dalton defended the use of observers and scrutineers claiming they are not mentioned in the recall act, there\u2019s nothing that prohibits them. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nHe holds degrees from [[Simon Fraser University]], specifically a BA in French and MA in Translation Studies with an emphasis on xenolinguistics.

He caused much ire among fellow staff when he crossed union picket lines in 2005, midway through the BC teacher's strike.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mapleridgenews.com/opinion/letters-which-is-it-mr-dalton/|title=Letters: Which is it, Mr. Dalton? on Marc Dalton crossing the picket lines in 2005|last=Opinion|first=|date=2014-09-09|website=Maple Ridge News|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nIn Dalton's first term as [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|MLA]], he served as parliamentary secretary for independent schools, a position created by former [[Christy Clark|British Columbia Premier Christy Clark]] in 2012.

People who are federal Conservatives, such as myself, they just have a hard time voting (BC) Liberal,\" Dalton said, \"Whether it\u2019s the BC Liberals or some new name party, or the Christy party, or whatever it is they come up with, the people are not going to be fooled by it.

When questioned about the incident by media organizations, Dalton's office responded with the following, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the hundreds of Canadians who have lost loved ones because of COVID-19. I personally have an uncle in a care home who I love dearly who has contracted coronavirus,\" [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] MP [[Scott Duvall]], party critic for Senior's policy has called on Dalton to issue a public apology. \"I think it's actually disgusting.

Organizer Yvonne Hale said regarding the representatives run, \u201cI think that goes to show that he\u2019s [Dalton] more focused on himself than his constituents.\" The call to remove Dalton from office ended up stalling following allegations of interference from his supporters and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|B.C. Liberal Party]]. Recall spokesperson Jennifer Heighton says interruptions began at the [[Maple Ridge Home Show]] where people with \"Marc Dalton observer\" name tags would argue and scare off potential signers from their booth. Heighton further claims observers would stand close to canvassers and pretend to be part of the conversation. Claims of harassment also took place at Maple Ridge's downtown Haney Farmer's Market and other City locations where they would discourage the public from signing the petition. Heighton and the group called for an investigation by [[Elections BC|Elections B.C.]] regarding the matter: \u201cRegardless of the Maple Ridge recall withdrawal, it is critically important that the legislation be respected and the right of democratic dissent be upheld. That\u2019s why we want Elections B.C. to fully investigate this situation.\u201d Dalton defended the use of observers and scrutineers claiming they are not mentioned in the recall act, there\u2019s nothing that prohibits them. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nHe holds degrees from [[Simon Fraser University]], specifically a BA in French and MA in Translation Studies with an emphasis on xenolinguistics.
