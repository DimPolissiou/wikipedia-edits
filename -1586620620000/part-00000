It is part of the [[community (Wales)|community]] of [[Penmaenmawr]] which has a population of 4,353.<ref name=ons/> The electoral ward of '''Capelulo''' which includes Dwygyfylchi had a population of 1,485 in 2011. It was formerly part of the historic county of [[Caernarfonshire]].\n\nDwygyfylchi is also well known for the Gladstone where you can experience the true taste of Wales. The local celebrity chef Archie cooks up some of the villages finest dishes using only welsh produce.\n\n==Name==\nThe name Dwygyfylchi is [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for \"the meeting of two [[semicircle]]s\", in reference to the nearby promontories of Penmaenbach and Penmaenmawr. The origin of the name [[Capelulo]], the original settlement, lies in its association with [[Saint Ulo]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Geography==\nApproximately half of Dwygyfylchi forms the most northern tip of the [[Snowdonia National Park]]. Half a mile to the south-east of the main village lies Capelulo, which lies at the foot of the picturesque [[Sychnant Pass]], which connects Dwygyfylchi to Conwy. The Pensychnant Conservation Centre and Nature Reserve is nearby.<ref>[http://www.pensychnant.co.uk/ \"Pensychnant Conservation Centre and Nature Reserve\" at V]</ref> Two headlands separate Dwygyfylchi & [[Penmaenmawr]] from its neighbours. Towards the east Penmaenbach divides Dwygyfylchi from the neighbouring town of [[Conwy Morfa]] and the [[Conwy Valley]] leading up to [[Betws-y-Coed]]. To the west the larger headland of Penmaenmawr divides them from the town of [[Llanfairfechan]] and the wider coastal plain extending to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]]. To the south an arc of hills and uplands extends east to west from the latter to Penmaen Mawr, beginning with Yr Allt Wen above Dwygyfylchi, Bwlch Sychnant (the old road crosses this pass to [[Conwy]]) and Pen-sychnant at Capelulo. The rounded hill of Foel Lys, Gwddw Glas (Green Gorge), Bryn Derwydd and the head of Cwm Graiglwyd and finally Penmaenmawr itself.  The coastal plain itself is nearly divided by Trwyn-yr-Wylfa, which also marks the boundary between the \"Hen Bentra\" or \"Old Village\" of Dwygyfylchi and Capelulo in the east and Pant-yr-afon and Penmaenan in the west . Finally two small rivers flow through the area. The first and larger, [[Afon Gyrrach]], runs for about 4 miles (6.4&nbsp;km) from the northern slopes of Tal-y-Fan to the sea near Penmaenbach, passing through Nant Ddaear-y-llwynog (\"Fairy Glen\") and the old villages of Dwygyfylchi and Capelulo. The second, [[Afon Pabwyr]], runs down from wooded Cwm Graiglwyd then under the town centre, Pant-yr-afon, to the beach.\n\n==History==\nThe surrounding landscape is dotted with [[palaeolithic]], [[mesolithic]], [[neolithic]], [[bronze age]] and [[iron age]] structures, including [[Dolmen|cromlechs]], [[standing stone]]s, [[stone circle]]s and [[hill forts]]. Notable iron age hill forts in the area are [[Caer Seion]], at the summit of [[Conwy]] mountain, and nearby [[Braich-y-Dinas]], one of the largest Iron Age hill-forts in Europe (and comparable with [[Tre'r Ceiri]] near [[Trefor]] on the [[Ll\u0177n peninsula]]), at the summit of [[Penmaenmawr]]. Nothing remains of Braich-y-Dinas, however, as the last remnants were destroyed in the 1920s. The 1868 National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland notes: \"In this neighbourhood are a great number of antiquities, consisting of cromlechs and single upright stones, the remains of a British camp, with ditches and ramparts, &c.\"<ref>[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/CAE/Dwygyfylchi/index.html Genuki]</ref>\n\n[[File:Penmaen-mawrmap 1947.png|thumb|right|A map of Penmaenmawr from 1947]]\nAbout a mile or so north of Dwygyfylchi & Penmaenmawr lies [[Llys Helig]].

The area is also an important producer of commodity grain, pigs, and cotton.\n\nIn Fuliang County there are some large-scale tea plantations and processing facilities.<ref name=\"tea2\"/> The tea of Fuliang County is well known in China. [[Bai Juyi]], a famous poet of [[Tang Dynasty]] China, wrote a poem that says \"My merchant loved money more than family, he left me to go to Fuliang to buy tea last month\". This suggests that one thousand years ago Fuliang was already well known for its tea. In 1915, Fuliang's \"Fuhong\" brand tea won a golden prize in the [[World's Fair]] in Panama.<ref name=\"tea2\"/>\n\nLeping City, the \"Vegetable Township of [[Northern and southern China|South China]]\", is a major vegetable growing and processing area for Jiangxi Province even for China. Its vegetable output and sales are important to the agricultural economy of Jiangxi Province. In 2007, Leping had 1.7 million hectares under cultivation that produced a total output of 620,000 tons. The [[Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China|Agriculture Ministry of China]] also designated Leping as a demonstration zone for \"pollution-free\" vegetable production.<ref name=\"tea2\"/>\n\n==Transportation==\nJingdezhen is the most important transportation hub in the northeast region of Jiangxi province.  Historically, Jingdezhen's main communication route was via the Chang River. It could ship its porcelain down the Chang to [[Poyang Lake]] and connected there with the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Hukou County]], Jiangxi Province. From there the porcelain could get to the coast for export. Today, water is far less important for transporting goods. Roads, the railway and airlines have grown to be more important forms of transport of goods and people.\n\n===Road===\n*[[G35 Jinan\u2013Guangzhou Expressway|<span style=\"background:green; color:white;\">G35</span>]], running from [[Jinan]], [[Shandong]] to [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]],\n*[[G56 Hangzhou\u2013Ruili Expressway|<span style=\"background:green; color:white;\">G56</span>]] Hangzhou-Ruili Highway from [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]] to [[Ruili]], [[Yunnan]],\n*[[China National Highway 206|<span style=\"background:red; color:white; \">G206</span>]], running from [[Yantai]], Shandong to [[Shantou]], Guangdong.\n\n===Rail===\nThe [[Anhui\u2013Jiangxi Railway]] connects Jingdezhen to many key cities in China such as Shanghai, [[Nanjing]], [[Jinan]], [[Qingdao]], [[Hefei]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Xiamen]], [[Nanchang]], [[Kunming]] and [[Guiyang]], etc. In addition, the [[Jiujiang]]- Jingdezhen-[[Quzhou]] Railway is under construction. In the near future, the two rail lines will intersect in Jingdezhen, and make the city an important rail transportation hub in Jiangxi Province and East China. The Jingdezhen Railway Station is located in the city center and is under the control of the Nanchang Railway Bureau.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:jdzair.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Airlines Routes of Jingdezhen]]\n[[Jingdezhen Luojia Airport]] is located at Luojian Village, northwest of Jingdezhen city, and about {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} from the city's downtown.\n\n[[Civil Aviation Administration of China|CAAC]] statistics show that in 2008 Jingdezhen Airport served 189,256 passengers.

The area is also an important producer of commodity grain, pigs, and cotton.\n\nIn Fuliang County there are some large-scale tea plantations and processing facilities.<ref name=\"tea2\"/> The tea of Fuliang County is well known in China. [[Bai Juyi]], a famous poet of [[Tang Dynasty]] China, wrote a poem that says \"My merchant loved money more than family, he left me to go to Fuliang to buy tea last month\". This suggests that one thousand years ago Fuliang was already well known for its tea.

Historically, Jingdezhen's main communication route was via the Chang River. It could ship its porcelain down the Chang to [[Poyang Lake]] and connected there with the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Hukou County]], Jiangxi Province. From there the porcelain could get to the coast for export. Today, water is far less important for transporting goods.

She believes that a woman loses her natural traits after enrolling in a grooming school. Her mother persistently pressurizes her to marry and to shape herself into an ideal, well-groomed, upper-class wife; to fulfil her desire to see her daughter get married after constant proposal rejections. She believes that Meera can only be socially acceptable by changing herself by going to Soni Kudi Academy. However, Meera is strongly against the idea and believes that she should only marry someone who loves her the way she is.\n\nVivaan is a rich, business tycoon and a NRI from London. He comes back to India on his sister Amaya's wish and also in search of his long-lost mother, Pammi Kapoor, who left them as a child. Although he has hatred for his biological mother; he secretly yearns to meet her. Vivaan's trust issues stem from his abandonment issues and he promises himself to never marry. Vivaan does not believe in marriage whereas Meera believes that she wants her life partner to love and understand her imperfections.\n\nMeera's alliance is fixed with Sumair (Paramvir Cheema) but in a comedy of errors, she ends up meeting Vivaan at the airport. Their opinionated personalities clash and they argue. It is later revealed that Vivaan is the landlord of Kapoor Mansion, of which the Dhingras are caretakers. While Vivaan and Amaya live in the same house, Meera's wedding preparations begin. While Vivaan believes Meera to be a gold digger, Meera hates Vivaan's egoistic personality. Meera secretly harbors the desire to play a qualifying kabaddi match on her wedding day. Vivaan initially befriends Meera to extract information about a bangle in her possession, which resembles his mother's, but over time unbeknownst to themselves they start caring for each other. Sumair, who initially comes across as understanding of Meera's stand, is slowly revealed to be a man who has his own expectations from his wife-to-be. Meera complies for the sake of her family and finding no support from her fiance, decides to groom herself. Vivaan and Meera on the other hand constantly bicker, but Vivaan ends up saving her from sticky situations that she lands in owing to her wedding preparations. While Sumair is gradually shown to be a shallow minded person, Vivaan comes across as a liberal, open-minded individual albeit with his own imperfections.\n\nSumair falls in love with Meera's cousin Silky. He has no regard for Meera and to pull himself out of the wedding, he makes a fake MMS clip of Meera and Vivaan and airs it on the wedding day. He manipulates Meera into believing that it was Vivaan who made the video for which she slaps Vivaan. Meera is abused and bad mouthed by village goons but Vivaan saves her. They marry to save Meera's dignity. But they decide to divorce after their wedding as they're not happy. However they decide to hide their impending divorce from Meera's family till situation cools down. Meanwhile Vivaan's step mother and business partner Roma Kapoor (Shilpa Saklani) comes to live in Kapoor Mansion with the agenda of breaking the couple's relationship. However Meera and Vivaan become friends and gradually start falling in love but this irks Roma. She creates many misunderstandings between the couple and manipulates Vivaan, who already has contempt for his birth mother, into believing that Pammi Kapoor wants to kill Amaya and him. Meera refuses to believe this and this becomes the root cause for clashes and separation between the couple. The divorce keeps coming up between them. Eventually Pammi Kapoor is revealed as Soni Kudi's owner Mrs. Singh. Roma is exposed and all allegations against Pammi are quelled and they reunite as one happy family. \n\nVivaan and Meera decide to express their love for each other but unfortunately happy times do not last long and Pammi and Amaya are kidnapped. Vivaan is blackmailed and a series of events lead to Pammi's death and Amaya being in coma. Vivaan misunderstands Meera and blames her for interfering in the kidnapping mess and thus causing Pammi's death. Meera tries very hard to prove her innocence to Vivaan but to no avail and he decides to divorce her. He starts hating on Meera when she refuses to divorce him and troubles her to no end with harsh words and actions. But a series of events lead Meera and Vivaan to the alleged kidnapper where Meera saves Vivaan from being shot at, by taking the bullet herself. Vivaan's misunderstandings are cleared and tries to win back her love, berating himself for believing a wrong and contrived version of events. Unfortunately, Meera's father gives Meera the ultimatum to choose between himself and Vivaan. Meera chooses her father forcefully and is also hurt because of Vivaan's past actions, but this does not stop Vivaan. He enters the Dhingra household as a cook, to prove he will do anything for Meera. Meera's father creates many problems for Vivaan and continuously insults him. He puts up with it for Meera's sake. Meera's father finds a good groom for her who is also his best friend's son. This marks the entry of Sunny in their lives. Meanwhile Meera makes the mistake of agreeing to the wedding in order to teach Vivaan a lesson without realizing the storm that is about to enter their lives.\n\nSunny pretends to be a good guy, who wants to save Meera and Vivaan's love but they soon discover that he is Vivaan's stepbrother, and the actual kidnapper who killed his mother by hatred . Vivaan and Meera fight against Sunny with courage, he tries to separate them by sending Vivaan to jail and blackmailing Meera but in vain. He is arrested by police later.\n\nVivaan and Meera have a peaceful life. Meanwhile he gifts his late mother's Soni Kudi academy to Meera. But his past starts haunting him. Paromita was Vivaan's friend, she was in love with him but he never loved her. Meera gets visions about how Vivaan was responsible for Paromita's death and decides to expose him in front of the world for causing an innocent's death and for hiding it. She stages a drama narrating the sequence of events at Soni Kudi academy but later Vivaan proves himself innocent. But Paromita's sister Tulika comes for revenge from Vivaan as he had refused to marry her sister. The show takes a supernatural turn but at the end they reunite\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Aditi Sharma (actor)|Aditi Sharma]] as Meera Dhingra\n* [[Arjit Taneja]] as Vivaan

The key to understanding DBT is analogous to understanding the difference between an x-ray and CT.  Specifically, one is three dimensional whereas the other is flat. A mammogram usually takes two x-rays of each breast from different angles whereas digital tomosynthesis creates a 3-dimensional picture of the breast using x-rays. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/dig_tomosynth|title=Digital Tomosynthesis|date=2016-06-23|website=Breastcancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn DBT, like conventional mammography, compression is used to improve image quality and decreases radiation dose.  The laminographic imaging technique dates back to the 1930s and belongs to the category of geometric or linear tomography.<ref>Dedicated Computed Tomography of the Breast: Image Processing and Its Impact on Breast Mass Detectability. Qing Xia. 2007. {{ISBN|0549663193}} pp.4</ref> Because the data acquired are very high resolution (85 \u2013 160 micron typical ), much higher than CT, DBT is unable to offer the  narrow slice widths that CT offers (typically 1-1.5&nbsp;mm). However, the higher resolution detectors permit very high in-plane resolution, even if the Z-axis resolution is less. The primary interest in DBT is in breast imaging, as an extension to [[mammography]], where it offers better detection rates .<ref>Smith AP, Niklason L, Ren B, Wu T, Ruth C, Jing Z.

This ensures that the area biopsies correlates to the abnormality seen on mammogram. It\u2019s called stereotactic since it utilizes images taken from two different angles of the same location.

The key to understanding DBT is analogous to understanding the difference between an x-ray and CT.  Specifically, one is three dimensional whereas the other is flat. A mammogram usually takes two x-rays of each breast from different angles whereas digital tomosynthesis creates a 3-dimensional picture of the breast using x-rays. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/dig_tomosynth|title=Digital Tomosynthesis|date=2016-06-23|website=Breastcancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn DBT, like conventional mammography, compression is used to improve image quality and decreases radiation dose.  The laminographic imaging technique dates back to the 1930s and belongs to the category of geometric or linear tomography.<ref>Dedicated Computed Tomography of the Breast: Image Processing and Its Impact on Breast Mass Detectability. Qing Xia. 2007. {{ISBN|0549663193}} pp.4</ref> Because the data acquired are very high resolution (85 \u2013 160 micron typical ), much higher than CT, DBT is unable to offer the  narrow slice widths that CT offers (typically 1-1.5&nbsp;mm). However, the higher resolution detectors permit very high in-plane resolution, even if the Z-axis resolution is less. The primary interest in DBT is in breast imaging, as an extension to [[mammography]], where it offers better detection rates .<ref>Smith AP, Niklason L, Ren B, Wu T, Ruth C, Jing Z.

The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}).

The university offers undergraduate and [[graduate degrees]], including [[Doctorate|doctoral]] and [[professional degree]]s and [[Online degree|online masters]] as well.\n\nThe university was founded in 1829 and is the tenth largest private university in the country in terms of full-time students. It is internationally known for its science, computer, engineering, and art programs, as well as for the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]], a leading deaf-education institution that provides educational opportunities to more than 1000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students. RIT is known for its Co-op program that gives students professional and industrial experience. It has the fourth oldest and one of the largest Co-op programs in the world.\n\nRIT student population is approximately 19,000 students, about 16,000 undergraduate and 3000 graduate. Demographically, students attend from all 50 states in the United States and from more than 100 countries around the world. The university has more than 4000 active faculty and staff members who engage with the students in a wide range of academic activities and research projects. It also has branches abroad, its global campuses, located in China, Croatia, United Arab Emirates ([[Dubai]]), and Kosovo.\n\nThirteen RIT alumni and faculty members have been recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rit.edu/about-rit#key-facts| title = Key facts about RIT|website=rit.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe university began as a result of an 1891 merger between '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um''', a [[literary society]] founded in 1829 by [[Nathaniel Rochester|Colonel Nathaniel Rochester]] and associates, and '''The Mechanics Institute''', a Rochester school of practical [[Vocational education|technical training]] for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including [[Henry Lomb|Captain Henry Lomb]], co-founder of [[Bausch & Lomb]]. The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}). Its art department was originally located in the [[Bevier Memorial Building]]. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the [[New York (state)|New York]] Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university's campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, an unanticipated donation of $3.27&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3270000|1961|r=0}}}} today) from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT's dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new {{convert|1300|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus several miles south along the east bank of the [[Genesee River]] in suburban [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]].

Their house is turned upside down when they realize that Raven's son Booker has inherited the same psychic abilities as his mother.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Raven's Home episodes}}\n{{:List of Raven's Home episodes}}\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as Raven Baxter,<ref name=\"Walt Disney Television Press Show Bios\" /> the single mother of twins Nia and Booker, who works as a fashion designer for dogs and later as a car rental service driver. It is revealed that prior to the series, Raven had gotten divorced from Devon Carter, an ex-boyfriend from high school, and now lives with Chelsea and her son in Chicago.

Afterward, Garrett was arrested for tax evasion and ended up having an affair with the federal agent who arrested him.

It is recorded that he was the most accomplished and warlike chief that ever held sway in the castle. This assumption might be owing to the nearness of his time, whilst those remote might grow dim as ages melt away. His military talents were of a high order; his chivalrous character everywhere commanded respect, and his devoted interest in behalf of his people endeared him to all. Historians have written of him in unstinted praise. His reign covers a very interesting period, though varied and much given to tumult. He fell in a clan battle with the MacDonalds of Islay, on August 5, 1598 ... His issue by Margaret, daughter of William Cunningham, sixth earl of Glencairn, was Eachann Og, his eldest son and successor, Lachlan Og, of whom the family of Torloisk was descended, Gillean, married to Mary the elder, Allan, married to Mary the younger, both daughters of John Dubh of Morvern, and Charles. The only daughter married Hector MacLean of Lochbuy, the first Protestant of his family also. | url=https://archive.org/details/ahistoryclanmac00maclgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistoryclanmac00maclgoog/page/n231 224] |isbn= }}</ref>\nM\u00f3r or Mor translates as ''big'' in English, or ''magnus'' in Latin, when added to a name in [[Scottish Gaelic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb27.html |title=M\u00f3r  |accessdate=2009-04-17 |quote=great, Irish m\u00f3r, Old Irish m\u00f3r, m\u00e1r, Welsh mawr, Old Welsh, Cornish maur, Breton meur, Gaulish -m\u00e2r\u00f3s; Gothic -m\u00ears, famed, m\u00earian, proclaim, Old High German m\u00e2ri, famed, -mar in Germanic names German m\u00e4rchen, a tale, Norse moerr, famous; Slavonic -meru  (Vladimir, etc.); Latin merus, English mere.

It lies between [[Strasbourg]] and [[Obernai]].\n\n==Geography==\nKrautergersheim is located in the district of S\u00e9lestat-Erstein and the township of Obernai. The village is located close to the A 35 connecting Barr and Strasbourg. There are two main areas:\n*To the west, cabbages, potatoes and corn are raised in loess terraces.\n*To the east are country meadows, forests, and wet heaths; hemp and flax are also cultivated.\n\nThe commune occupies an area of {{convert|6.4|km2|abbr=on}}. The nearest villages are Meistratzheim, Innenhei, Hindhead and Illkirch-Graffenstaden, the largest, {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} to the south-west.\n\nThe Ehn River (formerly Ergers) flows through the area.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe commune, known as Ergersheimas, is mentioned as existing in 736 in a document of the Abbey of Murbach Eringisashaim, written in 778. The Abbess of Sainte-Odile, Herrad of Landsberg, mentions the commune in his writings.\n\nAccording to humanist Wimpheling, ''Kraut'', the German word for cabbage, was added to the name in the sixteenth century to distinguish it from a similar-named resort near Molsheim.\n\n==History==\nRoman remains and Merovingian tombs attest to the site being occupied during Roman times. Germans settled the area in the sixth and seventh centuries. Various abbeys mention the village: [[Murbach Abbey]] in 735, Hohenbourg Abbey (Mont Sainte-Odile) in 778 and Baumgarten Abbey in 1050.\n\nThe commune was destroyed in 1587 during the War of Religion; it was burned by passing mercenaries. During the Thirty Years' War the troops of General Ernst von Mansfeld pillaged and sacked the churches and abbeys, abused the peasants and burned the village. In 1632 Swedish King Gustav II Adolf came to the aid of German Protestants, and occupied Alsace. \n\nIn 1634, two years after the death of their king, the Swedes left Alsace. From the fourteenth century, many noble families ruled the commune. The Berckheim family had a castle that was later purchased by Bernard Frederick Turckheim and his wife Lili Schoenemann. At the fall of the Empire, Austrian units occupied Krautergersheim for three years.\n\nCommune activities include potato farming, the industrial production of sauerkraut, and building a strong artisan and commercial industry.\n\n===Sauerkraut===\n[[File:Krautergersheim 003.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The sign reads \"Capital of the Sauerkraut\".]]\nKrautergersheim is known as the [[Sauerkraut|Choucroute]] (sauerkraut) capital of the region.
