The club was established in 1890 and, from the Surrey Senior League, joined the [[Metropolitan League]] in the 1964\u201365 season. They are the current holders of the [[FA Vase]], having won the 2018/19 competition, with the previous best prior to 2019\u2019s success was reaching the quarter-finals of the Vase twice. In the 2005\u201306 season, they played in Division Two of the [[Isthmian League]], but as a result of the restructuring of non-league football, they were sent across to play in the [[Combined Counties Football League|Combined Counties League]] Premier Division. In the 2010\u201311 season, Chertsey Town finished 2nd in the league and were promoted to the [[Southern League Division One Central]] ahead of local rivals [[Guildford City]], following a dispute over the suitability of Guildford's ground for higher-level play.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Beginnings===\nOrganised football was evident in Chertsey well over a century ago but county affiliation did not take place immediately. The official founding of the club took place in 1890 when matches were played in the West Surrey League. The first success came in 1897 when the Surrey Junior Cup was secured. A one-year gap took place before football resumed in the same competition which eventually became the East and West Surrey League. A further halt in football took place during the [[World War I|Great War]] but soon after, in 1919, the club joined the Surrey Intermediate League where it stayed, uneventfully, until 1939 and a further break. An invitation to become founder members of the Surrey Senior League was not taken up in 1923 but membership was later assumed, on attaining senior status in 1946.\n\n===1950s\u20131980s===\nAlthough Chertsey gained membership of the [[Surrey Senior League]] immediately after the Second World War, it was not until the 1959\u201360 season that success came with the league championship. This was repeated twice in the next three years, a halcyon period when the League Cup was also won on three occasions. Due to the static nature of amateur football in those days, the club could not progress to the preferred [[Corinthian League]] so, in 1963, it was controversially{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} decided to turn professional and enter the Metropolitan League. Although an entertaining three years were then enjoyed, the cost was too much to bear and a return to the lower levels of the Greater London League for one season occurred before a further shift to the [[Spartan League]] was made in 1966\n\nIndifferent results then dogged the club for almost two decades. This situation was briefly relieved in 1974\u201375 when the club were league and league cup runners up to an up-and-coming [[Farnborough Town F.C.|Farnborough Town]]. Meanwhile, the fabric of the club was being built up behind the scenes and despite lack of prominence on the park, movement was made via the London Spartan (1975\u201376) and [[Athenian League|Athenian]] leagues through to the Isthmian with a place in Division Two South in 1984. Instant relegation to the Combined Counties League was suffered but a rejuvenated side won promotion back to Isthmian ranks within the year whilst winning the League Cup on the way.\n\n===1980s on===\nThe club was initially rewarded with good league positions but not high enough for further promotion. The worst season after returning to the Isthmians came when the two Division Twos were split in 1991 and a place in the new Division Three had to suffice. This position was quickly rectified with a runner\u2019s up slot in 1992. The club also reached the quarter finals of the FA Vase, emulating a similar performance in 1987\u201388. One year later, 102 points and a runner\u2019s up promotion place to Division One was nailed. The League Cup was also secured together with the Carlsberg Trophy in the same campaign along with the League Charity Shield.\n\nOnly one campaign was required in Division One before further promotion, to the Premier Division was secured behind Boreham Wood and Worthing. The first season in the Premier Division was one of consolidation with nine points to spare but the second was far more difficult. Although a late rally was experienced, it proved insufficient to avoid the drop to Division One. Two subsequent Division One campaigns saw the side comfortably occupy positions just over the half way mark each time but the third proved too difficult after a very poor first half of the season. Improvement was made but not enough to stave off relegation to competition in Division Two.\n\nRelatively respectable positions were attained for the next two seasons and then a return to Division One, taking a place in the revised south section in the Isthmian re-organisation. The side was not able to compete at this level and suffered relegation to Division Two in 2003. After a slow start, a serious challenge was made the following season but the club had to settle for a position just outside a promotion place. A similar situation was created over the next two seasons with the side finishing in sixth place on both occasions. However, with the dissolution of the division, the club was allocated to the [[Combined Counties Football League|Combined Counties League]] in 2006.\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Chertsey Town finished second in the Combined Counties League Premier Division with 90 points, 3 points behind the league winners, [[Guildford City]]. However, owing to problems with Guildford City's ground, Chertsey Town were promoted into the [[Southern League Division One Central]] in their place. After a very encouraging start to the Southern League campaign, manager Spencer Day and the team then struggled. Relegation was suffered the following season back to the Combined Counties League where the team now plays. Chertsey Town won the Combined Counties League Premier Division in the 2018-19 season with 6 games to go, after securing their first appearance in the [[FA Vase]] final played at Wembley Stadium. On 19 May 2019, Chertsey defeated [[Cray Valley Paper Mills F.C.|Cray Valley Paper Mills]] 3-1 (after extra time) to lift the FA Vase for the first time in their history.<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48314552|title=FA Vase: Chertsey Town win FA Vase final in extra time|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 May 2019}} </ref>\n\n==Ground==\nChertsey Town play their home games at [[Alwyns Lane]], Chertsey, Surrey, KT16 9DW.\n\nThe club has played at various locations within the parish (Willow Walk, Free Prae Road, Staines Lane and Chilsey Green) before settling down at the present home in 1929. The suffix \u2018Town\u2019 was added to its title some 21 years later. The ground was donated by Sir Edward Stern as a football ground to the \u2018premier club in the parish\u2019. Next door, a similar trust provides facilities for Chertsey Cricket Club. The main stand was constructed in the mid-1950s. Covered enclosures exist on the other three sides of the playing area. The original clubhouse added in 1960 and was rebuilt in 1976 with later additions.\n\n===Attendances===\n'''Record Attendance:''' 2,150 Vs Aldershot, 2003\n\n== Players ==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|28 August 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Player Profiles |url=http://www.chertseytownfc.co.uk/player-profiles/4594690073 |publisher=Chertsey Town FC |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref>\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player | pos=GK | nat=ENG | name=Nick Bennett          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=GK | nat=ENG | name=Lewis Gallifent       | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=GK | nat=ENG | name=Nick Jupp             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Danny Bennell         | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Sam Flegg             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Fred Hill             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Lewis Jackson         | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Michael Kinsella      | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Michael Peacock       | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Quincy Rowe           | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Mason Welch-Turner    | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Andy Crossley         | other=                    }}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=GHA | name=Leon Dadey            | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Scott Day             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Oliver Duffy          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Casey Maclaren        | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Kevin Maclaren        | other= [[player-manager]] }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Sam Murphy            | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Jake Baxter           | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Tino Carpene          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Lewis Driver          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=BGR | name=[[Lubomir Guentchev]] | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Bryan Taylor          | other=                    }}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Nickname==\nChertsey Town\u2019s nickname, the \u2018Curfews\u2019 is derived from a locally famous bell that hangs in the nearby St. Peters Church.

The original clubhouse added in 1960 and was rebuilt in 1976 with later additions.\n\n===Attendances===\n'''Record Attendance:''' 2,150 Vs Aldershot, 2003\n\n== Players ==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|28 August 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Player Profiles |url=http://www.chertseytownfc.co.uk/player-profiles/4594690073 |publisher=Chertsey Town FC |accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref>\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player | pos=GK | nat=ENG | name=Nick Bennett          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=GK | nat=ENG | name=Lewis Gallifent       | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=GK | nat=ENG | name=Nick Jupp             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Danny Bennell         | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Sam Flegg             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Fred Hill             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Lewis Jackson         | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Michael Kinsella      | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Michael Peacock       | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Quincy Rowe           | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=DF | nat=ENG | name=Mason Welch-Turner    | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Andy Crossley         | other=                    }}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=GHA | name=Leon Dadey            | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Scott Day             | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Oliver Duffy          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Casey Maclaren        | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Kevin Maclaren        | other= [[player-manager]] }}\n{{fs player | pos=MF | nat=ENG | name=Sam Murphy            | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Jake Baxter           | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Tino Carpene          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Lewis Driver          | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=BGR | name=[[Lubomir Guentchev]] | other=                    }}\n{{fs player | pos=FW | nat=ENG | name=Bryan Taylor          | other=                    }}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Nickname==\nChertsey Town\u2019s nickname, the \u2018Curfews\u2019 is derived from a locally famous bell that hangs in the nearby St. Peters Church.

Truman]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]].

Roosevelt]]. Defeating attempts to drop him from the ticket, Truman won the presidential nomination at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]]. The Democratic convention's civil rights plank caused a walk-out by several Southern delegates, who launched a [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] \"[[Dixiecrat]]\" ticket led by Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]]. The Dixiecrats hoped to win enough [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to force a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where they could extract concessions from either Dewey or Truman in exchange for their support. Truman also faced a challenge from the left in the form of former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], who launched the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] and challenged Truman's confrontational [[Cold War]] policies. Dewey, who was the leader of his party's moderate eastern wing and had been the 1944 Republican presidential nominee, defeated Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] and other challengers at the [[1948 Republican National Convention]].\n\nTruman's feisty campaign style energized his base of traditional Democrats, consisting of most of the white South, as well as Catholic and Jewish voters; he also fared surprisingly well with Midwestern farmers.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=DiSalvo |title=The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972 |journal=Journal of Policy History |year=2010 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=269\u2013299 |jstor= |doi=10.1017/S0898030610000114 }}</ref> Dewey ran a low-risk campaign and largely avoided directly criticizing Truman. With the three-way split in the Democratic Party, and with Truman's low approval ratings, Truman was widely considered to be the underdog in the race. Virtually every prediction (with or without public opinion polls) indicated that Truman would be defeated by Dewey.\n\nDefying predictions of his defeat, Truman won the 1948 election, garnering 303 electoral votes to Dewey's 189. Truman won 49.6% of the popular vote compared to Dewey's 45.1%, while the third party candidacies of Thurmond and Wallace each won less than 3% of the popular vote, with Thurmond carrying four southern states. Truman's surprise victory was the fifth consecutive presidential win for the Democratic Party, the longest winning streak for either party since the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]]. With simultaneous success in the [[1948 United States elections|1948 congressional elections]], the Democrats regained control of both houses of Congress, which they had lost in 1946. Thus, Truman's election confirmed the Democratic Party's status as the nation's majority party.<ref>Paul Kleppner et al.

Spirits were low; the Republicans had taken control of both houses of the [[United States Congress]] and a majority of state governorships during the 1946 mid-term elections, and the public opinion polls showed Truman trailing Republican nominee Dewey, sometimes by double digits. Furthermore, some liberal Democrats had joined [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s new Progressive Party, and party leaders feared that Wallace would take enough votes from Truman to give the large Northern and Midwestern states to the Republicans.\n\nConservatives dominated the party in the South, and they were angered by the growing voice of labor unions and black voters in the party outside the South. The hope that Truman would reverse course had faded by 1947, when he vetoed the [[Taft-Hartley Law]], which would have helped control union power. Truman's appointment of a liberal [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] commission convinced Southern conservatives that to re-establish their voice they had to threaten [[third party (United States)|third-party]] action to defeat Truman in 1948.<ref>Robert A. Garson, \"The Alienation of the South: A Crisis for Harry S. Truman and the Democratic Party, 1945-1948,\" ''Missouri Historical Review,'' (July 1970) 64#4 pp. 448\u2013471</ref>\n\nTruman was aware of his unpopularity. In July 1947, he privately offered to be Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination, an offer which Eisenhower declined. Truman's offer to Eisenhower did not become public knowledge during the campaign.<ref name=\"nyt20030711\">\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/11/us/truman-wrote-of-48-offer-to-eisenhower.html?fta=y Truman Wrote of '48 Offer to Eisenhower]\" ''The New York Times'', July 11, 2003.</ref>\n\nAs a result of Truman's low standing in the polls, several Democratic party bosses began working to \"dump\" Truman and nominate a more popular candidate. Among the leaders of this movement were [[Jacob Arvey]], the head of the powerful Cook County (Chicago) Democratic organization; [[Frank Hague]], the boss of New Jersey; [[James Roosevelt]], the eldest son of former President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]; and liberal Senator [[Claude Pepper]] from Florida. The rebels hoped to draft Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate. On July 10, however, Eisenhower officially refused to be a candidate. There was then an attempt to put forward Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], but Douglas also declared that he would not be a presidential candidate. Finally, Senator Pepper declared his intention to challenge Truman for the presidential nomination. His candidacy collapsed when the liberal [[Americans for Democratic Action]] and the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] withheld their support, partly due to concerns over Pepper's attacks on Truman's foreign policy decisions regarding the Soviet Union. As a result of the refusal by most of the dump-Truman delegates to support him, Pepper withdrew his candidacy for the nomination on July 14. Lacking a candidate acceptable to all sides, the leaders of the dump-Truman movement reluctantly agreed to support Truman for the nomination.\n\n==== Democratic Convention ====\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Truman initially proposed a [[civil rights]] plank to the party platform that moderated the strong vocal support for civil rights that he had expressed at the NAACP convention in 1947, and to Congress in February 1948. This proposal disappointed Northern and Western liberals who wanted more swift and sweeping reforms in civil rights, but it also failed to placate Southern conservatives, and both sides decided to present their own amendments and proposals to Truman's civil rights plank.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael R.

The Southern delegates who remained nominated Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] from Georgia for the Democratic nomination as a rebuke to Truman. Nonetheless, 947 Democratic delegates voted for Truman as the Democratic nominee, while Russell received only 266 votes, all from the South.\n\nTruman's first choice for his running mate was Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, hoping that it might make the ticket more appealing to liberals. Douglas refused the nomination. Needing an alternative, Truman then selected Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] from [[Kentucky]], who had delivered the convention's [[keynote address]], as his running mate, with this nomination being made by acclamation.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Harvard |last=Sitkoff |title=Harry Truman and the Election of 1948: The Coming of Age of Civil Rights in American Politics |journal=[[Journal of Southern History]] |volume=37 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=597\u2013616 |jstor=2206548 |doi=10.2307/2206548 }}</ref>\n\nTruman gave a fighting acceptance speech, stating that \"Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make the Republicans like it - don't you forget it!...We will do that because they are wrong and we are right.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 129)</ref> He claimed that the Republican Party had, \"ever since its inception...been under the control of special privilege; and they have completely proved it in the Eightieth Congress.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 131)</ref> At the end of the speech the \"delegates rose to their feet and cheered loudly for two minutes...for a moment Truman had created the illusion - few regarded it as more than an illusion - that the Democrats had a fighting chance in November.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 130)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+The Balloting\n|-\n!Presidential Ballot!! !!Vice Presidential Ballot!!\n|-\n![[Harry S.

Eisenhower]], the most popular general of World War II and a favorite in the polls. Unlike the latter movement within the Democratic Party, however, the Republican draft movement came largely from the grassroots of the party. By January 23, 1948, the grassroots movement had successfully entered Eisenhower's name into every state holding a Republican presidential primary, and polls gave him a significant lead against all other contenders. With the first state primary approaching, Eisenhower was forced to make a quick decision. Stating that soldiers should keep out of politics, Eisenhower declined to run and requested that the grassroots draft movement cease its activities. After a number of failed efforts to get Eisenhower to reconsider, the organization disbanded, with the majority of its leadership endorsing the presidential campaign of the former Governor of [[Minnesota]], [[Harold Stassen]].\n\nWith Eisenhower refusing to run, the contest for the Republican nomination was between Stassen, New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] from Ohio, California Governor [[Earl Warren]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] from Michigan, the senior Republican in the Senate. Dewey, who had been the Republican nominee in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], was regarded as the frontrunner when the primaries began. Dewey was the acknowledged leader of the Republican Party's [[Eastern Establishment]]. In 1946 he had been re-elected governor of New York by the largest margin in state history. Dewey's handicap was that many Republicans disliked him on a personal level; he often struck observers as cold, stiff, and calculating. Taft was the leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing, which was strongest in the Midwest and parts of the South. Taft called for abolishing many [[New Deal]] welfare programs, which he felt were harmful to business interests, and he was skeptical of American involvement in foreign alliances such as the [[United Nations]]. Taft had two major weaknesses: He was a plodding, dull campaigner, and he was viewed by most party leaders as being too conservative and controversial to win a presidential election.<ref>{{cite book |author=James T. Patterson |title=Mr. Republican: a biography of Robert A. Taft |url=https://archive.org/details/mrrepublicanbiog00patt_0 |url-access=registration |year=1972 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mrrepublicanbiog00patt_0/page/399 399]\u2013408 |isbn=9780395139387}}</ref>\n\nBoth Vandenberg and Warren were highly popular in their home states, but each refused to campaign in the primaries, which limited their chances of winning the nomination. Their supporters, however, hoped that in the event of a Dewey-Taft-Stassen deadlock, the convention would turn to their man as a compromise candidate.\n\nGeneral MacArthur, the famous war hero, was especially popular among conservatives. Since he was serving in Japan as the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] occupying that nation, he was unable to campaign for the nomination. He did make it known, however, that he would accept the GOP nomination if it were offered to him, and some conservative Republicans hoped that by winning a primary contest he could prove his popularity with voters. They chose to enter his name in the Wisconsin primary.<ref>Howard B. Schonberger, \"The General and the Presidency: Douglas MacArthur and the Election of 1948,\" ''Wisconsin Magazine of History,'' (Spring 1974) 57#3 pp. 201\u2013219</ref>\n\nThe \"surprise\" candidate of 1948 was Stassen, a liberal from Minnesota.<ref>Alec Kirby, \"'A Major Contender': Harold Stassen and the Politics of American Presidential Nominations,\" ''Minnesota History,'' (Dec 1996) 55#4 pp. 150\u2013165</ref> In 1938, Stassen had been elected governor of Minnesota at the age of 31; he resigned as governor in 1943 to serve in the wartime Navy. In 1945 he served on the committee that created the [[United Nations]]. Stassen was widely regarded as the most liberal of the Republican candidates, yet during the primaries he was criticized for being vague on many issues. Stassen stunned Dewey and MacArthur in the Wisconsin primary; Stassen's surprise victory virtually eliminated General MacArthur, whose supporters had made a major effort on his behalf. Stassen defeated Dewey again in the Nebraska primary, thus making him the new frontrunner. He then made the strategic mistake of trying to beat Taft in Ohio, Taft's home state. Stassen believed that if he could defeat Taft in his home state, Taft would be forced to quit the race and most of Taft's delegates would support him instead of Dewey.\n\nTaft defeated Stassen in his native Ohio, however, and Stassen earned the hostility of the party's conservatives. Even so, Stassen was still leading Dewey in the polls for the upcoming Oregon primary. Dewey, however, realized that losing another primary would end his chances at the nomination, and he decided to make an all-out effort in Oregon.<ref>(Smith, pp. 488-489)</ref> In April 1948 Dewey sent Paul Lockwood, one of his top aides, to build a strong grassroots organization in the state. Working with $150,000 sent by Dewey's powerful New York political organization (three times the previous record spent in an Oregon primary), Lockwood paid \"for 126 billboards, hundreds of sixty-second radio spots on every station in the state, and half-hour broadcasts each noon...The daily ''[[Portland Oregonian]]'' carried five Dewey advertisements a day.\"<ref>(Smith, p. 489)</ref> Dewey also extensively campaigned in Oregon, spending three weeks in the state. He \"invaded every hamlet, no matter how isolated, speaking at rural crossroads and shaking hands in hamburger stands. One journalist commented that Dewey was the greatest explorer of Oregon since [[Lewis and Clark]].\"<ref>(Abels, p. 57)</ref>\n\nDewey also agreed to debate Stassen in Oregon on national radio. Held on May 17, 1948, it was the first-ever [[Dewey\u2013Stassen debate|radio debate]] between presidential candidates. The sole issue of the debate concerned whether to outlaw the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]]. Stassen, despite his liberal reputation, argued in favor of outlawing the party, stating his belief that a network of Soviet-directed Communist spies \"within the U.S. demanded immediate, and punitive, response...Why did Dewey oppose such a ban? Stassen wanted to know.\"<ref>(Smith, pp. 492-493)</ref> \"We must not coddle Communism with legality\", Stassen insisted. Dewey - while criticizing Communist totalitarianism and Soviet actions in the Cold War - still forcefully argued against banning the Communist Party: \"This outlawing idea is nothing new...for thousands of years despots have tortured, imprisoned, killed, and exiled their opponents, and their governments have always fallen into the dust.\"<ref name=\"Smith, p. 493\">(Smith, p. 493)</ref> Dewey ended his turn in the debate by stating that \"I am unalterably, wholeheartedly, and unswervingly against any scheme to write laws outlawing people because of their religious, political, social, or economic ideas. I am against it because it is a violation of the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights...I am against it because I know from a great many years of experience in law enforcement that the proposal wouldn't work. Stripped to its naked essentials...this is nothing but the method of Hitler and Stalin. It is thought control...an attempt to beat down ideas with a club. It is a surrender of everything we believe in.\"<ref name=\"Smith, p. 493\"/> Surveys showed that from 40 to 80 million people nationwide listened to the debate, and most observers rated Dewey as the winner.<ref>(Smith, pp. 492-494)</ref> Four days after the debate, Dewey defeated Stassen in the Oregon primary.<ref>(Smith, p. 494)</ref> From this point forward, the New York governor had the momentum he needed to win his party's second nomination.<ref>Tom Swafford, \"The Last Real Presidential Debate,\" ''American Heritage,'' Feb/Mar 1986, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp. 66\u201371</ref>\n\n==== Republican Convention ====\nThe [[1948 Republican National Convention]] was held in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. It was the first presidential convention to be shown on \"national\" [[television]]. (At this time there were 27 television stations in full operation in the US and an estimated 350,000 TV sets in the whole country.) As the convention opened, Dewey was believed to have a large lead in the delegate count.<ref>(Patterson, p. 411)</ref> His campaign managers - [[Herbert Brownell, Jr.]], [[Edwin Jaeckle]], and [[J. Russell Sprague]] - were \"as skillful a group of operators as ever manipulated a convention...it was said at the convention that the Dewey forces \"could have won even with Taft\" as their candidate.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 63-64)</ref> His main opponent, Senator Taft, was hobbled by an ineffective campaign team that one writer called \"bumblers\", and another historian noted that Taft's campaign manager, Ohio Congressman [[Clarence J. Brown]], \"seemed no match for Herbert Brownell...while the Dewey forces were busy flattering delegates and hinting at promises of patronage, Brown was still worrying about such mundane matters as hotel rooms and seats in the gallery for his friends.\"<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 410\">(Patterson, p. 410)</ref>\n\nDewey's leading opponents \u2013 Taft and Stassen \u2013 met in Taft's hotel suite to plan a \"stop-Dewey\" movement. A key obstacle soon developed, however, as both men refused to unite behind a single candidate to oppose Dewey: \"The essence of their impasse was simple. Neither Stassen nor Taft hated Dewey enough to withdraw [in favor of the other], and neither man thought he could get his delegates to follow if he did.\"<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 410\"/> Instead, both Taft and Stassen, along with Senator Vandenberg, simply agreed to try to hold their own delegates in the hopes of preventing Dewey from obtaining a majority. This proved to be futile, as Dewey's efficient campaign team methodically gathered the remaining delegates they needed to win the nomination. Stassen tried to contact General Eisenhower to ask him to reconsider becoming a candidate, but Eisenhower \"could not be reached.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 64-65)</ref> After the second round of balloting, Dewey was only 33 votes short of victory. Taft then called Stassen and urged him to withdraw from the race and endorse him as Dewey's main opponent. When Stassen refused, Taft wrote a concession statement and had it read to the convention at the start of the third ballot; at this point the other candidates also dropped out, and Dewey was then nominated unanimously by [[acclamation]].<ref name=\"Abels, p. 65\">(Abels, p. 65)</ref>\n\nDewey's campaign team originally wanted Illinois Governor [[Dwight Green]] to be his running mate, but the opposition of Colonel [[Robert R. McCormick]], the powerful publisher of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', nixed his chances.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 65\"/> According to journalist Jules Abels, Dewey managers Brownell, Sprague, and Jaeckle then appeared to offer the vice-presidential nomination to influential Indiana Congressman [[Charles Halleck]], in exchange for Halleck delivering the entire Indiana delegation to Dewey.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 65\"/> Halleck did so, but Dewey, who had not been present at the meeting between his managers and Halleck, decided to reject his candidacy, telling his aides \"Halleck won't do.\" After Dewey told Halleck of his decision, Halleck \"was first speechless with disbelief and then overcome with emotion.\" He told Dewey that \"you're running out on the Eightieth Congress, and you'll be sorry!\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 66-67)</ref> Abels wrote that Dewey's decision to deny Halleck the vice-presidential bid \"may have been a fateful one...Halleck with his forceful personality might have changed the tone of the Dewey campaign, and certainly the issue of the record of the GOP-controlled Eightieth Congress would have to have been met heads on.\"<ref>(Halleck, p. 68)</ref> Instead, Dewey chose popular governor (and future [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]) [[Earl Warren]] of California as his running mate. Following the convention, most political experts in the [[news media]] rated the Republican ticket as an almost-certain winner over the Democrats.<ref>(Abels, p. 71)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+ The tally\n|-\n!Ballot || 1 || 2 || 3\n|-\n|'''[[Thomas E.

A new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] (the name had been used earlier by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1912 and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert M. La Follette]] in 1924) was created afresh in 1948, with the nomination of [[Henry A. Wallace]], who had served as [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Vice President of the United States]], and [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1946, President Truman had fired Wallace as Secretary of Commerce when Wallace publicly opposed Truman's firm moves to counter the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. Wallace's 1948 platform opposed the Cold War policies of President Truman, including the [[Marshall Plan]] and [[Truman Doctrine]]. The Progressives proposed stronger government regulation and control of [[Big Business]]. They also campaigned to end discrimination against blacks and women, backed a minimum wage, and called for the elimination of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which was investigating the issue of [[Communism|communist]] spies within the U.S. government and [[Trade union|labor unions]]. Wallace and his supporters believed that the committee was violating the [[civil liberties]] of government workers and labor unions.\n\nThe Progressives, however, also generated a great deal of controversy because of the widespread belief that they were secretly controlled by Communists who were more loyal to the [[Soviet Union]] than the United States. Wallace himself denied being a Communist, but he repeatedly refused to disavow their support and, at one point, was quoted as saying that the \"Communists are the closest thing to the early Christian martyrs.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 162)</ref> [[Walter Reuther]], the president of the influential [[United Auto Workers]] union, strongly opposed Wallace's candidacy, stating that \"people who are not sympathetic with democracy in America are influencing him.\"<ref name=\"Ross, p. 153\">(Ross, p. 153)</ref> [[Philip Murray]], the president of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), stated in April 1948 that \"the Communist Party is directly responsible for the creation of the third party [Progressive Party] in the United States.\"<ref name=\"Ross, p. 153\" />\n\nWallace was also hurt when [[Westbrook Pegler]], a prominent conservative newspaper columnist, revealed that Wallace as vice president had written coded letters discussing prominent politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt and [[Winston Churchill]] to his controversial Russian [[New Age]] spiritual [[guru]] [[Nicholas Roerich]]; the letters were nicknamed the \"Guru letters.\" In his book ''Out of the Jaws of Victory'', the journalist Jules Abels wrote: \"Personalities were referred to by symbolic titles\u2014Roosevelt was 'The Flaming One', Churchill 'The Roaring Lion', and [[Cordell Hull]] 'The Sour One'... some of the letters were signed 'Wallace', others '[[Galahad]]'\", the name that Roerich had assigned Wallace in his cult.<ref>(Ross, p. 163)</ref> This revelation\u2014including direct quotes from the letters\u2014led to much ridicule of Wallace in the national press.\n\nThe Progressive Party Convention, which was also held in Philadelphia, was a highly contentious affair; several famous newspaper journalists, such as [[H. L. Mencken]] and [[Dorothy Thompson]], publicly accused the Progressives of being covertly controlled by Communists. The party's platform was drafted by [[Lee Pressman]], the convention secretary; he later admitted that he had been a member of the Communist party.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 117\">(Abels, p. 117)</ref> [[John Abt]] served as legal counsel to the convention's permanent chairman, Albert Fitzgerald; he also testified years later that he was a Communist.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 117\" /> [[Rexford Tugwell]], a prominent liberal in President Franklin Roosevelt's [[New Deal]], served as the Chairman of the party's platform committee. He became convinced that the party was being manipulated by Communists, and was \"so heartsick about Communist infiltration of the party that he discussed . . . with his wife disaffiliating [from the party] the night before the convention\" started.<ref>(Abels, pp. 116-117)</ref> Tugwell later did disassociate himself from the Progressive Party and did not participate in Wallace's fall campaign.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 117\" /> A number of other Progressive Party delegates and supporters would quit the party in protest over what they perceived as the undue influence Communists exerted over Wallace, including the prominent American socialist [[Norman Thomas]]. In the fall, Thomas would run as the [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate to offer liberals a non-Communist alternative to Wallace.<ref>(Abels, p. 233)</ref>\n\nSenator [[Glen H. Taylor]] from [[Idaho]], an eccentric figure who was known as a \"singing cowboy\" and who had ridden his horse \"Nugget\" up the steps of the [[United States Capitol]] after winning election to the Senate in 1944, was named as Wallace's running mate. Although he was a member of the Democratic Party, Taylor accepted the Progressive Party's vice-presidential nomination, saying \"I am not leaving the Democratic Party. It left me. Wall Street and the military have taken over the Democratic Party.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 34-35)</ref> After receiving the vice-presidential nomination, Taylor told reporters that there was a difference between \"pink\" Communists and \"red\" Communists.<ref>(Abels, p. 118)</ref> Taylor claimed that \"pink\" Communists would support the Wallace-Taylor ticket because they believed in a \"peaceful revolution\" to turn the government to left-wing beliefs, but \"red\" Communists would support the Republican ticket in the belief that they would cause another [[Great Depression]], which would give Communists the chance to take over the government.<ref>(Abels, pp. 118-119)</ref>\n\nIn the fall campaign the Wallace-Taylor ticket made a Southern tour, where both Wallace and Taylor insisted on speaking to racially integrated audiences, in defiance of Southern custom and law at the time. In several North Carolina cities Wallace was hit by a total of \"twenty-seven eggs, thirty-seven tomatoes, six peaches, and two lemons.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 206)</ref> When he left the state he announced: \"As Jesus Christ said, if at any time they will not listen to you willingly, then shake the dust off from your feet and go elsewhere.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 206-207)</ref> He ate only in unsegregated restaurants, traveled with a black secretary, and in Mississippi had to be escorted by police for protection. His aide Clark Foreman admitted that Wallace wanted to stir up controversy for the publicity it would receive in more liberal areas in the North and West.<ref>(Abels, p. 207)</ref> As the campaign progressed, however, Wallace's crowds thinned and his standing in the polls dropped. Wallace was hurt by the successful effort of labor unions to keep their members in the Democratic column, and by controversial statements from Progressives supporting \"appeasement with Russia.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 211-212)</ref> Wallace himself attacked [[Winston Churchill]] as a \"racist\" and \"imperialist\", and Senator Taylor earned criticism for a speech in which he claimed that the \"Nazis are running the US government. So why should Russia make peace with them? If I were a Russian . . . I would not agree to anything . . . we are aggressively preparing for war.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 212)</ref>\n\nThe Wallace-Taylor ticket finished in fourth place in the election, winning 1,157,328 votes (2.4%). This was slightly less than the States' Rights Party, but the Progressive Party received no electoral votes.\n\n=== States' Rights Democratic Party nomination ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''States' Rights Democratic Party Ticket, 1948'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"| [[Strom Thurmond|{{color|black|Strom Thurmond}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"| [[Fielding L.

At the Southern Governor's Conference in Wakulla Springs, Florida, on February 6, Mississippi Governor [[Fielding Wright]] proposed the formation of a new third party to protect [[racial segregation]] in the South. On May 10, 1948, the governors of the eleven states of the former Confederacy, along with other high-ranking Southern officials, met in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], to discuss their concerns about the growing civil rights movement within the Democratic Party. At the meeting, South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] criticized President Truman for his civil rights agenda, and the governors discussed ways to oppose it.<ref>Jeffrey Smith. ''Dixiecrat: The Life and Times of Strom Thurmond''{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Southern Democrats who had walked out of the Democratic National Convention to protest the civil rights platform approved by the convention, and supported by Truman, promptly met at [[Boutwell Memorial Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on July 17, 1948, and formed yet another political party, which they named the [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Democratic Party]]. More commonly known as the \"Dixiecrats\", the party's main goal was continuing the policy of racial segregation in the South and the [[Jim Crow laws]] that sustained it. Governor Thurmond, who had led the walkout, became the party's presidential nominee after the convention's initial favorite, [[Arkansas]] Governor [[Benjamin Travis Laney|Benjamin Laney]], withdrew his name from consideration. Governor Wright of Mississippi received the vice-presidential nomination. The Dixiecrats had no chance of winning the election themselves, since they could not get on the ballot in enough states to win the necessary electoral votes. Their strategy was to take enough Southern states from Truman to force the election into the [[United States House of Representatives]] under the provisions of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Electoral College under the Twelfth Amendment|Twelfth Amendment]], where they could then extract concessions from either Truman or Dewey on racial issues in exchange for their support. Even if Dewey won the election outright, the Dixiecrats hoped that their defection would show that the Democratic Party needed Southern support in order to win national elections, and that this fact would weaken the pro-civil rights movement among Northern and Western Democrats. The Dixiecrats were weakened, however, when most Southern Democratic leaders (such as Governor [[Herman Talmadge]] of Georgia and \"Boss\" [[E. H. Crump]] from Tennessee) refused to support the party. Despite being an incumbent president, Truman was not placed on the ballot in Alabama.<ref>Hugh Alvin Bone, ''American Politics and the Party System'', p. 262 (McGraw-Hill 1955).</ref> In the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, the party was able to be labeled as the main Democratic Party ticket on the local ballots on election night.<ref name=uop>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1366 Dixiecrats] New Georgia Encyclopedia.</ref> Outside of these four states, however, it was only listed as a third-party ticket.<ref name=uop />\n\n===Christian Nationalist Party nomination===\n\nThis Party nominated [[Gerald L.

Top Republicans believed that all their candidate had to do to win was to avoid major mistakes. In keeping with this advice, Dewey carefully avoided risks; he spoke in platitudes, avoided controversial issues, and was vague on what he planned to do as president, with speech after speech being filled with non-political, optimistic assertions of the obvious, including the now infamous quote \"You know that your future is still ahead of you.\" An editorial in ''[[The Courier-Journal|The (Louisville) Courier-Journal]]'' summed it up as such: \"No presidential candidate in the future will be so inept that four of his major speeches can be boiled down to these historic four sentences: Agriculture is important. Our rivers are full of fish. You cannot have freedom without liberty. Our future lies ahead.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last=Donaldson| first=Gary A.| title=Truman Defeats Dewey| page=[https://archive.org/details/trumandefeatsdew00dona/page/173 173]| publisher=The University Press of Kentucky| year=1999| isbn=0-8131-2075-6| url=https://archive.org/details/trumandefeatsdew00dona/page/173}} Quoting ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'', November 18, 1948.</ref> A writer noted that the \"one broad issue that Dewey set forth in the campaign was unity...but [he] was oversold on an issue which had no visceral appeal to the average American. It was hard to understand what Dewey was driving at. Sometimes it seemed that he was asking Americans to achieve unity by being united behind him.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 191)</ref>\n\nTruman's campaign strategist, [[Clark Clifford]], later said that Truman's campaign was \"pitched to four distinct interest groups - labor, the farmer, the Negro, and the consumer. Every move had these four interest groups in mind.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 165)</ref> Since he was trailing in the polls, Truman decided to adopt a slashing, no-holds-barred campaign. He ridiculed Dewey by name, criticized Dewey's refusal to address specific issues, and scornfully targeted the Republican-controlled 80th Congress with a wave of relentless and blistering partisan assaults. Truman claimed that \"the Communists are rooting for a GOP victory because they know it would bring on another [[Great Depression]].\"<ref>(Abels, p. 237)</ref> In several speeches, Truman stated that \"GOP\" actually stood for \"gluttons of privilege\", and said that Republicans were \"princes of privilege\" and \"bloodsuckers with offices on Wall Street.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 194)</ref> He told one audience that \"The Republicans have begun to nail the American consumer to the wall with spikes of greed.\"<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 460\">(Manchester, p. 460)</ref> At the National Plowing Contest in [[Dexter, Iowa]], Truman told 80,000 farmers in attendance that \"this Republican Congress has already stuck a pitchfork in the farmer's back.\"<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 460\"/> He nicknamed the Republican-controlled Congress as the \"worst\", \"do-nothing\" Congress, a remark which brought strong criticism from Republican Congressional leaders (such as Taft), but no comment from Dewey. In fact, Dewey rarely mentioned Truman's name during the campaign, which fit into his strategy of appearing to be above petty partisan politics.\n\nUnder Dewey's leadership, the Republicans had enacted a platform at their 1948 convention that called for expanding [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], more funding for public housing, [[civil rights]] legislation, and promotion of health and education by the federal government. These positions were, however, unacceptable to the conservative Congressional Republican leadership. Truman exploited this rift in the opposing party by calling [[Turnip Day Session|a special session of Congress]] on \"Turnip Day\" (referring to an old piece of Missouri folklore about planting turnips in late July) and daring the Republican Congressional leadership to pass its own platform. The [[80th United States Congress|80th Congress]] played into Truman's hands, delivering very little in the way of substantive legislation during this time. Truman simply ignored the fact that Dewey's policies were considerably more liberal than most of his fellow Republicans, and instead he concentrated his fire against what he characterized as the conservative, obstructionist tendencies of the unpopular 80th Congress.\n\n[[File:Truman-Dewey-polls-1948.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Clifford K. Berryman]]'s editorial cartoon of Oct. 19, 1948, shows the consensus of experts in mid-October]]\n\nTruman toured much of the nation with his fiery rhetoric, playing to large, enthusiastic crowds. \"Give 'em hell, Harry\" was a popular slogan shouted out at stop after stop along the tour. The polls and the pundits, however, all held that Dewey's lead was insurmountable and that Truman's efforts were for naught. Indeed, Truman's own staff considered the campaign a last hurrah. Even Truman's own wife, [[Bess Truman|Bess]], had private doubts that her husband could win. The only person who appears to have considered Truman's campaign to be winnable was the president himself, who confidently predicted victory to anyone who would listen to him. Near the end of the campaign, Truman privately wrote a state-by-state electoral vote prediction and gave it to his aide, George Elsey. Truman believed that he would win the election with 340 electoral votes, to 108 for Dewey, 42 for Thurmond, and 37 marked doubtful (he accidentally left out four electoral votes).<ref>(Manchester, p. 461)</ref>\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, American movie theaters agreed to play two short newsreel-like campaign films in support of the two major-party candidates; both had been created by its respective campaign organization. The Dewey film, shot professionally on an impressive budget, featured very high production values but somehow reinforced an image of the New York governor as cautious and distant. On the other hand, the Truman film, hastily assembled on virtually no budget by the perpetually cash-short Truman campaign, relied heavily on public-domain and newsreel footage of the president taking part in major world events and signing important legislation. Perhaps unintentionally, the Truman film visually reinforced an image of him as engaged and decisive. Years later, historian [[David McCullough]] cited the expensive but lackluster Dewey film and the far cheaper but more effective Truman film, as important factors in determining the preferences of undecided voters.\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, the polls showed Truman was gaining. Though Truman lost all nine of the [[Gallup Poll]]'s post-convention surveys, Dewey's Gallup lead dropped from 17 points in late September to 9 points in mid-October to just 5 points by the end of the month, just above the poll's margin of error. Although Truman was gaining momentum, most political analysts were reluctant to break with the conventional wisdom and say that a Truman victory was a serious possibility. On September 9, nearly two months before election day, pollster [[Elmo Roper]] announced, \"Thomas E. Dewey is almost as good as elected.... I can think of nothing duller or more intellectually barren than acting like a sports announcer who feels he must pretend he is witnessing a neck-and-neck race.\"<ref>(Manchester, p. 465)</ref> Roper stopped polling voters until the final week before the election, when he took another poll. It showed \"a slight shift to Truman; it still gave Dewey a heavy lead, however, so he decided not to hedge his bet.\"<ref name=\"auto\">(Manchester, p. 466)</ref> One poll showing strong Truman support in the rural Midwest was sponsored by the Staley Milling Company. They \"polled farmers by giving them a choice of a donkey or an elephant on chicken feed sacks. When the results among 20,000 farmers showed up as fifty-four percent to forty-six percent for the donkey, the poll was abandoned.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 275)</ref>\n\nWhen Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive stance after noticing that his crowds were dwindling, Herbert Brownell contacted 90 GOP state committeemen and committeewomen in all 48 states. With one exception, they \"urged [Dewey] to press forward on the high road\" his campaign had taken and to continue to ignore Truman's attacks.<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 463\">(Manchester, p. 463)</ref> The sole exception was Kansas committeeman Harry Darby, who warned Dewey and his managers \"that farmers were in a mutinous mood\" and recommended that Dewey take a tougher and more aggressive stance. However, given that all the polls still showed Dewey leading, and no other committee member supported Darby, his advice was rejected.<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 463\"/>\n\nIn the campaign's final days, many newspapers, magazines, and political pundits were so confident of Dewey's impending victory they wrote articles to be printed the morning after the election speculating about the new \"Dewey Presidency.\" ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine printed a large photo in its final edition before the election. Entitled \"Our Next President Rides by Ferryboat over San Francisco Bay,\" the photo showed Dewey and his staff riding across the city's harbor.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\">(Abels, p. 261)</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' polled fifty experts; all fifty predicted a Dewey win.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\"/> Several well-known and influential newspaper columnists, such as [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] and [[Joseph Alsop]], wrote columns to be printed the morning after the election speculating about Dewey's possible choices for his cabinet. The day before the election, Pearson wrote that any chance of a Truman victory was \"impossible,\" and his column printed the day after the election stated that Pearson had \"surveyed the closely-knit group around Tom Dewey who will take over the White House 86 days from now.\"<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\"/> [[Walter Winchell]] reported that gambling odds were 15 to 1 against Truman. More than 500 newspapers, accounting for over 78% of the nation's total circulation, endorsed Dewey. Truman picked up 182 endorsements, accounting for just 10% of America's newspaper readership, being surpassed by Thurmond, who got the remaining 12% from many Southern papers. [[Alistair Cooke]], the distinguished writer for the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' newspaper in the United Kingdom, published an article on the day of the election entitled \"Harry S. Truman: A Study of a Failure.\"<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\"/> For its television coverage, NBC News constructed a large cardboard model of the White House containing two elephants that would pop out when NBC announced Dewey's victory; since Truman's defeat was considered certain, no donkeys were placed in the White House model.<ref>(Smith, p. 20)</ref>\n\nAs Truman made his way to his hometown of [[Independence, Missouri]], to await the election returns, some among his inner circle had already accepted other jobs, and not a single reporter traveling on his campaign train thought that he would win.<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 463\"/> A number of prominent Republicans, anticipating serving in a Dewey Presidency, had already bought homes in Washington.<ref>(Manchester, p. 453)</ref>\n\n=== Results ===\n[[File:deweytruman12.jpg|thumb|Famous photograph of Truman grinning and holding up a copy of the newspaper that [[Dewey Defeats Truman|erroneously announced his defeat]].]]\nOn election night, Dewey, his family, and campaign staff confidently gathered in the [[The Roosevelt Hotel (New York)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in [[New York City]] to await the returns.<ref>(Ross, p. 241)</ref> Truman, aided by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], sneaked away from reporters covering him in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and rode to nearby [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]]. There, he took a room in the historic [[Elms Hotel (Excelsior Springs, Missouri)|Elms Hotel]], had dinner and a [[Turkish bath]], and went to sleep.<ref name=\"Ross, p. 242\">(Ross, p. 242)</ref> As the votes came in, Truman took an early lead that he never lost. The leading radio commentators, such as [[H. V. Kaltenborn]] of [[NBC]], still confidently predicted that once the \"late returns\" came in Dewey would overcome Truman's lead and win. At midnight, Truman awoke and turned on the radio in his room; he heard Kaltenborn announce that while Truman was still ahead in the popular vote, he could not possibly win. At 4 a.m., Truman awoke again and heard on the radio that his popular-vote lead was now nearly two million votes, and that he was well ahead in the electoral vote.<ref name=\"Ross, p. 242\" /> He told the Secret Service agents guarding him to drive him back to Kansas City, \"because it looks as if we're in for another four years.\"<ref>(Manchester, p. 469)</ref> For the rest of his life, Truman would gleefully mimic Kaltenborn's pedantic voice predicting his defeat throughout that election night. Dewey, meanwhile, realized that he was in trouble when early returns from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] showed him running well behind his expected vote total. He stayed up for the rest of the night and early morning analyzing the votes as they came in. By 10:30&nbsp;a.m., he was convinced that he had lost; at 11:14&nbsp;a.m., he sent a gracious telegram of concession to Truman.<ref>(Ross, p. 240-243)</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]'', a pro-Republican newspaper, was so sure of Dewey's victory that on Tuesday afternoon, before any polls closed, it printed \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman|DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN]]\" as its headline for the following day. Part of the reason Truman's victory came as such a shock was because of uncorrected flaws in the emerging craft of public opinion polling. According to historian [[William Manchester]], \"many professional pollsters...believed in what some had come to call [[James A. Farley|Farley's Law]].\"<ref name=\"auto\" /> James Farley, President Franklin Roosevelt's successful campaign manager in 1932 and 1936, had stated that, in his opinion, the great majority of voters decided which candidate to support during the political conventions. The fall campaigns, Farley believed, were simply \"ineffective carnivals\" that swayed few voters.<ref name=\"auto\" /> In 1948 many pollsters, relying on Farley's Law, believed that the election was effectively over after the Republican and Democratic Conventions, and they discounted the impact of Truman's campaigning that fall.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Manchester noted that \"Gallup's September 24 report foresaw 46.5% for Dewey to 38% for Truman. His last column, appearing in the Sunday papers two days before the election, showed Truman gaining sharply \u2013 to 44 percent \u2013 and the interviews on which it was based had been conducted two weeks earlier. The national mood was shifting daily, almost hourly.\"<ref name=\"auto\" /> After the election, a study by the University of Michigan revealed that \"14% of Truman's voters, or 3,374,800, had decided to vote for him in the last fortnight of the campaign.\"<ref name=\"auto1\">(Manchester, p. 471)</ref> Gallup and Roper also did an analysis of the votes, they \"learned that one voter in every seven (6,927,000), made up his mind in the last two weeks before the election. Of these, 75 percent picked Truman\", which was more than his margin of victory over Dewey.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> \"Using either the Michigan figures or Gallup-Roper's, one finds that some 3,300,000 fence-sitters determined the outcome of the race in its closing days \u2013 when Dewey's instincts were urging him to adopt Truman's hell-for-leather style and slug it out with him, and when he didn't because all the experts told him he shouldn't.\"<ref name=\"auto1\" /> After 1948, pollsters would constantly survey voters through election day.\n\nThe key states in the 1948 election were Ohio, California, and Illinois. Truman narrowly won all three states by a margin of less than one percentage point apiece. These three states had a combined total of 78 electoral votes. Had Dewey carried all three states, he would have won the election in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], even if not winning the popular vote. Had Dewey won only two (any two) of the three states, Truman would have had the most electoral votes but the Dixiecrats would have succeeded in their goal of forcing the election into the House of Representatives. The extreme closeness of the vote in these three states was the major reason why Dewey waited until late on the morning of November 3 to concede. A similarly narrow margin garnered Idaho and Nevada's electoral votes for Truman. Dewey countered by almost as narrowly carrying New York and Pennsylvania, the states with the most electoral votes at the time, as well as his native state of Michigan, but this was too little to give him the election. Dewey would always believe that he lost the election because he lost the [[Rural area|rural]] vote in the Midwest, which he had won in 1944 (the Kaltenborn predictions that Truman would joyously mock had, in fact, taken for granted that the \"country vote\" would go to Dewey).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_22.shtml |title=americanheritage.com |access-date=November 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207041433/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_22.shtml |archive-date=December 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nJournalist Sidney Lubell found in his post-1948 survey of voters that Truman, not Dewey, seemed the safer, more conservative candidate to the \"new middle class\" that had developed over the previous 20 years. He wrote that \"to an appreciable part of the electorate, the Democrats had replaced the Republicans as the party of prosperity\" during and after the war. Lubell quoted a man who, when asked why he did not vote Republican after moving to the suburbs, answered \"I own a nice home, have a new car and am much better off than my parents were. I've been a Democrat all my life. Why should I change?\" Dewey's promise of a \"great house cleaning\" in Washington worried an Iowa minister who wanted to retain [[US farm subsidies|farm subsidies]] for parishioners. Worried about the consequences of another depression, he voted Democratic for the first time in his church's history. Truman received a record number of [[Catholic Church and politics in the United States|Catholic votes]], exceeding even the Catholic support of [[Al Smith]] in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]], in part because Wallace drew leftists away from the Democrats.<ref name=\"lubell1956\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | author=Lubell, Samuel | year=1956 | pages=62\u201363,170\u2013172,224\u2013227 | edition=2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref>\n\nAnother reason for Dewey's surprise defeat was his complacent, distant approach to the campaign, and his failure to respond to Truman's attacks. Journalist Jules Abels wrote that \"the election was not thrown away by indifference or lack of effort. Preparation and more preparation had always been the distinguishing characteristic of Dewey and his team throughout his career...The truth is that Dewey's campaign was the result not of careless, but too careful and painstaking, calculation. The Dewey campaign was frozen into inertia not because it had been underthought, but because it had been overthought.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 142)</ref> Other possible factors for Truman's victory included his aggressive, populist campaign style; broad public approval of Truman's foreign policy, notably the [[Berlin Blockade#The start of the Berlin Airlift|Berlin Airlift]] of that year; and widespread dissatisfaction with the institution Truman labeled as the \"do-nothing, good-for-nothing 80th Republican Congress.\" In addition, after suffering a relatively severe recession in 1946 and 1947 (in which real GDP dropped by 12% and inflation went over 15%), the economy began recovering throughout 1948, thus possibly motivating many voters to give Truman credit for the economic recovery.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}\n\nThe year 1948 was a banner year for the Democrats, as they not only retained the presidency but also recaptured both houses of Congress. It was also an unprecedented fifth consecutive presidential victory for the party, thus continuing what remains the only winning streak of more than two presidential elections by the Democratic Party since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Since 1948, there has been [[US presidential election, 1988|only one]] streak of three consecutive presidential victories by any party (in that case, by the Republicans).\n\nThe two largest third parties did not hurt Truman nearly as much as expected. Thurmond's Dixiecrats carried only four Southern states, a lower total than predicted. The civil rights platform helped Truman win large majorities among black voters in the populous Northern and Midwestern states and may well have made the difference for Truman in states such as Illinois and Ohio. Wallace's Progressives received only 2.4% of the national popular vote, well below their expected vote total and slightly less than the Dixiecrats, and Wallace did not take as many liberal votes from Truman as many political [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]] had predicted. Some analysts, including author Zachary Karabell, have even argued that the separate candidacies of Wallace and Thurmond were beneficial to Truman by removing the separate taints of [[communism]] and [[racism]] from the Democratic Party.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}} Thurmond's 2.4% is the lowest popular vote percentage for a candidate who won all of a state's electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evan McMullin Could Set Mark for Weakest National Popular Vote by Candidate to Win a State|url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2016/10/13/evan-mcmullin-could-set-mark-for-weakest-national-popular-vote-by-candidate-to-win-a-state/|date=October 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 1948 presidential election contrasted with other elections across the world during this period, for Truman was a [[Allied leaders of World War II|war leader]] who managed to win re-election ([[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] both left office shortly after the end of the war).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/winston-churchill|title=History of Sir Winston Churchill - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biographyonline.net/politicians/charles_de_gaulle.html|title=Charles de Gaulle Biography &#124;|website=Biography Online}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box| pv_footnote=| ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Harry S.

losing both Pennsylvania and New York (the first time being in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]]; later such elections included [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]). \n* Truman became the first Democrat ever to be elected president without carrying Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, or South Carolina (the Dixiecrats' states).\n* Truman was also the last Democratic presidential candidate to win without carrying Pennsylvania, [[Maryland]], New York, or

The subsequent adoption of the Twenty-second Amendment makes a repetition of this streak less likely, although there have since been four consecutive presidential elections (1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984) in which a different incumbent president was re-nomininated each time.\n\n== See also ==\n* Party conventions:\n**[[1948 Republican National Convention]] (Philadelphia: June 21\u201325, 1948)\n** [[1948 Democratic National Convention]] (Philadelphia: July 12\u201314, 1948)\n** [[Dixiecrat]] (Birmingham: July 17, 1948)\n** [[1948 Progressive National Convention]] (Philadelphia: July 23\u201325, 1948)\n* [[History of the United States (1945\u20131964)]]\n* [[Truman Balcony#Controversy over construction plans|Truman Balcony]]\n* [[1948 United States House of Representatives elections]]\n* [[1948 United States Senate elections]]\n* [[Second inauguration of Harry S.

Roosevelt]]. Defeating attempts to drop him from the ticket, Truman won the presidential nomination at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]]. The Democratic convention's civil rights plank caused a walk-out by several Southern delegates, who launched a [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] \"[[Dixiecrat]]\" ticket led by Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]]. The Dixiecrats hoped to win enough [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] to force a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where they could extract concessions from either Dewey or Truman in exchange for their support. Truman also faced a challenge from the left in the form of former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], who launched the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] and challenged Truman's confrontational [[Cold War]] policies. Dewey, who was the leader of his party's moderate eastern wing and had been the 1944 Republican presidential nominee, defeated Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] and other challengers at the [[1948 Republican National Convention]].\n\nTruman's feisty campaign style energized his base of traditional Democrats, consisting of most of the white South, as well as Catholic and Jewish voters; he also fared surprisingly well with Midwestern farmers.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=DiSalvo |title=The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972 |journal=Journal of Policy History |year=2010 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=269\u2013299 |jstor= |doi=10.1017/S0898030610000114 }}</ref> Dewey ran a low-risk campaign and largely avoided directly criticizing Truman. With the three-way split in the Democratic Party, and with Truman's low approval ratings, Truman was widely considered to be the underdog in the race. Virtually every prediction (with or without public opinion polls) indicated that Truman would be defeated by Dewey.\n\nDefying predictions of his defeat, Truman won the 1948 election, garnering 303 electoral votes to Dewey's 189. Truman won 49.6% of the popular vote compared to Dewey's 45.1%, while the third party candidacies of Thurmond and Wallace each won less than 3% of the popular vote, with Thurmond carrying four southern states. Truman's surprise victory was the fifth consecutive presidential win for the Democratic Party, the longest winning streak for either party since the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]]. With simultaneous success in the [[1948 United States elections|1948 congressional elections]], the Democrats regained control of both houses of Congress, which they had lost in 1946. Thus, Truman's election confirmed the Democratic Party's status as the nation's majority party.<ref>Paul Kleppner et al.

Spirits were low; the Republicans had taken control of both houses of the [[United States Congress]] and a majority of state governorships during the 1946 mid-term elections, and the public opinion polls showed Truman trailing Republican nominee Dewey, sometimes by double digits. Furthermore, some liberal Democrats had joined [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s new Progressive Party, and party leaders feared that Wallace would take enough votes from Truman to give the large Northern and Midwestern states to the Republicans.\n\nConservatives dominated the party in the South, and they were angered by the growing voice of labor unions and black voters in the party outside the South. The hope that Truman would reverse course had faded by 1947, when he vetoed the [[Taft-Hartley Law]], which would have helped control union power. Truman's appointment of a liberal [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] commission convinced Southern conservatives that to re-establish their voice they had to threaten [[third party (United States)|third-party]] action to defeat Truman in 1948.<ref>Robert A. Garson, \"The Alienation of the South: A Crisis for Harry S. Truman and the Democratic Party, 1945-1948,\" ''Missouri Historical Review,'' (July 1970) 64#4 pp. 448\u2013471</ref>\n\nTruman was aware of his unpopularity. In July 1947, he privately offered to be Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination, an offer which Eisenhower declined. Truman's offer to Eisenhower did not become public knowledge during the campaign.<ref name=\"nyt20030711\">\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/11/us/truman-wrote-of-48-offer-to-eisenhower.html?fta=y Truman Wrote of '48 Offer to Eisenhower]\" ''The New York Times'', July 11, 2003.</ref>\n\nAs a result of Truman's low standing in the polls, several Democratic party bosses began working to \"dump\" Truman and nominate a more popular candidate. Among the leaders of this movement were [[Jacob Arvey]], the head of the powerful Cook County (Chicago) Democratic organization; [[Frank Hague]], the boss of New Jersey; [[James Roosevelt]], the eldest son of former President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]; and liberal Senator [[Claude Pepper]] from Florida. The rebels hoped to draft Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate. On July 10, however, Eisenhower officially refused to be a candidate. There was then an attempt to put forward Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], but Douglas also declared that he would not be a presidential candidate. Finally, Senator Pepper declared his intention to challenge Truman for the presidential nomination. His candidacy collapsed when the liberal [[Americans for Democratic Action]] and the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] withheld their support, partly due to concerns over Pepper's attacks on Truman's foreign policy decisions regarding the Soviet Union. As a result of the refusal by most of the dump-Truman delegates to support him, Pepper withdrew his candidacy for the nomination on July 14. Lacking a candidate acceptable to all sides, the leaders of the dump-Truman movement reluctantly agreed to support Truman for the nomination.\n\n==== Democratic Convention ====\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Truman initially proposed a [[civil rights]] plank to the party platform that moderated the strong vocal support for civil rights that he had expressed at the NAACP convention in 1947, and to Congress in February 1948. This proposal disappointed Northern and Western liberals who wanted more swift and sweeping reforms in civil rights, but it also failed to placate Southern conservatives, and both sides decided to present their own amendments and proposals to Truman's civil rights plank.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael R.

The Southern delegates who remained nominated Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] from Georgia for the Democratic nomination as a rebuke to Truman. Nonetheless, 947 Democratic delegates voted for Truman as the Democratic nominee, while Russell received only 266 votes, all from the South.\n\nTruman's first choice for his running mate was Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, hoping that it might make the ticket more appealing to liberals. Douglas refused the nomination. Needing an alternative, Truman then selected Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] from [[Kentucky]], who had delivered the convention's [[keynote address]], as his running mate, with this nomination being made by acclamation.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Harvard |last=Sitkoff |title=Harry Truman and the Election of 1948: The Coming of Age of Civil Rights in American Politics |journal=[[Journal of Southern History]] |volume=37 |issue=4 |year=1971 |pages=597\u2013616 |jstor=2206548 |doi=10.2307/2206548 }}</ref>\n\nTruman gave a fighting acceptance speech, stating that \"Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make the Republicans like it - don't you forget it!...We will do that because they are wrong and we are right.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 129)</ref> He claimed that the Republican Party had, \"ever since its inception...been under the control of special privilege; and they have completely proved it in the Eightieth Congress.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 131)</ref> At the end of the speech the \"delegates rose to their feet and cheered loudly for two minutes...for a moment Truman had created the illusion - few regarded it as more than an illusion - that the Democrats had a fighting chance in November.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 130)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+The Balloting\n|-\n!Presidential Ballot!! !!Vice Presidential Ballot!!\n|-\n![[Harry S.

Eisenhower]], the most popular general of World War II and a favorite in the polls. Unlike the latter movement within the Democratic Party, however, the Republican draft movement came largely from the grassroots of the party. By January 23, 1948, the grassroots movement had successfully entered Eisenhower's name into every state holding a Republican presidential primary, and polls gave him a significant lead against all other contenders. With the first state primary approaching, Eisenhower was forced to make a quick decision. Stating that soldiers should keep out of politics, Eisenhower declined to run and requested that the grassroots draft movement cease its activities. After a number of failed efforts to get Eisenhower to reconsider, the organization disbanded, with the majority of its leadership endorsing the presidential campaign of the former Governor of [[Minnesota]], [[Harold Stassen]].\n\nWith Eisenhower refusing to run, the contest for the Republican nomination was between Stassen, New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] from Ohio, California Governor [[Earl Warren]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] from Michigan, the senior Republican in the Senate. Dewey, who had been the Republican nominee in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]], was regarded as the frontrunner when the primaries began. Dewey was the acknowledged leader of the Republican Party's [[Eastern Establishment]]. In 1946 he had been re-elected governor of New York by the largest margin in state history. Dewey's handicap was that many Republicans disliked him on a personal level; he often struck observers as cold, stiff, and calculating. Taft was the leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing, which was strongest in the Midwest and parts of the South. Taft called for abolishing many [[New Deal]] welfare programs, which he felt were harmful to business interests, and he was skeptical of American involvement in foreign alliances such as the [[United Nations]]. Taft had two major weaknesses: He was a plodding, dull campaigner, and he was viewed by most party leaders as being too conservative and controversial to win a presidential election.<ref>{{cite book |author=James T. Patterson |title=Mr. Republican: a biography of Robert A. Taft |url=https://archive.org/details/mrrepublicanbiog00patt_0 |url-access=registration |year=1972 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mrrepublicanbiog00patt_0/page/399 399]\u2013408 |isbn=9780395139387}}</ref>\n\nBoth Vandenberg and Warren were highly popular in their home states, but each refused to campaign in the primaries, which limited their chances of winning the nomination. Their supporters, however, hoped that in the event of a Dewey-Taft-Stassen deadlock, the convention would turn to their man as a compromise candidate.\n\nGeneral MacArthur, the famous war hero, was especially popular among conservatives. Since he was serving in Japan as the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] occupying that nation, he was unable to campaign for the nomination. He did make it known, however, that he would accept the GOP nomination if it were offered to him, and some conservative Republicans hoped that by winning a primary contest he could prove his popularity with voters. They chose to enter his name in the Wisconsin primary.<ref>Howard B. Schonberger, \"The General and the Presidency: Douglas MacArthur and the Election of 1948,\" ''Wisconsin Magazine of History,'' (Spring 1974) 57#3 pp. 201\u2013219</ref>\n\nThe \"surprise\" candidate of 1948 was Stassen, a liberal from Minnesota.<ref>Alec Kirby, \"'A Major Contender': Harold Stassen and the Politics of American Presidential Nominations,\" ''Minnesota History,'' (Dec 1996) 55#4 pp 150-165</ref> In 1938, Stassen had been elected governor of Minnesota at the age of 31; he resigned as governor in 1943 to serve in the wartime Navy. In 1945 he served on the committee that created the [[United Nations]]. Stassen was widely regarded as the most liberal of the Republican candidates, yet during the primaries he was criticized for being vague on many issues. Stassen stunned Dewey and MacArthur in the Wisconsin primary; Stassen's surprise victory virtually eliminated General MacArthur, whose supporters had made a major effort on his behalf. Stassen defeated Dewey again in the Nebraska primary, thus making him the new frontrunner. He then made the strategic mistake of trying to beat Taft in Ohio, Taft's home state. Stassen believed that if he could defeat Taft in his home state, Taft would be forced to quit the race and most of Taft's delegates would support him instead of Dewey.\n\nTaft defeated Stassen in his native Ohio, however, and Stassen earned the hostility of the party's conservatives. Even so, Stassen was still leading Dewey in the polls for the upcoming Oregon primary. Dewey, however, realized that losing another primary would end his chances at the nomination, and he decided to make an all-out effort in Oregon.<ref>(Smith, pp. 488-489)</ref> In April 1948 Dewey sent Paul Lockwood, one of his top aides, to build a strong grassroots organization in the state. Working with $150,000 sent by Dewey's powerful New York political organization (three times the previous record spent in an Oregon primary), Lockwood paid \"for 126 billboards, hundreds of sixty-second radio spots on every station in the state, and half-hour broadcasts each noon...The daily ''[[Portland Oregonian]]'' carried five Dewey advertisements a day.\"<ref>(Smith, p. 489)</ref> Dewey also extensively campaigned in Oregon, spending three weeks in the state. He \"invaded every hamlet, no matter how isolated, speaking at rural crossroads and shaking hands in hamburger stands. One journalist commented that Dewey was the greatest explorer of Oregon since [[Lewis and Clark]].\"<ref>(Abels, p. 57)</ref>\n\nDewey also agreed to debate Stassen in Oregon on national radio. Held on May 17, 1948, it was the first-ever [[Dewey\u2013Stassen debate|radio debate]] between presidential candidates. The sole issue of the debate concerned whether to outlaw the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]]. Stassen, despite his liberal reputation, argued in favor of outlawing the party, stating his belief that a network of Soviet-directed Communist spies \"within the U.S. demanded immediate, and punitive, response...Why did Dewey oppose such a ban? Stassen wanted to know.\"<ref>(Smith, pp. 492-493)</ref> \"We must not coddle Communism with legality\", Stassen insisted. Dewey - while criticizing Communist totalitarianism and Soviet actions in the Cold War - still forcefully argued against banning the Communist Party: \"This outlawing idea is nothing new...for thousands of years despots have tortured, imprisoned, killed, and exiled their opponents, and their governments have always fallen into the dust.\"<ref name=\"Smith, p. 493\">(Smith, p. 493)</ref> Dewey ended his turn in the debate by stating that \"I am unalterably, wholeheartedly, and unswervingly against any scheme to write laws outlawing people because of their religious, political, social, or economic ideas. I am against it because it is a violation of the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights...I am against it because I know from a great many years of experience in law enforcement that the proposal wouldn't work. Stripped to its naked essentials...this is nothing but the method of Hitler and Stalin. It is thought control...an attempt to beat down ideas with a club. It is a surrender of everything we believe in.\"<ref name=\"Smith, p. 493\"/> Surveys showed that from 40 to 80 million people nationwide listened to the debate, and most observers rated Dewey as the winner.<ref>(Smith, pp. 492-494)</ref> Four days after the debate, Dewey defeated Stassen in the Oregon primary.<ref>(Smith, p. 494)</ref> From this point forward, the New York governor had the momentum he needed to win his party's second nomination.<ref>Tom Swafford, \"The Last Real Presidential Debate,\" ''American Heritage,'' Feb/Mar 1986, Vol. 37 Issue 2, pp. 66\u201371</ref>\n\n==== Republican Convention ====\nThe [[1948 Republican National Convention]] was held in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. It was the first presidential convention to be shown on \"national\" [[television]]. (At this time there were 27 television stations in full operation in the US and an estimated 350,000 TV sets in the whole country.) As the convention opened, Dewey was believed to have a large lead in the delegate count.<ref>(Patterson, p. 411)</ref> His campaign managers - [[Herbert Brownell, Jr.]], [[Edwin Jaeckle]], and [[J. Russell Sprague]] - were \"as skillful a group of operators as ever manipulated a convention...it was said at the convention that the Dewey forces \"could have won even with Taft\" as their candidate.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 63-64)</ref> His main opponent, Senator Taft, was hobbled by an ineffective campaign team that one writer called \"bumblers\", and another historian noted that Taft's campaign manager, Ohio Congressman [[Clarence J. Brown]], \"seemed no match for Herbert Brownell...while the Dewey forces were busy flattering delegates and hinting at promises of patronage, Brown was still worrying about such mundane matters as hotel rooms and seats in the gallery for his friends.\"<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 410\">(Patterson, p. 410)</ref>\n\nDewey's leading opponents \u2013 Taft and Stassen \u2013 met in Taft's hotel suite to plan a \"stop-Dewey\" movement. A key obstacle soon developed, however, as both men refused to unite behind a single candidate to oppose Dewey: \"The essence of their impasse was simple. Neither Stassen nor Taft hated Dewey enough to withdraw [in favor of the other], and neither man thought he could get his delegates to follow if he did.\"<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 410\"/> Instead, both Taft and Stassen, along with Senator Vandenberg, simply agreed to try to hold their own delegates in the hopes of preventing Dewey from obtaining a majority. This proved to be futile, as Dewey's efficient campaign team methodically gathered the remaining delegates they needed to win the nomination. Stassen tried to contact General Eisenhower to ask him to reconsider becoming a candidate, but Eisenhower \"could not be reached.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 64-65)</ref> After the second round of balloting, Dewey was only 33 votes short of victory. Taft then called Stassen and urged him to withdraw from the race and endorse him as Dewey's main opponent. When Stassen refused, Taft wrote a concession statement and had it read to the convention at the start of the third ballot; at this point the other candidates also dropped out, and Dewey was then nominated unanimously by [[acclamation]].<ref name=\"Abels, p. 65\">(Abels, p. 65)</ref>\n\nDewey's campaign team originally wanted Illinois Governor [[Dwight Green]] to be his running mate, but the opposition of Colonel [[Robert R. McCormick]], the powerful publisher of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', nixed his chances.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 65\"/> According to journalist Jules Abels, Dewey managers Brownell, Sprague, and Jaeckle then appeared to offer the vice-presidential nomination to influential Indiana Congressman [[Charles Halleck]], in exchange for Halleck delivering the entire Indiana delegation to Dewey.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 65\"/> Halleck did so, but Dewey, who had not been present at the meeting between his managers and Halleck, decided to reject his candidacy, telling his aides \"Halleck won't do.\" After Dewey told Halleck of his decision, Halleck \"was first speechless with disbelief and then overcome with emotion.\" He told Dewey that \"you're running out on the Eightieth Congress, and you'll be sorry!\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 66-67)</ref> Abels wrote that Dewey's decision to deny Halleck the vice-presidential bid \"may have been a fateful one...Halleck with his forceful personality might have changed the tone of the Dewey campaign, and certainly the issue of the record of the GOP-controlled Eightieth Congress would have to have been met heads on.\"<ref>(Halleck, p. 68)</ref> Instead, Dewey chose popular governor (and future [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]) [[Earl Warren]] of California as his running mate. Following the convention, most political experts in the [[news media]] rated the Republican ticket as an almost-certain winner over the Democrats.<ref>(Abels, p. 71)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|+ The tally\n|-\n!Ballot || 1 || 2 || 3\n|-\n|'''[[Thomas E.

La Follette]] in 1924) was created afresh in 1948, with the nomination of [[Henry A. Wallace]], who had served as [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Vice President of the United States]], and [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1946, President Truman had fired Wallace as Secretary of Commerce when Wallace publicly opposed Truman's firm moves to counter the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]]. Wallace's 1948 platform opposed the Cold War policies of President Truman, including the [[Marshall Plan]] and [[Truman Doctrine]]. The Progressives proposed stronger government regulation and control of [[Big Business]]. They also campaigned to end discrimination against blacks and women, backed a minimum wage, and called for the elimination of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which was investigating the issue of [[Communism|communist]] spies within the U.S. government and [[Trade union|labor unions]]. Wallace and his supporters believed that the committee was violating the [[civil liberties]] of government workers and labor unions.\n\nThe Progressives, however, also generated a great deal of controversy because of the widespread belief that they were secretly controlled by Communists who were more loyal to the [[Soviet Union]] than the United States. Wallace himself denied being a Communist, but he repeatedly refused to disavow their support and, at one point, was quoted as saying that the \"Communists are the closest thing to the early Christian martyrs.\"<ref>(Ross, p. 162)</ref> [[Walter Reuther]], the president of the influential [[United Auto Workers]] union, strongly opposed Wallace's candidacy, stating that \"people who are not sympathetic with democracy in America are influencing him.\"<ref name=\"Ross, p. 153\">(Ross, p. 153)</ref> [[Philip Murray]], the president of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), stated in April 1948 that \"the Communist Party is directly responsible for the creation of the third party [Progressive Party] in the United States.\"<ref name=\"Ross, p. 153\" />\n\nWallace was also hurt when [[Westbrook Pegler]], a prominent conservative newspaper columnist, revealed that Wallace as vice president had written coded letters discussing prominent politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt and [[Winston Churchill]] to his controversial Russian [[New Age]] spiritual [[guru]] [[Nicholas Roerich]]; the letters were nicknamed the \"Guru letters.\" In his book ''Out of the Jaws of Victory'', the journalist Jules Abels wrote: \"Personalities were referred to by symbolic titles\u2014Roosevelt was 'The Flaming One', Churchill 'The Roaring Lion', and [[Cordell Hull]] 'The Sour One'... some of the letters were signed 'Wallace', others '[[Galahad]]'\", the name that Roerich had assigned Wallace in his cult.<ref>(Ross, p. 163)</ref> This revelation\u2014including direct quotes from the letters\u2014led to much ridicule of Wallace in the national press.\n\nThe Progressive Party Convention, which was also held in Philadelphia, was a highly contentious affair; several famous newspaper journalists, such as [[H. L. Mencken]] and [[Dorothy Thompson]], publicly accused the Progressives of being covertly controlled by Communists. The party's platform was drafted by [[Lee Pressman]], the convention secretary; he later admitted that he had been a member of the Communist party.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 117\">(Abels, p. 117)</ref> [[John Abt]] served as legal counsel to the convention's permanent chairman, Albert Fitzgerald; he also testified years later that he was a Communist.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 117\" /> [[Rexford Tugwell]], a prominent liberal in President Franklin Roosevelt's [[New Deal]], served as the Chairman of the party's platform committee. He became convinced that the party was being manipulated by Communists, and was \"so heartsick about Communist infiltration of the party that he discussed . . . with his wife disaffiliating [from the party] the night before the convention\" started.<ref>(Abels, pp. 116-117)</ref> Tugwell later did disassociate himself from the Progressive Party and did not participate in Wallace's fall campaign.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 117\" /> A number of other Progressive Party delegates and supporters would quit the party in protest over what they perceived as the undue influence Communists exerted over Wallace, including the prominent American socialist [[Norman Thomas]]. In the fall, Thomas would run as the [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate to offer liberals a non-Communist alternative to Wallace.<ref>(Abels, p. 233)</ref>\n\nSenator [[Glen H. Taylor]] from [[Idaho]], an eccentric figure who was known as a \"singing cowboy\" and who had ridden his horse \"Nugget\" up the steps of the [[United States Capitol]] after winning election to the Senate in 1944, was named as Wallace's running mate. Although he was a member of the Democratic Party, Taylor accepted the Progressive Party's vice-presidential nomination, saying \"I am not leaving the Democratic Party. It left me. Wall Street and the military have taken over the Democratic Party.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 34-35)</ref> After receiving the vice-presidential nomination, Taylor told reporters that there was a difference between \"pink\" Communists and \"red\" Communists.<ref>(Abels, p. 118)</ref> Taylor claimed that \"pink\" Communists would support the Wallace-Taylor ticket because they believed in a \"peaceful revolution\" to turn the government to left-wing beliefs, but \"red\" Communists would support the Republican ticket in the belief that they would cause another [[Great Depression]], which would give Communists the chance to take over the government.<ref>(Abels, pp. 118-119)</ref>\n\nIn the fall campaign the Wallace-Taylor ticket made a Southern tour, where both Wallace and Taylor insisted on speaking to racially integrated audiences, in defiance of Southern custom and law at the time. In several North Carolina cities Wallace was hit by a total of \"twenty-seven eggs, thirty-seven tomatoes, six peaches, and two lemons.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 206)</ref> When he left the state he announced: \"As Jesus Christ said, if at any time they will not listen to you willingly, then shake the dust off from your feet and go elsewhere.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 206-207)</ref> He ate only in unsegregated restaurants, traveled with a black secretary, and in Mississippi had to be escorted by police for protection. His aide Clark Foreman admitted that Wallace wanted to stir up controversy for the publicity it would receive in more liberal areas in the North and West.<ref>(Abels, p. 207)</ref> As the campaign progressed, however, Wallace's crowds thinned and his standing in the polls dropped. Wallace was hurt by the successful effort of labor unions to keep their members in the Democratic column, and by controversial statements from Progressives supporting \"appeasement with Russia.\"<ref>(Abels, pp. 211-212)</ref> Wallace himself attacked [[Winston Churchill]] as a \"racist\" and \"imperialist\", and Senator Taylor earned criticism for a speech in which he claimed that the \"Nazis are running the US government. So why should Russia make peace with them? If I were a Russian . . . I would not agree to anything . . . we are aggressively preparing for war.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 212)</ref>\n\nThe Wallace-Taylor ticket finished in fourth place in the election, winning 1,157,328 votes (2.4%). This was slightly less than the States' Rights Party, but the Progressive Party received no electoral votes.\n\n=== States' Rights Democratic Party nomination ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''States' Rights Democratic Party Ticket, 1948'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"| [[Strom Thurmond|{{color|black|Strom Thurmond}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"| [[Fielding L.

Only in those states in which he ran under the standard Democratic Party label did he win, his best performance as a third-party candidate being a far second in Georgia.|325x325px]]\nSouthern Democrats had become increasingly disturbed over President Truman's support of civil rights, particularly following his executive order racially integrating the U.S. armed forces and a civil rights message he sent to Congress in February 1948. At the Southern Governor's Conference in Wakulla Springs, Florida, on February 6, Mississippi Governor [[Fielding Wright]] proposed the formation of a new third party to protect [[racial segregation]] in the South. On May 10, 1948, the governors of the eleven states of the former Confederacy, along with other high-ranking Southern officials, met in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], to discuss their concerns about the growing civil rights movement within the Democratic Party. At the meeting, South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] criticized President Truman for his civil rights agenda, and the governors discussed ways to oppose it.<ref>Jeffrey Smith. ''Dixiecrat: The Life and Times of Strom Thurmond''{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Southern Democrats who had walked out of the Democratic National Convention to protest the civil rights platform approved by the convention, and supported by Truman, promptly met at [[Boutwell Memorial Auditorium|Municipal Auditorium]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on July 17, 1948, and formed yet another political party, which they named the [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Democratic Party]]. More commonly known as the \"Dixiecrats\", the party's main goal was continuing the policy of racial segregation in the South and the [[Jim Crow laws]] that sustained it. Governor Thurmond, who had led the walkout, became the party's presidential nominee after the convention's initial favorite, [[Arkansas]] Governor [[Benjamin Travis Laney|Benjamin Laney]], withdrew his name from consideration. Governor Wright of Mississippi received the vice-presidential nomination. The Dixiecrats had no chance of winning the election themselves, since they could not get on the ballot in enough states to win the necessary electoral votes. Their strategy was to take enough Southern states from Truman to force the election into the [[United States House of Representatives]] under the provisions of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Electoral College under the Twelfth Amendment|Twelfth Amendment]], where they could then extract concessions from either Truman or Dewey on racial issues in exchange for their support. Even if Dewey won the election outright, the Dixiecrats hoped that their defection would show that the Democratic Party needed Southern support in order to win national elections, and that this fact would weaken the pro-civil rights movement among Northern and Western Democrats. The Dixiecrats were weakened, however, when most Southern Democratic leaders (such as Governor [[Herman Talmadge]] of Georgia and \"Boss\" [[E. H. Crump]] from Tennessee) refused to support the party. Despite being an incumbent president, Truman was not placed on the ballot in Alabama.<ref>Hugh Alvin Bone, ''American Politics and the Party System'', p. 262 (McGraw-Hill 1955).</ref> In the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, the party was able to be labeled as the main Democratic Party ticket on the local ballots on election night.<ref name=uop>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1366 Dixiecrats] New Georgia Encyclopedia.</ref> Outside of these four states, however, it was only listed as a third-party ticket.<ref name=uop />\n\n===Christian Nationalist Party nomination===\n\nThis Party nominated [[Gerald L.

Top Republicans believed that all their candidate had to do to win was to avoid major mistakes. In keeping with this advice, Dewey carefully avoided risks; he spoke in platitudes, avoided controversial issues, and was vague on what he planned to do as president, with speech after speech being filled with non-political, optimistic assertions of the obvious, including the now infamous quote \"You know that your future is still ahead of you.\" An editorial in ''[[The Courier-Journal|The (Louisville) Courier-Journal]]'' summed it up as such: \"No presidential candidate in the future will be so inept that four of his major speeches can be boiled down to these historic four sentences: Agriculture is important. Our rivers are full of fish. You cannot have freedom without liberty. Our future lies ahead.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last=Donaldson| first=Gary A.| title=Truman Defeats Dewey| page=[https://archive.org/details/trumandefeatsdew00dona/page/173 173]| publisher=The University Press of Kentucky| year=1999| isbn=0-8131-2075-6| url=https://archive.org/details/trumandefeatsdew00dona/page/173}} Quoting ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'', November 18, 1948.</ref> A writer noted that the \"one broad issue that Dewey set forth in the campaign was unity...but [he] was oversold on an issue which had no visceral appeal to the average American. It was hard to understand what Dewey was driving at. Sometimes it seemed that he was asking Americans to achieve unity by being united behind him.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 191)</ref>\n\nTruman's campaign strategist, [[Clark Clifford]], later said that Truman's campaign was \"pitched to four distinct interest groups - labor, the farmer, the Negro, and the consumer. Every move had these four interest groups in mind.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 165)</ref> Since he was trailing in the polls, Truman decided to adopt a slashing, no-holds-barred campaign. He ridiculed Dewey by name, criticized Dewey's refusal to address specific issues, and scornfully targeted the Republican-controlled 80th Congress with a wave of relentless and blistering partisan assaults. Truman claimed that \"the Communists are rooting for a GOP victory because they know it would bring on another [[Great Depression]].\"<ref>(Abels, p. 237)</ref> In several speeches, Truman stated that \"GOP\" actually stood for \"gluttons of privilege\", and said that Republicans were \"princes of privilege\" and \"bloodsuckers with offices on Wall Street.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 194)</ref> He told one audience that \"The Republicans have begun to nail the American consumer to the wall with spikes of greed.\"<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 460\">(Manchester, p. 460)</ref> At the National Plowing Contest in [[Dexter, Iowa]], Truman told 80,000 farmers in attendance that \"this Republican Congress has already stuck a pitchfork in the farmer's back.\"<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 460\"/> He nicknamed the Republican-controlled Congress as the \"worst\", \"do-nothing\" Congress, a remark which brought strong criticism from Republican Congressional leaders (such as Taft), but no comment from Dewey. In fact, Dewey rarely mentioned Truman's name during the campaign, which fit into his strategy of appearing to be above petty partisan politics.\n\nUnder Dewey's leadership, the Republicans had enacted a platform at their 1948 convention that called for expanding [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], more funding for public housing, [[civil rights]] legislation, and promotion of health and education by the federal government. These positions were, however, unacceptable to the conservative Congressional Republican leadership. Truman exploited this rift in the opposing party by calling [[Turnip Day Session|a special session of Congress]] on \"Turnip Day\" (referring to an old piece of Missouri folklore about planting turnips in late July) and daring the Republican Congressional leadership to pass its own platform. The [[80th United States Congress|80th Congress]] played into Truman's hands, delivering very little in the way of substantive legislation during this time. Truman simply ignored the fact that Dewey's policies were considerably more liberal than most of his fellow Republicans, and instead he concentrated his fire against what he characterized as the conservative, obstructionist tendencies of the unpopular 80th Congress.\n\n[[File:Truman-Dewey-polls-1948.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Clifford K. Berryman]]'s editorial cartoon of Oct. 19, 1948, shows the consensus of experts in mid-October]]\n\nTruman toured much of the nation with his fiery rhetoric, playing to large, enthusiastic crowds. \"Give 'em hell, Harry\" was a popular slogan shouted out at stop after stop along the tour. The polls and the pundits, however, all held that Dewey's lead was insurmountable and that Truman's efforts were for naught. Indeed, Truman's own staff considered the campaign a last hurrah. Even Truman's own wife, [[Bess Truman|Bess]], had private doubts that her husband could win. The only person who appears to have considered Truman's campaign to be winnable was the president himself, who confidently predicted victory to anyone who would listen to him. Near the end of the campaign, Truman privately wrote a state-by-state electoral vote prediction and gave it to his aide, George Elsey. Truman believed that he would win the election with 340 electoral votes, to 108 for Dewey, 42 for Thurmond, and 37 marked doubtful (he accidentally left out four electoral votes).<ref>(Manchester, p. 461)</ref>\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, American movie theaters agreed to play two short newsreel-like campaign films in support of the two major-party candidates; both had been created by its respective campaign organization. The Dewey film, shot professionally on an impressive budget, featured very high production values but somehow reinforced an image of the New York governor as cautious and distant. On the other hand, the Truman film, hastily assembled on virtually no budget by the perpetually cash-short Truman campaign, relied heavily on public-domain and newsreel footage of the president taking part in major world events and signing important legislation. Perhaps unintentionally, the Truman film visually reinforced an image of him as engaged and decisive. Years later, historian [[David McCullough]] cited the expensive but lackluster Dewey film and the far cheaper but more effective Truman film, as important factors in determining the preferences of undecided voters.\n\nAs the campaign drew to a close, the polls showed Truman was gaining. Though Truman lost all nine of the [[Gallup Poll]]'s post-convention surveys, Dewey's Gallup lead dropped from 17 points in late September to 9 points in mid-October to just 5 points by the end of the month, just above the poll's margin of error. Although Truman was gaining momentum, most political analysts were reluctant to break with the conventional wisdom and say that a Truman victory was a serious possibility. On September 9, nearly two months before election day, pollster [[Elmo Roper]] announced, \"Thomas E. Dewey is almost as good as elected.... I can think of nothing duller or more intellectually barren than acting like a sports announcer who feels he must pretend he is witnessing a neck-and-neck race.\"<ref>(Manchester, p. 465)</ref> Roper stopped polling voters until the final week before the election, when he took another poll. It showed \"a slight shift to Truman; it still gave Dewey a heavy lead, however, so he decided not to hedge his bet.\"<ref name=\"auto\">(Manchester, p. 466)</ref> One poll showing strong Truman support in the rural Midwest was sponsored by the Staley Milling Company. They \"polled farmers by giving them a choice of a donkey or an elephant on chicken feed sacks. When the results among 20,000 farmers showed up as fifty-four percent to forty-six percent for the donkey, the poll was abandoned.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 275)</ref>\n\nWhen Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive stance after noticing that his crowds were dwindling, Herbert Brownell contacted 90 GOP state committeemen and committeewomen in all 48 states. With one exception, they \"urged [Dewey] to press forward on the high road\" his campaign had taken and to continue to ignore Truman's attacks.<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 463\">(Manchester, p. 463)</ref> The sole exception was Kansas committeeman Harry Darby, who warned Dewey and his managers \"that farmers were in a mutinous mood\" and recommended that Dewey take a tougher and more aggressive stance. However, given that all the polls still showed Dewey leading, and no other committee member supported Darby, his advice was rejected.<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 463\"/>\n\nIn the campaign's final days, many newspapers, magazines, and political pundits were so confident of Dewey's impending victory they wrote articles to be printed the morning after the election speculating about the new \"Dewey Presidency.\" ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine printed a large photo in its final edition before the election. Entitled \"Our Next President Rides by Ferryboat over San Francisco Bay,\" the photo showed Dewey and his staff riding across the city's harbor.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\">(Abels, p. 261)</ref> ''[[Newsweek]]'' polled fifty experts; all fifty predicted a Dewey win.<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\"/> Several well-known and influential newspaper columnists, such as [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] and [[Joseph Alsop]], wrote columns to be printed the morning after the election speculating about Dewey's possible choices for his cabinet. The day before the election, Pearson wrote that any chance of a Truman victory was \"impossible,\" and his column printed the day after the election stated that Pearson had \"surveyed the closely-knit group around Tom Dewey who will take over the White House 86 days from now.\"<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\"/> [[Walter Winchell]] reported that gambling odds were 15 to 1 against Truman. More than 500 newspapers, accounting for over 78% of the nation's total circulation, endorsed Dewey. Truman picked up 182 endorsements, accounting for just 10% of America's newspaper readership, being surpassed by Thurmond, who got the remaining 12% from many Southern papers. [[Alistair Cooke]], the distinguished writer for the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' newspaper in the United Kingdom, published an article on the day of the election entitled \"Harry S. Truman: A Study of a Failure.\"<ref name=\"Abels, p. 261\"/> For its television coverage, NBC News constructed a large cardboard model of the White House containing two elephants that would pop out when NBC announced Dewey's victory; since Truman's defeat was considered certain, no donkeys were placed in the White House model.<ref>(Smith, p. 20)</ref>\n\nAs Truman made his way to his hometown of [[Independence, Missouri]], to await the election returns, some among his inner circle had already accepted other jobs, and not a single reporter traveling on his campaign train thought that he would win.<ref name=\"Manchester, p. 463\"/> A number of prominent Republicans, anticipating serving in a Dewey Presidency, had already bought homes in Washington.<ref>(Manchester, p. 453)</ref>\n\n=== Results ===\n[[File:deweytruman12.jpg|thumb|Famous photograph of Truman grinning and holding up a copy of the newspaper that [[Dewey Defeats Truman|erroneously announced his defeat]].]]\nOn election night, Dewey, his family, and campaign staff confidently gathered in the [[The Roosevelt Hotel (New York)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in [[New York City]] to await the returns.<ref>(Ross, p. 241)</ref> Truman, aided by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], sneaked away from reporters covering him in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and rode to nearby [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]]. There, he took a room in the historic [[Elms Hotel (Excelsior Springs, Missouri)|Elms Hotel]], had dinner and a [[Turkish bath]], and went to sleep.<ref name=\"Ross, p. 242\">(Ross, p. 242)</ref> As the votes came in, Truman took an early lead that he never lost. The leading radio commentators, such as [[H. V. Kaltenborn]] of [[NBC]], still confidently predicted that once the \"late returns\" came in Dewey would overcome Truman's lead and win. At midnight, Truman awoke and turned on the radio in his room; he heard Kaltenborn announce that while Truman was still ahead in the popular vote, he could not possibly win. At 4 a.m., Truman awoke again and heard on the radio that his popular-vote lead was now nearly two million votes, and that he was well ahead in the electoral vote.<ref name=\"Ross, p. 242\" /> He told the Secret Service agents guarding him to drive him back to Kansas City, \"because it looks as if we're in for another four years.\"<ref>(Manchester, p. 469)</ref> For the rest of his life, Truman would gleefully mimic Kaltenborn's pedantic voice predicting his defeat throughout that election night. Dewey, meanwhile, realized that he was in trouble when early returns from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] showed him running well behind his expected vote total. He stayed up for the rest of the night and early morning analyzing the votes as they came in. By 10:30&nbsp;a.m., he was convinced that he had lost; at 11:14&nbsp;a.m., he sent a gracious telegram of concession to Truman.<ref>(Ross, p. 240-243)</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]'', a pro-Republican newspaper, was so sure of Dewey's victory that on Tuesday afternoon, before any polls closed, it printed \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman|DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN]]\" as its headline for the following day. Part of the reason Truman's victory came as such a shock was because of uncorrected flaws in the emerging craft of public opinion polling. According to historian [[William Manchester]], \"many professional pollsters...believed in what some had come to call [[James A. Farley|Farley's Law]].\"<ref name=\"auto\" /> James Farley, President Franklin Roosevelt's successful campaign manager in 1932 and 1936, had stated that, in his opinion, the great majority of voters decided which candidate to support during the political conventions. The fall campaigns, Farley believed, were simply \"ineffective carnivals\" that swayed few voters.<ref name=\"auto\" /> In 1948 many pollsters, relying on Farley's Law, believed that the election was effectively over after the Republican and Democratic Conventions, and they discounted the impact of Truman's campaigning that fall.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Manchester noted that \"Gallup's September 24 report foresaw 46.5% for Dewey to 38% for Truman. His last column, appearing in the Sunday papers two days before the election, showed Truman gaining sharply \u2013 to 44 percent \u2013 and the interviews on which it was based had been conducted two weeks earlier. The national mood was shifting daily, almost hourly.\"<ref name=\"auto\" /> After the election, a study by the University of Michigan revealed that \"14% of Truman's voters, or 3,374,800, had decided to vote for him in the last fortnight of the campaign.\"<ref name=\"auto1\">(Manchester, p. 471)</ref> Gallup and Roper also did an analysis of the votes, they \"learned that one voter in every seven (6,927,000), made up his mind in the last two weeks before the election. Of these, 75 percent picked Truman\", which was more than his margin of victory over Dewey.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> \"Using either the Michigan figures or Gallup-Roper's, one finds that some 3,300,000 fence-sitters determined the outcome of the race in its closing days \u2013 when Dewey's instincts were urging him to adopt Truman's hell-for-leather style and slug it out with him, and when he didn't because all the experts told him he shouldn't.\"<ref name=\"auto1\" /> After 1948, pollsters would constantly survey voters through election day.\n\nThe key states in the 1948 election were Ohio, California, and Illinois. Truman narrowly won all three states by a margin of less than one percentage point apiece. These three states had a combined total of 78 electoral votes. Had Dewey carried all three states, he would have won the election in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], even if not winning the popular vote. Had Dewey won only two (any two) of the three states, Truman would have had the most electoral votes but the Dixiecrats would have succeeded in their goal of forcing the election into the House of Representatives. The extreme closeness of the vote in these three states was the major reason why Dewey waited until late on the morning of November 3 to concede. A similarly narrow margin garnered Idaho and Nevada's electoral votes for Truman. Dewey countered by almost as narrowly carrying New York and Pennsylvania, the states with the most electoral votes at the time, as well as his native state of Michigan, but this was too little to give him the election. Dewey would always believe that he lost the election because he lost the [[Rural area|rural]] vote in the Midwest, which he had won in 1944 (the Kaltenborn predictions that Truman would joyously mock had, in fact, taken for granted that the \"country vote\" would go to Dewey).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_22.shtml |title=americanheritage.com |access-date=November 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207041433/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1968/4/1968_4_22.shtml |archive-date=December 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nJournalist Sidney Lubell found in his post-1948 survey of voters that Truman, not Dewey, seemed the safer, more conservative candidate to the \"new middle class\" that had developed over the previous 20 years. He wrote that \"to an appreciable part of the electorate, the Democrats had replaced the Republicans as the party of prosperity\" during and after the war. Lubell quoted a man who, when asked why he did not vote Republican after moving to the suburbs, answered \"I own a nice home, have a new car and am much better off than my parents were. I've been a Democrat all my life. Why should I change?\" Dewey's promise of a \"great house cleaning\" in Washington worried an Iowa minister who wanted to retain [[US farm subsidies|farm subsidies]] for parishioners. Worried about the consequences of another depression, he voted Democratic for the first time in his church's history. Truman received a record number of [[Catholic Church and politics in the United States|Catholic votes]], exceeding even the Catholic support of [[Al Smith]] in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]], in part because Wallace drew leftists away from the Democrats.<ref name=\"lubell1956\">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | author=Lubell, Samuel | year=1956 | pages=62\u201363,170\u2013172,224\u2013227 | edition=2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref>\n\nAnother reason for Dewey's surprise defeat was his complacent, distant approach to the campaign, and his failure to respond to Truman's attacks. Journalist Jules Abels wrote that \"the election was not thrown away by indifference or lack of effort. Preparation and more preparation had always been the distinguishing characteristic of Dewey and his team throughout his career...The truth is that Dewey's campaign was the result not of careless, but too careful and painstaking, calculation. The Dewey campaign was frozen into inertia not because it had been underthought, but because it had been overthought.\"<ref>(Abels, p. 142)</ref> Other possible factors for Truman's victory included his aggressive, populist campaign style; broad public approval of Truman's foreign policy, notably the [[Berlin Blockade#The start of the Berlin Airlift|Berlin Airlift]] of that year; and widespread dissatisfaction with the institution Truman labeled as the \"do-nothing, good-for-nothing 80th Republican Congress.\" In addition, after suffering a relatively severe recession in 1946 and 1947 (in which real GDP dropped by 12% and inflation went over 15%), the economy began recovering throughout 1948, thus possibly motivating many voters to give Truman credit for the economic recovery.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}\n\nThe year 1948 was a banner year for the Democrats, as they not only retained the presidency but also recaptured both houses of Congress. It was also an unprecedented fifth consecutive presidential victory for the party, thus continuing what remains the only winning streak of more than two presidential elections by the Democratic Party since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Since 1948, there has been [[US presidential election, 1988|only one]] streak of three consecutive presidential victories by any party (in that case, by the Republicans).\n\nThe two largest third parties did not hurt Truman nearly as much as expected. Thurmond's Dixiecrats carried only four Southern states, a lower total than predicted. The civil rights platform helped Truman win large majorities among black voters in the populous Northern and Midwestern states and may well have made the difference for Truman in states such as Illinois and Ohio. Wallace's Progressives received only 2.4% of the national popular vote, well below their expected vote total and slightly less than the Dixiecrats, and Wallace did not take as many liberal votes from Truman as many political [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]] had predicted. Some analysts, including author Zachary Karabell, have even argued that the separate candidacies of Wallace and Thurmond were beneficial to Truman by removing the separate taints of [[communism]] and [[racism]] from the Democratic Party.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}} Thurmond's 2.4% is the lowest popular vote percentage for a candidate who won all of a state's electoral votes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evan McMullin Could Set Mark for Weakest National Popular Vote by Candidate to Win a State|url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2016/10/13/evan-mcmullin-could-set-mark-for-weakest-national-popular-vote-by-candidate-to-win-a-state/|date=October 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe 1948 Presidential election contrasted with other elections across the world during this period, for Truman was a [[Allied leaders of World War II|war leader]] who managed to win re-election ([[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] both left office shortly after the end of the war).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/winston-churchill|title=History of Sir Winston Churchill - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biographyonline.net/politicians/charles_de_gaulle.html|title=Charles de Gaulle Biography &#124;|website=Biography Online}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box| pv_footnote=| ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Harry S.

losing both Pennsylvania and New York (the first time being in [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]]; later such elections included [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]). \n* Truman became the first Democrat ever to be elected president without carrying Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, or South Carolina (the Dixiecrats' states).\n* Truman was also the last Democratic presidential candidate to win without carrying Pennsylvania, [[Maryland]], New York, or [[Delaware]], and the 1948 election marked the last time that the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]] acted as the \"banner region\" of the Republican Party.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reichley|first1=A. James|title=The Life of the Parties|date=2000|page=249}}</ref>\n** In fact, 1948 is the only presidential election since the founding of the Republican Party where a Democrat won without Maryland.\n* 1948 also remains the last time a Democratic candidate won [[Arizona]] by a majority of the state's popular vote, although [[Bill Clinton]] carried the state by a plurality in [[United States presidential election in Arizona, 1996|1996]].\n* This remains the last time the Democratic Party has won [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa]] and [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai Counties]] in Arizona, [[Davis County, Utah|Davis]] and [[Uintah County, Utah|Uintah Counties]] in neighbouring Utah, [[Benton County, Arkansas|Benton]] and [[Sebastian County, Arkansas|Sebastian Counties]] in Arkansas, [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole]] and [[Highlands County, Florida|Highlands Counties]] in Florida or [[Hamilton County, Tennessee]].{{efn|Hamilton County did give a plurality to [[George Wallace]] in 1968}}<ref>Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century 'How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century']; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref>\n* This was the last time that the Democrats won Arizona until 1996, the last time the Democrats won California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming until 1964, and the last time the Democrats won Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Texas until 1960.\n* The four states won by Thurmond also meant that this election was also the last time that the Democrats failed to win South Carolina until 1964, when it voted Republican, the last time they failed to win Alabama and Mississippi until 1960, when they voted for unpledged electors, and the last time they failed to win Louisiana until it voted Republican in 1956.\n* As of 2019, this remains the last election in which [[United States presidential elections in Illinois|Illinois]] and [[United States presidential elections in New Jersey|New Jersey]] have not voted for the same candidate \u2013 and the only one since [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]].\n* As of 2019, this remains the last election in which the Republican candidate did not win at least one former Confederate state.\n* This Presidential election was the last of an unprecedented five consecutive elections in which the incumbent President was re-nominated and the last of an also unprecedented four consecutive elections in which the incumbent was re-elected. The subsequent adoption of the Twenty-second Amendment makes a repetition of this streak less likely, although there have since been four consecutive presidential elections (1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984) in which a different incumbent President was re-nomininated each time.\n\n== See also ==\n* Party conventions:\n**[[1948 Republican National Convention]] (Philadelphia: June 21\u201325, 1948)\n** [[1948 Democratic National Convention]] (Philadelphia: July 12\u201314, 1948)\n** [[Dixiecrat]] (Birmingham: July 17, 1948)\n** [[1948 Progressive National Convention]] (Philadelphia: July 23\u201325, 1948)\n* [[History of the United States (1945\u20131964)]]\n* [[Truman Balcony#Controversy over construction plans|Truman Balcony]]\n* [[1948 United States House of Representatives elections]]\n* [[1948 United States Senate elections]]\n* [[Second inauguration of Harry S.

The 37th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Chris Buck]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son survive a shipwreck. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of gorillas, and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage leopard named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid elephant named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a baboon troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, who turns against him. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and reveals his past to him. He dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of stowaway poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to capture the gorillas and sell them for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the storage area of the ship. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Clayton fatally shoots Kerchak and fights Tarzan across the treetops. Although Tarzan spares his life and destroys his shotgun, Clayton tries to kill him with his machete. After Tarzan traps Clayton in vines, Clayton wildly slashes the vines with his machete, causing him to fall from the tree with a vine tangled around his throat, hanging and killing him. Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully dying.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a 20-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots. [[Glen Keane]] served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult, while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and child. John Ripa studied the movements of young chimpanzees to use for young Tarzan's animation.<ref name=\"Green\" /> [[Brian Blessed]] provided the [[Tarzan yell]], while Goldwyn provided Tarzan's speaking voice.\n:*[[Alex D. Linz]] as young Tarzan\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the eccentric, feisty, kind-hearted, and intelligent daughter of Professor Porter. She is the first of the group to encounter Tarzan and becomes his love interest. Ken Duncan served as the supervising animator for Jane. Many of Driver's mannerisms and characteristics were incorporated into Jane's animation. The scene where Jane describes meeting Tarzan for the first time to her father and Clayton was improvised by Driver, resulting in Ken Duncan animating one of the longest animated scenes on record. The scene took 7 weeks to animate and 73 feet of film.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], Tarzan's adoptive mother, who found and raised him after losing her biological son to Sabor. She is also Kerchak's mate. [[Russ Edmonds]] served as the supervising animator for Kala.\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[Kerchak]], Kala's mate and the leader of the gorilla troop who struggles to accept Tarzan. [[Bruce W. Smith]] served as the supervising animator for Kerchak.\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as [[William Cecil Clayton|William Clayton]], an intelligent and suave - yet arrogant and treacherous - hunter, who guides the Porters on their quest. Randy Haycock served as the supervising animator for Clayton, basing his design on [[Clark Gable]] and other film stars of the 1930s and 40s.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, an eccentric, short-statured scientist and Jane's father. Dave Burgess served as the supervising animator for Porter. This was Hawthorne's final voice acting role before his death in 2001.\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Terk (short for Terkina, a feminization of Terkoz merged with Teeka), Tarzan's best friend, a wisecracking gorilla. She is also Kala and Kerchak's niece, making her and Tarzan adoptive cousins. Michael Surrey served as the supervising animator for Terk.\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Tantor]], a paranoid and submissive elephant, and Tarzan and Terk's close friend. [[Sergio Pablos]] served as the supervising animator for Tantor.\n:*Taylor Dempsey as young Tantor. \n* [[Erik von Detten]] and [[Jason Marsden]] as Flynt and Mungo, a duo of young gorillas who are friends with Terk.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDisney's ''Tarzan'' was the first Tarzan film to be animated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Whipp|first=Glenn|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|title=With Tarzan, It's A Disney Jungle Out There|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407132030/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+%60TARZAN,'+IT'S+A+DISNEY+JUNGLE+OUT+THERE.-a083614442|date=June 16, 1999|accessdate=September 29, 2014|archivedate=April 7, 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com}}</ref> [[Thomas Schumacher]], the President of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], expressed surprise that there weren't any previous attempts to animate a ''Tarzan'' film, saying, \"Here is a book that cries out to be animated.

In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his daughter, Jane. In addition to this, Kerchak was re-characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" />\n\nIn January 1997, husband-and-wife screenwriting duo [[Bob Tzudiker]] and [[Noni White]] were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" /> Comedy writer [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|Dave Reynolds]] was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film.<ref name=\"Animation Artist\">{{cite news| url=http://www.animationartist.com/movies/tarzan/Production/production.html | title=Disney's Tarzan Adventure: Two Worlds Merge | last=Tracy | first=Joe | publisher=Animation Artist | accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> \"I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch-up\", Reynolds said, \"A year and a half later, I finished.

However, Katzenberg persuaded Allen to leave the project for [[DreamWorks Pictures]]' ''[[Antz]]'' and in exchange, the studio would distribute his next four films.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|accessdate=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd.|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newsstand.</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |accessdate=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210336/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003.

Expanded to support moving objects as part of the background, ''Deep Canvas'' was used to create about 75 percent of the environments in Disney's next major animated action film, ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' (2002).\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Tarzan (1999 soundtrack)}}\nIn 1995, [[Phil Collins]] was initially brought onto the project as a songwriter following a recommendation by Disney music executive Chris Montan.

The 37th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Chris Buck]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son survive a shipwreck. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of gorillas, and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage leopard named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid elephant named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a baboon troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, who turns against him. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and reveals his past to him. He dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of stowaway poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to capture the gorillas and sell them for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the storage area of the ship. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Clayton fatally shoots Kerchak and fights Tarzan across the treetops. Although Tarzan spares his life and destroys his shotgun, Clayton tries to kill him with his machete. After Tarzan traps Clayton in vines, Clayton wildly slashes the vines with his machete, causing him to fall from the tree with a vine tangled around his throat, hanging and killing him. Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully dying.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a 20-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots.

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|accessdate=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd.|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newsstand.</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |accessdate=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210336/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003.

He is first mentioned in 1376 as being [[prince]] and [[knight]] during the reign of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Monarch|king]] [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. He called himself Count of Donji Kraji.  \n\nWith the help of Hrvoje, [[Ostoja of Bosnia|King Ostoja]] came to the throne in 1398. [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigmund]] broke into the Donji Kraji, but was suppressed by Hrvoje army. [[Ladislaus of Naples]] awarded him the title of Duke of Split, giving him the islands of [[Bra\u010d]], [[Hvar]] and [[Kor\u010dula]]. He was awarded administration of large territories and the title of Herceg Split Viceroy of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatia]], grand Duke of Bosnia and Duke of Donji Kraji. In doing so, he became Sigmund's largest opponent in Bosnia.{{Sfn|Mrgi\u0107|2008|p=85}} \n\nIn 1407, Sigmund led the Hungarian army and attacked Donji Kraji, but was stopped. The turning point came after the Sigmund victory in the [[Fortress of Doboj|Battle of Dobor]] (1408). Hrvoje did not personally participate in the battle, but the disaster of the Bosnian forces led him to reconcile with the Hungarian king. In doing so, he lost all the privileges he received from [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus]] and his power declined.{{Sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|1964|p=304}} Hrvoje turned to the Ottomans and brought them to Bosnia resulting in the Battle of Doboj (1415) where Hungarians were defeated. He died at the beginning of 1416 after which his possessions disintegrated rapidly. His widow Jelena later married the Bosnian king Ostoja. \n\n[[Jajce]], a major fortified caste, was built in the 14th century and initially was seat of Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107.

Even before 1386, it is possible to see the effects of the [[Ottomans]] in [[medieval Bosnia]], after numerous raids. Events during the 1410s marked the beginning of their active engagement. The Ottoman Empire supported the local nobility, led by [[Tvrtko II]]. After the La\u0161vanian battle on [[La\u0161va]] river (in 1415), the Ottomans and [[Hungary]] became the most powerful factor in the local affairs. Navigating between these two forces, bans and kings in Bosnia resisted pressures from both sides. Juraj supported 1434 Bosnian King Tvrtko II against [[Sandalj Hrani\u0107]] in the civil war.{{Sfn|Mrgi\u0107|2002|p=118-121}}\n\nJuraj was succeeded by his son Peter. The reign of Peter was marked by improved connections with The Pope who has repeatedly taken the Duke of Donji Kraji for protection, pointing out that he is the only one among the schismatic Bosnian rulers who has maintained true faith. He actively supported [[Vladislav Hercegovi\u0107]] in the fight against [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]]. Peter was last mentioned as alive in a Venetian document from 1456.{{Sfn|Mrgi\u0107|2008|p=121-124}} \n\nOttomans launched surprise attack on Bosnia, when they re-directed their troops from their supposed attack towards Hungary. Fortresses were quickly overrun, and [[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 of Bosnia|Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] fled from Jajce towards the Donji Kraji, while the [[Catherine of Bosnia|Queen Catherine]] fled to the coast.

He is first mentioned in 1376 as being [[prince]] and [[knight]] during the reign of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Monarch|king]] [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. He called himself Count of Donji Kraji.  \n\nWith the help of Hrvoje, [[Ostoja of Bosnia|King Ostoja]] came to the throne in 1398. [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigmund]] broke into the Donji Kraji, but was suppressed by Hrvoje army. [[Ladislaus of Naples]] awarded him the title of Duke of Split, giving him the islands of [[Bra\u010d]], [[Hvar]] and [[Kor\u010dula]]. He was awarded administration of large territories and the title of Herceg Split Viceroy of [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatia]], grand Duke of Bosnia and Duke of Donji Kraji. In doing so, he became Sigmund's largest opponent in Bosnia.{{Sfn|Mrgi\u0107|2008|p=85}} \n\nIn 1407, Sigmund led the Hungarian army and attacked Donji Kraji, but was stopped. The turning point came after the Sigmund victory in the [[Fortress of Doboj|Battle of Dobor]] (1408). Hrvoje did not personally participate in the battle, but the disaster of the Bosnian forces led him to reconcile with the Hungarian king. In doing so, he lost all the privileges he received from [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus]] and his power declined.{{Sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|1964|p=304}} Hrvoje turned to the Ottomans and brought them to Bosnia resulting in the Battle of Doboj (1415) where Hungarians were defeated. He died at the beginning of 1416 after which his possessions disintegrated rapidly. His widow Jelena later married the Bosnian king Ostoja. \n\n[[Jajce]], a major fortified caste, was built in the 14th century and initially was seat of Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107. It would become one of the capital cities of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]].{{Sfn|Fine|1994|p=455}} After Hrvoje death Jajce has passed back to the [[royal domain]].

Even before 1386, it is possible to see the effects of the [[Ottomans]] in [[medieval Bosnia]], after numerous raids. Events during the 1410s marked the beginning of their active engagement. The Ottoman Empire supported the local nobility, led by [[Tvrtko II]]. After the La\u0161vanian battle on [[La\u0161va]] river (in 1415), the Ottomans and [[Hungary]] became the most powerful factor in the local affairs. Navigating between these two forces, bans and kings in Bosnia resisted pressures from both sides. Juraj supported 1434 Bosnian King Tvrtko II against [[Sandalj Hrani\u0107]] in the civil war.{{Sfn|Mrgi\u0107|2002|p=118-121}}\n\nJuraj was succeeded by his son Peter. The reign of Peter was marked by improved connections with The Pope who has repeatedly taken the Duke of Donji Kraji for protection, pointing out that he is the only one among the schismatic Bosnian rulers who has maintained true faith. He actively supported [[Vladislav Hercegovi\u0107]] in the fight against [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]].

However, as the children and grandchildren of these immigrants began speaking English in their everyday lives and the various Lutheran denominations began uniting, many felt that the North American Lutheran churches needed a common English-language [[liturgy]] and hymns. Although the eighteenth-century missionary [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]] had hoped for the day when Lutherans would be \"one church [with] one book\", it was not until the 1888 \"Common Service\" that a majority of English-speaking Lutherans in North America began to use the same texts for worship, albeit with minor adaptations. (Senn, 584-591.) The \"Common Liturgy\" included in the 1958 [[Service Book and Hymnal]] was a major revision of the \"Common Service\", and introduced a Eucharistic Prayer into American Lutheran usage. ''Culto Cristiano'', a 1964 service book, attempted to offer a unified liturgy for Spanish-speaking Lutherans.\n\nThe process leading to the publication of the ''LBW'' was started in 1965 when the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) invited other North American Lutheran denominations to join it to work on a common service book. Together with the LCMS, the [[Lutheran Church in America]], the [[American Lutheran Church]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada]] formed the '''Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship''' to undertake this project. The commission conducted its work through four sub-committees: Liturgical Text Committee, Liturgical Music Committee, Hymn Text Committee, Hymn Music Committee. The work of the committees was validated via provisional liturgical and hymn materials, questionnaires, conferences, and dialogs. The Rev. Dr. Eugene Brand was named project director for the development work and The Rev. Leonard Flachman was named publishers' representative and managing editor. The ''LBW'' was published in [[1978 in literature|1978]]. The LCMS pulled out of the ILCW just prior to the publication of the ''LBW'', but having been a participant in the development of the materials its name appears on the title page. The LCMS published its own hymnal, ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (LW), in 1982.  Although the ''LW'' liturgies are very similar to those in the ''LBW'', there are differences which reflect differing theologies. For example, ''LW'' lacks the option for a Eucharistic Prayer.\n\nThe ''Lutheran Book of Worship'' has remained in use for thirty years. There are a couple reasons for that longevity. The first is the careful, forward-looking, inclusive work of the ILCW and the four subcommittees. The second is the careful work done by the staff of [[Augsburg Fortress|Augsburg Publishing House]] in selecting and testing the materials with which the book was manufactured. The books did not wear out.\n\nThe first printing of the ''LBW'' was one million copies and required 19 semi-trailers to carry the book from the printer to 14 distribution points around the United States.\n\nWhile it is in its twenty-seventh printing and widely used by the ELCA and the ELCIC, the ''LBW'' was replaced in October 2006 as the primary worship resource in the two denominations by ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''. The new book is intended to reflect the changing demographic of the church bodies and the subsequent changes in language and ritual practice.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of English-language hymnals by denomination]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|title=Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Augsburg Publishing House and Lutheran Church in America Publication Board|year=1978|isbn=0-8006-3330-X|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=With One Voice|last=|first=|publisher=[[Augsburg Fortress]]|year=1995|isbn=0-8066-0051-9|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/withonevoiceluth00evan}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical|last=Senn|first=Frank C.|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|year=1997|isbn=0-8006-2726-1|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Encountering God: The Legacy of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Kirk House Publishers|year=1998|isbn=1-886513-15-5|editor-last=Van Loon|editor-first=Ralph R.|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=In the Context of Unity: A History of the Development of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=Quere|first=Ralph W.|publisher=Lutheran University Press|year=2003|isbn=1-932688-00-5|location=|pages=}}\n\n{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n{{Lutheran hymnody}}\n\n[[Category:Lutheran hymnals]]\n[[Category:1978 books]]\n[[Category:Christian prayer books]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:1978 in music]]\n[[Category:1978 in Christianity]]\n[[Category:Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]\n[[Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Worship book and hymnal used by several Lutheran denominations in North America}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox hymnal\n| name            = '''Lutheran Book of Worship'''\n| cover           = Lutheran Book of Worship.JPG\n| caption         = 1978 edition of the ''Lutheran Book of Worship''\n| commissioned_by =\n| approved_for    =\n| country         = United States\n| pages           =\n| publisher       = [[Augsburg Fortress]]\n| released        = 1978\n| number_of_hymns = 569\n| psalms          = 150\n| service_music   =\n| last_hymnal     = ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]''\n| next_hymnal     = ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''\n}}\n\nThe '''''Lutheran Book of Worship''''' ('''''LBW''''') is a [[worship]] book and [[hymn]]al used by several [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] in [[North America]].
