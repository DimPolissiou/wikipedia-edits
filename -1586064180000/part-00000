As part of this restructuring, the [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] collections were transferred from the Art Gallery to the Museum.\n\nIn February 1947, the remains of the old Museum building (with the exception of the undamaged lecture theatre) were sold to Bristol University: it was then rebuilt as its dining rooms, later becoming [[Brown's Restaurant]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brown's Restaurant and attached front area walls and railings |work=historicengland.org.uk |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1218162 |accessdate=20 April 2007 |df= }}</ref> The sale of the building in 1947 reflected the intention that new premises would soon be provided for the Museum and the Art Gallery; planning began in 1951, but then dragged on for the next twenty years, during which time the old buildings received minimal attention, other than the insertion of [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanines]] to gain additional space.\n\nMeanwhile, various proposals had been made for new museum buildings in [[Castle Park, Bristol#Replanning|Castle Park]], in the very centre of Bristol, overlooking the [[River Avon, Bristol|river Avon]]. However, spiraling costs and funding difficulties meant that in 1971 the plans were abandoned and a smaller amount of money was put into upgrading the existing building. Wholesale refurbishment was required, including rewiring, rearranging offices, creating laboratories and dividing up and furnishing the basement to provide proper storage for the reserve collections.\n\nIn the summer of 2009 the museum hosted an exhibition by [[Banksy]], called Banksy versus Bristol Museum featuring more than 70 works of art, including animatronics and installations; it is his largest exhibition yet. It was developed in secrecy and with no advance publicity.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/whats-on/banksy-versus-bristol-museum/ \n |title=Homecoming for Bristol's Banksy \n |date=12 June 2009 \n |accessdate=8 February 2015 \n |url-status=live \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208114323/http://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/whats-on/banksy-versus-bristol-museum/ \n |archivedate=8 February 2015 \n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Collection==\n[[Image:bristol art.gallery.interior.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of Bristol Art Gallery.

The clients he looked for all young students who were by themselves.\n\nThe agents who captured Chamba, doubtful of his guilt, tried to confuse him by taking him to places distant from the actual murder sites; however, with surprising coldness, Chamba corrected them and lead back to the locations.\n\nA chronicle in the newspaper Spanish [[El Pa\u00eds]] presented the testimony of Fausto T\u00e9ran, a retired policeman who participated in the capture of the \"Monster of Machala\":\n{{quote|According to what Chamba confessed, he did not practice vaginal penetration of his victims.

Because of the testimony of a sex worker, one of the two women who survived his attack, criminal proceedings could be initiated against Chamba, which eventually led to his sentence of 16 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he served only 7 of these years, as he benefited from a law which lowered the sentences of well-behaved prisoners in half, as well as receiving another year due to the [[Great Jubilee]], when he was given amnesty.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/el-dolor-que-produjo-el-monstruo-de-machala-no-pasa-248620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223104408/http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/el-dolor-que-produjo-el-monstruo-de-machala-no-pasa-248620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 February 2014|title=The pain that the \"Monster of Machala\" produced never happened.|publisher=Explored.com|location=Quito|date=23 October 2006|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n==Migration to Spain==\nOn November 9, 2000, after serving his sentence and having his police record cleaned \u2013 a benefit only possible in Ecuador \u2013, Gilberto, who until then was married and had daughters with his wife Mariela, decided to move to Spain. He took a flight to [[Amsterdam]], and from there he traveled to the Barajas airport in [[Madrid]], where two of his sisters were waiting for him.\n\nSince then, Chamba maintained several jobs that varied between masonry and being a [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] building of his neighbours, where he lived with his family and casual girlfriends.\n\nBy September 2004, Chamba finally registered as a parking attendant for the entertainment complex Illa de I 'Oci, located near the Faculty of Law, in the town of [[Lleida]]. There he served not only as a caretaker, but also collaborated with the clerks who cleaned the movie theaters.\n\n==The new murder==\nThe six years of apparent tranquility for the Chamba family, which suffered greatly during their confinement in Ecuador, ended when Gilberto was arrested on December 1, 2004, accused of having raped and murdered Mar\u00eda Isabel Bascu\u00f1ana, a student of the local university's Faculty of Law.\n\nThe last time she was seen alive was the night of November 23. Her parents last spoke to her at approximately 10 PM, when she told them that she was not going to have dinner at home. Her body was found two days later, a few streets away from the cinema. She had a handkerchief tied around her neck, with garbage bags wrapped around her body. She had been brutally raped.\n\nSoon after, several theories arose about her death. Some speculated that it was a crime of passion, others - revenge, but it was her friends which gave the necessary clues to catch the killer.\n\n===The clues that gave it away===\nWithin the investigations carried out by the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]], testimonies from Bascu\u00f1ana's friends were compiled, which gave enough evidence to arrest Chamba.\n\nAccording to the agents, Mar\u00eda told them that Chamba constantly harassed her while she was dropping off or picking up her car from the movie theater. That version was complemented by those of other girls, who indicated that Chamba regularly asked for their phone numbers with the excuse that if something bad happened with their cars he would call them immediately.\n\nHowever, many of them received sexually harassing calls, and the only possible explanation was that the parking attendant made the calls. This hypothesis was confirmed when agents found Mar\u00eda's phone. After making records of the incoming and outcoming calls hours before and after the murder, they found that the victimizer had made two calls to phone sex services. The calls lasted between five and six minutes.\n\nThat was one of the clues that led agents closer to consider Chamba as the main suspect. In addition to this, the agents alleged in the trial to have found garbage bags inside of the glove department of Mar\u00eda's vehicle, the same ones that were used to cover her body. They were very similar to the ones used by cleaners in the cinemas to carry the waste, immediately connecting this to Chamba, one of the cleaning assistants.\n\nAt first Chamba was detained solely for questioning, as his co-workers, who were called to testify in the process, said that they hadn't noticed anything strange the night of the murder and that the Ecuadorian did not skip his shift. In addition, testimonies from neighbours and acquaintances of Chamba, all in his favour and recounted him as a kind man, denied his guilt.\n\nHowever, DNA tests on the sperm residue found on the victim's body directly incriminated Chamba, who argued that the police were making everything up to charge him. According to him, the agents took a sperm sample from a condom he had used and then inserted it into Mar\u00eda's vagina to indicated him as the culprit.\n\nWhen the corresponding analyzes and tests were carried out, the prosecutor's office dismissed the argument, which was the main element to incriminating Chamba.

The clients he looked for all young students who were by themselves.\n\nThe agents who captured Chamba, doubtful of his guilt, tried to confuse him by taking him to places distant from the actual murder sites; however, with surprising coldness, Chamba corrected them and lead back to the locations.\n\nA chronicle in the newspaper Spanish [[El Pa\u00eds]] presented the testimony of Fausto T\u00e9ran, a retired policeman who participated in the capture of the \"Monster of Machala\":\n{{quote|According to what Chamba confessed, he did not practice vaginal penetration of his victims. Practically they were skewered with an instrument similar to a cane, which had been expressly ordered to be manufactured. To many, he threatened them with such violence that the instrument came out through their mouths.}}\n\n===Condemnation in Ecuador===\nOf his ten victims, two were minors. Because of the testimony of a sex worker, one of the two women who survived his attack, criminal proceedings could be initiated against Chamba, which eventually led to his sentence of 16 years in prison.\n\nHowever, he served only 7 of these years, as he benefited from a law which lowered the sentences of well-behaved prisoners in half, as well as receiving another year due to the [[Great Jubilee]], when he was given amnesty.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/el-dolor-que-produjo-el-monstruo-de-machala-no-pasa-248620.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223104408/http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/el-dolor-que-produjo-el-monstruo-de-machala-no-pasa-248620.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 February 2014|title=The pain that the \"Monster of Machala\" produced never happened.|publisher=Explored.com|location=Quito|date=23 October 2006|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n==Migration to Spain==\nOn November 9, 2000, after serving his sentence and having his police record cleaned \u2013 a benefit only possible in Ecuador \u2013, Gilberto, who until then was married and had daughters with his wife Mariela, decided to move to Spain. He took a flight to [[Amsterdam]], and from there he traveled to the Barajas airport in [[Madrid]], where two of his sisters were waiting for him.\n\nSince then, Chamba maintained several jobs that varied between masonry and being a [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] building of his neighbours, where he lived with his family and casual girlfriends.\n\nBy September 2004, Chamba finally registered as a parking attendant for the entertainment complex Illa de I 'Oci, located near the Faculty of Law, in the town of [[Lleida]]. There he served not only as a caretaker, but also collaborated with the clerks who cleaned the movie theaters.\n\n==The new murder==\nThe six years of apparent tranquility for the Chamba family, which suffered greatly during their confinement in Ecuador, ended when Gilberto was arrested on December 1, 2004, accused of having raped and murdered Mar\u00eda Isabel Bascu\u00f1ana, a student of the local university's Faculty of Law.\n\nThe last time she was seen alive was the night of November 23. Her parents last spoke to her at approximately 10 PM, when she told them that she was not going to have dinner at home. Her body was found two days later, a few streets away from the cinema. She had a handkerchief tied around her neck, with garbage bags wrapped around her body. She had been brutally raped.\n\nSoon after, several theories arose about her death. Some speculated that it was a crime of passion, others - revenge, but it was her friends which gave the necessary clues to catch the killer.\n\n===The clues that gave it away===\nWithin the investigations carried out by the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]], testimonies from Bascu\u00f1ana's friends were compiled, which gave enough evidence to arrest Chamba.\n\nAccording to the agents, Mar\u00eda told them that Chamba constantly harassed her while she was dropping off or picking up her car from the movie theater. That version was complemented by those of other girls, who indicated that Chamba regularly asked for their phone numbers with the excuse that if something bad happened with their cars he would call them immediately.\n\nHowever, many of them received sexually harassing calls, and the only possible explanation was that the parking attendant made the calls. This hypothesis was confirmed when agents found Mar\u00eda's phone. After making records of the incoming and outcoming calls hours before and after the murder, they found that the victimizer had made two calls to phone sex services. The calls lasted between five and six minutes.\n\nThat was one of the clues that led agents closer to consider Chamba as the main suspect. In addition to this, the agents alleged in the trial to have found garbage bags inside of the glove department of Mar\u00eda's vehicle, the same ones that were used to cover her body. They were very similar to the ones used by cleaners in the cinemas to carry the waste, immediately connecting this to Chamba, one of the cleaning assistants.\n\nAt first Chamba was detained solely for questioning, as his co-workers, who were called to testify in the process, said that they hadn't noticed anything strange the night of the murder and that the Ecuadorian did not skip his shift. In addition, testimonies from neighbours and acquaintances of Chamba, all in his favour and recounted him as a kind man, denied his guilt.\n\nHowever, DNA tests on the sperm residue found on the victim's body directly incriminated Chamba, who argued that the police were making everything up to charge him. According to him, the agents took a sperm sample from a condom he had used and then inserted it into Mar\u00eda's vagina to indicated him as the culprit.\n\nWhen the corresponding analyzes and tests were carried out, the prosecutor's office dismissed the argument, which was the main element to incriminating Chamba. He received a sentence of 45 years, divided in 20 years for the murder of Mar\u00eda, another 12 for her rape, and another 13 for the attempted rape and murder of a Romanian prostitute who testified against him in court after seeing images of him on local media after his arrest.<ref>{{Citeweb|url=http://www.elcomercio.net/mundo/ecuatorianos-en-el-mundo/Monstruo-Machala-condenado-anos-carcel_0_132587103.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221143644/http://www.elcomercio.net/mundo/ecuatorianos-en-el-mundo/Monstruo-Machala-condenado-anos-carcel_0_132587103.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 February 2014|title=The \"Monster of Machala\" was sentenced to 45 years in prison.|publisher=\"El Comercio\"|location=Quito|date=10 November 2006|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{Citeweb|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2006/11/07/0001/12/ECDDDCF9EE564D8EAD581700E4D572DB.html|title=Accumulated penalties against the \"Monster of Machala\"|publisher=The Universe|location=Guayaquil|date=7 November 2006|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this evidence, the prosecutors alleged that Chamba had attempted to conceal information from the police.

On 30 Nov. 1909 the railroad reached the Tiekel River, completing the first phase of the contract.  Heney made another trip to New York to turn over that portion of the railroad to the Katalla Company.  On the return trip he spent the winter in Seattle.  His health failing, Heney finally succumbed to [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] on 4 Oct. 1910.<ref name=Quinn />{{rp|149\u2013151}}\n\nThe last spike in the construction, a \"copper spike\", was driven on 29 March 1911, by Chief Engineer E.

In 1941, the Kennecott Corporation donated the railroad right-of-way to the United States \"for use as a public highway\".  In 1953 conversion was started.  The Alaska Dept. of Highways had extended the [[Copper River Highway]] to Mile 59, from Cordova to the Million Dollar Bridge, by 1964.  However, the damage to 28 bridges after the [[Good Friday earthquake]] delayed further construction.

In contrast to traditional [[virtual machine]]s, the CVM shares resources that already exist in the host [[Operating system|OS]]. In traditional VM hosts, resources are virtualized for every (guest) OS. The CVM gives both OSs complete control of the host machine while the traditional VM sets every guest OS in an unprivileged state to access the real machine.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Ubuntu on Windows - running Synaptic and nautilus.png|thumb|left|[[Synaptic Package Manager|Synaptic]] and [[Nautilus (file manager)|nautilus]] running on Windows]]\nThe term \"cooperative\" is used to describe two entities working in parallel. In effect Cooperative Linux turns the two different operating system kernels into two big [[coroutine]]s. Each kernel has its own complete CPU context and address space, and each kernel decides when to give control back to its partner.\n\nHowever, while both kernels theoretically have full access to the real hardware, modern PC hardware is not designed to be controlled by two different operating systems at the same time. Therefore, the host kernel is left in control of the real hardware and the guest kernel contains special drivers that communicate with the host and provide various important devices to the guest OS. The host can be any OS kernel that exports basic primitives that allow the Cooperative Linux portable driver to run in CPL0 mode [[Ring (computer security)|(ring 0)]] and allocate memory.<ref>http://colinux.org/ coLinux main page</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nDan Aloni originally started the development of Cooperative Linux based on similar work with [[User-mode Linux]]. He announced the development on 25 Jan 2004.<ref>[https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/1/25/96 Dan Aloni announces Cooperative Linux]</ref> In July 2004 he presented a paper at the Linux Symposium.<ref>[http://www.colinux.org/publications/Reprint-Aloni-OLS2004.pdf Dan Aloni paper presented July 2004 at Linux Symposium]</ref> The [[open-source software|source]] was released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Other developers have since contributed various patches and additions to the software.\n\n== Comparisons ==\n\nCooperative Linux is significantly different from full [[x86 virtualization]], which generally works by running the guest OS in a less privileged mode than that of the host kernel, and having all resources delegated by the host kernel. In contrast, Cooperative Linux runs a specially modified [[Linux kernel]] that is ''Cooperative'' in that it takes responsibility for sharing resources with the NT kernel and not instigating [[race conditions]].\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nMost of the changes in the Cooperative Linux patch are on the [[i386]] tree\u2014the only supported architecture for Cooperative at the time of this writing. The other changes are mostly additions of virtual drivers: cobd (block device), conet (network), and cocon (console). Most of the changes in the i386 tree involve the initialization and setup code. It is a goal of the Cooperative Linux kernel design to remain as close as possible to the standalone i386 kernel, so all changes are localized and minimized as much as possible.\n\nThe coLinux package installs a port of the [[Linux kernel]] and a [[Network virtualization|virtual network device]] and can run simultaneously under a  version of the Windows operating system such as [[Windows 2000]] or [[Windows XP]].  It does not use a [[virtual machine]] such as [[VMware]].\n\n[[Debian]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] are especially popular with the coLinux users.\n\nDue to the rather unusual structure of the virtual hardware, installing Linux distributions under coLinux is generally difficult. Therefore, users in most cases use either an existing Linux installation on a real partition or a ready made filesystem image distributed by the project. The filesystem images are made by a variety of methods, including taking images of a normal Linux system, finding ways to make installers run with the strange hardware, building up installs by hand using the package manager or simply upgrading existing images using tools like [[Yellow Dog Updater Modified|yum]] and [[Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]]. An easier way to get an up-to-date filesystem image is to use [[QEMU]] to install Linux and \"convert\" the image by stripping off the first 63 512-byte blocks as described in the coLinux wiki.\n\nSince coLinux does not have access to native graphics hardware, [[X Window System|X Window]] or X Servers will not run under coLinux directly, but one can install<ref>[http://colinux.wikia.com/wiki/XCoLinux See \"XCoLinux\" on the coLinux Wikia]</ref> an X Server under Windows, such as [[Cygwin/X]] or [[Xming]] and use [[KDE]] or [[GNOME]] and almost any other Linux application and distribution.
