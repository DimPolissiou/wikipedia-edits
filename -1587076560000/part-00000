{"title_page": "Andrew Cogan", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2013}}\n'''Andrew Cogan''' also known as '''Andrew Coggan''' (born circa 1600, [[Greenwich]], [[England]]; died circa 1660) was the first agent of the English [[East India Company]] to rule [[Chennai|Madras]]&nbsp;(a.&nbsp;k.&nbsp;a. Chennai). He was the chief of the [[Masulipatnam]] factory when Madras was purchased from [[Peda Venkata Raya]], the last king of the [[Aravidu dynasty]] of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], the capital of which was at [[Chandragiri]]. As such Cogan is a significant figure in the history of the [[English colonial empire]].\n\n== Purchase of Madras ==\n\nIn 1637, [[Francis Day of Madras|Francis Day]], a member of the Masulipatnam Council and Chief of the Armagon Factory, made a voyage of exploration down the [[Coromandel Coast]] as far as [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]. At that time, the Coromandel Coast was ruled by the Raja of Chandragiri through a local chief or Nayak, Damarla Venkatapathy Nayak, who ruled the coast from Pulicat up to [[San Thome]]. He had his seat at [[Wandiwash]] and his brother, Ayyappa Nayak resided at [[Poonamallee]].\n\nIt is widely presumed that Ayyappa Nayak was the one who made overtures to the [[Kingdom of England|English]] to choose the area comprising the modern-day [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] for settlement. The offer looked good, and Day consulted Cogan, his superior, who investigated the proposed site and examined trading possibilities there. The results were favourable and Day secured a grant offering the [[village]] of Madraspatnam to the English for a period of two years. The [[Land grant|grant]] was dated August 1639, and after obtaining the approval of the Factory at Masulipatnam and the Presidency of Bantam (in Java), the settlement of Madraspatnam was begun.\n\n== Construction of Fort St. George ==\n{{further|Fort St. George}}\n\nDay and Cogan were jointly responsible for the construction of [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St. George]].

He had his seat at [[Wandiwash]] and his brother, Ayyappa Nayak resided at [[Poonamallee]].\n\nIt is widely presumed that Ayyappa Nayak was the one who made overtures to the [[Kingdom of England|English]] to choose the area comprising the modern-day [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]] for settlement. The offer looked good, and Day consulted Cogan, his superior, who investigated the proposed site and examined trading possibilities there. The results were favourable and Day secured a grant offering the [[village]] of Madraspatnam to the English for a period of two years.

Ascyltus are typically large to medium sized Salticids and often move relatively slow. However, they are capable of agile jumps when moving, hunting, or to avoid predators. They have well developed <u>[[Book lung|book lungs]]</u> and tracheal systems, and they are capable of utilizing both systems ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11815656 bimodal breathing]).

In 1995, the series was adapted into a satirical comedy theatrical film titled ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'', followed by ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'' in 1996. A second sequel, ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]'', aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in November 2002 as a [[television film|made-for-television film]]. In 1997, \"Getting [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]\" (season three, episode 12) was ranked number 37 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time]].<ref>{{cite journal|year=1997 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28 July 4 |pages= |publisher= |doi= }}</ref> The enduring popularity of the show has resulted in it becoming widely recognized as an American [[cultural icon]].\n\n== Development ==\nIn 1966, following the success of his TV series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', Sherwood Schwartz conceived the idea for ''The Brady Bunch'' after reading in ''The Los Angeles Times'' that \"30% of marriages [in the United States] have a child or children from a previous marriage.\" He set to work on a [[television pilot|pilot]] script for a series tentatively titled ''Mine and Yours''.<ref name=Brady>{{cite book |last1=Edelstein |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Lovece |first2=Frank |authorlink2=Frank Lovece|title=The Brady Bunch Book |year=1990|publisher=Warner Books |location=New York|isbn=0-446-39137-9 |pages=5\u20139}}</ref> Schwartz then developed the script to include three children for each parent. While Mike Brady is depicted as being a widower, Schwartz originally wanted the character of Carol Brady to have been a divorc\u00e9e, but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby Carol's marital status (whether she was divorced or widowed) was never directly revealed.\n\nSchwartz shopped the series to the \"big three\" television networks of the era. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]] all liked the script, but each network wanted changes before they would commit to filming, so Schwartz shelved the project.<ref>[[The Biography Channel]] documentary titled \"''The Brady Bunch''\", retrieved on June 16, 2008.</ref> Although similarities exist between the series and two 1968 theatrical release films, United Artists' ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'' (starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]]) and [[National General Pictures|CBS]]'s ''[[With Six You Get Eggroll]]'' (starring [[Brian Keith]] and [[Doris Day]]), the original script for ''The Brady Bunch'' predated the scripts for both of these films. Nonetheless, the outstanding success of ''Yours, Mine and Ours'' ([[1968 in film|the 11th-highest-grossing film of 1968]]) was a factor in ABC's decision to order episodes for the series.<ref name=Brady />\n\nAfter receiving a commitment for 13 weeks of television shows from ABC in 1968, Schwartz hired film and television director [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] to direct the pilot, then called \"The Brady Brood,\" cast the six children from 264 interviews during that summer, and hired the actors to play the mother role, the father role, and the housekeeper role.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwartz |first1=Sherwood |last2=Schwartz|first2=Lloyd J. |title=Brady, Brady, Brady: The Complete Story of The Brady Bunch as Told by the Father/Son Team who Really Know|year=2010|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-4164-X|pages=46, 48}}</ref> As the sets were built on [[Paramount Television]] stage 5, adjacent to the stage where ''[[H.R.

The wife and daughters take the Brady surname. Included in the blended family are Mike's live-in housekeeper, Alice Nelson ([[Ann B. Davis]]), and the boys' dog, Tiger. (In the pilot episode, the girls also have a pet:  a cat named Fluffy.  Fluffy never appeared in any episodes following the pilot.)  The setting is a large, suburban, two-story house designed by Mike, in a Los Angeles suburb.<ref name = \"BB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/thebradybunch.html|title=Brady Bunch synopsis|publisher=Sitcoms Online|accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, awkward adjustments, accommodations, gender rivalries, and resentments inherent in blended families dominate the stories. In an early episode, Carol tells Bobby that the only \"steps\" in their household lead to the second floor (in other words, that the family contains no \"stepchildren\", only \"children\"). Thereafter, the episodes focus on typical preteen and teenaged adjustments such as sibling rivalry, [[puppy love]], self-image, character building, and responsibility.

Lloyd Schwartz, son of creator and executive producer Sherwood Schwartz, later admitted that the character threw off the balance of the show and said that fans regarded the character as an interloper.

One of the adopted sons was played by Todd Lookinland, the younger brother of Mike Lookinland.

Although scheduled to be shown in its original full-length movie format, NBC at the last minute divided it into half-hour segments and showed one part a week for three weeks, and the fourth week debuted a spin-off sitcom titled ''The Brady Brides''. The reunion movie featured the entire original cast; this proved to be the only time the entire cast worked together on a single project following the cancellation of the original series. The movie's opening credits featured the season-one \"Grid\" and theme song, with the addition of ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradyworld.com/episodes/brides.htm |title=Brady World \u2013 Episode Guide |publisher=Bradyworld.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref> The movie shows what the characters had been doing since the original series ended: Mike is still an architect, Carol is a real-estate agent, Greg is a doctor, Marcia is a fashion designer, Peter is in the Air Force, Jan is also an architect, Bobby and Cindy are in college, and Alice has married Sam. Eventually, they all reunite for Marcia and Jan's double wedding.\n\n''The Brady Brides'' features [[Maureen McCormick]] (Marcia) and [[Eve Plumb]] (Jan) in regular roles. The series begins with Marcia and Jan and their new husbands buying a house and living together. The clashes between Jan's uptight and conservative husband, Philip Covington III (a college professor in science who is several years older than Jan, played by Ron Kuhlman) and Marcia's slovenly and more [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] husband, Wally Logan (a fun-loving salesman for a large toy company, played by [[Jerry Houser]]), were the pivot on which many of the stories were based, not unlike ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''. [[Florence Henderson]] and [[Ann B. Davis]] also appeared regularly. Ten episodes were aired before the sitcom was cancelled. This was the only Brady show in sitcom form to be filmed in front of a live studio audience. [[Bob Eubanks]] guest-starred as himself in an episode where the two couples appear on ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''.\n\nThroughout the late 1980s and 1990s, ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' was rerun on various networks in its original full-length movie format.\n\nIn 2019, the series was released on DVD for the first time as a part of ''The Brady-est Brady Bunch TV & Movie Collection''.\n\n====Episodes====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:70%\"\n! style=\"background:#f8e900\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#f8e900\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#f8e900\"| Original air date\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1 | Title = The Brady Girls Get Married (Part 1) | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|2|6}}\n| ShortSummary = Marcia and Jan announce that they are both getting married and plans soon begin for a double wedding. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2 | Title = The Brady Girls Get Married (Part 2) | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|2|13}}\n| ShortSummary = Jan and Philip want a traditional wedding, and Marcia and Wally want a modern wedding. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 3 | Title = The Brady Girls Get Married (Part 3) | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|{{nowrap| February 20, 1981}}}}\n| ShortSummary = The weather spells disaster for an outdoor wedding, so they end up having the ceremony inside the Brady house. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 4 | Title = Living Together | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|3|6}}\n| ShortSummary = After all the houses they see are too expensive, Marcia, Jan and their husbands decide to share a house. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 5 | Title = Gorilla of My Dreams | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|3|13}}\n| ShortSummary = Marcia and Jan get some self-defense lessons from their mother, while a thief attempts to burglarize their home. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 6 | Title = The Newlywed Game | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|3|20}}\n| ShortSummary = Game-show host [[Bob Eubanks]] asks Marcia and Jan to appear on ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' with their new husbands. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 7 | Title = The Mom Who Came to Dinner | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|3|27}}\n| ShortSummary = Carol temporarily moves in with her newly wedded daughters and their husbands. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 8 | Title = The Siege | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|4|3}}\n| ShortSummary = Wally's guilt over parking tickets causes him to panic when a policeman visits the house, so he decides to impersonate Philip. | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 9 | Title = Cool Hand Phil | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|4|10}}\n| ShortSummary = Philip tries to change his image by dressing and acting \"hip.\" | LineColor = f8e900  }}  {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 10 | Title = A Pretty Boy is Like a Melody | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1981|4|17}}\n| ShortSummary = Marcia is forced to use Wally and Philip in her fashion show after her models go on strike. | LineColor = f8e900  \n}}\n|}\n\n===''A Very Brady Christmas''===\n{{Main|A Very Brady Christmas}}\nA second TV reunion movie, ''A Very Brady Christmas'', aired in December 1988 on CBS and featured most of the regular cast (except [[Susan Olsen]], who was on her honeymoon at the time of filming; the role of Cindy was played by [[Jennifer Runyon]]), as well as three grandchildren, Peter's girlfriend, Valerie, and the spouses of Greg, Marcia, and Jan (Nora, Wally, and Phillip, respectively).<ref>{{cite book|last=Owen|first=Rob |title=Gen X TV: \"The Brady Bunch\" to \"Melrose Place\"|year=1999|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=0-8156-0585-4|page=26}}</ref> The [[Nielsen ratings]] for ''A Very Brady Christmas'' were the highest of any television movie that season for CBS.<ref>{{cite book|last=Newcomb|first=Horace |title=Encyclopedia of television: A-C, Volume 1|edition=2|year=2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1-57958-411-X|page=300}}</ref>\n\n===''The Bradys''===\n{{Main|The Bradys}}\nDue to the success of ''A Very Brady Christmas'', CBS asked ''Brady Bunch'' creator Sherwood Schwartz and his son Lloyd to create a new series for the network. According to Lloyd Schwartz,  his father and he initially balked at the idea because they felt a new series would harm the Brady franchise. They finally relented because CBS was \"desperate for programming\". A new series featuring the Brady clan was created entitled ''The Bradys''. All the original ''Brady Bunch'' cast members returned for the series, except for [[Maureen McCormick]] (Marcia), who was replaced with [[Leah Ayres]].\n\nAs with ''A Very Brady Christmas'', ''The Bradys'' also featured elements of comedy and drama and featured storylines that were of a more serious nature than that of the original series and its subsequent spin-offs. Lloyd Schwartz later said he compared ''The Bradys'' to another dramedy of the time, ''[[thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]''. The two-hour series premiere episode aired on February 9, 1990, at 9 pm on CBS and initially drew respectable ratings. Subsequent episodes were moved to 8 pm, where ratings quickly declined. Due to the decline, CBS cancelled the series after six episodes.<ref>Schwartz 2010 p. 228</ref>\n\n===''Day by Day'': \"A Very Brady Episode\"===\nThe ''[[Day by Day (American TV series)|Day by Day]]'' episode titled \"A Very Brady Episode\" (February 5, 1989), on NBC, reunited six of the original ''The Brady Bunch'' cast members: [[Robert Reed]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[Ann B.

The series revolves around a large [[Stepfamily|blended family]] with six children. Considered one of the last of the old-style family sitcoms, the series aired for five seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in September 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/blogra/656581/brady-bunch-actor-ann-b-davis-dies-88|title=Ann B Davis obit|publisher=Straight.com|accessdate=2014-06-03}}</ref> While the series was never a critical success or hit series during its original run, it has since become a popular staple in syndication, especially among children and teenaged viewers.\n\n''The Brady Bunch''{{'}}s success in syndication led to several television reunion films and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series: ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'' (1976\u201377), ''[[The Brady Bunch#The Brady Girls Get Married .2F The Brady Brides|The Brady Girls Get Married]]'' (1981), ''[[The Brady Bunch#The Brady Girls Get Married .2F The Brady Brides|The Brady Brides]]'' (1981), ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]'' (1988), and ''[[The Bradys]]'' (1990). In 1995, the series was adapted into a satirical comedy theatrical film titled ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'', followed by ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'' in 1996. A second sequel, ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]'', aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in November 2002 as a [[television film|made-for-television film]]. In 1997, \"Getting [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]\" (season three, episode 12) was ranked number 37 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time]].<ref>{{cite journal|year=1997 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28 July 4 |pages= |publisher= |doi= }}</ref> The enduring popularity of the show has resulted in it becoming widely recognized as an American [[cultural icon]].\n\n== Development ==\nIn 1966, following the success of his TV series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', Sherwood Schwartz conceived the idea for ''The Brady Bunch'' after reading in ''The Los Angeles Times'' that \"30% of marriages [in the United States] have a child or children from a previous marriage.\" He set to work on a [[television pilot|pilot]] script for a series tentatively titled ''Mine and Yours''.<ref name=Brady>{{cite book |last1=Edelstein |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Lovece |first2=Frank |authorlink2=Frank Lovece|title=The Brady Bunch Book |year=1990|publisher=Warner Books |location=New York|isbn=0-446-39137-9 |pages=5\u20139}}</ref> Schwartz then developed the script to include three children for each parent. While Mike Brady is depicted as being a widower, Schwartz originally wanted the character of Carol Brady to have been a divorc\u00e9e, but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby Carol's marital status (whether she was divorced or widowed) was never directly revealed.\n\nSchwartz shopped the series to the \"big three\" television networks of the era. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[NBC]] all liked the script, but each network wanted changes before they would commit to filming, so Schwartz shelved the project.<ref>[[The Biography Channel]] documentary titled \"''The Brady Bunch''\", retrieved on June 16, 2008.</ref> Although similarities exist between the series and two 1968 theatrical release films, United Artists' ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'' (starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]]) and [[National General Pictures|CBS]]'s ''[[With Six You Get Eggroll]]'' (starring [[Brian Keith]] and [[Doris Day]]), the original script for ''The Brady Bunch'' predated the scripts for both of these films. Nonetheless, the outstanding success of ''Yours, Mine and Ours'' ([[1968 in film|the 11th-highest-grossing film of 1968]]) was a factor in ABC's decision to order episodes for the series.<ref name=Brady />\n\nAfter receiving a commitment for 13 weeks of television shows from ABC in 1968, Schwartz hired film and television director [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] to direct the pilot, then called \"The Brady Brood,\" cast the six children from 264 interviews during that summer, and hired the actors to play the mother role, the father role, and the housekeeper role.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwartz |first1=Sherwood |last2=Schwartz|first2=Lloyd J. |title=Brady, Brady, Brady: The Complete Story of The Brady Bunch as Told by the Father/Son Team who Really Know|year=2010|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-4164-X|pages=46, 48}}</ref> As the sets were built on [[Paramount Television]] stage 5, adjacent to the stage where ''[[H.R.

The wife and daughters take the Brady surname. Included in the blended family are Mike's live-in housekeeper, Alice Nelson ([[Ann B. Davis]]), and the boys' dog, Tiger. (In the pilot episode, the girls also have a pet:  a cat named Fluffy.  Fluffy never appeared in any episodes following the pilot.)  The setting is a large, suburban, two-story house designed by Mike, in a Los Angeles suburb.<ref name = \"BB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/thebradybunch.html|title=Brady Bunch synopsis|publisher=Sitcoms Online|accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, awkward adjustments, accommodations, gender rivalries, and resentments inherent in blended families dominate the stories. In an early episode, Carol tells Bobby that the only \"steps\" in their household lead to the second floor (in other words, that the family contains no \"stepchildren\", only \"children\"). Thereafter, the episodes focus on typical preteen and teenaged adjustments such as sibling rivalry, [[puppy love]], self-image, character building, and responsibility.  Noticeably absent was any political commentary, especially regarding the [[Vietnam War]], which was being waged at its largest extent during the height of the series.<ref>History Channel, \"The Social History of Television\" (Aug 2013)</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of The Brady Bunch characters}}\n\n===Main===\nThe regular cast appeared in an opening title sequence in which video head shots were arranged in a three-by-three grid, with each cast member appearing to look at the other cast members.

Tiger appeared in about half the episodes in the first season and about half a dozen episodes in the second season. Tiger seemingly vanished without an explanation and was not shown again after \"The Impractical Joker\" (last episode shown with Tiger) and \"What Goes Up\" (last episode made with Tiger).\n[[File:Robbie Rist Cousin Oliver Brady Bunch 1974.JPG|thumb|180px|Robbie Rist as Cousin Oliver]]\n*Mr. Phillips ([[Jack Collins (actor)|Jack Collins]]) is Mike's boss at the architectural firm.

The character was added in an attempt to fill the age gap left by the maturing Brady children \u2013 the youngest (Susan Olsen) was 12 years old during the show's final season. Lloyd Schwartz, son of creator and executive producer Sherwood Schwartz, later admitted that the character threw off the balance of the show and said that fans regarded the character as an interloper. Oliver appeared in the final six episodes of season five, which proved to be the final season, as ABC cancelled the series in 1974. The addition of the character has been cited as the  moment the series \"[[jumped the shark]]\".<ref>Schwartz 2010 p.201</ref> The term \"Cousin Oliver\" has been used to describe the addition of a young character to a series in an attempt to save a series from cancellation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ariano|first1=Tara|last2=Bunting|first2=Sarah D. |title=Television Without Pity: 752 Things We Love to Hate (And Hate to Love) About TV|year=2006|publisher=Quirk Books|isbn=1-59474-117-4|page=63}}</ref>\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n[[File:Davy Jones Maureen McCormick Brady Bunch 1971.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] with [[Maureen McCormick]] in the 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' episode \"Getting Davy Jones\"]]\n* [[Herbert Anderson]] as a doctor who comes to treat the boys' measles in \"Is There a Doctor in the House?\" (season one)\n* [[Melissa Sue Anderson]] played Millicent, a girl who gives Bobby his first kiss (\"Never Too Young\", season five)\n* [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]] meets Marcia, who had written about him in her diary in \"The Possible Dream\" (season one)\n* [[Jim Backus]] appears three times in the series, twice in two of the three Grand Canyon episodes, \"Ghost Town U.S.A.\" and \"Grand Canyon or Bust\", playing Zaccariah T.

In season two, the Brady kids took over singing the theme song. In season three, the boys sing the first verse, girls sing the second verse, and all sing together for the third and last verse. In season four, a new version is recorded with the same structure as the season three version, but in season five, the season three version returns. The sequence was created and filmed by [[Howard A. Anderson, Jr.]], a visual effects pioneer who worked on the title sequences for many popular television series.<ref name=archive>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/howard-anderson-jr#|title=Howard Anderson, Jr. Interview|publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Archive of American Television|accessdate=2015-10-30}}</ref>\n\nThe end credits feature an instrumental version of the theme song's third verse.

Although scheduled to be shown in its original full-length movie format, NBC at the last minute divided it into half-hour segments and showed one part a week for three weeks, and the fourth week debuted a spin-off sitcom titled ''The Brady Brides''. The reunion movie featured the entire original cast; this proved to be the only time the entire cast worked together on a single project following the cancellation of the original series. The movie's opening credits featured the season-one \"Grid\" and theme song, with the addition of ''The Brady Girls Get Married'' title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bradyworld.com/episodes/brides.htm |title=Brady World \u2013 Episode Guide |publisher=Bradyworld.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref> The movie shows what the characters had been doing since the original series ended: Mike is still an architect, Carol is a real-estate agent, Greg is a doctor, Marcia is a fashion designer, Peter is in the Air Force, Jan is also an architect, Bobby and Cindy are in college, and Alice has married Sam. Eventually, they all reunite for Marcia and Jan's double wedding.\n\n''The Brady Brides'' features [[Maureen McCormick]] (Marcia) and [[Eve Plumb]] (Jan) in regular roles. The series begins with Marcia and Jan and their new husbands buying a house and living together. The clashes between Jan's uptight and conservative husband, Philip Covington III (a college professor in science who is several years older than Jan, played by Ron Kuhlman) and Marcia's slovenly and more [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] husband, Wally Logan (a fun-loving salesman for a large toy company, played by [[Jerry Houser]]), were the pivot on which many of the stories were based, not unlike ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.

According to Lloyd Schwartz,  his father and he initially balked at the idea because they felt a new series would harm the Brady franchise. They finally relented because CBS was \"desperate for programming\". A new series featuring the Brady clan was created entitled ''The Bradys''. All the original ''Brady Bunch'' cast members returned for the series, except for [[Maureen McCormick]] (Marcia), who was replaced with [[Leah Ayres]].\n\nAs with ''A Very Brady Christmas'', ''The Bradys'' also featured elements of comedy and drama and featured storylines that were of a more serious nature than that of the original series and its subsequent spin-offs. Lloyd Schwartz later said he compared ''The Bradys'' to another dramedy of the time, ''[[thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]''. The two-hour series premiere episode aired on February 9, 1990, at 9 pm on CBS and initially drew respectable ratings. Subsequent episodes were moved to 8 pm, where ratings quickly declined. Due to the decline, CBS cancelled the series after six episodes.<ref>Schwartz 2010 p. 228</ref>\n\n===''Day by Day'': \"A Very Brady Episode\"===\nThe ''[[Day by Day (American TV series)|Day by Day]]'' episode titled \"A Very Brady Episode\" (February 5, 1989), on NBC, reunited six of the original ''The Brady Bunch'' cast members: [[Robert Reed]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[Ann B.

[[Mike Lookinland]], [[Susan Olsen]] and [[Maureen McCormick]] appeared in deleted scenes. \n\nA sequel, ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'', was released in 1996. The cast of the first film returned for the sequel. Another sequel, ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]],'' was made-for-television and aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 2002.

The campaign consisted of a series of battles that were all overwhelming victories for the Native Americans, and the collective losses are sometimes referred to as Harmar's defeat.\n\n==Prelude to battle==\nFrom 1784 to 1789, there was considerable violence between encroaching American settlers and the [[Shawnee]] and [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Indians in [[Kentucky]], along the [[Ohio River]], and at the few American settlements north of the Ohio, with some 1,500 settlers killed by the Indians. However, there was no general war. Before the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British had tried to [[Proclamation Line|preserve this area as a Native American reserve]] but it was forced to cede what became known as the Northwest Territory when [[American Revolution|the United States gained independence]]. American settlers were eager to enter these lands and started to do so.\n\nIn 1789, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] wrote to [[Arthur St. Clair]], Governor of the Northwest Territory (an entity not recognized by its Native inhabitants), and asked him to determine whether the Indians living along the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Illinois River]]s were \"inclined for war or peace\" with the United States.  St. Clair decided the tribes \"wanted war\", and called for militia forces to be assembled at [[Fort Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio|Fort Washington]] (now [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]) and [[Vincennes, Indiana]].  President Washington and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] ordered General [[Josiah Harmar]] to lead these forces on a \"punitive expedition\" into the Shawnee and Miami lands as retaliation for the killings of American settlers and travellers on the contested frontier, and to deter the tribes from further attacks.\n\nThe primary objective of the campaign was the destruction of the large, main Miami village of [[Kekionga]] (present-day [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]), where the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph]] and [[St. Marys River (Indiana and Ohio)|St. Mary's]] rivers join to form the [[Maumee River]]. St. Clair and Harmar also planned to build a fort there. But when St. Clair presented his plan to Washington at New York in August 1790, the President decided that a fort would be too vulnerable and too expensive.<ref>Schecter, 232</ref>\n\nAt this time, [[United Kingdom|British forces]] still occupied [[Fort Detroit]], in violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. St. Clair wrote to the British at [[Fort Detroit]] to assure them that the expedition was against only Indian tribes, and expressed his confidence that the British would not interfere.<ref>Barnhart, pp 284-285, fn.21</ref><ref>Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\" Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there. Following Harmar's defeat, Knox changed his mind. He instructed St. Clair to occupy and fortify Kekionga the following year.  Poinsatte, 21-23</ref>\n\nGeneral Harmar gathered 320 [[Regular Army (United States)|regulars]] of the [[First American Regiment]] (organized into two battalions commanded by Major [[John Doughty]] and Major [[John Wyllys]]) and 1,133 [[militia]] from Kentucky and [[Pennsylvania]], for a total of 1,453 men.<ref>Barnhart, pg 283</ref> The force also had a battery of three horse-drawn 6-pounder [[cannon]]s.  Few experienced frontiersmen took part in the campaign; many instead paid recent immigrants to take their place.  Lt. [[Ebenezer Denny]] wrote that the militia \"appear to be raw and unused to the gun or the woods.\"<ref>Winkler, 25</ref> The troops were assembled in September, and the campaign had to be completed before winter set in. The pack horses which carried the troops' supplies were fed by grazing, and would starve on the frontier in winter. The Army had no time to train the militia.<ref>Barnhart, 283</ref> The campaign was launched from Fort Washington on 7 October 1790, when General Harmar began the march north along the [[Great Miami River]]. \n\nA smaller force led by Major [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Hamtramck]] marched north from Vincennes at the same time.  Hamtramck commanded 330 soldiers of the First American Regiment and militia from Virginia.{{sfn|Stewart|2009|p=118}}  He was to distract the Wabash Indians from the main force and then join Harmar for the main attack.{{sfn|Stewart|2009|p=118}}  Hamtramck's force burned a few villages over 11 days, but was delayed when the militia refused to continue.  Hamtramck returned to Vincennes instead of joining Harmar,<ref name=Schecter233>Schecter, 233</ref> who, by 14 October, had marched to within {{convert|25|mi|km}} of Kekionga. On that day, Kentucky scouts captured a Shawnee. After some intense interrogation, the Indian said that the Miami and Shawnee were gathering at Kekionga to meet Harmar's army. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBefore dawn on 15 October, Harmar dispatched 600 men under Colonel [[John Hardin]] on a forced march to \"surprise\" the Indians at Kekionga. When Colonel Hardin's detachment reached Kekionga, they found the village abandoned. They burned it together with any stores they found, and camped south of the destroyed town.\n\nHarmar reached other Miami villages near Kekionga on 17 October. The Miami had warning of the attack, and had evacuated their villages with as much food as they could carry. Some British-affiliated traders had been living among the Miami; they fled to Fort Detroit with their families and goods. They had distributed all available arms and ammunition to Miami warriors. The Miami were well informed of the size and movements of Harmar's force, and had learned of Harmar's inclination toward drunkenness.<ref name=\"P22\">Poinsatte, 22</ref> The Americans seized the food left behind by the Miami.\n\n==Battle of Heller's Corner==<!--redirect from [[Hardin's defeat]] -->\n\nOn 19 October, south of modern [[Churubusco, Indiana]], Harmar sent out a scouting party under Colonel Hardin, consisting of 180 militia, a troop of cavalry under Major [[James Fontaine]], and 30 regulars under Captain [[John Armstrong (frontiersman)|John Armstrong]].<ref>Winkler, 15</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=47459 |title=Site of Hardin's Defeat |publisher=The Historical Marker Database |editor=Pfingsten, Bill |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> It was to estimate the strength of the Indians and attack the village of Chief [[Le Gris]].<ref>Carter, 94</ref>  The party came within a few miles of Kekionga, where they encountered an Indian on horseback, who fled along a minor trail leading away from the village. Hardin ordered his force to pursue, but sent Major Fontaine's cavalry back to bring up a company that had been left behind. The Indian was a decoy, and led Hardin into a swampy lowland by the [[Eel River (Wabash River)|Eel River]] [https://goo.gl/maps/DVKcmmkUEdK2 13 miles northwest of Kekionga], where he could neither pursue nor easily retreat.\n\nIndians led by [[Little Turtle]] attacked Hardin's force from three sides. Most of the militia fled, warning Major Fontaine's cavalry to get out.\n\nThe regulars stood their ground with some of the militia.

He sent a detachment of 300 men under Ensign Phillip Hartshorn northward to scout for Indian movements. [https://goo.gl/maps/vXD1AajhhTN2 Eight miles north of Kekionga], Hartshorn was ambushed by a large Indian force, which killed him and 19 of his men. Instead of advancing immediately to attack the Indians, Harmar pulled back several miles south of Kekionga. He did not arrange for a burial detail to bury the twenty dead. Morale had plummeted, and the men were enraged at the cowardice of their commander. Hardin demanded that he be allowed to attack the Indians with 400 men, or at the very least, bury their fallen comrades.\n\n== Battle of the Pumpkin Fields ==\n[[File:Little Turtle.jpg|thumb |right |[[Little Turtle]] ]]\n\nOn the night of 21 October, Colonel Hardin advanced with 300 militia and 60 regulars of the [[First American Regiment]], under Major John P. Wyllys. At dawn on 22 October, they found about 1,000 Indians encamped at Kekionga. Hardin immediately sent to Harmar requesting reinforcements. When the courier told Harmar (who was rumored to have been drunk) about the size of the enemy force, he became visibly shaken. He ordered his 800-900 remaining men into a hollow defensive square and refused to come to Hardin's aid, leaving him alone to face an enemy more than twice his number. Colonel Hardin, expecting reinforcements at any time, divided his command into four groups under Major Wyllys, Major Hall, Major Fontaine, and Major McMullen. He planned to flank the Indians on all sides.<ref>Allison, 74</ref>\n\nThe Indians at Kekionga, who were led by Little Turtle, attacked first, however. Little Turtle sent small parties to fire on the militia and retreat. The militia gave chase in many instances, until the regulars were left isolated. Little Turtle then attacked Major Wyllys's detachment, with results as devastating as at Heller's Corner on 19 October.<ref>Allison, 75</ref> Major Fontaine, meanwhile, led a cavalry charge into a wooded area and was ambushed. Soon the Shawnee and Miami attacked Hardin from three sides. Still expecting reinforcements from Harmar, Hardin's men put up a valiant defense, holding the Indians at bay for over three hours before finally falling back to join the rest of the army.<ref>[http://kynghistory.ky.gov/history/1qtr/revolutionary.htm Map of \"Harmar's Defeat\"], Kentucky History {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110200019/http://kynghistory.ky.gov/history/1qtr/revolutionary.htm |date=10 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThis battle, sometimes known as Harmar's defeat by the Americans, was called the Battle of the Pumpkin Fields by the Indians, because the steam from the scalped skulls reminded the Indians of squash steaming in the autumn air. 180 American men were either killed or wounded.<ref name=\"Barnhart, 284\"/>  The army forces reported 129 men killed in action (14 officers, including Major Wyllys and Major Fontaine, and 115 enlisted men) and 94 wounded (including 50 of the Regulars). Estimates of Indian casualties range from 120 to 150 total.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter such high casualties from these engagements, General Harmar determined that he could not attack. The approaching winter further threatened his command, as militia deserted and horses starved. The retreating force reached Fort Washington on 3 November 1790.<ref name=\"Barnhart, 284\"/>\n\nIt was the worst defeat of U.S. forces by Indians up to that time.

The campaign consisted of a series of battles that were all overwhelming victories for the Native Americans, and the collective losses are sometimes referred to as Harmar's defeat.\n\n==Prelude to battle==\nFrom 1784 to 1789, there was considerable violence between encroaching American settlers and the [[Shawnee]] and [[Miami tribe|Miami]] Indians in [[Kentucky]], along the [[Ohio River]], and at the few American settlements north of the Ohio, with some 1,500 settlers killed by the Indians. However, there was no general war. Before the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British had tried to [[Proclamation Line|preserve this area as a Native American reserve]] but it was forced to cede what became known as the Northwest Territory when [[American Revolution|the United States gained independence]]. American settlers were eager to enter these lands and started to do so.\n\nIn 1789, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] wrote to [[Arthur St. Clair]], Governor of the Northwest Territory (an entity not recognized by its Native inhabitants), and asked him to determine whether the Indians living along the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Illinois River]]s were \"inclined for war or peace\" with the United States.  St. Clair decided the tribes \"wanted war\", and called for militia forces to be assembled at [[Fort Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio|Fort Washington]] (now [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]) and [[Vincennes, Indiana]].  President Washington and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]] ordered General [[Josiah Harmar]] to lead these forces on a \"punitive expedition\" into the Shawnee and Miami lands as retaliation for the killings of American settlers and travellers on the contested frontier, and to deter the tribes from further attacks.\n\nThe primary objective of the campaign was the destruction of the large, main Miami village of [[Kekionga]] (present-day [[Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]), where the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph]] and [[St. Marys River (Indiana and Ohio)|St. Mary's]] rivers join to form the [[Maumee River]]. St. Clair and Harmar also planned to build a fort there. But when St. Clair presented his plan to Washington at New York in August 1790, the President decided that a fort would be too vulnerable and too expensive.<ref>Schecter, 232</ref>\n\nAt this time, [[United Kingdom|British forces]] still occupied [[Fort Detroit]], in violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. St. Clair wrote to the British at [[Fort Detroit]] to assure them that the expedition was against only Indian tribes, and expressed his confidence that the British would not interfere.<ref>Barnhart, pp 284-285, fn.21</ref><ref>Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\" Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there. Following Harmar's defeat, Knox changed his mind. He instructed St. Clair to occupy and fortify Kekionga the following year.  Poinsatte, 21-23</ref>\n\nGeneral Harmar gathered 320 [[Regular Army (United States)|regulars]] of the [[First American Regiment]] (organized into two battalions commanded by Major [[John Doughty]] and Major [[John Wyllys]]) and 1,133 [[militia]] from Kentucky and [[Pennsylvania]], for a total of 1,453 men.<ref>Barnhart, pg 283</ref> The force also had a battery of three horse-drawn 6-pounder [[cannon]]s.  Few experienced frontiersmen took part in the campaign; many instead paid recent immigrants to take their place.  Lt. [[Ebenezer Denny]] wrote that the militia \"appear to be raw and unused to the gun or the woods.\"<ref>Winkler, 25</ref> The troops were assembled in September, and the campaign had to be completed before winter set in. The pack horses which carried the troops' supplies were fed by grazing, and would starve on the frontier in winter. The Army had no time to train the militia.<ref>Barnhart, 283</ref> The campaign was launched from Fort Washington on 7 October 1790, when General Harmar began the march north along the [[Great Miami River]]. \n\nA smaller force led by Major [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Hamtramck]] marched north from Vincennes at the same time.  Hamtramck commanded 330 soldiers of the First American Regiment and militia from Virginia.{{sfn|Stewart|2009|p=118}}  He was to distract the Wabash Indians from the main force and then join Harmar for the main attack.{{sfn|Stewart|2009|p=118}}  Hamtramck's force burned a few villages over 11 days, but was delayed when the militia refused to continue.  Hamtramck returned to Vincennes instead of joining Harmar,<ref name=Schecter233>Schecter, 233</ref> who, by 14 October, had marched to within {{convert|25|mi|km}} of Kekionga. On that day, Kentucky scouts captured a Shawnee. After some intense interrogation, the Indian said that the Miami and Shawnee were gathering at Kekionga to meet Harmar's army.\n\nBefore dawn on 15 October, Harmar dispatched 600 men under Colonel [[John Hardin]] on a forced march to \"surprise\" the Indians at Kekionga. When Colonel Hardin's detachment reached Kekionga, they found the village abandoned. They burned it together with any stores they found, and camped south of the destroyed town.\n\nHarmar reached other Miami villages near Kekionga on 17 October. The Miami had warning of the attack, and had evacuated their villages with as much food as they could carry. Some British-affiliated traders had been living among the Miami; they fled to Fort Detroit with their families and goods. They had distributed all available arms and ammunition to Miami warriors. The Miami were well informed of the size and movements of Harmar's force, and had learned of Harmar's inclination toward drunkenness.<ref name=\"P22\">Poinsatte, 22</ref> The Americans seized the food left behind by the Miami.\n\n==Battle of Heller's Corner==<!--redirect from [[Hardin's defeat]] -->\n\nOn 19 October, south of modern [[Churubusco, Indiana]], Harmar sent out a scouting party under Colonel Hardin, consisting of 180 militia, a troop of cavalry under Major [[James Fontaine]], and 30 regulars under Captain [[John Armstrong (frontiersman)|John Armstrong]].<ref>Winkler, 15</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=47459 |title=Site of Hardin's Defeat |publisher=The Historical Marker Database |editor=Pfingsten, Bill |date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> It was to estimate the strength of the Indians and attack the village of Chief [[Le Gris]].<ref>Carter, 94</ref>  The party came within a few miles of Kekionga, where they encountered an Indian on horseback, who fled along a minor trail leading away from the village. Hardin ordered his force to pursue, but sent Major Fontaine's cavalry back to bring up a company that had been left behind. The Indian was a decoy, and led Hardin into a swampy lowland by the [[Eel River (Wabash River)|Eel River]] [https://goo.gl/maps/DVKcmmkUEdK2 13 miles northwest of Kekionga], where he could neither pursue nor easily retreat.\n\nIndians led by [[Little Turtle]] attacked Hardin's force from three sides. Most of the militia fled, warning Major Fontaine's cavalry to get out.\n\nThe regulars stood their ground with some of the militia. Only 8 of the 30 regulars survived. 40 militia were killed,<ref name=\"Barnhart, 284\">Barnhart, 284</ref> and 12 Americans were wounded.<ref>Allison, 73</ref>  Captain Armstrong hid in the marsh and escaped with his life. He blamed Hardin and the militia for the defeat, and claimed that only about 100 Indians had been involved. This was the approximate number of warriors available from Kekionga and Le Gris' village.<ref>Carter, 92-93</ref>  The battle is sometimes referred to as Hardin's defeat.<ref name=\"P22\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/history/markers/37.htm|title=IHB: Site of Hardin's Defeat|website=www.in.gov|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref>\n\n== Hartshorn's defeat ==\nOn 20 October, General Harmar arrived at the camp outside Kekionga. He sent a detachment of 300 men under Ensign Phillip Hartshorn northward to scout for Indian movements. [https://goo.gl/maps/vXD1AajhhTN2 Eight miles north of Kekionga], Hartshorn was ambushed by a large Indian force, which killed him and 19 of his men. Instead of advancing immediately to attack the Indians, Harmar pulled back several miles south of Kekionga. He did not arrange for a burial detail to bury the twenty dead. Morale had plummeted, and the men were enraged at the cowardice of their commander. Hardin demanded that he be allowed to attack the Indians with 400 men, or at the very least, bury their fallen comrades.\n\n== Battle of the Pumpkin Fields ==\n[[File:Little Turtle.jpg|thumb |right |[[Little Turtle]] ]]\n\nOn the night of 21 October, Colonel Hardin advanced with 300 militia and 60 regulars of the [[First American Regiment]], under Major John P. Wyllys. At dawn on 22 October, they found about 1,000 Indians encamped at Kekionga. Hardin immediately sent to Harmar requesting reinforcements. When the courier told Harmar (who was rumored to have been drunk) about the size of the enemy force, he became visibly shaken. He ordered his 800-900 remaining men into a hollow defensive square and refused to come to Hardin's aid, leaving him alone to face an enemy more than twice his number. Colonel Hardin, expecting reinforcements at any time, divided his command into four groups under Major Wyllys, Major Hall, Major Fontaine, and Major McMullen. He planned to flank the Indians on all sides.<ref>Allison, 74</ref>\n\nThe Indians at Kekionga, who were led by Little Turtle, attacked first, however. Little Turtle sent small parties to fire on the militia and retreat. The militia gave chase in many instances, until the regulars were left isolated. Little Turtle then attacked Major Wyllys's detachment, with results as devastating as at Heller's Corner on 19 October.<ref>Allison, 75</ref> Major Fontaine, meanwhile, led a cavalry charge into a wooded area and was ambushed. Soon the Shawnee and Miami attacked Hardin from three sides. Still expecting reinforcements from Harmar, Hardin's men put up a valiant defense, holding the Indians at bay for over three hours before finally falling back to join the rest of the army.<ref>[http://kynghistory.ky.gov/history/1qtr/revolutionary.htm Map of \"Harmar's Defeat\"], Kentucky History {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110200019/http://kynghistory.ky.gov/history/1qtr/revolutionary.htm |date=10 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThis battle, sometimes known as Harmar's defeat by the Americans, was called the Battle of the Pumpkin Fields by the Indians, because the steam from the scalped skulls reminded the Indians of squash steaming in the autumn air. 180 American men were either killed or wounded.<ref name=\"Barnhart, 284\"/>  The army forces reported 129 men killed in action (14 officers, including Major Wyllys and Major Fontaine, and 115 enlisted men) and 94 wounded (including 50 of the Regulars). Estimates of Indian casualties range from 120 to 150 total.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter such high casualties from these engagements, General Harmar determined that he could not attack. The approaching winter further threatened his command, as militia deserted and horses starved. The retreating force reached Fort Washington on 3 November 1790.<ref name=\"Barnhart, 284\"/>\n\nIt was the worst defeat of U.S. forces by Indians up to that time. It was later surpassed only by [[St. Clair's Defeat]] in this war, and the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]] in the late 19th century in the West.<ref>Allison, 76</ref>  Little Turtle became established as an Indian hero, and the Indians in the Northwest Territory took heart to continue to resist the United States.<ref name=ftba>{{cite journal |last=Fleming |first=Thomas |date=August 2009 |title=Fallen Timbers, Broken Alliance |journal=Military History |volume=26 |pages=36\u201343 |location=History Reference Center, EBSCOhost |issue=3}}</ref> Indians attacked settlements all across the Northwest Territory, including the January 1791 [[Big Bottom massacre]] and [[Siege of Dunlap's Station]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Winkler |first=John F |title=Wabash 1791.
