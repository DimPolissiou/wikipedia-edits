Alongside these are modern flats developments such as The Reef, The Point and Honeycombe Beach.\n\n==Geography and administration==\nThe area upon which Boscombe is situated, between the somewhat older village of [[Pokesdown]] and [[Bournemouth Square]], was part of the great heathland which covered much of western Hampshire, and extended well into eastern Dorset. From [[Normans|Norman]] times it was within the [[Liberty of Westover]]. From the beach and cliffs the whole of [[Poole Bay]] stretching from [[Hengistbury Head]] in the east to [[Poole Harbour]] entrance in the west, and on to [[Studland]] and [[Swanage]] bays to the south can be seen.\n\nBoscombe was originally an independent settlement, separated from Bournemouth by dense wood and moorland, it was incorporated into the boundaries of [[Bournemouth (borough)|Bournemouth]] in 1876 (against the wishes of Boscombe residents).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.localhistories.org/bournemouth.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A History of Bournemouth |publisher=www.localhistories.org |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1273 a reference is made to \"Boscumbe\" suggesting that the name may well have derived from the Old English words meaning a 'valley overgrown with spiky plants' perhaps a reference to [[gorse]].<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Mills |first=AD |year=1986 |title=Dorset Place-Names: their Origins and Meaning |place= |publisher=Roy Gasson Associates |isbn=0-948495-04-9 |page=}}{{page needed|date=September 2015}}</ref>\n\nReference to Boscombe is included in [[Christopher Saxton]]'s 1574 survey made of possible enemy landing places on the coast of Hampshire; this mentions...{{quote|\"Bournemouth within the west baye at Christchurch...We finde more a place called Bastowe within the said Baye\".

This property became the nucleus of the Boscombe Manor Estate.\n\nThe large estate owned by Mr Norris changed hands several times during the first half of the 19th century. After Norris's death it was acquired by Robert Heathcote, and on his death the estate was put up for auction The estate was purchased by James Dover, in whose possession it remained until 1841; then it was sold to Major Stephenson.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nStevenson sold the estate in 1849 to [[Percy Florence Shelley|Sir Percy Florence Shelley]] who bought the Boscombe property mainly with the intention of it becoming a home for his mother [[Mary Shelley]], but she died in London on 1 February 1851. Sir Percy and his wife liked the place, and decided to make it their home, dividing their time between Boscombe and their London house at Chelsea.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nThe house at Boscombe was extensively rebuilt for Sir Percy, and extended to include a 200-seat (later 300 seats) theatre, to the designs of [[Christopher Crabb Creeke]], who later became surveyor to the Bournemouth Improvement Commissioners and was responsible for both the layout of much of central Bournemouth's roads, and for several local buildings. \n\nIt may be noted that the name of Boscombe Manor changed several times over the years. First recorded as Boscombe Cottage, it was then for a time called Boscombe Alcove and then Boscombe Lodge. By Shelley's time it was Boscombe House, and he and his family later renamed it Boscombe Manor. In the present century it was Groveley Manor for many years, taking the name of the school which then occupied it, but now it is known as Shelley Park, most of the building being taken up by the Shelley Manor Medical Centre in Beechwood Avenue.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nTo supplement the existing plantations of pine trees on the estate, Sir Percy added a large number of deciduous trees. There was a drive to the house from the main Christchurch Road, which followed the line of the present Chessel Avenue, and there was a lodge at its entrance. A second entry was from Sea Road, along a roadway flanked with lime trees \u2013 the present Percy Road.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1860s Boscombe consisted of the Shelley estate and some cottages, one of which is known to have stood at the top of Boscombe Hill, near the present Drummond Road.\n\nFrom 1865 the development and expansion of the area to the end of the 19th century, and beyond, was very rapid. Starting with a proposal by the Malmesbury Estate to develop the 'picturesque Village of Boscombe Spa' to make available building plots for the erection of marine villas to be let on long leases.\n\nThe Spa was related to a natural spring of mineral water containing properties similar to Harrogate which had been discovered near the foot of the hill; this would be available for invalids and could combine the advantages of a Spa with those of sea air and bathing.<ref name=\"ntlworld1\">{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/msboscombe/History/spa.htm |title=Boscombe Bournemouth History |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=11 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025075604/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/msboscombe/History/spa.htm# |archive-date=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe scheme was not implemented; instead about {{convert|19|acre|m2}} of land was obtained by [[Henry Drummond Wolff|Sir Henry Drummond Wolff]], on part of which he built a house for himself named Boscombe Towers, in 1868, Sir Henry became closely associated with the development of Boscombe Spa for a considerable number of years. Wolff sought to develop 'Boscombe Spa' as a resort to rival Bournemouth and it was he who created the Boscombe Chine Gardens. In order to encourage the taking of the mineral water from the spring at the mouth of the Chine, a small thatched-roof building resembling a summer house was erected over the spring, and for a time this became a fashionable meeting place. The Chine itself was partially laid out and a broad pathway provided. A rustic bridge was constructed across the Chine.<ref name=\"ntlworld1\"/>\n\nThe census of 1871 showed that there was a population of 212 people in 19 houses in the Boscombe Estate, and a further 70 people in 9 houses at Boscombe Spa. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/msboscombe/History/village.htm |title=Boscombe Bournemouth History |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=11 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203195309/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/msboscombe/History/village.htm# |archive-date=3 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nDuring the 1870s development of Boscombe was such that the population at the census of 1881 had grown to 1,895 \u2013 a more than sixfold increase.\n\n===Expansion===\nIn 1875 a 160,000 gallon water tower was built in Palmerston Road, at this time it was stated that there were 244 houses in Boscombe.

With this increase in less affluent, vulnerable people came an increase in transience in the population, a more 'chaotic' environment in Boscombe and the beginnings of a drug using community in the area. This was coupled with an influx of Liverpudlian drug users and dealers to Bournemouth in the 1970s. Bournemouth was becoming an importer of people with drug and alcohol problems, and the drugs market expanded around these circumstances. By the 1980s this was being further stimulated by the setting up and proliferation of treatment centres for drug misuse.\" |Quoted from: [http://archive.bournemouth.gov.uk/Library/PDF/Living/Planning/E_base/Boscombe%20Profile1.pdf Vulnerable Area Profile Boscombe]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vulnerable Area Profile Boscombe Date of Profile January 2006 Period Covered 2005 Area Covered Boscombe 1 |journal=Safer Neighbourhoods Profile \u2013 Boscombe |date=January 2006 |url=http://archive.bournemouth.gov.uk/Library/PDF/Living/Planning/E_base/Boscombe%20Profile1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012213032/http://archive.bournemouth.gov.uk/Library/PDF/Living/Planning/E_base/Boscombe%20Profile1.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> }}\n\nBoscombe saw an increase in social problems during this period with drug and alcohol dependency levels well above the national average.

The southern end of the chine was laid out as pleasure gardens with a surface water stream as a picturesque feature. Towards the foot of the Chine, near to Sea Road, a [[chalybeate]] spring was discovered, no doubt fed by the water draining into the chine. A small thatched hut was erected over the spring and was given the name Boscombe Spa. The water was sufficiently foul-tasting that people would make a special trip to drink the water for any health-giving properties that it may contain.\n\n==Boscombe Pier==\n[[File:Boscombe pier - geograph.org.uk - 380849.jpg|thumb|Boscombe Pier in 2003]]\n[[File:Boscombe Pier (4542944815).jpg|thumb|The pier in 2010, after restoration]]\n[[File:Musical_Walkway_on_Boscombe_Pier.png|thumb|Musical walkway installed in 2014]]\nA pier was proposed in 1884 as a visitor attraction. In September 1888 the contract for its building was awarded for \u00a33,813, and for making the pier approach \u00a3938. The pier was {{convert|200|yd|m}} long, and built in spans of {{convert|13|yd|m}} each with a continuous wrought iron girder frame, which carried timber decking {{convert|11|yd|m}} wide. The pier head was {{convert|40|yd|m}} long and {{convert|13|yd|m}} wide, with a landing stage on each side, at which excursion steamers could call. At the entrance were two toll houses with turnstiles. The architect for the pier construction was James Stuart Campbell McEwan-Brown (1870\u20131949). His family were originally from [[Kintyre]], [[Argyll]] and were closely connected to the [[Duke of Argyll]]. It is no surprise therefore, that it was opened with considerable ceremony on 29 July 1889 by the [[George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]].\n\nThe pier head was not added until 1926, and like most piers it was partially demolished during [[World War II]] to combat the threat of invasion. The pier remained derelict for a number of years and was only fully reopened in 1962.

Alongside these are modern flats developments such as The Reef, The Point and Honeycombe Beach.\n\n==Geography and administration==\nThe area upon which Boscombe is situated, between the somewhat older village of [[Pokesdown]] and [[Bournemouth Square]], was part of the great heathland which covered much of western Hampshire, and extended well into eastern Dorset.

This property became the nucleus of the Boscombe Manor Estate.\n\nThe large estate owned by Mr Norris changed hands several times during the first half of the 19th century. After Norris's death it was acquired by Robert Heathcote, and on his death the estate was put up for auction The estate was purchased by James Dover, in whose possession it remained until 1841; then it was sold to Major Stephenson.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nStevenson sold the estate in 1849 to [[Percy Florence Shelley|Sir Percy Florence Shelley]] who bought the Boscombe property mainly with the intention of it becoming a home for his mother [[Mary Shelley]], but she died in London on 1 February 1851. Sir Percy and his wife liked the place, and decided to make it their home, dividing their time between Boscombe and their London house at Chelsea.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nThe house at Boscombe was extensively rebuilt for Sir Percy, and extended to include a 200-seat (later 300 seats) theatre, to the designs of [[Christopher Crabb Creeke]], who later became surveyor to the Bournemouth Improvement Commissioners and was responsible for both the layout of much of central Bournemouth's roads, and for several local buildings. \n\nIt may be noted that the name of Boscombe Manor changed several times over the years. First recorded as Boscombe Cottage, it was then for a time called Boscombe Alcove and then Boscombe Lodge. By Shelley's time it was Boscombe House, and he and his family later renamed it Boscombe Manor. In the present century it was Groveley Manor for many years, taking the name of the school which then occupied it, but now it is known as Shelley Park, most of the building being taken up by the Shelley Manor Medical Centre in Beechwood Avenue.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nTo supplement the existing plantations of pine trees on the estate, Sir Percy added a large number of deciduous trees. There was a drive to the house from the main Christchurch Road, which followed the line of the present Chessel Avenue, and there was a lodge at its entrance. A second entry was from Sea Road, along a roadway flanked with lime trees \u2013 the present Percy Road.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1860s Boscombe consisted of the Shelley estate and some cottages, one of which is known to have stood at the top of Boscombe Hill, near the present Drummond Road.\n\nFrom 1865 the development and expansion of the area to the end of the 19th century, and beyond, was very rapid. Starting with a proposal by the Malmesbury Estate to develop the 'picturesque Village of Boscombe Spa' to make available building plots for the erection of marine villas to be let on long leases.\n\nThe Spa was related to a natural spring of mineral water containing properties similar to Harrogate which had been discovered near the foot of the hill; this would be available for invalids and could combine the advantages of a Spa with those of sea air and bathing.<ref name=\"ntlworld1\">{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/msboscombe/History/spa.htm |title=Boscombe Bournemouth History |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=11 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025075604/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/msboscombe/History/spa.htm# |archive-date=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe scheme was not implemented; instead about {{convert|19|acre|m2}} of land was obtained by [[Henry Drummond Wolff|Sir Henry Drummond Wolff]], on part of which he built a house for himself named Boscombe Towers, in 1868, Sir Henry became closely associated with the development of Boscombe Spa for a considerable number of years. Wolff sought to develop 'Boscombe Spa' as a resort to rival Bournemouth and it was he who created the Boscombe Chine Gardens. In order to encourage the taking of the mineral water from the spring at the mouth of the Chine, a small thatched-roof building resembling a summer house was erected over the spring, and for a time this became a fashionable meeting place.

Reports on the reef's performance showed that it was failing to meet its performance criteria.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/8255368.Why_is_the_Boscombe_surf_reef_failing__part_two___/ |last=Vass |first=Melanie |title=Why is the Boscombe surf reef failing, part two... |newspaper=[[Bournemouth Daily Echo]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> In 2011, the reef was closed for safety reasons; in 2012 the contractor went out of business and in 2014 the reef was re-branded as a Coastal Activity Park. Funding for the development had been through the sale of the local seafront car park, to Barratt Homes for 169 seafront apartments, at Honeycombe [[Chine]]. As well as these flats there have been a number of other large developments of flats such as \"The Reef\" in Boscombe Spa Road and the renovation of Shelley Park into a medical centre and flats development.\n\nIn May 2007, for the first time, a property in Boscombe sold for \u00a31 million.

The school opened in 1879.

The senior section of the school moved in 1940 to the newly built Boscombe Bilateral Secondary Modern(now King\u2019s Park Primary) on Ashley Road. In 1960,a local teacher Leslie Williams formed the 'Bournemouth Children's Theatre' in the old school buildings and it became the Drama Centre.

Several of these originated in Springbourne, but they all eventually confluenced near to Christchurch Road. The southern end of the chine was laid out as pleasure gardens with a surface water stream as a picturesque feature. Towards the foot of the Chine, near to Sea Road, a [[chalybeate]] spring was discovered, no doubt fed by the water draining into the chine. A small thatched hut was erected over the spring and was given the name Boscombe Spa. The water was sufficiently foul-tasting that people would make a special trip to drink the water for any health-giving properties that it may contain.\n\n==Boscombe Pier==\n[[File:Boscombe pier - geograph.org.uk - 380849.jpg|thumb|Boscombe Pier in 2003]]\n[[File:Boscombe Pier (4542944815).jpg|thumb|The pier in 2010, after restoration]]\n[[File:Musical_Walkway_on_Boscombe_Pier.png|thumb|Musical walkway installed in 2014]]\nA pier was proposed in 1884 as a visitor attraction. In September 1888 the contract for its building was awarded for \u00a33,813, and for making the pier approach \u00a3938. The pier was {{convert|200|yd|m}} long, and built in spans of {{convert|13|yd|m}} each with a continuous wrought iron girder frame, which carried timber decking {{convert|11|yd|m}} wide. The pier head was {{convert|40|yd|m}} long and {{convert|13|yd|m}} wide, with a landing stage on each side, at which excursion steamers could call. At the entrance were two toll houses with turnstiles. The architect for the pier construction was James Stuart Campbell McEwan-Brown (1870\u20131949). His family were originally from [[Kintyre]], [[Argyll]] and were closely connected to the [[Duke of Argyll]]. It is no surprise therefore, that it was opened with considerable ceremony on 29 July 1889 by the [[George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]].\n\nThe pier head was not added until 1926, and like most piers it was partially demolished during [[World War II]] to combat the threat of invasion. The pier remained derelict for a number of years and was only fully reopened in 1962. The borough architect, John Burton, designed the modernist 1950s style entrance building.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nothingtoseehere.net/2009/06/boscombe_pier_dorset.html |title=Boscombe Pier, Bournemouth |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> This building was [[Grade II listed]] in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |title=Listing decision hits pier revamp |date=9 December 2004 |publisher=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/4082171.stm |work=BBC news |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> The heritage minister said: {{Quote|\"The Neck Building at Boscombe Pier is a rarity amongst municipal entertainment structures of the period.

It closed in 1989 and the pier became progressively more derelict over the next 19 years.\n\nOn 30 October 2005 the pier was closed as it was deemed unsafe. The Grade II listed pier entrance building was externally restored in 2007 together with a restoration of the pier neck. New decking, lighting and central windbreak screen was added together with a new viewing and fishing platform end section, replacing the derelict Mermaid Amusement Hall. The pier re-opened in May 2008.

Although variants of roadshow releases occasionally still exist, the practice mostly ended in the early 1970s.\n\nAs far as is known, virtually all of the films given roadshow releases were subsequently distributed to regular movie theaters. This was called a general release, and was akin to the modern-day [[wide release]] of a film. However, there are five important differences between a roadshow presentation of a film and today's [[limited release]]s:\n\n* Roadshow theatrical releases almost always placed a ten to fifteen-minute [[intermission]] between the two \"acts\" of the film, and the first act was frequently longer than the second.\n* Films shown as roadshow releases, especially those made between 1952 and 1974, were nearly always longer than the usual motion picture, lasting anywhere from slightly more than two hours to four hours or more, counting the intermission. Examples include ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), or ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963). There were no [[short subject]]s accompanying the film, and rarely any [[trailer (promotion)|movie trailer]]s.\n* Roadshow presentations were always shown on a one or two-performance a day, reserved seat basis, and admission prices were always higher than those of regular screenings. Unlike today's limited releases, seats ''had'' to be reserved; one could not simply buy a ticket at the box office and go in to watch the film. The two-performance-a-day screenings were usually limited to Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the rest of the week, the films would be shown only once a day. (However, in the case of ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'', there were three showings a day of the film on weekends, rather than two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/1999/59/rivoli/index.htm|title=The Rivoli Theatre|publisher=}}</ref>)\n* [[Programme (booklet)|Souvenir program]]s were often available at roadshow presentations of films, much as souvenir programs are made available when one goes to see the stage version of a play or musical. These movie souvenir programs contained photos from the film, photos and biographies of its cast and principal crew, and information on how the film was made, rather like today's \"extras\" on [[DVD]]s.\n* In the days of frequent roadshow releases, production companies and film distributors never used them to determine whether or not a film should be given a wide release, as is done today occasionally when films perform poorly at the box office. From the 1920s to the mid-1970s, a roadshow release would ''always'' play widely after its original engagements. This was true even of box office flops.\n\n==U.S. releases==\nThe roadshow format had been used since the days of [[silent film|silent]] films, but the rise of widescreen and stereophonic sound in the 1950s made it especially attractive to studio executives, who hoped to lure audiences away from television by presenting films in a way that an audience at that time could never hope to see at home. Possibly, the first film ever shown in a roadshow engagement was the French film ''[[Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth|Les Amours de la reine Elisabeth]]'' in America in 1912, a 53-minute motion picture which starred the legendary stage actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]].\n\nFilms shown in a roadshow format before 1951 included:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915)\n*''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916)\n*''[[The Covered Wagon]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n*''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925)\n*''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925)\n*''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927) , the first [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Academy Award]] winner\n*''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927) , the first feature length part-talkie \n*''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), the silent film based on the play that inspired the [[Kander and Ebb]] Broadway musical and Oscar-winning film\n*''[[The Broadway Melody]]''(1929)\n*''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1929), a [[part-talkie]] based not on the 1927 stage musical but on Edna Ferber's original novel from which the musical was adapted\n*''[[Hollywood Revue of 1929|Hollywood Revue]]'' (1929)\n*''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Paris (1929 film)|Paris]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Howard Hughes]]''<nowiki/>' [[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930)\n*''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), winner of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]\n*''[[Cavalcade (1933 film)|Cavalcade]]'' (1933)\n*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755216-2,00.html|title=Cinema: The New Pictures: Oct. 21, 1935|date=October 21, 1935|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n*''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936)\n*''[[In Old Chicago]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939)\n*''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940)\n*''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943)\n*''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n*''[[This Is the Army]]'' (1943) (shown only in roadshow format on initial release)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35613/warner-bros-and-the-homefront-collection/|title=Warner Bros. and the Homefront Collection|website=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n*''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944)\n*''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946)\n*''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946) \n*''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947)\n*[[Ingrid Bergman]]''<nowiki/>'''s ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]''  (1948)\n*''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949)\n*''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951).

The overture should not be confused with the main title music. The overture, recorded on film without a picture (and years later, on tape), was always played before the beginning of the film, while the lights were still up and the curtains were still closed.  As the lights dimmed, the overture ended, the curtains opened, and the film began with its main title music and opening credits. Likewise, the exit music should not be confused with the end title music. The exit music, also recorded without a picture on film, was always played ''after'' the end of the film, while the lights were up and the curtains were closed. As the lights came on, the end title music ended, the curtains closed, and the exit music began. Most movie theaters until the 1980s had curtains which covered the screen, and which would open when the show actually began and close when it ended.\n\n==Examples==\nAn early example of this was ''Gone with the Wind'' (1939). Running almost four hours in length, the film was divided into the above components, so that the film patron can experience the film as if they were seeing an actual play in a theater.\n\nThe original theatrical release of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''Fantasia'', presented in [[Fantasound]] in selected large cities in the United States, never had an overture, entr'acte, or exit music. Still, ''Fantasia'' was first released in the roadshow format, included an intermission in its first run, and was originally presented without on-screen credits to perpetuate a concert-going experience\u2014the printed souvenir program, given out to patrons as they entered the theater, presented the film's credits.\n\nThe original New York run of the English-language film ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1950), starring [[Jose Ferrer]] and based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s 1897 French play, was likewise presented in a roadshow format (that is, one or two performances a day), although the film is only two hours long, was not produced on a large budget, and does not contain an intermission.<ref>{{cite news| last=Crowther |first=Bosley | authorlink= Bosley Crowther | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9506EFD61738E73ABC4F52DFB767838B649EDE  |title='Cyrano,' With Jose Ferrer in Title Role and Mala Powers as Roxane, Opens at the Bijou |publisher= The New York Times |date=1950-11-17 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Show Boat (1951 film)|1951 ''Show Boat'']] was also shown in a roadshow format in some theaters, despite being less than two hours long, and not having an overture, intermission, entr'acte, or exit music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr2.htm|title=Widescreen Museum - Cinerama Wing 2|publisher=}}</ref> \n\n===1950s to 1970s===\nWith the rise of television, beginning in 1952 and continuing through the early 1970s, studios tried to bring movie audiences back to theaters by making widescreen epics, again using the \"roadshow\" formula. Films shot in [[3D film|3D]] sometimes were also shown in a roadshow format with intermission, regardless of actual length, as well as many films shot in various larger [[widescreen]] processes, such as [[CinemaScope]], [[Todd-AO]], [[Ultra Panavision 70|MGM Camera 65]], and [[Super Panavision 70]] were given roadshow presentations, as well as films that were blown up to 70mm from the 35mm negative.

The film had originally been made in [[Cinemascope 55]] and through advances in technology was now able to be re-released in a process called [[70 mm Grandeur film|Grandeur 70]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcs7.htm|title=Widescreen Museum\u2014The CinemaScope Wing 7\u2014CinemaScope 55|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFilms made in three-camera [[Cinerama]] always received roadshow releases to show off the technology. The special requirements needed to show films in Cinerama\u2014a theater with a huge, ultra-curved screen, three projectors running simultaneously, and seven-track stereophonic sound\u2014made it impossible to show its films in wide release unless the picture was converted to standard one projector format (i.e. [[Panavision]]).\n\nSince most of those cut off the sides of the original combined picture, eventually, with the advent of anamorphic lenses, a number of Cinerama roadshows were able to be compressed onto normal 5-perf 70MM film and with the extra-wide screens installed, normal 70MM theaters were able to play these reformatted Cinerama titles.\n\n==Exceptions==\nThere were some notable exceptions to the standard roadshow release format, three of them Shakespeare productions. One was ''Othello'' (1965), which was essentially a filmed visual record of the already famous Laurence Olivier 1964 London stage production, shot in a movie studio, but on enlarged stage settings. The nearly three-hour color film, made in Panavision and shown in 35MM and mono sound in many areas, was shown in 70MM and six-track stereophonic sound in exactly one engagement - in London in 1966,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |title=70mm Blow Up List 1966 - by |publisher=In70mm.com |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144618/http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nBeing a film that lay somewhere between a photographed play and a true motion picture, the film did not make sufficient use of the spectacular vistas that 1960s widescreen epics usually boasted. In addition, while it had no overture, entr'acte music, or exit music, it was still shown on a two-performance-a-day basis with an intermission, as nearly all roadshow releases were. However, it was shown in U.S. cinemas for an extremely limited release: only two days,<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E0D6163AEF34BC4A53DFB466838D679EDE |title= Minstrel Show 'Othello':Radical Makeup Marks Olivier's Interpretation |publisher= The New York Times |date=1966-02-02 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> in contrast to the customary and lengthy months-long engagements enjoyed by most roadshow films.\n\nThe same was true of the Richard Burton ''Hamlet'', which was presented in the same type of extremely limited engagement as ''Othello''. Filmed over two days in a quickie black-and-white process called [[Electronovision]], which resembled a 1960s videotaped broadcast, this three hours plus production featured none of the epic features that were a standard of roadshow theatrical release - no impressive scenery, no gorgeous color, no beautiful costumes, or stereophonic sound, only an intermission halfway through the performance. It was not even, strictly speaking, a full-scale film version of the play, but merely a visual recording of a performance of it at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], with a live audience. At three hours and eleven minutes, it was the longest film version of ''Hamlet'' to that date.\n\nAnother exception was Franco Zeffirelli's hugely successful 1968 version of ''Romeo and Juliet'', which, although photographed in beautiful settings and certainly having the look of an epic, was shown in most areas in monaural sound (although its three [[soundtrack album]]s were all made in stereo) and was projected at a screen aspect ratio of 1.66:1; that is, roughly the dimensions of today's average movie screen or HDTV screen, not the very wide screens required for films made in [[Ultra Panavision 70|Ultra Panavision]], CinemaScope, Todd-AO or any of the other ultrawide processes invented in the 1950s meant that the film lacked many of the customary roadshow elements opf the period. However The Mexican release of the picture, DID feature a six-track stereo surround mix and was shown with its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio matted to a 2.2 in standard 70MM.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |title=70mm films in Mexico |publisher=In70mm.com |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144721/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the film version of [[James Goldman]]'s ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968), although a roadshow release filmed on location to qualify for the gorgeous color and beautiful scenery requirements, instead of being released in 70MM and 6-track stereo sound - even though it was shown in Technicolor, it was only from 35MM Panavision (anamorphic) film and mono sound. Only in Australia and in its 1973 London re-release was the picture shown in both 70MM and stereophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1968/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1968 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1973/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1973 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> 1971's ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', another roadshow release, was also shown in 70mm 6-track only in Europe, while its U.S. release was in regular Panavision with monophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/technical|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/combined|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|work=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above, ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1959), ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' (1961) and ''The Longest Day'' (1962) were three epics that were shown in black and white instead of [[Technicolor]]. Before then, roadshow epics alternated between getting released in black and white or color.\n\n===Edited versions and restoration===\nIt was common practice for studios to cut some of these epics for general release in order for theaters to book more showings a day and present the film at reduced \"popular prices\", especially if the film ran longer than two hours. Sometimes this was done to a successful film, such as ''South Pacific'', but more often to one that had been a notable flop, in an effort to make it a success on its second run. As a result, some of these films have not been seen in their entirety since their first release, as the original edited footage is either missing or no longer exists. With the work of [[film preservation|film preservationists and restoration]], such roadshow flops as ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1935), ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' (1947), ''Joan of Arc'' (1948), '' A Star Is Born'' (1954) and ''Fantasia'' (1940), along with the hugely successful films ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943), ''Spartacus'', ''Lawrence of Arabia'', ''Around the World in 80 Days'' and ''It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'', all of which had significant footage missing, have been restored in recent years to match the filmmakers' original intent. However, several extremely popular long films, such as ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''The Ten Commandments'', have never been released in edited form, and were nearly always shown on a two performance-a-day basis.\n\n''In Old Chicago'', despite its roadshow presentation running only 110 minutes, was edited down to 95 minutes for general release, but restored to its full length on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/16907/in-old-chicago/|title=In Old Chicago|work=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n\nFrequently, unless the film was exceptionally long, the intermission, along with the overture, ent'racte music, and exit music would be eliminated when it went into general release, in order to save twenty minutes and possibly squeeze in more showings, and the film would be shown just like any other motion picture. Often too, the souvenir programs that were a part of the roadshow release of the films were no longer given out during the wide release.\n\n===Rise of the limited release===\nThe practice of roadshow presentation began dying out in the 1970s, partly due to a string of costly box-office flops, and partly due to the rise of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]]. As multiplexes began to increase in number, and as more and more skyscraper hotels and office buildings took the place of the oldtime movie palaces, theater exhibitors began showing long films in a more informal format. [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s Oscar-winning epics ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), for instance, were made with mono sound, shown without intermissions, and were given more than two performances a day, despite their extreme length. [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) was shown more than twice a day, but included an intermission.\n\nAlthough some very long films such as ''Gone with the Wind'' would always be shown with an intermission and some films like ''[[Huckleberry Finn (1974 film)|Huckleberry Finn]]'' would be released with overtures until 1979, \"reserved seat\" showings of new films became extremely rare. The last film musical to officially receive a reserved seat engagement was ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1973), a financial and critical disaster.\n\nIn the late 1970s, only three films (two popular and one a legendary disaster) received a reserved seat engagement. Michael Cimino made the successful film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', which was a commercial and critical success, winning the Oscar for Best Picture. In its initial run, it was enlarged to 70mm film and given a roadshow release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1978/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1978 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> Francis Ford Coppola, director of ''[[The Godfather]]'', made ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', another three-hour epic which garnered some favorable reviews and is now considered one of his best. The film had a difficult production history, and after five years of production it premiered in a U.S. reserved seat engagement in 70mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1979/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1979 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> It became a great financial success, and made even more money years later when the director's cut was released. Cimino's next film in 1980 was ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which is infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs ever. It had a roadshow release and premiered in a 70mm version with an intermission. The roadshow engagement was the shortest in history, for only three theaters held the screenings. Its New York run lasted three days, the Toronto run was shown once, and the Los Angeles engagement was cancelled.\n\nOne development that diminished the novelty of the modern roadshow release was that, beginning with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), stereophonic sound began to be used more and more in films, even films that were not really big-budget spectaculars. Most films, however, were at that time still released only with mono sound. ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', for example, made a mere two years before ''Star Wars'', was originally released in this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/jaws.php|title=DVD Verdict Review - Jaws|work=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nAlthough as late as in 1982, the hugely successful ''[[Tootsie]]'' was also released with mono sound, as was the 1983 Best Picture winner ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/technical|title=Tootsie (1982)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086425/technical|title=Terms of Endearment (1983)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> By about 1984, mono sound was abandoned completely in American films, and stereo (often the six-track variety) finally became the norm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/combined|title=The Killing Fields (1984)|work=IMDb}}</ref>. However, 1982's ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' and 1983's ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' originally received 70mm releases with intermissions, due to their extreme lengths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/alternateversions|title=Gandhi (1982) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/alternateversions|title=Scarface (1983) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nBy 1984, the entire roadshow format had also largely been abandoned, as the rise of the multiplex and competition from cable TV and home video began forcing changes in the nature of film industry. For example, ''[[Carmen (1984 film)|Carmen]]'' (1984), an uncut two-and-a-half hour film version of the popular [[Georges Bizet]] opera, was not released as a roadshow nor shown with an intermission, despite the fact that the film was so faithful to the opera that it kept the stage version's original division into four acts. The 1984 ''Carmen'' was also filmed in six-track stereo and on location, like many epics. \n\nEven though the format had died out, 1993's ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', 1996's ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' and 2003's ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' were screened with intermissions due to their extreme lengths on their original releases. While all three films had no official overture, entr'acte or exit music, cinemas choose to show the films accompanied with the commercially available film soundtracks playing as the audience entered and exited theaters. ''Gettysburg'' and ''Hamlet'' were screened with two screenings a day while ''Gods and Generals'' was not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20030222intermissionae1p1.asp|title=Intermission: The pause that refreshes Just like old days, long film has break|website=old.post-gazette.com}}</ref>\n\nToday, a practice of first premiering a film in larger cities is more common, mainly towards the end of the year, in order to qualify for film award consideration, including the [[Academy Awards]]. Such recent films that have gone the limited release route include ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' (2005), and the Disney film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' (2009); these and other such limited release films eventually opened wide.  Sometimes this is done to allow a film to receive a wide release shortly after the first of the year, while qualifying for the previous year's Academy Awards. Often, smaller films (often art and independent) will receive an initial release in New York and Los Angeles, and later expand to other cities based on results; this is called \"platforming\" or a [[platform release]].\n\nOccasionally roadshow releases are done for special event films. In 2006, the film ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', based on the [[Dreamgirls (musical)|Broadway stage musical]], was given a three-theater road show release, with reserved seats and program guides. Tickets were significantly higher priced than normal, at $25. The film itself was not shown with an intermission.<ref>{{cite news| last=McClintock | first=Pamela | date=2006-11-06  | url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117953449.html | title= D'Works takes 'Girls' on road | publisher= Daily Variety | accessdate= 2006-11-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the four-hour biopic ''[[Che (2008 film)|Che]]'', starring [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Che Guevara]], was shown in a roadshow format for a limited time in a number of large cities.\n\n[[Quentin Tarantino]], who remembers the roadshow era fondly, released ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' in selected theaters on [[Christmas Day]] before expanding into a wide release on December 30, 2015. Tarantino shot the film in anamorphic 70mm (specifically the single-strip 6-track stereo [[Cinerama]] format described above) and managed to get the film booked in roughly 100 theaters worldwide that were provided 70mm projectors and lenses to equip the theaters to cope with the Cinerama format by [[The Weinstein Company]] to screen the film as the director intended.

Although variants of roadshow releases occasionally still exist, the practice mostly ended in the early 1970s.\n\nAs far as is known, virtually all of the films given roadshow releases were subsequently distributed to regular movie theaters. This was called a general release, and was akin to the modern-day [[wide release]] of a film. However, there are five important differences between a roadshow presentation of a film and today's [[limited release]]s:\n\n* Roadshow theatrical releases almost always placed a ten to fifteen-minute [[intermission]] between the two \"acts\" of the film, and the first act was frequently longer than the second.\n* Films shown as roadshow releases, especially those made between 1952 and 1974, were nearly always longer than the usual motion picture, lasting anywhere from slightly more than two hours to four hours or more, counting the intermission. Examples include ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), or ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963). There were no [[short subject]]s accompanying the film, and rarely any [[trailer (promotion)|movie trailer]]s.\n* Roadshow presentations were always shown on a one or two-performance a day, reserved seat basis, and admission prices were always higher than those of regular screenings. Unlike today's limited releases, seats ''had'' to be reserved; one could not simply buy a ticket at the box office and go in to watch the film. The two-performance-a-day screenings were usually limited to Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the rest of the week, the films would be shown only once a day. (However, in the case of ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'', there were three showings a day of the film on weekends, rather than two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/1999/59/rivoli/index.htm|title=The Rivoli Theatre|publisher=}}</ref>)\n* [[Programme (booklet)|Souvenir program]]s were often available at roadshow presentations of films, much as souvenir programs are made available when one goes to see the stage version of a play or musical. These movie souvenir programs contained photos from the film, photos and biographies of its cast and principal crew, and information on how the film was made, rather like today's \"extras\" on [[DVD]]s.\n* In the days of frequent roadshow releases, production companies and film distributors never used them to determine whether or not a film should be given a wide release, as is done today occasionally when films perform poorly at the box office. From the 1920s to the mid-1970s, a roadshow release would ''always'' play widely after its original engagements. This was true even of box office flops.\n\n==U.S. releases==\nThe roadshow format had been used since the days of [[silent film|silent]] films, but the rise of widescreen and stereophonic sound in the 1950s made it especially attractive to studio executives, who hoped to lure audiences away from television by presenting films in a way that an audience at that time could never hope to see at home. Possibly, the first film ever shown in a roadshow engagement was the French film ''[[Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth|Les Amours de la reine Elisabeth]]'' in America in 1912, a 53-minute motion picture which starred the legendary stage actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]].\n\nFilms shown in a roadshow format before 1951 included:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915)\n*''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916)\n*''[[The Covered Wagon]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n*''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925)\n*''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925)\n*''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927) , the first [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Academy Award]] winner\n*''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927) , the first feature length part-talkie \n*''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), the silent film based on the play that inspired the [[Kander and Ebb]] Broadway musical and Oscar-winning film\n*''[[The Broadway Melody]]''(1929)\n*''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1929), a [[part-talkie]] based not on the 1927 stage musical but on Edna Ferber's original novel from which the musical was adapted\n*''[[Hollywood Revue of 1929|Hollywood Revue]]'' (1929)\n*''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Paris (1929 film)|Paris]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Howard Hughes]]''<nowiki/>' [[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930)\n*''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), winner of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]\n*''[[Cavalcade (1933 film)|Cavalcade]]'' (1933)\n*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755216-2,00.html|title=Cinema: The New Pictures: Oct. 21, 1935|date=October 21, 1935|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n*''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936)\n*''[[In Old Chicago]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939)\n*''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940)\n*''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943)\n*''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n*''[[This Is the Army]]'' (1943) (shown only in roadshow format on initial release)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35613/warner-bros-and-the-homefront-collection/|title=Warner Bros. and the Homefront Collection|website=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n*''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944)\n*''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946)\n*''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946) \n*''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947)\n*[[Ingrid Bergman]]''<nowiki/>'''s ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]''  (1948)\n*''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949)\n*''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951).

The overture, recorded on film without a picture (and years later, on tape), was always played before the beginning of the film, while the lights were still up and the curtains were still closed.  As the lights dimmed, the overture ended, the curtains opened, and the film began with its main title music and opening credits. Likewise, the exit music should not be confused with the end title music. The exit music, also recorded without a picture on film, was always played ''after'' the end of the film, while the lights were up and the curtains were closed. As the lights came on, the end title music ended, the curtains closed, and the exit music began. Most movie theaters until the 1980s had curtains which covered the screen, and which would open when the show actually began and close when it ended.\n\n==Examples==\nAn early example of this was ''Gone with the Wind'' (1939). Running almost four hours in length, the film was divided into the above components, so that the film patron can experience the film as if they were seeing an actual play in a theater.\n\nThe original theatrical release of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''Fantasia'', presented in [[Fantasound]] in selected large cities in the United States, never had an overture, entr'acte, or exit music. Still, ''Fantasia'' was first released in the roadshow format, included an intermission in its first run, and was originally presented without on-screen credits to perpetuate a concert-going experience\u2014the printed souvenir program, given out to patrons as they entered the theater, presented the film's credits.\n\nThe original New York run of the English-language film ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1950), starring [[Jose Ferrer]] and based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s 1897 French play, was likewise presented in a roadshow format (that is, one or two performances a day), although the film is only two hours long, was not produced on a large budget, and does not contain an intermission.<ref>{{cite news| last=Crowther |first=Bosley | authorlink= Bosley Crowther | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9506EFD61738E73ABC4F52DFB767838B649EDE  |title='Cyrano,' With Jose Ferrer in Title Role and Mala Powers as Roxane, Opens at the Bijou |publisher= The New York Times |date=1950-11-17 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Show Boat (1951 film)|1951 ''Show Boat'']] was also shown in a roadshow format in some theaters, despite being less than two hours long, and not having an overture, intermission, entr'acte, or exit music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr2.htm|title=Widescreen Museum - Cinerama Wing 2|publisher=}}</ref> \n\n===1950s to 1970s===\nWith the rise of television, beginning in 1952 and continuing through the early 1970s, studios tried to bring movie audiences back to theaters by making widescreen epics, again using the \"roadshow\" formula. Films shot in [[3D film|3D]] sometimes were also shown in a roadshow format with intermission, regardless of actual length, as well as many films shot in various larger [[widescreen]] processes, such as [[CinemaScope]], [[Todd-AO]], [[Ultra Panavision 70|MGM Camera 65]], and [[Super Panavision 70]] were given roadshow presentations, as well as films that were blown up to 70mm from the 35mm negative.

Several of them, especially the musicals, were box-office flops that cost the studios fortunes, even if they had previously been hits as stage shows.\n\nSome of the films, such as the Olivier ''Othello'' or the Burton ''Hamlet'', were not even ''designed'' to be box-office smashes as films, but were merely meant to bring these productions to a wider public than could have seen them onstage, much as [[American Film Theatre]] would do in the mid-1970s.\n\nMany of these newer roadshow releases, including the Disney ''Sleeping Beauty'', were shown in six-track [[stereophonic sound]], a then non-standard feature of motion pictures. ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961), although shown in 70mm and six track stereophonic sound, was originally intended to be shown with intermission, but was, in most areas, shown without one in order to increase the tension in the plot\u2014an idea recommended by the filmmakers themselves. The Special Limited Edition DVD release includes an option for watching the two-and-a-half hour film both with and without a break.\n\nSome films like ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' were often occasionally shown as roadshows for international releases, even if they weren't intended as roadshows for domestic release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/gunsofnavarone.php|title=DVD Verdict Review\u2014The Guns Of Navarone: Collector's Edition|work=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', which had originally been shown in 35mm 4-Track stereophonic sound and without an overture, intermission and exit music, was re-released in a 70mm format with an overture, intermission and exit music, remixed into six-track stereophonic sound, and shown in a roadshow format. The film had originally been made in [[Cinemascope 55]] and through advances in technology was now able to be re-released in a process called [[70 mm Grandeur film|Grandeur 70]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcs7.htm|title=Widescreen Museum\u2014The CinemaScope Wing 7\u2014CinemaScope 55|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFilms made in three-camera [[Cinerama]] always received roadshow releases to show off the technology. The special requirements needed to show films in Cinerama\u2014a theater with a huge, ultra-curved screen, three projectors running simultaneously, and seven-track stereophonic sound\u2014made it impossible to show its films in wide release unless the picture was converted to standard one projector format (i.e. [[Panavision]]).\n\nSince most of those cut off the sides of the original combined picture, eventually, with the advent of anamorphic lenses, a number of Cinerama roadshows were able to be compressed onto normal 5-perf 70MM film and with the extra-wide screens installed, normal 70MM theaters were able to play these reformatted Cinerama titles.\n\n==Exceptions==\nThere were some notable exceptions to the standard roadshow release format, three of them Shakespeare productions. One was ''Othello'' (1965), which was essentially a filmed visual record of the already famous Laurence Olivier 1964 London stage production, shot in a movie studio, but on enlarged stage settings. The nearly three-hour color film, made in Panavision and shown in 35MM and mono sound in many areas, was shown in 70MM and six-track stereophonic sound in exactly one engagement - in London in 1966,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |title=70mm Blow Up List 1966 - by |publisher=In70mm.com |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144618/http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nBeing a film that lay somewhere between a photographed play and a true motion picture, the film did not make sufficient use of the spectacular vistas that 1960s widescreen epics usually boasted. In addition, while it had no overture, entr'acte music, or exit music, it was still shown on a two-performance-a-day basis with an intermission, as nearly all roadshow releases were. However, it was shown in U.S. cinemas for an extremely limited release: only two days,<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E0D6163AEF34BC4A53DFB466838D679EDE |title= Minstrel Show 'Othello':Radical Makeup Marks Olivier's Interpretation |publisher= The New York Times |date=1966-02-02 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> in contrast to the customary and lengthy months-long engagements enjoyed by most roadshow films.\n\nThe same was true of the Richard Burton ''Hamlet'', which was presented in the same type of extremely limited engagement as ''Othello''. Filmed over two days in a quickie black-and-white process called [[Electronovision]], which resembled a 1960s videotaped broadcast, this three hours plus production featured none of the epic features that were a standard of roadshow theatrical release - no impressive scenery, no gorgeous color, no beautiful costumes, or stereophonic sound, only an intermission halfway through the performance. It was not even, strictly speaking, a full-scale film version of the play, but merely a visual recording of a performance of it at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], with a live audience. At three hours and eleven minutes, it was the longest film version of ''Hamlet'' to that date.\n\nAnother exception was Franco Zeffirelli's hugely successful 1968 version of ''Romeo and Juliet'', which, although photographed in beautiful settings and certainly having the look of an epic, was shown in most areas in monaural sound (although its three [[soundtrack album]]s were all made in stereo) and was projected at a screen aspect ratio of 1.66:1; that is, roughly the dimensions of today's average movie screen or HDTV screen, not the very wide screens required for films made in [[Ultra Panavision 70|Ultra Panavision]], CinemaScope, Todd-AO or any of the other ultrawide processes invented in the 1950s meant that the film lacked many of the customary roadshow elements opf the period. However The Mexican release of the picture, DID feature a six-track stereo surround mix and was shown with its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio matted to a 2.2 in standard 70MM.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |title=70mm films in Mexico |publisher=In70mm.com |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144721/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the film version of [[James Goldman]]'s ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968), although a roadshow release filmed on location to qualify for the gorgeous color and beautiful scenery requirements, instead of being released in 70MM and 6-track stereo sound - even though it was shown in Technicolor, it was only from 35MM Panavision (anamorphic) film and mono sound. Only in Australia and in its 1973 London re-release was the picture shown in both 70MM and stereophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1968/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1968 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1973/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1973 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> 1971's ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', another roadshow release, was also shown in 70mm 6-track only in Europe, while its U.S. release was in regular Panavision with monophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/technical|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/combined|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|work=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above, ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1959), ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' (1961) and ''The Longest Day'' (1962) were three epics that were shown in black and white instead of [[Technicolor]]. Before then, roadshow epics alternated between getting released in black and white or color.\n\n===Edited versions and restoration===\nIt was common practice for studios to cut some of these epics for general release in order for theaters to book more showings a day and present the film at reduced \"popular prices\", especially if the film ran longer than two hours. Sometimes this was done to a successful film, such as ''South Pacific'', but more often to one that had been a notable flop, in an effort to make it a success on its second run. As a result, some of these films have not been seen in their entirety since their first release, as the original edited footage is either missing or no longer exists. With the work of [[film preservation|film preservationists and restoration]], such roadshow flops as ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1935), ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' (1947), ''Joan of Arc'' (1948), '' A Star Is Born'' (1954) and ''Fantasia'' (1940), along with the hugely successful films ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943), ''Spartacus'', ''Lawrence of Arabia'', ''Around the World in 80 Days'' and ''It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'', all of which had significant footage missing, have been restored in recent years to match the filmmakers' original intent. However, several extremely popular long films, such as ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''The Ten Commandments'', have never been released in edited form, and were nearly always shown on a two performance-a-day basis.\n\n''In Old Chicago'', despite its roadshow presentation running only 110 minutes, was edited down to 95 minutes for general release, but restored to its full length on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/16907/in-old-chicago/|title=In Old Chicago|work=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n\nFrequently, unless the film was exceptionally long, the intermission, along with the overture, ent'racte music, and exit music would be eliminated when it went into general release, in order to save twenty minutes and possibly squeeze in more showings, and the film would be shown just like any other motion picture. Often too, the souvenir programs that were a part of the roadshow release of the films were no longer given out during the wide release.\n\n===Rise of the limited release===\nThe practice of roadshow presentation began dying out in the 1970s, partly due to a string of costly box-office flops, and partly due to the rise of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]]. As multiplexes began to increase in number, and as more and more skyscraper hotels and office buildings took the place of the oldtime movie palaces, theater exhibitors began showing long films in a more informal format. [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s Oscar-winning epics ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), for instance, were made with mono sound, shown without intermissions, and were given more than two performances a day, despite their extreme length. [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) was shown more than twice a day, but included an intermission.\n\nAlthough some very long films such as ''Gone with the Wind'' would always be shown with an intermission and some films like ''[[Huckleberry Finn (1974 film)|Huckleberry Finn]]'' would be released with overtures until 1979, \"reserved seat\" showings of new films became extremely rare. The last film musical to officially receive a reserved seat engagement was ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1973), a financial and critical disaster.\n\nIn the late 1970s, only three films (two popular and one a legendary disaster) received a reserved seat engagement. Michael Cimino made the successful film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', which was a commercial and critical success, winning the Oscar for Best Picture. In its initial run, it was enlarged to 70mm film and given a roadshow release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1978/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1978 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> Francis Ford Coppola, director of ''[[The Godfather]]'', made ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', another three-hour epic which garnered some favorable reviews and is now considered one of his best. The film had a difficult production history, and after five years of production it premiered in a U.S. reserved seat engagement in 70mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1979/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1979 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> It became a great financial success, and made even more money years later when the director's cut was released. Cimino's next film in 1980 was ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which is infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs ever. It had a roadshow release and premiered in a 70mm version with an intermission. The roadshow engagement was the shortest in history, for only three theaters held the screenings. Its New York run lasted three days, the Toronto run was shown once, and the Los Angeles engagement was cancelled.\n\nOne development that diminished the novelty of the modern roadshow release was that, beginning with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), stereophonic sound began to be used more and more in films, even films that were not really big-budget spectaculars. Most films, however, were at that time still released only with mono sound. ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', for example, made a mere two years before ''Star Wars'', was originally released in this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/jaws.php|title=DVD Verdict Review - Jaws|work=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nAlthough as late as in 1982, the hugely successful ''[[Tootsie]]'' was also released with mono sound, as was the 1983 Best Picture winner ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/technical|title=Tootsie (1982)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086425/technical|title=Terms of Endearment (1983)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> By about 1984, mono sound was abandoned completely in American films, and stereo (often the six-track variety) finally became the norm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/combined|title=The Killing Fields (1984)|work=IMDb}}</ref>. However, 1982's ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' and 1983's ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' originally received 70mm releases with intermissions, due to their extreme lengths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/alternateversions|title=Gandhi (1982) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/alternateversions|title=Scarface (1983) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nBy 1984, the entire roadshow format had also largely been abandoned, as the rise of the multiplex and competition from cable TV and home video began forcing changes in the nature of film industry. For example, ''[[Carmen (1984 film)|Carmen]]'' (1984), an uncut two-and-a-half hour film version of the popular [[Georges Bizet]] opera, was not released as a roadshow nor shown with an intermission, despite the fact that the film was so faithful to the opera that it kept the stage version's original division into four acts. The 1984 ''Carmen'' was also filmed in six-track stereo and on location, like many epics. \n\nEven though the format had died out, 1993's ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', 1996's ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' and 2003's ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' were screened with intermissions due to their extreme lengths on their original releases. While all three films had no official overture, entr'acte or exit music, cinemas choose to show the films accompanied with the commercially available film soundtracks playing as the audience entered and exited theaters. ''Gettysburg'' and ''Hamlet'' were screened with two screenings a day while ''Gods and Generals'' was not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20030222intermissionae1p1.asp|title=Intermission: The pause that refreshes Just like old days, long film has break|website=old.post-gazette.com}}</ref>\n\nToday, a practice of first premiering a film in larger cities is more common, mainly towards the end of the year, in order to qualify for film award consideration, including the [[Academy Awards]]. Such recent films that have gone the limited release route include ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' (2005), and the Disney film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' (2009); these and other such limited release films eventually opened wide.  Sometimes this is done to allow a film to receive a wide release shortly after the first of the year, while qualifying for the previous year's Academy Awards. Often, smaller films (often art and independent) will receive an initial release in New York and Los Angeles, and later expand to other cities based on results; this is called \"platforming\" or a [[platform release]].\n\nOccasionally roadshow releases are done for special event films. In 2006, the film ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', based on the [[Dreamgirls (musical)|Broadway stage musical]], was given a three-theater road show release, with reserved seats and program guides. Tickets were significantly higher priced than normal, at $25. The film itself was not shown with an intermission.<ref>{{cite news| last=McClintock | first=Pamela | date=2006-11-06  | url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117953449.html | title= D'Works takes 'Girls' on road | publisher= Daily Variety | accessdate= 2006-11-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the four-hour biopic ''[[Che (2008 film)|Che]]'', starring [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Che Guevara]], was shown in a roadshow format for a limited time in a number of large cities.\n\n[[Quentin Tarantino]], who remembers the roadshow era fondly, released ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' in selected theaters on [[Christmas Day]] before expanding into a wide release on December 30, 2015. Tarantino shot the film in anamorphic 70mm (specifically the single-strip 6-track stereo [[Cinerama]] format described above) and managed to get the film booked in roughly 100 theaters worldwide that were provided 70mm projectors and lenses to equip the theaters to cope with the Cinerama format by [[The Weinstein Company]] to screen the film as the director intended.

However, Milan were the designated away side in the latter, and so became the only team to win on \"away\" goals without having scored a goal away from their own stadium. They later went on to win the final against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].\n* [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] are the only teams to have advanced on the away goals rule after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].

Both teams scored one goal each in the extra time, giving Milan the victory on away goals. They later went on to win the final against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. In the round of 16 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League|2014\u201315]], PSG drew 1\u20131 at home and away.

Roma's [[Agostino Di Bartolomei]] was the first player to score, while Liverpool's [[Steve Nicol]] was the first to miss. Liverpool went on to win 4\u20132 with [[Alan Kennedy]] scoring the deciding goal. Kennedy also scored the deciding goal in the [[1981 European Cup Final|1981 final]].\n* 11 finals have been decided by a penalty shootout. [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] is the only team to have won more than once ([[1983\u201384 European Cup|1984]] and [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|2005]]), while [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[A.C.
