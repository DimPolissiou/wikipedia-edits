Created in 1536, the franchise expanded in the late 19th century and on the enfranchisement of women. Its boundaries remained virtually unchanged until 1983. From 1536 until 1885 the area had two seats (electing MPs): a [[county constituency]] (Cardiganshire) comprising the rural areas, the other the borough constituency known as the [[Cardigan Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardigan District of Boroughs]] comprising a few separate towns; in 1885 the latter was abolished, its towns and electors incorporated into the former, reduced to one MP. The towns which comprised the Boroughs varied slightly over this long period, but primarily consisted of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Lampeter]] and [[Adpar]], the latter now a suburb of [[Newcastle Emlyn]] across the [[River Teifi|Teifi]], in [[Carmarthenshire]].\n\nThe county constituency (a distinction from borough class remains, namely as to type of returning officer and permissible electoral expenses) was merged in 1983 with part of [[Pembrokeshire]], making a new constituency named [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]]. In 1997 it was recreated and its non-Anglicised name became its formal name, ''Ceredigion''.\n\nThe [[Ceredigion (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Ceredigion Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe boundaries of this constituency mirror almost exactly those of the county of [[Ceredigion]].\n\n=== Proposed constituency changes ===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat's boundaries will be extended. The seat, which has the proposed name of Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire, includes all of the current Ceredigion constituency, the northern part of the current [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]] constituency, a small part of [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]] around the village of [[Dre-fach Felindre]], as well the south-western part of [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] around [[Llanidloes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ceredigion could return to south constituency boundary|work=Cambrian News|date=19 September 2016|url=http://cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920131235/http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 September 2016|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|title=2018 Review of Parliamentary Constituencies \u2014 Initial Proposals Report|publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales|date=September 2016|section=Ceredigion a Gogledd Sir Benfro (Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire)|page=80|access-date=<!--30 October 2016-->}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Ceredigion]], formerly known by the anglicised version of its name as ''Cardiganshire'', was first enfranchised in 1536 when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] incorporated [[Wales]] within England. The county was given one member, who was to be elected by each person who owned property of a sufficient value. In addition the inhabitants of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Adpar]] and [[Lampeter]] were given the right to elect one MP between them, with the vote restricted to the [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]]. The [[1715 British general election|general election of 1715]] saw the return of [[Lewis Pryse]], who was expelled from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the following year for refusing to attend the House to take oaths of loyalty to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] after the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rising]], with which he sympathised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/expulsions.html|title=Members expelled from the House of Commons since the Restoration|work=demon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformed elections ===\nFrom 1832 the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] changed the electoral system so that householders of homes worth over \u00a310 were enfranchised in the boroughs. The Borough constituency was still dominated by the [[Pryse baronets|Loveden-Pryse]] family based in [[Gogerddan]] who were supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]; Pryse Pryse held the seat unopposed from 1818 until his death in 1849, except for the 1841 election when he narrowly retained the seat after a controversial contest. The Cardiganshire county constituency, however, was dominated by the Powell family of [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] who were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. [[William Edward Powell]] held the seat from 1816 until shortly before his death in 1854. By agreement between the followers of Gogerddan and Nanteos, neither challenged the others' nomination and as a result there were no contested elections in the county until 1859.\n\nFollowing Powell's retirement, the representation fell to [[Ernest Vaughan, 4th Earl of Lisburne|Ernest Vaughan]] of Trawscoed, whose politics were Conservative.\n\nThe county saw its first contest in the [[1859 United Kingdom general election|1859 general election]] when Colonel [[William Thomas Rowland Powell|W.T.R. Powell]] of Nanteos sought to re-establish the family's claim to the county seat. He was opposed by Arthur Saunders-Davies of Pentre but prevailed by a narrow margin. Both candidates held conservative views but Powell sat as a Liberal-Conservative.\n\nHowever, the era where Nanteos could claim the seat were numbered, and [[Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Lloyd]] of Bronwydd was mooted as a potential Liberal candidate at the 1854 by-election,<ref name=\"W edit 17-2-54\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4348090/4348092/19|accessdate=24 January 2019 |newspaper=Welshman |date=17 February 1854 |page=2}}</ref> and again at the General Elections of 1857<ref name=\"W edit 27-3-57\">{{cite news|title=Editorial [untitled]|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4349354/4349357/7|accessdate=6 February 2019|newspaper=Welshman|date=27 March 1857|page=3}}</ref> and 1859.<ref name=\"W 22-4-59 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4350326/4350331/40 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=22 April 1859 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865 general election]], Powell had indicated some twelve months prior to the election that he would retire and Lloyd of Bronwydd was selected as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] offered themselves as candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw and came within 361 votes of victory.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=16}}\n\nLloyd transferred to the borough in the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 election]] when the seat was captured by Swansea industrialist, [[Evan Mathew Richards|E.M. Richards]]. This election is often regarded as a landmark when tenant farmers allegedly refused to follow patterns of age-old deference and vote in line with the wishes of their landlords. Following this election there were claims of intimidation by Conservative landlords and a national fund was set up to support those purportedly evicted from their farms. In reality, however, Richards' victory owed much to the support of the powerful Pryse family of [[Pryse baronets|Gogerddan]].\n\nIn 1874, the Conservative candidate [[Thomas Edward Lloyd]] of Coedmore captured the seat for the Conservatives, defeating Richards by 215 votes. The result was greeted with disbelief in Liberal ranks, particularly since the introduction of the secret ballot was expected to have favoured the Liberals.<ref name=\"CN edit 13-2-74\">{{cite news|title=Liberal Defeat in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3343745/3343751/58|accessdate=18 January 2018|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=13 February 1874|page=6}}</ref> However, the Conservatives had chosen a candidate who was popular in his locality and not been involved in conflicts with his tenants. The Liberals were also caught unprepared for the contest, with Lloyd's candidature kept secret until nomination day.<ref name=\"SWDN edit 5-2-74\">{{cite news|title=The Cardiganshire Election (editorial)|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3499558/3499560/24|accessdate=19 January 2018|newspaper=South Wales Daily News|date=5 February 1874|page=2}}</ref> Much capital was also made of the fact that Lloyd was a Cardiganshire man, in contrast to Richards, a Swansea industrialist.<ref name=\"AO edit 14-2-74\">{{cite news|title=The Conservative Victory in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3040206/3040210/27|accessdate=20 January 2018|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=14 February 1874|page=2}}</ref> The result was reversed in 1880 although there were close contests for the county thereafter, on a slightly widened franchise.\n\n===Single constituency===\nIn a redistribution of seats for the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]], the borough constituency was abolished and absorbed into the county. This brought into the county seat the more radical politics of urban voters in the boroughs of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Lampeter]] and Adpar. More significantly, the further widening of the franchise in 1884 added between five and six thousand new voters to the register by extending the pattern of household suffrage to the counties. The majority of these voters would have been tenant farmers, the more prosperous agricultural labourers, and householders in small towns or large villages such as Tregaron, Aberaeron, New Quay, Aberporth, Tal-y-bont and Borth, which had not been part of the old Cardigan Boroughs constituency. The impact of the widening of the franchise and boundary changes was to increase the electorate from 5,026 in 1883 to 12,308 by 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=313}}</ref> It was assumed that these changes would make the county a reasonably safe bet for the Liberal Party and that supporters of Gladstone would be comfortably returned at every election. These structural changes to the political arrangements of the county were also taking place against wider social and economic developments which affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life. Traditional industries were in decline, agriculture was increasingly in crisis and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still-increasing population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities. As a result, there were two major consequences. Firstly there was a significant population shift as a result of emigration, in the majority of cases to the south Wales valleys. Secondly, the great landed estates of the county, which had for so long dominated the politics of the county, were in many cases heavily in debt. This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the politics of the county, a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|Cardiganshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=314\u201318; 319\u201320}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the predictions that Gladstonian Liberals would dominate county politics were realised, in 1885, [[David Davies (Liberal politician)|David Davies]] was elected to represent the constituency with a majority of 2,323 (24.2%) on a turnout of 78%, heavily defeating the Conservative, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]]. Although David Davies was no public speaker, he drew substantial support in Cardiganshire as a generous benefactor of the new university college at Aberystwyth and also through his links with Calvinistic Methodism, which had over 13,000 members in the county. Allied to this was a particularly effective Liberal association which paid close attention to the registration of voters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=322\u20133}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|David Davies (industrialist)}}\n\nIn 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland in 1886 and a number of his associates such as [[Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr]] followed him into the [[Liberal Unionist]] camp.<ref name=\"AO 18860626\">{{cite news|title=Meeting in support of Mr D.

This election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=323\u20134}}</ref> The result of the election was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations, although the more effective canvassing of supporters by the Liberal Association was also identified as an important factor.<ref name=\"AO 18870717\">{{cite news|title=Cardiganshire Election and its lessons (editorial)|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3301611/3301615/39|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=17 July 1886}}</ref>\n\nEven though Bowen Rowlands's victory was by the closest of margins it was a decisive moment in the political history of Cardiganshire. It proved that a Gladstonian Liberal candidate, even an Anglican with strong Irish Nationalist sympathies, could triumph in Cardiganshire even against the resources and religious connections of a candidate such as David Davies. Although Liberal Unionism continued to be championed by a relatively small group, led by the journalist Henry Tobit Evans, who published a newspaper, ''Y Brython'', at Lampeter, most of the leading Liberals who had defected to Davies eventually returned to the fold, in some cases to contest the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|1889 County Council]] elections. The demise of Liberal Unionism was confirmed at the 1892 general election when, William Jones, a self-made Birmingham draper who had a small estate in Cardiganshire and was a member of the [[Cardiganshire County Council]] ran with the support of Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain had sponsored a number of Nonconformist unionist candidates in Wales in the hope of capitalising upon perceived antipathy towards Irish Nationalism. Despite spending heavily and producing a farmer evicted at the 1868 Election on his platform, Jones was heavily defeated by Bowen Rowlands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=324\u20135}}</ref> Rowlands served until 1895.\n\nOnce Rowlands's intention not to stand again was known, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]] of [[Tan-y-Bwlch, Aberystwyth|Tan-y-Bwlch]], who had been the Conservative candidate in the seat in 1885, but who had subsequently joined the Liberal Party, emerged as a contender for the nomination and was eventually chosen by a delegate conference, defeating [[John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids|Wynford Phillips]] by 160 votes to 111.<ref name=\"AO 4-7-95 LibCand\">{{cite news|title=Representation of Cardiganshire.

His closest electoral call came in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|'Khaki election' of 1900]] when he had a majority of 781 (9.4%) over [[J.C. Harford]] of Falcondale. Thereafter, Vaughan Davies was comfortably returned at each election but the vitality of the Liberal Association was in serious decline. During this time the ''Cambrian News'' had tempered its opposition to him and grudgingly admitted that Vaughan-Davies had won friends and supporteres by his adherence to Liberal policies.<ref name=\"CN 27-10-00 edit\">{{cite news|title=The Two Cardiganshire Candidates (editorial)|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3317276/ART27|accessdate=27 October 2014|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=5 October 1900}}</ref>\n\nBy 1914 the Liberal Association was heavily dependent on Vaughan Davies's role as treasurer to keep it going. In the meantime, Vaughan Davies remained on poor terms with prominent Liberals, including [[John Gibson (editor and journalist)|John Gibson]], editor of the ''Cambrian News'' until his death in 1915.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=328\u20139}}</ref>\n\nLike most Welsh Liberals, he supported [[David Lloyd George]] in the split in the Liberal Party, and not [[H. H. Asquith]], and was therefore returned unopposed as a Coalition Liberal in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]].\n\n===Liberal infighting (1921\u20131950)===\nIn many ways the Liberals had become the new elite in Cardiganshire by the time of the First World War. This was demonstrated in 1919 when [[John Humphreys Davies]], the nonconformist squire of Cwrtmawr, was appointed Principal of the University College, Aberystwyth, at the expense of [[Thomas Jones (T. J.)|Thomas Jones]], who was championed by Lord Davies of Llandinam, grandson of [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|page=330}}</ref>\n\nWith Vaughan Davies known to be a supporter of Lloyd George, it was natural that Lloyd George looked to him to boost his support in the [[House of Lords]] and awarded him a peerage in the New Years' Honours list in 1921. Although he would have preferred to be called 'Lord Ceredigion', the Garter King of Arms refused this as an inappropriate title for a Baron, and so Vaughan Davies took his title from the [[River Ystwyth]] which ran past his home. The peerage created a vacancy in a historically Liberal seat and the Asquithites decided to take the Lloyd Georgeites on in their 'backyard' in what became a memorable [[1921 Cardiganshire by-election|by-election]].\n\n[[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], who asserted on his election posters that he was 'THE Liberal candidate', was a Barrister from Aberystwyth and had been Private Secretary to Lloyd George himself, and therefore had the blessing of the Coalition and official support from the Conservatives. A number of possible Asquithian Liberal candidates were approached to contest the seat against Evans and eventually the choice fell upon [[W. Llewelyn Williams]] who was sponsored by the Asquithite 'Welsh Liberal Federation'. No other candidate stood and in the straight fight, Evans won with a majority of 3,590 (14.6%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=332\u20135}}</ref>\n\nEvans held on as a 'National Liberal' (as Lloyd George's supporters called themselves) in the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] but with a slim majority of 515 votes (2.0%) over [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]].\n\nThe sudden shotgun merger of the two factions in the Liberal Party led to Evans getting the official approval of the unified party for the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]]. However, the Conservatives decided to fight and this deprived him of their votes. Hopkin Morris decided to fight again as an unofficial Liberal and won with a 5,078 vote majority. Hopkin Morris was lucky to survive the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], a disaster for the Liberals, by being returned unopposed.\n\nThe first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate stood against [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] and polled 24% of the vote in a straight fight against Morris, who had a 13,752 (52.0%) majority.\n\nIn 1932, Morris left Parliament temporarily (he was later to return as MP for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]]) when he was appointed as a Metropolitan Police magistrate. The byelection on 22 September 1932 saw the first three-way fight between the parties, but was won by [[Owen Evans (politician)|Owen Evans]] for the Liberals. Like many of the Liberal MPs he had been a barrister. Evans died shortly before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], but the seat was easily held by his successor [[Roderic Bowen]]. Unusually the Labour vote actually fell in percentage terms compared with the previous election despite the Labour landslide in the country at large.\n\n===Labour challenge (1950\u20131972)===\nLabour established itself as the main challenger to the Liberals at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] in a three-way contest, and the Conservatives opted out of the contest thereafter until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. This was partly a move to keep the seat from going Labour. [[Plaid Cymru]] first fought the seat in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] and kept their deposit (just, with 12.8% of the vote).\n\nWith a four-way contest involving the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru at the 1964 general election, and a national swing to Labour, Roderic Bowen suffered a precipitate decline in his share of the vote to only 38.4%; he was re-elected with a majority of 2,219 (7.4%) over Labour. After the death of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] in 1965, Bowen accepted the offer to become a Deputy Speaker, which prevented him from speaking on behalf of his constituency. For the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]], Labour selected [[Elystan Morgan]] who had been a member of Plaid Cymru until 1964; with a further national swing and Morgan making a credible bid for the Welsh-speaking vote, Labour won the seat by 523 votes.\n\n===1974 onwards===\nIn boundary changes in 1983, the constituency was merged with a northern area of [[Pembrokeshire]] and also took a Welsh version of its name, becoming known as [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]].\n\nCeredigion was recreated for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] as it reverted to its former borders, having lost the part of North Pembrokeshire in boundary changes.\n\nMark Williams, first elected in 2005, was the first non-Welsh speaking Member of Parliament elected to represent the constituency since Bowen Rowlands (MP from 1886 until 1892, who declared at a meeting in Aberystwyth when adopted as candidate that he could not speak Welsh).<ref>{{cite news|title=The County Election|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3301595/ART95|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=3 July 1886}}</ref> At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], he received a massive increase in his vote, polling over 50% of the votes cast and raising his majority from 219 to 8,324 over the Plaid Cymru candidate, Penri James.\n\nIn [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], Williams suffered a decline of over 14% in his vote share, in common with other Liberal Democrat incumbents across the UK. However, after a campaign which made national headlines due to prior controversial comments by both the Plaid Cymru<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32227229|title=Election 2015: 'Baptism of fire' for Plaid candidate|date=9 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and Labour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32249455|title=Election 2015: Candidate suggested cars be damaged|date=10 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> candidates, Plaid Cymru were unable to capitalise as their vote share went down slightly. The Conservative vote also declined, while UKIP, Labour and the Greens all improved on their 2010 performance. Williams retained the seat to become the only Liberal Democrat MP in Wales, and one of only eight across the UK.\n\nIn [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], Williams lost his seat to [[Ben Lake]] by 104 votes (0.2%). Labour moved from fifth to third in the seat and were roughly 3,000 votes behind Williams and Lake, their best result in Ceredigion since 1997, and the Tories fell to fourth but increased their vote by more than 3,000. The 29.2% won by Plaid Cymru in 2017 was the lowest winning vote share of the election and the only seat won with less than 30% of the vote. At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]] Lake substantially increased both his majority and vote share, with the Liberal Democrats falling to third place.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1541\u20131640===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1541\u20131543|| [[Morgan ap Rice ap Philip]]\n|-\n|1543\u20131544|| [[Thomas Gynns]]\n|-\n|1545\u20131547|| [[David ap Llewellin Lloid of Llan Dissill]]\n|-\n|1547|| [[William Devereux (MP)|William Devereux]]\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1555|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1558|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1563|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1571|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1584|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1586|| [[Griffith Lloyd]]\n|-\n|1588|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1593|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1597|| [[Thomas Pryse]]\n|-\n|1601|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1604\u20131611|| [[John Lewis (of Abernant)|Sir John Lewis]]\n|-\n|1614\u20131622|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Sir Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1625\u20131629|| [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n|-\n|1629\u20131640|| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n===MPs after 1640===\n\n'''[[Short Parliament]]'''\n*1640: [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n\n'''[[Long Parliament]]'''\n* 1640\u20131644: [[Walter Lloyd]] ([[Cavalier|Royalist]]) \u2013 ''disabled to sit, 5 February 1644''\n* 1646\u20131648: [[Sir Richard Pryse, 1st Baronet]] \u2013 ''excluded in [[Pride's Purge]], December 1648''\n\n''Cardiganshire was unrepresented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n\n'''[[First Protectorate Parliament]]'''\n*1654\u20131655: [[James Philipps|Col.

Created in 1536, the franchise expanded in the late 19th century and on the enfranchisement of women. Its boundaries remained virtually unchanged until 1983. From 1536 until 1885 the area had two seats (electing MPs): a [[county constituency]] (Cardiganshire) comprising the rural areas, the other the borough constituency known as the [[Cardigan Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardigan District of Boroughs]] comprising a few separate towns; in 1885 the latter was abolished, its towns and electors incorporated into the former, reduced to one MP. The towns which comprised the Boroughs varied slightly over this long period, but primarily consisted of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Lampeter]] and [[Adpar]], the latter now a suburb of [[Newcastle Emlyn]] across the [[River Teifi|Teifi]], in [[Carmarthenshire]].\n\nThe county constituency (a distinction from borough class remains, namely as to type of returning officer and permissible electoral expenses) was merged in 1983 with part of [[Pembrokeshire]], making a new constituency named [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]]. In 1997 it was recreated and its non-Anglicised name became its formal name, ''Ceredigion''.\n\nThe [[Ceredigion (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Ceredigion Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe boundaries of this constituency mirror almost exactly those of the county of [[Ceredigion]].\n\n=== Proposed constituency changes ===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat's boundaries will be extended. The seat, which has the proposed name of Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire, includes all of the current Ceredigion constituency, the northern part of the current [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]] constituency, a small part of [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]] around the village of [[Dre-fach Felindre]], as well the south-western part of [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] around [[Llanidloes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ceredigion could return to south constituency boundary|work=Cambrian News|date=19 September 2016|url=http://cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920131235/http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 September 2016|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|title=2018 Review of Parliamentary Constituencies \u2014 Initial Proposals Report|publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales|date=September 2016|section=Ceredigion a Gogledd Sir Benfro (Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire)|page=80|access-date=<!--30 October 2016-->}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Ceredigion]], formerly known by the anglicised version of its name as ''Cardiganshire'', was first enfranchised in 1536 when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] incorporated [[Wales]] within England. The county was given one member, who was to be elected by each person who owned property of a sufficient value. In addition the inhabitants of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Adpar]] and [[Lampeter]] were given the right to elect one MP between them, with the vote restricted to the [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]]. The [[1715 British general election|general election of 1715]] saw the return of [[Lewis Pryse]], who was expelled from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the following year for refusing to attend the House to take oaths of loyalty to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] after the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rising]], with which he sympathised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/expulsions.html|title=Members expelled from the House of Commons since the Restoration|work=demon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformed elections ===\nFrom 1832 the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] changed the electoral system so that householders of homes worth over \u00a310 were enfranchised in the boroughs. The Borough constituency was still dominated by the [[Pryse baronets|Loveden-Pryse]] family based in [[Gogerddan]] who were supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]; Pryse Pryse held the seat unopposed from 1818 until his death in 1849, except for the 1841 election when he narrowly retained the seat after a controversial contest. The Cardiganshire county constituency, however, was dominated by the Powell family of [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] who were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. [[William Edward Powell]] held the seat from 1816 until shortly before his death in 1854. By agreement between the followers of Gogerddan and Nanteos, neither challenged the others' nomination and as a result there were no contested elections in the county until 1859.\n\nFollowing Powell's retirement, the representation fell to [[Ernest Vaughan, 4th Earl of Lisburne|Ernest Vaughan]] of Trawscoed, whose politics were Conservative.\n\nThe county saw its first contest in the [[1859 United Kingdom general election|1859 general election]] when Colonel [[William Thomas Rowland Powell|W.T.R.

Both candidates held conservative views but Powell sat as a Liberal-Conservative.\n\nHowever, the era where Nanteos could claim the seat were numbered, and [[Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Lloyd]] of Bronwydd was mooted as a potential Liberal candidate at the 1854 by-election,<ref name=\"W edit 17-2-54\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4348090/4348092/19|accessdate=24 January 2019 |newspaper=Welshman |date=17 February 1854 |page=2}}</ref> and again at the General Elections of 1857<ref name=\"W edit 27-3-57\">{{cite news|title=Editorial [untitled]|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4349354/4349357/7|accessdate=6 February 2019|newspaper=Welshman|date=27 March 1857|page=3}}</ref> and 1859.<ref name=\"W 22-4-59 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4350326/4350331/40 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=22 April 1859 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865 general election]], Powell had indicated some twelve months prior to the election that he would retire and Lloyd of Bronwydd was selected as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] offered themselves as candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw and came within 361 votes of victory.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=16}}\n\nLloyd transferred to the borough in the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 election]] when the seat was captured by Swansea industrialist, [[Evan Mathew Richards|E.M. Richards]]. This election is often regarded as a landmark when tenant farmers allegedly refused to follow patterns of age-old deference and vote in line with the wishes of their landlords. Following this election there were claims of intimidation by Conservative landlords and a national fund was set up to support those purportedly evicted from their farms. In reality, however, Richards' victory owed much to the support of the powerful Pryse family of [[Pryse baronets|Gogerddan]].\n\nIn 1874, the Conservative candidate [[Thomas Edward Lloyd]] of Coedmore captured the seat for the Conservatives, defeating Richards by 215 votes. The result was greeted with disbelief in Liberal ranks, particularly since the introduction of the secret ballot was expected to have favoured the Liberals.<ref name=\"CN edit 13-2-74\">{{cite news|title=Liberal Defeat in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3343745/3343751/58|accessdate=18 January 2018|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=13 February 1874|page=6}}</ref> However, the Conservatives had chosen a candidate who was popular in his locality and not been involved in conflicts with his tenants.

This brought into the county seat the more radical politics of urban voters in the boroughs of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Lampeter]] and Adpar. More significantly, the further widening of the franchise in 1884 added between five and six thousand new voters to the register by extending the pattern of household suffrage to the counties. The majority of these voters would have been tenant farmers, the more prosperous agricultural labourers, and householders in small towns or large villages such as Tregaron, Aberaeron, New Quay, Aberporth, Tal-y-bont and Borth, which had not been part of the old Cardigan Boroughs constituency. The impact of the widening of the franchise and boundary changes was to increase the electorate from 5,026 in 1883 to 12,308 by 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=313}}</ref> It was assumed that these changes would make the county a reasonably safe bet for the Liberal Party and that supporters of Gladstone would be comfortably returned at every election. These structural changes to the political arrangements of the county were also taking place against wider social and economic developments which affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life. Traditional industries were in decline, agriculture was increasingly in crisis and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still-increasing population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities. As a result, there were two major consequences. Firstly there was a significant population shift as a result of emigration, in the majority of cases to the south Wales valleys. Secondly, the great landed estates of the county, which had for so long dominated the politics of the county, were in many cases heavily in debt. This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the politics of the county, a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|Cardiganshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=314\u201318; 319\u201320}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the predictions that Gladstonian Liberals would dominate county politics were realised, in 1885, [[David Davies (Liberal politician)|David Davies]] was elected to represent the constituency with a majority of 2,323 (24.2%) on a turnout of 78%, heavily defeating the Conservative, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]]. Although David Davies was no public speaker, he drew substantial support in Cardiganshire as a generous benefactor of the new university college at Aberystwyth and also through his links with Calvinistic Methodism, which had over 13,000 members in the county. Allied to this was a particularly effective Liberal association which paid close attention to the registration of voters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=322\u20133}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|David Davies (industrialist)}}\n\nIn 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland in 1886 and a number of his associates such as [[Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr]] followed him into the [[Liberal Unionist]] camp.<ref name=\"AO 18860626\">{{cite news|title=Meeting in support of Mr D.

This election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=323\u20134}}</ref> The result of the election was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations, although the more effective canvassing of supporters by the Liberal Association was also identified as an important factor.<ref name=\"AO 18870717\">{{cite news|title=Cardiganshire Election and its lessons (editorial)|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3301611/3301615/39|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=17 July 1886}}</ref>\n\nEven though Bowen Rowlands's victory was by the closest of margins it was a decisive moment in the political history of Cardiganshire. It proved that a Gladstonian Liberal candidate, even an Anglican with strong Irish Nationalist sympathies, could triumph in Cardiganshire even against the resources and religious connections of a candidate such as David Davies. Although Liberal Unionism continued to be championed by a relatively small group, led by the journalist Henry Tobit Evans, who published a newspaper, ''Y Brython'', at Lampeter, most of the leading Liberals who had defected to Davies eventually returned to the fold, in some cases to contest the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|1889 County Council]] elections. The demise of Liberal Unionism was confirmed at the 1892 general election when, William Jones, a self-made Birmingham draper who had a small estate in Cardiganshire and was a member of the [[Cardiganshire County Council]] ran with the support of Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain had sponsored a number of Nonconformist unionist candidates in Wales in the hope of capitalising upon perceived antipathy towards Irish Nationalism. Despite spending heavily and producing a farmer evicted at the 1868 Election on his platform, Jones was heavily defeated by Bowen Rowlands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=324\u20135}}</ref> Rowlands served until 1895.\n\nOnce Rowlands's intention not to stand again was known, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]] of [[Tan-y-Bwlch, Aberystwyth|Tan-y-Bwlch]], who had been the Conservative candidate in the seat in 1885, but who had subsequently joined the Liberal Party, emerged as a contender for the nomination and was eventually chosen by a delegate conference, defeating [[John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids|Wynford Phillips]] by 160 votes to 111.<ref name=\"AO 4-7-95 LibCand\">{{cite news|title=Representation of Cardiganshire.

His closest electoral call came in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|'Khaki election' of 1900]] when he had a majority of 781 (9.4%) over [[J.C. Harford]] of Falcondale. Thereafter, Vaughan Davies was comfortably returned at each election but the vitality of the Liberal Association was in serious decline. During this time the ''Cambrian News'' had tempered its opposition to him and grudgingly admitted that Vaughan-Davies had won friends and supporteres by his adherence to Liberal policies.<ref name=\"CN 27-10-00 edit\">{{cite news|title=The Two Cardiganshire Candidates (editorial)|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3317276/ART27|accessdate=27 October 2014|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=5 October 1900}}</ref>\n\nBy 1914 the Liberal Association was heavily dependent on Vaughan Davies's role as treasurer to keep it going. In the meantime, Vaughan Davies remained on poor terms with prominent Liberals, including [[John Gibson (editor and journalist)|John Gibson]], editor of the ''Cambrian News'' until his death in 1915.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=328\u20139}}</ref>\n\nLike most Welsh Liberals, he supported [[David Lloyd George]] in the split in the Liberal Party, and not [[H. H. Asquith]], and was therefore returned unopposed as a Coalition Liberal in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]].\n\n===Liberal infighting (1921\u20131950)===\nIn many ways the Liberals had become the new elite in Cardiganshire by the time of the First World War. This was demonstrated in 1919 when [[John Humphreys Davies]], the nonconformist squire of Cwrtmawr, was appointed Principal of the University College, Aberystwyth, at the expense of [[Thomas Jones (T. J.)|Thomas Jones]], who was championed by Lord Davies of Llandinam, grandson of [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|page=330}}</ref>\n\nWith Vaughan Davies known to be a supporter of Lloyd George, it was natural that Lloyd George looked to him to boost his support in the [[House of Lords]] and awarded him a peerage in the New Years' Honours list in 1921. Although he would have preferred to be called 'Lord Ceredigion', the Garter King of Arms refused this as an inappropriate title for a Baron, and so Vaughan Davies took his title from the [[River Ystwyth]] which ran past his home. The peerage created a vacancy in a historically Liberal seat and the Asquithites decided to take the Lloyd Georgeites on in their 'backyard' in what became a memorable [[1921 Cardiganshire by-election|by-election]].\n\n[[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], who asserted on his election posters that he was 'THE Liberal candidate', was a Barrister from Aberystwyth and had been Private Secretary to Lloyd George himself, and therefore had the blessing of the Coalition and official support from the Conservatives. A number of possible Asquithian Liberal candidates were approached to contest the seat against Evans and eventually the choice fell upon [[W. Llewelyn Williams]] who was sponsored by the Asquithite 'Welsh Liberal Federation'. No other candidate stood and in the straight fight, Evans won with a majority of 3,590 (14.6%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=332\u20135}}</ref>\n\nEvans held on as a 'National Liberal' (as Lloyd George's supporters called themselves) in the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] but with a slim majority of 515 votes (2.0%) over [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]].\n\nThe sudden shotgun merger of the two factions in the Liberal Party led to Evans getting the official approval of the unified party for the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]]. However, the Conservatives decided to fight and this deprived him of their votes. Hopkin Morris decided to fight again as an unofficial Liberal and won with a 5,078 vote majority. Hopkin Morris was lucky to survive the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], a disaster for the Liberals, by being returned unopposed.\n\nThe first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate stood against [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] and polled 24% of the vote in a straight fight against Morris, who had a 13,752 (52.0%) majority.\n\nIn 1932, Morris left Parliament temporarily (he was later to return as MP for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]]) when he was appointed as a Metropolitan Police magistrate. The byelection on 22 September 1932 saw the first three-way fight between the parties, but was won by [[Owen Evans (politician)|Owen Evans]] for the Liberals. Like many of the Liberal MPs he had been a barrister. Evans died shortly before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], but the seat was easily held by his successor [[Roderic Bowen]]. Unusually the Labour vote actually fell in percentage terms compared with the previous election despite the Labour landslide in the country at large.\n\n===Labour challenge (1950\u20131972)===\nLabour established itself as the main challenger to the Liberals at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] in a three-way contest, and the Conservatives opted out of the contest thereafter until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. This was partly a move to keep the seat from going Labour. [[Plaid Cymru]] first fought the seat in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] and kept their deposit (just, with 12.8% of the vote).\n\nWith a four-way contest involving the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru at the 1964 general election, and a national swing to Labour, Roderic Bowen suffered a precipitate decline in his share of the vote to only 38.4%; he was re-elected with a majority of 2,219 (7.4%) over Labour. After the death of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] in 1965, Bowen accepted the offer to become a Deputy Speaker, which prevented him from speaking on behalf of his constituency. For the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]], Labour selected [[Elystan Morgan]] who had been a member of Plaid Cymru until 1964; with a further national swing and Morgan making a credible bid for the Welsh-speaking vote, Labour won the seat by 523 votes.\n\n===1974 onwards===\nIn boundary changes in 1983, the constituency was merged with a northern area of [[Pembrokeshire]] and also took a Welsh version of its name, becoming known as [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]].\n\nCeredigion was recreated for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] as it reverted to its former borders, having lost the part of North Pembrokeshire in boundary changes.\n\nMark Williams, first elected in 2005, was the first non-Welsh speaking Member of Parliament elected to represent the constituency since Bowen Rowlands (MP from 1886 until 1892, who declared at a meeting in Aberystwyth when adopted as candidate that he could not speak Welsh).<ref>{{cite news|title=The County Election|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3301595/ART95|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=3 July 1886}}</ref> At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], he received a massive increase in his vote, polling over 50% of the votes cast and raising his majority from 219 to 8,324 over the Plaid Cymru candidate, Penri James.\n\nIn [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], Williams suffered a decline of over 14% in his vote share, in common with other Liberal Democrat incumbents across the UK. However, after a campaign which made national headlines due to prior controversial comments by both the Plaid Cymru<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32227229|title=Election 2015: 'Baptism of fire' for Plaid candidate|date=9 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and Labour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32249455|title=Election 2015: Candidate suggested cars be damaged|date=10 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> candidates, Plaid Cymru were unable to capitalise as their vote share went down slightly. The Conservative vote also declined, while UKIP, Labour and the Greens all improved on their 2010 performance. Williams retained the seat to become the only Liberal Democrat MP in Wales, and one of only eight across the UK.\n\nIn [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], Williams lost his seat to [[Ben Lake]] by 104 votes (0.2%). Labour moved from fifth to third in the seat and were roughly 3,000 votes behind Williams and Lake, their best result in Ceredigion since 1997, and the Tories fell to fourth but increased their vote by more than 3,000. The 29.2% won by Plaid Cymru in 2017 was the lowest winning vote share of the election and the only seat won with less than 30% of the vote. At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]] Lake substantially increased both his majority and vote share, with the Liberal Democrats falling to third place.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1541\u20131640===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1541\u20131543|| [[Morgan ap Rice ap Philip]]\n|-\n|1543\u20131544|| [[Thomas Gynns]]\n|-\n|1545\u20131547|| [[David ap Llewellin Lloid of Llan Dissill]]\n|-\n|1547|| [[William Devereux (MP)|William Devereux]]\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1555|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1558|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1563|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1571|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1584|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1586|| [[Griffith Lloyd]]\n|-\n|1588|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1593|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1597|| [[Thomas Pryse]]\n|-\n|1601|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1604\u20131611|| [[John Lewis (of Abernant)|Sir John Lewis]]\n|-\n|1614\u20131622|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Sir Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1625\u20131629|| [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n|-\n|1629\u20131640|| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n===MPs after 1640===\n\n'''[[Short Parliament]]'''\n*1640: [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n\n'''[[Long Parliament]]'''\n* 1640\u20131644: [[Walter Lloyd]] ([[Cavalier|Royalist]]) \u2013 ''disabled to sit, 5 February 1644''\n* 1646\u20131648: [[Sir Richard Pryse, 1st Baronet]] \u2013 ''excluded in [[Pride's Purge]], December 1648''\n\n''Cardiganshire was unrepresented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n\n'''[[First Protectorate Parliament]]'''\n*1654\u20131655: [[James Philipps|Col.

Since 2015, the two also compete in the Palmetto Series, which is an athletic, head-to-head competition between both schools, not just in football, but also more than a dozen competitions throughout each school year. Both institutions are public universities supported by the state of [[South Carolina]], and their campuses are separated by only 132 miles. USC and Clemson have been bitter rivals since 1896, and a heated rivalry continues to this day for a variety of reasons, including the historic tensions regarding their respective charters and the passions surrounding their athletic programs.\n\nMuch like the [[Alabama\u2013Auburn football rivalry|Alabama\u2013Auburn Rivalry]], the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|Georgia-Georgia Tech Rivalry]], the [[Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry]] and the [[Carolina-State rivalry|North Carolina-NC State Rivalry]], the Clemson\u2013South Carolina rivalry is an in-state collegiate rivalry. This is one of a handful of rivalries where the teams are in different premier conferences: South Carolina is in the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC); Clemson is in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theacc.com/#!/|title=Atlantic Coast Conference - Official Athletics Site|website=www.theacc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/SECSports/Home.aspx|title=Southeastern Conference|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince 1960, the game has been held in late November, usually on [[American football on Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving]] weekend.

The opening salvo was fired by Gideon Lee, the father of Clemson's granddaughter and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s great granddaughter Floride Isabella Lee, who wrote a letter on her behalf to the ''News and Courier'' in May that she was being denied as Calhoun's rightful heir.<ref name=\"Cooperp164\">{{Harvnb | Cooper | 2005 | page = 164}}</ref>  Furthermore, he stated that Clemson was egotistical and \"only wanted to erect a monument to his own name.\"<ref name=\"Cooperp164\"/>  In November, Lee filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to contest the will which ultimately ruled against him in May 1889.\n\nThe [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1888|election of 1888]] afforded Tillman an opportunity to convince the politicians to accept the Clemson bequest or face the possibility of being voted out of office.  He demanded that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] nominate its candidates by the [[Primary election|primary system]], which was denied, but they did accept his request that the candidates for statewide office [[Canvassing|canvass]] the state.<ref name=\"HollisIIp151\">{{Harvnb | Hollis | 1956 | page = 151}}</ref>  Tillman proved excellent on the stump, by far superior to his Conservative opponents, and as the Democratic convention neared there was a clear groundswell of support for the acceptance of Clemson's estate.<ref>{{Harvnb | Cooper | 2005 | page = 163}}</ref>\n\n===Clemson's Bequest barely wins support===\nTillman explained his justification for an independently controlled agriculture college by pointing to the mismanagement and political interference of the University of South Carolina as had occurred during Reconstruction.  The agriculture college, as specified in Clemson's will, was to be privately controlled. With declining cotton prices, Tillman played upon the farmer's desperation by stating that the salaries of the college professors were exorbitant and it must be a sign of corruption.<ref>{{Harvnb | Ball | 1932 | page = 209}}</ref>  Consequently, the legislature was compelled to pass the bill to accept Clemson's bequest in December 1888, albeit with the tie-breaking vote in the [[South Carolina Senate|state Senate]] from [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|Lieutenant Governor]] [[William L.

He saved the coup de gr\u00e2ce for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Wade Hampton III]], a South Carolina College graduate and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General during the Civil War, who \"invoked Confederate service and honor as a barrier to Tillmanism.\"<ref name=\"Cooperp206\">{{Harvnb | Cooper | 2005 | page = 206}}</ref>  Tillman directed the legislature to defeat Hampton's renomination for another term in December 1890.<ref name=\"Cooperp206\"/><ref>{{Harvnb | Hollis | 1956 | page = 157}}</ref>\n\nWhile campaigning for governor in 1890, Tillman leveled his harshest criticism towards the University of South Carolina and threatened to close it along with [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]], which he called a \"[[Dude#history|dude]] factory.\"<ref>{{Harvnb | Edgar | 1998 | pages = 437, 439}}</ref>  Despite the rhetoric, Tillman only succeeded in reorganizing the University of South Carolina into a liberal arts college while in office.<ref>{{Harvnb | Edgar | 1998 | page = 439}}</ref>  It would eventually be rechartered for the last time in 1906 as the University of South Carolina.

In that first season as the Gamecocks, Carolina defeated a highly favored Clemson team coached by the legendary [[John Heisman]] 12\u20136.  But it was the full-scale riot that broke out in the wake of the game that is remembered most.\n\n\"The Carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail,\" Jay McCormick said.  \"Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance.  After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they are your rival, they're going to do exactly what you told them not to do.\"<ref name=\"Metrobeat.Net\">[http://metrobeat.net/gbase/Expedite/Content?oid=oid%3A1647 Metrobeat.Net<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030722040816/http://metrobeat.net/gbase/Expedite/Content?oid=oid%3A1647 |date=July 22, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nAs expected, another brawl broke out before both sides agreed to mutually burn the poster in an effort to defuse tensions. The immediate aftermath resulted in the stoppage of the rivalry until 1909. The Carolina\u2013Clemson game has been played every year since.\n\n[[File:Clemson-South Carolina game 1911-4 (Taps 1912).png|thumb|Action in the 1911 Clemson\u2013USC football game]]\n\n===World War II era===\n[[World War II]] produced one of the most bizarre situations in the history of the rivalry.  Cary Cox, a football player of the victorious Clemson squad in 1942, signed up for the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] in 1943 and was placed at USC.  The naval instructors at USC ordered him to play on the football team and he was named the captain for the Big Thursday game against Clemson.  Cox was reluctant to play against his former teammates and he voiced his concerns to coach Lt. James P. Moran who responded, \"Cox, I can't promise you'll get a Navy commission if you play Thursday, but I can damn well promise that you won't get one if you don't play.\"<ref>{{Harvnb | Lesesne | 2001 | page = 27}}</ref>  Cox then went out and led the Carolina team to a 33\u20136 win against Clemson.  He returned to Clemson after the war and captained the 1947 team in a losing effort to Carolina, but Cox earned his place in history as the only player to captain both schools' football teams.\n\n===Modern era \u2013 Post World War II===\n'''1946: Near riot \u2013 counterfeit tickets'''<br>\nThe 1946 game could be the most chaotic in the football series.  Two New York mobsters printed counterfeit tickets for the game. Fans from both sides were denied entrance when the duplicate tickets were discovered, which led to a near riot. To add to the wild scene, a Clemson fan strangled a live chicken at midfield during halftime.  Fans from both sides of the rivalry, many of whom who had been denied entrance, along with fans who poured out of the stands, stormed the fences and gates and spilled onto the field. It took U.S. Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]], who attended the game along with then-Governor-elect [[Strom Thurmond]], to settle down the hostile crowd.  Once order was restored, fans were allowed to stand along the sidelines, with the teams, while the second half was played to the game's conclusion. The Gamecocks eventually won by a score of 26\u201314.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19571023&id=DJQzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=neoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3093,3010339 | work=Miami Herald | title=Tigers-Gamecocks in annual classic | date=October 23, 1957}}</ref>\n\n'''1952: Game mandated by South Carolina law'''<br>\nThe Southern Conference (SoCon) almost brought the longstanding rivalry to an abrupt end when it ordered Clemson to play no other league team other than Maryland as punishment for both schools accepting bowl bids against conference rules (both Clemson and USC were members at the time). Upon request of both schools' presidents, the S.C. General Assembly passed a resolution on February 27, 1952, ordering the game to be played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetandd.com/news/opinion/article_07801204-17bd-11e1-b54b-001cc4c03286.html|title=No law needed to require rivals to play big game|author=T&D Staff|work=The Times and Democrat|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref> The Gamecocks won the contest 6\u20130.

This year would mark the end of the tradition as the rivalry progressed to a home-and-home series played on a Saturday. However, the two schools would not move the contest to the last regular season game until two years later. Clemson won the final Big Thursday match-up 27\u20130.\n\n'''1961: The Prank'''<br>\nIn 1961, the USC fraternity [[Sigma Nu]] pulled what some have called the greatest prank in the rivalry's history.  A few minutes before Clemson football players entered the field for pre-game warm ups, a group of Sigma Nu fraternity members ran onto the field, jumping up and down and cheering in football uniforms that resembled the ones worn by the Tigers.  This caused the Clemson band to start playing \"Tiger Rag,\" which was followed by the pranksters falling down as they attempted to do calisthenics.  They would also do football drills where guys would drop passes and miss the ball when trying to kick it.  Clemson fans quickly realized that they had been tricked, and some of them angrily ran onto the field.  However, security restored order before any blows could be exchanged. The Carolina frat boys had also acquired a sickly cow they planned to bring out during halftime to be the \"Clemson Homecoming Queen\", but the cow died en route to the stadium. Carolina won the game 21\u201314.\n\n'''1963: National tragedy moves game'''<br>\nOn November 23, 1963, the Tigers and Gamecocks were set to play the annual rivalry on live national TV. However, the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] the day before would affect the scheduling of the game. Both schools planned to proceed with the original day and time, but federal government pressure caused the schools to push the game to November 28, marking the only time Clemson and Carolina played on Thanksgiving Day. Clemson won the game 24\u201320.\n\n'''1975: Most points scored by Carolina'''<br>\nOn November 22, 1975, Carolina defeated Clemson 56\u201320 to set a Gamecock record for most points scored in a football game against the Tigers.\n\n'''1977: \"The Catch\"'''<br>\nOn November 19, 1977, Clemson WR [[Jerry Butler (American football)|Jerry Butler]] made a diving, backwards, 20-yard touchdown reception on a pass from QB [[Steve Fuller (American football)|Steve Fuller]] with 49 seconds left in the fourth quarter to give Clemson the 31\u201327 victory in Columbia.

In a surprise to both the players and the fans, Coach [[Danny Ford]] unveiled new orange uniform pants for the Tigers to wear. This was the first time in Clemson's history that they wore orange pants in any combination for a football game. Inspired by the pants, the underdog Tigers defeated the Gamecocks, 27\u20136.\n\n'''1981: Clemson wins a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|National Championship]]'''<br>\nIn 1981, [[1981 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] defeated Carolina 29\u201313 en route to the National Championship.\n\n'''1984: Black Magic'''<br>\nCarolina took their 9\u20131 record on the road to Clemson, and fell behind 21\u20133 to the Tigers. With about three minutes remaining in the game, Gamecock QB Mike Hold led an eight-play 86-yard touchdown drive and, thanks to a Clemson penalty that allowed a re-kick of a missed extra point, defeated the Tigers 22\u201321 to finish the first 10-win season in program history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecolumbiastar.com/news/2011-11-18/Sports/Gamecock_84_win_made_season_even_more_special.html|title=Gamecock '84 win made season even more special|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''1989: Orange on the road and Ford's last hurrah'''<br>\nAfter suffering two disappointing upsets to Duke and Georgia Tech, the 8\u20132 Tigers traveled to Columbia for the annual game.

Gamecock RB [[Brandon Bennett]] received the kick to start the third quarter, took a few steps, then turned and threw a backward pass to the other side of the field which was caught by DB Reggie Richardson who returned the ball 85 yards to the Tigers' 6-yard line. Bennett ran it in for a touchdown on the next play, putting Carolina ahead 21\u20137 and the Gamecocks never looked back, going on to win the game 33\u20137 and clinching a bid to the Carquest Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/south_carolina/flashback/|title=A Step Ahead|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''2000: \"The Catch II\"/\"The Push-off\"'''<br>\nIn 2000, Trailing late in the game 14\u201313, Clemson quarterback [[Woody Dantzler]] connected with wide-receiver [[Rod Gardner]] for a 50-yard reception to Carolina's 8-yard line with 10 seconds remaining.

Clemson fans remember this game as \"The Catch II\" while Carolina fans call it \"The Push-Off Game\".\n\n'''2001: A bicentennial win'''<br>\nIn the 200th year of the University of South Carolina, the Gamecocks hosted the Tigers at the end of a successful regular season that saw them ranked in the Top 25 every week and 7\u20133 heading into the rivalry game. Carolina jumped out to an early 20\u20139 lead behind a strong ground attack, and held on to win 20\u201315 and secure a bid to their second straight Outback Bowl. Because of the September 11 attacks, this was not the final regular season game for Clemson. The Tigers rescheduled their September 15 game (Vs. Duke) for the first weekend of December. \n\n'''2003: Most points scored by Clemson'''<br>\nIn 2003, Clemson defeated Carolina 63\u201317 to set the record for the most points scored by either team in the series.\n\n'''2004: The Brawl'''<br>\nThe [[South Carolina-Clemson brawl]] during the 2004 football game is the most recent eruption of hostilities in this rivalry.  It is also the last time [[Lou Holtz]] coached, having retired shortly thereafter.  Clemson won the game 29\u20137.  Each team had won a total of six games that year, making them technically bowl eligible.  However, both schools withdrew from bowl consideration because of the unsportsmanlike nature of the fight.\n\n'''2005: A quarterback wins 4'''<br>\nIn 2005, the two teams showed an unusual gesture of sportsmanship by meeting at midfield before the game to shake hands, putting the melee of 2004 behind them.  Clemson won this game 13\u20139, leaving the Tiger's quarterback, [[Charlie Whitehurst]], undefeated against USC in his 4 years at Clemson. The only Carolina quarterback to do so against the Tigers was Tommy Suggs, who led the Gamecocks to three victories in a row from 1968 to 1970.\n\n'''2006: Kickers make the difference'''<br>\nClemson was leading 28\u201314 in the third quarter, with Carolina quarterback [[Blake Mitchell (American football)|Blake Mitchell]] throwing three interceptions. The Gamecocks then scored 17 unanswered points, including two Mike Davis touchdown runs and a 35-yard field goal from [[Ryan Succop]] \u2013 the only points in the fourth quarter \u2013 to give the Gamecocks a 31\u201328 lead. Clemson kicker Jad Dean missed a field goal attempt wide left as time expired to give Carolina the win. This game also marked the moving of the series to the Saturday following Thanksgiving Day.\n\n'''2013: Highest Ranked Meeting'''<br>\nIn the highest-ever ranked matchup between the two teams (Clemson #6, South Carolina #10), the Gamecocks secured their fifth straight victory over the Tigers with a score of 31\u201317. Carolina took advantage of six turnovers by Clemson, including two during punt returns, to secure the victory. The win marked the Gamecocks' longest streak versus Clemson in the rivalry's history. With the win, South Carolina quarterback [[Connor Shaw]] finished his college career unbeaten at Williams-Brice Stadium.\n\n'''2019: Last Meeting'''<br>\nNo. 3 Clemson rolled to its sixth straight win over the Gamecocks, racking up 527 yards to win 38-3. South Carolina only managed 174 yards in the contest. Clemson sophomore quarterback [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]] threw for 295 yards and 3 touchdowns to move the Tigers to 12-0 on the regular season. Lawrence also had 8 carries for 66 yards. The Gamecocks' loss moved them to 4-8 for the season.

The teams previously met four times during the regular season, with two games scheduled at each home field. Two of the games were played on Saturday and Sunday, and then later in the season 2 games were played during the mid-week, usually on Wednesday. Since 2010, the teams have competed against each other over the course of a single weekend: once on each home field and once at a neutral site. [[Fluor Field at the West End]] (2010, 2011, 2013-2019) in [[Greenville, SC]] and Riley Park (2012) in [[Charleston, SC]] have served as the host sites. The other instances where the teams met in neutral site games were the [[2002 College World Series]] and the [[2010 College World Series]], both times at [[Rosenblatt Stadium]] in [[Omaha, NE]]. Both schools are perennially considered to be among the top programs in the country, giving the rivalry a prominent spot in college baseball beyond the state of South Carolina.

The Gamecocks beat their rivals soundly, 12\u20134, and then beat the Tigers again, 10\u20132, the following day to advance to the national championship game. The Gamecocks fell to Texas 12\u20136 in the championship game, the last under the format where a one-game final was played.<ref>[http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/scar/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/07-media-guide South Carolina Baseball Media Guide 2007], p. 111.</ref>\n\n'''2010'''<br>\nEight years later, in what has been called [[2010 College World Series|The Last Bat at Rosenblatt]], an identical situation leading to the series began.  Clemson had taken both on-campus games from South Carolina in the regular season, including a lopsided 19\u20136 victory in the rubber match, played before over 8,000 fans at [[Carolina Stadium]] in Columbia, but had lost in the \"neutral site\" game.  The Gamecocks had just come off a 12-inning win against the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] less than 24 hours before, while the Tigers had two days of rest.  However, fatigue was not a factor as the Gamecocks won the first game, 5\u20131, on a dominating complete game pitching performance by reliever Michael Roth, who had not started a game in more than a year.  Carolina won the second game the following day, 4\u20133, to advance to the championship series against [[2010 UCLA Bruins baseball team|UCLA]], who they defeated, 7\u20131 (Game 1) and 2\u20131 (Game 2) to win the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]].

Students, faculty and fans from the schools band together in an effort to collect blood before the holiday season when many are too busy to give blood. The drive is held from Monday through Friday the week before the football matchup. The University of South Carolina and Clemson University wrapped up their 35th annual blood drive in 2019, resulting in the second consecutive win for Clemson. Carolina now holds an 18\u201317 lead in the yearly competition.\n\nThe 2019 Carolina-Clemson Blood Drive took place on both campuses Nov 18\u201322 with students, staff, faculty and fans showing support for their favorite team by donating blood. This year's event resulted in 4,549 donors presenting to give blood. Carolina support totaled 2,108 donors, while Clemson support totaled 2,441 donors. The blood drive is sponsored by The Blood Connection and [[American Red Cross]] at the University of South Carolina with the help of the University of South Carolina Fraternity and Sorority Council<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sa.sc.edu/fsl/carolina-clemson-blood-drive/|title=Fraternity and Sorority Life - Fraternity and Sorority Life - University of South Carolina|website=www.sa.sc.edu}}</ref> in addition to the Men's Rugby team and the Gamma Lambda chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] national service fraternity at Clemson, and the two schools have collected 153,320 pints of blood over the past thirty five years. Everyone who gives blood receives a free shirt, with the graphic on the back usually featuring a Tiger and Gamecock together and a statement explaining that even though the competition is part of the rivalry, both schools share the common ground of giving blood. It is currently the largest collegiate blood drive in the country.\n\n==Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series==\nOn August 4, 2015, leaders from the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina gathered at the South Carolina State House to announce the launch of the Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series, in which the Tigers and Gamecocks will compete for the Palmetto Series trophy based primarily on head to head athletic competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|title=Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series Announced|access-date=August 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222214/http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following 13 sports will count toward the series: baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball, women's cross country, women's diving, football, men's golf, women's golf, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's tennis, women's tennis, and volleyball. These are all sports that either compete head to head or will face each other in the same tournament or meet. The winning team in each sport (including postseason) earns one point, while a half a point will be awarded if the teams evenly split a series throughout the year (example, if Carolina baseball were to win 2 of 3 from Clemson in the regular season, but Clemson later wins 2 of 3 in postseason play, both teams would be awarded half a point each for splitting their meetings). In the case of a tie in the 2015\u20132016 year, the winner of the schools' annual food drive and the average student athlete GPA will be used for tie breaker.

Since 2015, the two also compete in the Palmetto Series, which is an athletic, head-to-head competition between both schools, not just in football, but also more than a dozen competitions throughout each school year. Both institutions are public universities supported by the state of [[South Carolina]], and their campuses are separated by only 132 miles. USC and Clemson have been bitter rivals since 1896, and a heated rivalry continues to this day for a variety of reasons, including the historic tensions regarding their respective charters and the passions surrounding their athletic programs.\n\nMuch like the [[Alabama\u2013Auburn football rivalry|Alabama\u2013Auburn Rivalry]], the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|Georgia-Georgia Tech Rivalry]], the [[Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry]] and the [[Carolina-State rivalry|North Carolina-NC State Rivalry]], the Clemson\u2013South Carolina rivalry is an in-state collegiate rivalry.

South Carolina holds the \"Tiger Burn\", and Clemson holds a mock funeral for [[Cocky (mascot)|Cocky]]. After seven students\u2014six from South Carolina and one from Clemson\u2014died in the [[Ocean Isle Beach house fire]] in 2007, the Cocky funeral was cancelled and the Tiger Burn was changed to the \"Tiger Tear Down\" for that year.<ref>http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2007/11/14/News/Tiger.Burn.Comes.Under.Fire-3098917.shtml{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/newsroom/articles/2008/november/Black_Friday.php5|title=Clemson students to hold pep rally, Cocky 'funeral'|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2007/11/15/News/Tiger.Burn.Update-3102793.shtml{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Early years: 1896\u20131902===\nWhen Clemson began its football program in 1896, coached by [[Walter Riggs]], they scheduled the rival South Carolina College for a Thursday morning game in conjunction with the State Fair. Carolina won that game 12\u20136 and a new tradition was born \u2013 Big Thursday.  Clemson would win the next four contests (including a 51\u20130 win in 1900, still the largest margin of victory by either team in the series) before the 1st break in the series took place in 1901.\n\nThe Gamecock mascot made its first appearance in 1902.  In that first season as the Gamecocks, Carolina defeated a highly favored Clemson team coached by the legendary [[John Heisman]] 12\u20136.  But it was the full-scale riot that broke out in the wake of the game that is remembered most.\n\n\"The Carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tiger's tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail,\" Jay McCormick said.  \"Naturally, the Clemson guys didn't take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance.  After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and they are your rival, they're going to do exactly what you told them not to do.\"<ref name=\"Metrobeat.Net\">[http://metrobeat.net/gbase/Expedite/Content?oid=oid%3A1647 Metrobeat.Net<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030722040816/http://metrobeat.net/gbase/Expedite/Content?oid=oid%3A1647 |date=July 22, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nAs expected, another brawl broke out before both sides agreed to mutually burn the poster in an effort to defuse tensions. The immediate aftermath resulted in the stoppage of the rivalry until 1909. The Carolina\u2013Clemson game has been played every year since.\n\n[[File:Clemson-South Carolina game 1911-4 (Taps 1912).png|thumb|Action in the 1911 Clemson\u2013USC football game]]\n\n===World War II era===\n[[World War II]] produced one of the most bizarre situations in the history of the rivalry.  Cary Cox, a football player of the victorious Clemson squad in 1942, signed up for the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] in 1943 and was placed at USC.  The naval instructors at USC ordered him to play on the football team and he was named the captain for the Big Thursday game against Clemson.  Cox was reluctant to play against his former teammates and he voiced his concerns to coach Lt. James P. Moran who responded, \"Cox, I can't promise you'll get a Navy commission if you play Thursday, but I can damn well promise that you won't get one if you don't play.\"<ref>{{Harvnb | Lesesne | 2001 | page = 27}}</ref>  Cox then went out and led the Carolina team to a 33\u20136 win against Clemson.  He returned to Clemson after the war and captained the 1947 team in a losing effort to Carolina, but Cox earned his place in history as the only player to captain both schools' football teams.\n\n===Modern era \u2013 Post World War II===\n'''1946: Near riot \u2013 counterfeit tickets'''<br>\nThe 1946 game could be the most chaotic in the football series.  Two New York mobsters printed counterfeit tickets for the game. Fans from both sides were denied entrance when the duplicate tickets were discovered, which led to a near riot. To add to the wild scene, a Clemson fan strangled a live chicken at midfield during halftime.  Fans from both sides of the rivalry, many of whom who had been denied entrance, along with fans who poured out of the stands, stormed the fences and gates and spilled onto the field. It took U.S. Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]], who attended the game along with then-Governor-elect [[Strom Thurmond]], to settle down the hostile crowd.  Once order was restored, fans were allowed to stand along the sidelines, with the teams, while the second half was played to the game's conclusion. The Gamecocks eventually won by a score of 26\u201314.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19571023&id=DJQzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=neoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3093,3010339 | work=Miami Herald | title=Tigers-Gamecocks in annual classic | date=October 23, 1957}}</ref>\n\n'''1952: Game mandated by South Carolina law'''<br>\nThe Southern Conference (SoCon) almost brought the longstanding rivalry to an abrupt end when it ordered Clemson to play no other league team other than Maryland as punishment for both schools accepting bowl bids against conference rules (both Clemson and USC were members at the time). Upon request of both schools' presidents, the S.C.

This year would mark the end of the tradition as the rivalry progressed to a home-and-home series played on a Saturday. However, the two schools would not move the contest to the last regular season game until two years later. Clemson won the final Big Thursday match-up 27\u20130.\n\n'''1961: The Prank'''<br>\nIn 1961, the USC fraternity [[Sigma Nu]] pulled what some have called the greatest prank in the rivalry's history.  A few minutes before Clemson football players entered the field for pre-game warm ups, a group of Sigma Nu fraternity members ran onto the field, jumping up and down and cheering in football uniforms that resembled the ones worn by the Tigers.  This caused the Clemson band to start playing \"Tiger Rag,\" which was followed by the pranksters falling down as they attempted to do calisthenics.  They would also do football drills where guys would drop passes and miss the ball when trying to kick it.  Clemson fans quickly realized that they had been tricked, and some of them angrily ran onto the field.  However, security restored order before any blows could be exchanged. The Carolina frat boys had also acquired a sickly cow they planned to bring out during halftime to be the \"Clemson Homecoming Queen\", but the cow died en route to the stadium. Carolina won the game 21\u201314.\n\n'''1963: National tragedy moves game'''<br>\nOn November 23, 1963, the Tigers and Gamecocks were set to play the annual rivalry on live national TV. However, the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] the day before would affect the scheduling of the game. Both schools planned to proceed with the original day and time, but federal government pressure caused the schools to push the game to November 28, marking the only time Clemson and Carolina played on Thanksgiving Day. Clemson won the game 24\u201320.\n\n'''1975: Most points scored by Carolina'''<br>\nOn November 22, 1975, Carolina defeated Clemson 56\u201320 to set a Gamecock record for most points scored in a football game against the Tigers.\n\n'''1977: \"The Catch\"'''<br>\nOn November 19, 1977, Clemson WR [[Jerry Butler (American football)|Jerry Butler]] made a diving, backwards, 20-yard touchdown reception on a pass from QB [[Steve Fuller (American football)|Steve Fuller]] with 49 seconds left in the fourth quarter to give Clemson the 31\u201327 victory in Columbia.

In a surprise to both the players and the fans, Coach [[Danny Ford]] unveiled new orange uniform pants for the Tigers to wear. This was the first time in Clemson's history that they wore orange pants in any combination for a football game. Inspired by the pants, the underdog Tigers defeated the Gamecocks, 27\u20136.\n\n'''1981: Clemson wins a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|National Championship]]'''<br>\nIn 1981, [[1981 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] defeated Carolina 29\u201313 en route to the National Championship.\n\n'''1984: Black Magic'''<br>\nCarolina took their 9\u20131 record on the road to Clemson, and fell behind 21\u20133 to the Tigers.

Bennett ran it in for a touchdown on the next play, putting Carolina ahead 21\u20137 and the Gamecocks never looked back, going on to win the game 33\u20137 and clinching a bid to the Carquest Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/south_carolina/flashback/|title=A Step Ahead|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''2000: \"The Catch II\"/\"The Push-off\"'''<br>\nIn 2000, Trailing late in the game 14\u201313, Clemson quarterback [[Woody Dantzler]] connected with wide-receiver [[Rod Gardner]] for a 50-yard reception to Carolina's 8-yard line with 10 seconds remaining.

Clemson fans remember this game as \"The Catch II\" while Carolina fans call it \"The Push-Off Game\".\n\n'''2001: A bicentennial win'''<br>\nIn the 200th year of the University of South Carolina, the Gamecocks hosted the Tigers at the end of a successful regular season that saw them ranked in the Top 25 every week and 7\u20133 heading into the rivalry game. Carolina jumped out to an early 20\u20139 lead behind a strong ground attack, and held on to win 20\u201315 and secure a bid to their second straight Outback Bowl. Because of the September 11 attacks, this was not the final regular season game for Clemson. The Tigers rescheduled their September 15 game (Vs. Duke) for the first weekend of December. \n\n'''2003: Most points scored by Clemson'''<br>\nIn 2003, Clemson defeated Carolina 63\u201317 to set the record for the most points scored by either team in the series.\n\n'''2004: The Brawl'''<br>\nThe [[South Carolina-Clemson brawl]] during the 2004 football game is the most recent eruption of hostilities in this rivalry.  It is also the last time [[Lou Holtz]] coached, having retired shortly thereafter.  Clemson won the game 29\u20137.  Each team had won a total of six games that year, making them technically bowl eligible.  However, both schools withdrew from bowl consideration because of the unsportsmanlike nature of the fight.\n\n'''2005: A quarterback wins 4'''<br>\nIn 2005, the two teams showed an unusual gesture of sportsmanship by meeting at midfield before the game to shake hands, putting the melee of 2004 behind them.  Clemson won this game 13\u20139, leaving the Tiger's quarterback, [[Charlie Whitehurst]], undefeated against USC in his 4 years at Clemson. The only Carolina quarterback to do so against the Tigers was Tommy Suggs, who led the Gamecocks to three victories in a row from 1968 to 1970.\n\n'''2006: Kickers make the difference'''<br>\nClemson was leading 28\u201314 in the third quarter, with Carolina quarterback [[Blake Mitchell (American football)|Blake Mitchell]] throwing three interceptions. The Gamecocks then scored 17 unanswered points, including two Mike Davis touchdown runs and a 35-yard field goal from [[Ryan Succop]] \u2013 the only points in the fourth quarter \u2013 to give the Gamecocks a 31\u201328 lead. Clemson kicker Jad Dean missed a field goal attempt wide left as time expired to give Carolina the win. This game also marked the moving of the series to the Saturday following Thanksgiving Day.\n\n'''2013: Highest Ranked Meeting'''<br>\nIn the highest-ever ranked matchup between the two teams (Clemson #6, South Carolina #10), the Gamecocks secured their fifth straight victory over the Tigers with a score of 31\u201317. Carolina took advantage of six turnovers by Clemson, including two during punt returns, to secure the victory. The win marked the Gamecocks' longest streak versus Clemson in the rivalry's history. With the win, South Carolina quarterback [[Connor Shaw]] finished his college career unbeaten at Williams-Brice Stadium.\n\n'''2019: Last Meeting'''<br>\nNo. 3 Clemson rolled to its sixth straight win over the Gamecocks, racking up 527 yards to win 38-3. South Carolina only managed 174 yards in the contest. Clemson sophomore quarterback [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]] threw for 295 yards and 3 touchdowns to move the Tigers to 12-0 on the regular season. Lawrence also had 8 carries for 66 yards. The Gamecocks' loss moved them to 4-8 for the season.

The teams previously met four times during the regular season, with two games scheduled at each home field. Two of the games were played on Saturday and Sunday, and then later in the season 2 games were played during the mid-week, usually on Wednesday. Since 2010, the teams have competed against each other over the course of a single weekend: once on each home field and once at a neutral site. [[Fluor Field at the West End]] (2010, 2011, 2013-2019) in [[Greenville, SC]] and Riley Park (2012) in [[Charleston, SC]] have served as the host sites. The other instances where the teams met in neutral site games were the [[2002 College World Series]] and the [[2010 College World Series]], both times at [[Rosenblatt Stadium]] in [[Omaha, NE]]. Both schools are perennially considered to be among the top programs in the country, giving the rivalry a prominent spot in college baseball beyond the state of South Carolina.

The Gamecocks beat their rivals soundly, 12\u20134, and then beat the Tigers again, 10\u20132, the following day to advance to the national championship game. The Gamecocks fell to Texas 12\u20136 in the championship game, the last under the format where a one-game final was played.<ref>[http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/scar/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/07-media-guide South Carolina Baseball Media Guide 2007], p. 111.</ref>\n\n'''2010'''<br>\nEight years later, in what has been called [[2010 College World Series|The Last Bat at Rosenblatt]], an identical situation leading to the series began.  Clemson had taken both on-campus games from South Carolina in the regular season, including a lopsided 19\u20136 victory in the rubber match, played before over 8,000 fans at [[Carolina Stadium]] in Columbia, but had lost in the \"neutral site\" game.  The Gamecocks had just come off a 12-inning win against the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] less than 24 hours before, while the Tigers had two days of rest.  However, fatigue was not a factor as the Gamecocks won the first game, 5\u20131, on a dominating complete game pitching performance by reliever Michael Roth, who had not started a game in more than a year.  Carolina won the second game the following day, 4\u20133, to advance to the championship series against [[2010 UCLA Bruins baseball team|UCLA]], who they defeated, 7\u20131 (Game 1) and 2\u20131 (Game 2) to win the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]].

Students, faculty and fans from the schools band together in an effort to collect blood before the holiday season when many are too busy to give blood. The drive is held from Monday through Friday the week before the football matchup. The University of South Carolina and Clemson University wrapped up their 35th annual blood drive in 2019, resulting in the second consecutive win for Clemson. Carolina now holds an 18\u201317 lead in the yearly competition.\n\nThe 2019 Carolina-Clemson Blood Drive took place on both campuses Nov 18\u201322 with students, staff, faculty and fans showing support for their favorite team by donating blood. This year's event resulted in 4,549 donors presenting to give blood. Carolina support totaled 2,108 donors, while Clemson support totaled 2,441 donors. The blood drive is sponsored by The Blood Connection and [[American Red Cross]] at the University of South Carolina with the help of the University of South Carolina Fraternity and Sorority Council<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sa.sc.edu/fsl/carolina-clemson-blood-drive/|title=Fraternity and Sorority Life - Fraternity and Sorority Life - University of South Carolina|website=www.sa.sc.edu}}</ref> in addition to the Men's Rugby team and the Gamma Lambda chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] national service fraternity at Clemson, and the two schools have collected 153,320 pints of blood over the past thirty five years. Everyone who gives blood receives a free shirt, with the graphic on the back usually featuring a Tiger and Gamecock together and a statement explaining that even though the competition is part of the rivalry, both schools share the common ground of giving blood. It is currently the largest collegiate blood drive in the country.\n\n==Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series==\nOn August 4, 2015, leaders from the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina gathered at the South Carolina State House to announce the launch of the Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series, in which the Tigers and Gamecocks will compete for the Palmetto Series trophy based primarily on head to head athletic competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|title=Certified SC Grown Palmetto Series Announced|access-date=August 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923222214/http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=210250309&SPID=103723&SPSID=658250|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following 13 sports will count toward the series: baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball, women's cross country, women's diving, football, men's golf, women's golf, men's soccer, women's soccer, men's tennis, women's tennis, and volleyball. These are all sports that either compete head to head or will face each other in the same tournament or meet. The winning team in each sport (including postseason) earns one point, while a half a point will be awarded if the teams evenly split a series throughout the year (example, if Carolina baseball were to win 2 of 3 from Clemson in the regular season, but Clemson later wins 2 of 3 in postseason play, both teams would be awarded half a point each for splitting their meetings). In the case of a tie in the 2015\u20132016 year, the winner of the schools' annual food drive and the average student athlete GPA will be used for tie breaker.

Her works have been shown at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago.\n\nShe began her studies at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which also continued as she pursued her [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees. She has taught art at the college level.\n\nShe made [[Henri Matisse]]-inspired paintings of mothers and children in the 1960s. During that decade, she owned a gallery in Indianapolis. Her art changed markedly in the 1970s when she shifted to performance and other forms of art, as well as how women are depicted in art. Her studies of philosophy and psychology greatly influenced her art, both in terms of content and medium. Important works of the early 1970s are representations of goddesses, ''Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper'', where the faces of the disciples are replaced with noted women artists, and ''Story Gathering Boxes''. She was a figure in the feminist art movement in Washington, D.C. and active in the [[civil rights movement]]. She worked to increase the rate at which works of art by women are among museum collections.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Early life and education===\nMary Beth Edelson was born Mary Elizabeth Johnson in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], in 1933.<ref name=\"Marter p. 136\" /> She was the eldest of three children born to Mary Lou and A.

In March 2018 the entirety of Edelson's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] loft was digitally archived by The Feminist Institute (TFI), an online repository for feminist artwork overseen by [[Hunter College]].<ref name=\"Observer\" />\n\nMoMA PS1's 2015 survey show ''Greater New York'' included the artist's life-size monument to [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]], who famously castrated her abusive husband in 1993. The sculpture, titled ''Kali Bobbitt'' (1994), reimagines Bobbitt as the warrior goddess [[Kali]], mounted on a [[ziggurat]] plinth, adorned with knives, and grasping a severed penis.<ref name=\"MoMA\" /> Edelson explains:\n\n{{quote|text=My interest in Bobbitt is obviously a feminist one\u2014I had a point of view about it immediately and wanted to examine and express that. I started thinking of her as Saint Bobbitt because she really did something for all women: She retaliated. In addition to the book, I\u2019ve also created a lot of other drawings and a sculpture of a Kali figure that I made out of a mannequin. She has a number of arms and a girdle of knives around her waist as well as a bracelet of severed penises around her arm. In short, she is decorated. I first exhibited the work at Combat Zone and put this very dramatic lighting on it. It sums up my feelings about the Bobbitt situation, a situation that I feel the same way about today as when I first heard about it\u2014I thought it was really funny. As someone once said: A hundred ten million women worldwide are survivors of [[Genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]], and then there is just [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|John Bobbitt]]\u2013\u2013one man, one name.|author=Mary Beth Edelson<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n\nIn March 2017 Edelson's 1973 hand-painted silver gelatin prints\u2013\u2013collectively titled ''Woman Rising\u2013\u2013''were exhibited in the show ''The Devil Giving Birth to the Patriarchy'' at David Lewis Gallery. This was the first exhibition to focus on the series, selections from which were later presented at Frieze London in a new section curated by [[Alison M. Gingeras|Alison Gingeras]] titled ''Sex Work: Feminist Art & Politics''.<ref name=\"Frieze\" /> The ''Woman Rising''\u2014of a woman \"standing staunchly, feet outspread, arms flung open to the sky, head thrust upwards. It is woman triumphant\" is a motif that appears throughout Edelson's work.<ref name=\"Flander\" />\n\n''The Devil Giving Birth to the Patriarchy'' (2017) also prominently featured Edelson's ''Kali Bobbitt'' sculpture, previously exhibited at MoMA PS1 in 2015.<ref name=\"Art in Am\" />\n\nIn October of the same year, the [[Tate Modern]] accessioned Edelson's ''Selected Wall Collages'' (1972\u20132011). The collages, made between 1972 and 2011, vary in size with the smallest measuring approximately 100 millimeters in height and the largest about one meter in height and width.

Her works have been shown at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago.\n\nShe began her studies at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], which also continued as she pursued her [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees. She has taught art at the college level.\n\nShe made [[Henri Matisse]]-inspired paintings of mothers and children in the 1960s. During that decade, she owned a gallery in Indianapolis. Her art changed markedly in the 1970s when she shifted to performance and other forms of art, as well as how women are depicted in art. Her studies of philosophy and psychology greatly influenced her art, both in terms of content and medium. Important works of the early 1970s are representations of goddesses, ''Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper'', where the faces of the disciples are replaced with noted women artists, and ''Story Gathering Boxes''. She was a figure in the feminist art movement in Washington, D.C. and active in the [[civil rights movement]]. She worked to increase the rate at which works of art by women are among museum collections.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Early life and education===\nMary Beth Edelson was born Mary Elizabeth Johnson in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], in 1933.<ref name=\"Marter p. 136\" /> She was the eldest of three children born to Mary Lou and A.

The two merge in an individual identification with the collective ego: 'Women exploring who \"we are\" and not who \"I am\"'.\"<ref name=\"Lippard\" />\n\nEdelson joined the feminist cooperative gallery, [[A.I.R. Gallery]] (Artists In Residence), which held exhibits of Edelson's work, including ''The Memorial to the 9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era''.

In March 2018 the entirety of Edelson's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] loft was digitally archived by The Feminist Institute (TFI), an online repository for feminist artwork overseen by [[Hunter College]].<ref name=\"Observer\" />\n\nMoMA PS1's 2015 survey show ''Greater New York'' included the artist's life-size monument to [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]], who famously castrated her abusive husband in 1993. The sculpture, titled ''Kali Bobbitt'' (1994), reimagines Bobbitt as the warrior goddess [[Kali]], mounted on a [[ziggurat]] plinth, adorned with knives, and grasping a severed penis.<ref name=\"MoMA\" /> Edelson explains:\n\n{{quote|text=My interest in Bobbitt is obviously a feminist one\u2014I had a point of view about it immediately and wanted to examine and express that. I started thinking of her as Saint Bobbitt because she really did something for all women: She retaliated. In addition to the book, I\u2019ve also created a lot of other drawings and a sculpture of a Kali figure that I made out of a mannequin. She has a number of arms and a girdle of knives around her waist as well as a bracelet of severed penises around her arm. In short, she is decorated. I first exhibited the work at Combat Zone and put this very dramatic lighting on it. It sums up my feelings about the Bobbitt situation, a situation that I feel the same way about today as when I first heard about it\u2014I thought it was really funny. As someone once said: A hundred ten million women worldwide are survivors of [[Genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]], and then there is just [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|John Bobbitt]]\u2013\u2013one man, one name.|author=Mary Beth Edelson<ref name=\":0\" />}}\n\nIn March 2017 Edelson's 1973 hand-painted silver gelatin prints\u2013\u2013collectively titled ''Woman Rising\u2013\u2013''were exhibited in the show ''The Devil Giving Birth to the Patriarchy'' at David Lewis Gallery. This was the first exhibition to focus on the series, selections from which were later presented at Frieze London in a new section curated by [[Alison M. Gingeras|Alison Gingeras]] titled ''Sex Work: Feminist Art & Politics''.<ref name=\"Frieze\" /> The ''Woman Rising''\u2014of a woman \"standing staunchly, feet outspread, arms flung open to the sky, head thrust upwards. It is woman triumphant\" is a motif that appears throughout Edelson's work.<ref name=\"Flander\" />\n\n''The Devil Giving Birth to the Patriarchy'' (2017) also prominently featured Edelson's ''Kali Bobbitt'' sculpture, previously exhibited at MoMA PS1 in 2015.<ref name=\"Art in Am\" />\n\nIn October of the same year, the [[Tate Modern]] accessioned Edelson's ''Selected Wall Collages'' (1972\u20132011). The collages, made between 1972 and 2011, vary in size with the smallest measuring approximately 100 millimeters in height and the largest about one meter in height and width.

In the fifth century, the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the Holy Saturday Vigil to Holy Thursday during a special Mass for that purpose, distinct from the Mass of the Lord's Supper. In the decree renewing this rite [[Pope Paul VI]] said:\u201cThe Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop\u2019s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.\u201d<ref name=Baltimore/>\n[[File:BlessingChrism.jpg|thumb|Blessing Chrism]]\nThe Holy Oils are:\n* [[Chrism]] \u2013 used in the sacraments of [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation in the Catholic Church|Confirmation]] and [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|Holy Orders]], as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches.<ref>[http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/Events/2017/album-chrismmass.aspx \"Chrism Mass 2017\", St. James Cathedral, Seattle, April 6, 2017]</ref>\n* the [[oil of catechumens]] \u2013 also used in the sacrament of Baptism, and\n* the oil of the sick \u2013 used in the rite of the [[Anointing of the Sick]]\n\nThe oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming [[Holy Saturday]] at the [[Easter Vigil]], for the [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]] of those entering the church. While the Oil of the Catechumens and the Oil of the Sick, are simply \"blessed,\" the Sacred Chrism is \"consecrated,\". Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam, an aromatic resin. Balsam is poured into the oil, which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the \"odor of sanctity\" to which those who are marked with it, are called to strive. The bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism, a gesture which symbolizes the Holy Spirit coming down to consecrate this oil, and recalls the actions of Jesus in John 20:22, when he breathed on the apostles and said, \"Receive the Holy Spirit...\"<ref name=Jalbert/><ref name=Baltimore>[https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm \"Chrism Mass\", ''Catholic Review'', Archdiocese of Baltimore, March 27, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413153522/https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm |date=13 April 2017 }}</ref>\n\nWith respect to Anglicanism, the 1979 [[Book of Common Prayer]] (p.&nbsp;307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. During the Chrism Eucharist, the Bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing. In addition, the Bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their Ordination Vows.<ref name=Tennessee/>\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\n====Eastern Orthodoxy====\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|left|Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[liturgical colour]]s are brighter, white being common. On this day alone during Holy Week, the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil.\n\nThe primary service of this day is [[Vespers]] combined with the [[Liturgy of St. Basil|Liturgy of St. Basil the Great]] at which is read the first Passion Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1}}), known as the \"Gospel of the Testament\", and many of the normal hymns of the Divine Liturgy are substituted with the following [[troparion]]:\n\n<blockquote>''Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant; for I will not speak of Thy [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] to Thine enemies, neither will I give Thee a kiss like Judas. But like the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Thief]] will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy [[Paradise|Kingdom]].''</blockquote>\n\nWhen necessary to replenish the [[Church tabernacle#Reserved sacrament|sacrament for communing the sick at a time not following a divine liturgy]], an additional [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb (Host)]] is consecrated on this day, [[Intinction#Eastern Christianity|intincted]], covered, and left to dry until Holy Saturday when it is divided, completely dried with a candle flame, and the pieces placed in the [[Church tabernacle#Communion for the Sick|artophorion]].\n\nIn [[cathedral]]s and [[monasteries]] the ceremony of the [[Washing of Feet]] is normally performed.\n\nWhen there is need to [[consecrate]] more [[chrism]], that is performed by patriarchs and other heads of the various [[autocephalous]] churches.\n\n[[File:Passion Gospels - Great Thursday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2015.JPG|right|thumb| Reading of the 12th Passion Gospel on Great and Holy Thursday]]\nIn the evening, after the Liturgy, all of the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] are changed to black or some other dark colour, to signify the beginning of the Passion. Anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the '''Twelve Gospels''' is conducted. In these readings Christ's last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ's prayer, and his new commandment. The twelve readings are:\n* John 13:31\u201318:1\n* John 18:1\u201329\n* Matthew 26:57\u201375\n* John 18:28\u201319:16\n* Matthew 27:3\u201332\n* Mark 15:16\u201332\n* Matthew 27:33\u201354\n* Luke 23:32\u201349\n* John 19:19\u201337\n* Mark 15:43\u201347\n* John 19:38\u201342\n* Matthew 27:62\u201366\nBeginning on Holy and Great Thursday, the [[Memorial service (Orthodox)#Lity|memorial service for the dead]] is forbidden until after [[Thomas Sunday]].\n{{clear}}\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n=====Local customs=====\n* In Greek practice, the [[Sacrament|Mystery]] of [[Unction]] is performed on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] as preparation for the reception of Holy Communion on Great Thursday and Pascha, a custom that originated when Greece was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control and parish priests, being uneducated, were not permitted to hear confession, so this sacrament, by which sins are believed to be forgiven, came to be performed.\n* In Greek tradition, a procession is made during the service of the Twelve Passion Gospels. It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of \"Today He Who Hung\". During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ's body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed.\n* In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ's crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated.\n\n====Oriental Orthodoxy====\n{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}\nOriental Orthodoxy including Coptic (Egyptian) and Ethiopian Orthodoxy which is under papacy of Pope Tawadros II The Copts celebrate Covenant Thursday on 16 April which is 1 week after the Catholics celebrate it. They have praises and vespers every day of week and on Thursday and Saturday they stay praising God and reading about the First Liturgy and Judas\u2019 Betrayal. On Saturday they sing praises for the Entrance of the Messiah in Hades freeing all of the faithful ones including Moses and Abraham etc.\n\n==Customs and names from around the world==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]) washing the feet of children during the Washing of Feet ceremony]]\n* If statues and crucifixes have been covered during Passion Time (the last 2 weeks of Lent, at least in the 1962 Catholic missal), the crucifix covers are allowed to be white instead of purple for Holy Thursday.\n* Maundy Thursday celebrations in the [[United Kingdom]] (also called [[Royal Maundy]]) today involve the [[Monarch]] offering \"alms\" to deserving senior citizens, one man and one woman for each year of the sovereign's age. These coins, known as [[Maundy money]] or Royal Maundy, are distributed in red and white purses, and is a custom dating back to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The red purse contains regular currency and is given in place of food and clothing; the white purse has money in the amount of one penny for each year of the Sovereign's age. Since 1822, rather than ordinary money, the Sovereign gives out [[Maundy money#Maundy coinage|Maundy coins]],<ref>[http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp The Royal Mint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328121720/http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp |date=28 March 2007 }}</ref> which are specially minted 1, 2, 3 and 4 penny pieces, and are legal tender. The service at which this takes place rotates around English and Welsh churches, though in 2008 it took place for the first time in [[Northern Ireland]] at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh Cathedral]]. Until the death of King [[James II of England|James II]], the [[Monarch]] would also wash the feet of the selected poor people. There is an old sketch, done from life, of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] washing people's feet on Maundy Thursday. \n* The popular [[German (language)|German]] name ''Gr\u00fcndonnerstag'' means either \"mourning Thursday\" or \"green Thursday\".<ref>The word is of medieval origin and may refer to the possible use of green vestments on this day in some regions, or to a custom of eating green salad or pancakes (cf. [http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemid=GG26646 Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]). The name could also derive from [[Old High German]] ''gr\u012bnan'' (\"mourn\" or \"wail\", cf. Engl. ''groan''), referring to the death of Jesus or the [[penitent]]s' return to the [[eucharist]] on this day in older times (K. K\u00fcppers, \"Gr\u00fcndonnerstag\", In ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'', vol. IV,, DTV, Munich, 2003).</ref>\n* In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the day is called ''Zelen\u00fd \u010dtvrtek'' or ''Zelen\u00fd \u0161tvrtok'' respectively, again meaning \"Green Thursday\". It is because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the [[church bell]]s until [[Holy Saturday]], here called \"White Saturday\", because \"they have flown to [[Rome]]\" (a euphemism), in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and call the people to the church.\n* The tradition of silent bells is found also in [[Luxembourg]]: the bells fall silent until Easter, because \"they have flown to Rome for Confession\", so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.<ref>Festivals of Western Europe, by Dorothy Gladys Spicer, 1958</ref>\n* In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the day is called ''Witte Donderdag'' (White Thursday) referring to the [[liturgical colour]] of the day.\n* In [[Malta]], Holy Thursday is known as ''\u0126amis ix-Xirka'' (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of [[Seven Churches Visitation|visiting seven churches]] (see below) is called ''is-seba' visti'' or is-Sepulkri.\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Maundy Thursday is ''Dydd Iau Cablyd''.\n* In [[Sweden]] Maundy Thursday (sk\u00e4rtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for easter eggs.\n* In [[Bulgaria]] Maundy Thursday is called ''Veliki Chetvurtuk'' (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for ''Razpeti Petuk'' (Crucifixion Friday), ''Velika Subota'' (Great Saturday) and ''Velikden'' (Easter Day).\n* In [[Kerala]] State in [[India]], the day is called as ''[[Pesaha]]''(\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d38\u0d39), a [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word for [[Passover]]. Maundy Thursday and following Good Friday are observed as statewide public holiday declared by the [[Government of Kerala]], given the high number of Christians in the state.<ref name=\"newindianexpress\">{{cite news |title=Kerala government releases list of holidays for 2019 |url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2018/oct/20/government-releases-list-of-holidays-for-2019-1887493.html |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=The New Indian Express}}</ref> The tradition of consuming ''[[Pesaha appam]]'' or ''Indariyappam'' is customary after special longer [[Holy Qurbana]], which are conducted on the or at midnight till morning in churches of Saint Thomas Christians. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink call ''Pesaha Paal'' made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, ''Pesaha Paal'' a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them.<ref>Sunish George J Alumkalnal, (2013). \"[https://www.nasrani.net/2012/11/11/pesaha-celebration-of-nasranis-a-socio-cultural-analysis/ Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis].\" ''Journal of Indo Judaic studies'' '''13''', pp.&nbsp;57\u201371</ref> The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating [[Jesus]] washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness.\n* In the [[Philippines]], the day is officially known as ''Huwebes Santo'' or \"Maundy Thursday\" (the term \"Holy Thursday\" is rarely used). Most businesses are closed during the [[Easter Triduum]], with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday. Terrestrial television and radio stations either go completely off-air during the Triduum or operate on shorter hours with special programming; cable channels usually retain their normal programming. Newspapers do not publish on Good Friday and Black Saturday.\n\n===Public holiday===\n[[File:ChristWashingFeet.JPG|thumb|''Christus'', by the Lutheran [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].

In the UK, civil servants were traditionally granted a half-day holiday (known as \"privilege leave\") on this date, but that was abolished after 2012.\n\n===Seven Churches Visitation===\n{{main|Seven Churches Visitation}}\nThe tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday is an ancient practice, probably originating in [[Rome]].<ref name=Hill>{{Cite web |url=http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |title=Hill, William. \"Join the 7-church visits\", Diocese of Pittsburgh, April 11, 2014 |access-date=30 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521120610/http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and occurs among the faithful in countries around the world.\n\nIn [[India]], the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per [[Station of the Cross]]. Traditionally, this is performed on Maundy Thursday evening but is more often done on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] for the duration of the rite. It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the tradition is called ''[[Visita Iglesia]]'' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], \"church visit\"), where people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the [[Stations of the Cross]]. The Stations are often distributed amongst one, seven, or fourteen churches; the custom until the 1970s was to pray all fourteen in each church. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of [[Intramuros]] that stood until the 1945 [[Bombing of Manila]].<ref>Of the seven, only [[Manila Cathedral]] and [[San Agustin Church, Manila|San Agust\u00edn Church]] remain ''[[in situ]]'' following the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]].</ref> The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the [[Blessed Sacrament]] in the [[Altar of Repose]] on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the [[Pope]]), the Stations of the Cross were recited. Some Filipino liturgists{{who|date=March 2013}}, however, have sought to revive the original vigil before the Blessed Sacrament, and have composed prayers to guide contemporary worshippers.\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Ave Maria]], and the ''[[Gloria Patri]]''. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8&nbsp;pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, [[hot cross bun]]s and other local snacks like the traditional ''kueh ko chee''. Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.\n\n==See also==\n{{Death of Jesus |Holy Week}}\n* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Easter Triduum]]\n* [[Friday of Sorrows|Friday of Sorrows (Friday before Palm Sunday)]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[wikt:maundy|Maundy]]\n* [[Paschal cycle]]\n* [[Tenebrae (service)]]\n* [[Thursday of the Dead]]\n* [[Tristis est anima mea (responsory)]], second responsory for the Tenebrae at Maundy Thursday\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Maundy Thursday}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Maundy Thursday}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-homily-for-chrism-mass-full-text Pope Francis, \"Homily for Chrism Mass\", ''News.va'', March 28, 2013]\n* [http://www.saintcd.com/2017/04/09/chrism-mass-its-symbols-and-their-meaning/ Cosentino, Tony. \"Chrism Mass: its Symbols and Their Meaning\", Diocese of St. Catherine's, Ontario]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Philippine national holidays}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Thursday observances]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek traditions]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Peru]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Spain]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Iceland]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Norway]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Christian holiday commemorating the Last Supper}}\n{{About||the 2006 film|Maundy Thursday (film)}}\n{{redirect|Holy Thursday}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n|holiday_name = Maundy Thursday\n|image = Simon ushakov last supper 1685.jpg\n|caption = ''The Mystical Supper'', [[Icon]] by [[Simon Ushakov]] (1685)\n|nickname = Holy Thursday<br />Covenant Thursday<br />Great and Holy Thursday<br />Thursday of Mysteries<br />Sheer Thursday\n|observedby = Christians\n|date{{LASTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{LASTYEAR}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{LASTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{CURRENTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{CURRENTYEAR}} |cite=y}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{CURRENTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{NEXTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{NEXTYEAR|2}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR|2}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR|2}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|observances = [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]; distribution of [[Maundy money]]\n|type = [[Christianity|Christian]] / [[Civic holiday|Civic]]\n|significance = Commemorates the [[Foot washing|Maundy]] and [[Last Supper]] of [[Jesus Christ]]\n|relatedto = [[Holy Week]]\n|frequency = annual\n|duration = 1 day\n}}\n'''Maundy Thursday''' (also known as '''Holy Thursday''', '''Covenant Thursday''', '''Great and Holy Thursday''', '''Sheer Thursday''', and '''Thursday of Mysteries''', among other names) is the Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before [[Easter]].

On this day alone during Holy Week, the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil.\n\nThe primary service of this day is [[Vespers]] combined with the [[Liturgy of St. Basil|Liturgy of St. Basil the Great]] at which is read the first Passion Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1}}), known as the \"Gospel of the Testament\", and many of the normal hymns of the Divine Liturgy are substituted with the following [[troparion]]:\n\n<blockquote>''Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant; for I will not speak of Thy [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] to Thine enemies, neither will I give Thee a kiss like Judas. But like the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Thief]] will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy [[Paradise|Kingdom]].''</blockquote>\n\nWhen necessary to replenish the [[Church tabernacle#Reserved sacrament|sacrament for communing the sick at a time not following a divine liturgy]], an additional [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb (Host)]] is consecrated on this day, [[Intinction#Eastern Christianity|intincted]], covered, and left to dry until Holy Saturday when it is divided, completely dried with a candle flame, and the pieces placed in the [[Church tabernacle#Communion for the Sick|artophorion]].\n\nIn [[cathedral]]s and [[monasteries]] the ceremony of the [[Washing of Feet]] is normally performed.\n\nWhen there is need to [[consecrate]] more [[chrism]], that is performed by patriarchs and other heads of the various [[autocephalous]] churches.\n\n[[File:Passion Gospels - Great Thursday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2015.JPG|right|thumb| Reading of the 12th Passion Gospel on Great and Holy Thursday]]\nIn the evening, after the Liturgy, all of the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] are changed to black or some other dark colour, to signify the beginning of the Passion. Anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the '''Twelve Gospels''' is conducted. In these readings Christ's last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ's prayer, and his new commandment. The twelve readings are:\n* John 13:31\u201318:1\n* John 18:1\u201329\n* Matthew 26:57\u201375\n* John 18:28\u201319:16\n* Matthew 27:3\u201332\n* Mark 15:16\u201332\n* Matthew 27:33\u201354\n* Luke 23:32\u201349\n* John 19:19\u201337\n* Mark 15:43\u201347\n* John 19:38\u201342\n* Matthew 27:62\u201366\nBeginning on Holy and Great Thursday, the [[Memorial service (Orthodox)#Lity|memorial service for the dead]] is forbidden until after [[Thomas Sunday]].\n{{clear}}\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n=====Local customs=====\n* In Greek practice, the [[Sacrament|Mystery]] of [[Unction]] is performed on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] as preparation for the reception of Holy Communion on Great Thursday and Pascha, a custom that originated when Greece was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control and parish priests, being uneducated, were not permitted to hear confession, so this sacrament, by which sins are believed to be forgiven, came to be performed.\n* In Greek tradition, a procession is made during the service of the Twelve Passion Gospels. It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of \"Today He Who Hung\". During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ's body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed.\n* In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ's crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated.\n\n====Oriental Orthodoxy====\n{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}\nOriental Orthodoxy including Coptic (Egyptian) and Ethiopian Orthodoxy which is under papacy of Pope Tawadros II The Copts celebrate Covenant Thursday on 16 April which is 1 week after the Catholics celebrate it. They have praises and vespers every day of week and on Thursday and Saturday they stay praising God and reading about the First Liturgy and Judas\u2019 Betrayal. On Saturday they sing praises for the Entrance of the Messiah in Hades freeing all of the faithful ones including Moses and Abraham etc.\n\n==Customs and names from around the world==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]) washing the feet of children during the Washing of Feet ceremony]]\n* If statues and crucifixes have been covered during Passion Time (the last 2 weeks of Lent, at least in the 1962 Catholic missal), the crucifix covers are allowed to be white instead of purple for Holy Thursday.\n* Maundy Thursday celebrations in the [[United Kingdom]] (also called [[Royal Maundy]]) today involve the [[Monarch]] offering \"alms\" to deserving senior citizens, one man and one woman for each year of the sovereign's age. These coins, known as [[Maundy money]] or Royal Maundy, are distributed in red and white purses, and is a custom dating back to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The red purse contains regular currency and is given in place of food and clothing; the white purse has money in the amount of one penny for each year of the Sovereign's age.

The service at which this takes place rotates around English and Welsh churches, though in 2008 it took place for the first time in [[Northern Ireland]] at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh Cathedral]]. Until the death of King [[James II of England|James II]], the [[Monarch]] would also wash the feet of the selected poor people. There is an old sketch, done from life, of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] washing people's feet on Maundy Thursday. \n* The popular [[German (language)|German]] name ''Gr\u00fcndonnerstag'' means either \"mourning Thursday\" or \"green Thursday\".<ref>The word is of medieval origin and may refer to the possible use of green vestments on this day in some regions, or to a custom of eating green salad or pancakes (cf. [http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemid=GG26646 Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]). The name could also derive from [[Old High German]] ''gr\u012bnan'' (\"mourn\" or \"wail\", cf. Engl. ''groan''), referring to the death of Jesus or the [[penitent]]s' return to the [[eucharist]] on this day in older times (K. K\u00fcppers, \"Gr\u00fcndonnerstag\", In ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'', vol. IV,, DTV, Munich, 2003).</ref>\n* In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the day is called ''Zelen\u00fd \u010dtvrtek'' or ''Zelen\u00fd \u0161tvrtok'' respectively, again meaning \"Green Thursday\". It is because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the [[church bell]]s until [[Holy Saturday]], here called \"White Saturday\", because \"they have flown to [[Rome]]\" (a euphemism), in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and call the people to the church.\n* The tradition of silent bells is found also in [[Luxembourg]]: the bells fall silent until Easter, because \"they have flown to Rome for Confession\", so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.<ref>Festivals of Western Europe, by Dorothy Gladys Spicer, 1958</ref>\n* In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the day is called ''Witte Donderdag'' (White Thursday) referring to the [[liturgical colour]] of the day.\n* In [[Malta]], Holy Thursday is known as ''\u0126amis ix-Xirka'' (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of [[Seven Churches Visitation|visiting seven churches]] (see below) is called ''is-seba' visti'' or is-Sepulkri.\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Maundy Thursday is ''Dydd Iau Cablyd''.\n* In [[Sweden]] Maundy Thursday (sk\u00e4rtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for easter eggs.\n* In [[Bulgaria]] Maundy Thursday is called ''Veliki Chetvurtuk'' (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for ''Razpeti Petuk'' (Crucifixion Friday), ''Velika Subota'' (Great Saturday) and ''Velikden'' (Easter Day).\n* In [[Kerala]] State in [[India]], the day is called as ''[[Pesaha]]''(\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d38\u0d39), a [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word for [[Passover]]. It is a statewide public holiday declared by the [[Government of Kerala]], given the high number of Christians in the state. The tradition of consuming ''[[Pesaha appam]]'' or ''Indariyappam'' is customary after special longer [[Holy Qurbana]], which are conducted on the or at midnight till morning in churches of Saint Thomas Christians. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink call ''Pesaha Paal'' made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, ''Pesaha Paal'' a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them.<ref>Sunish George J Alumkalnal, (2013). \"[https://www.nasrani.net/2012/11/11/pesaha-celebration-of-nasranis-a-socio-cultural-analysis/ Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis].\" ''Journal of Indo Judaic studies'' '''13''', pp.&nbsp;57\u201371</ref> The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating [[Jesus]] washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness.\n* In the [[Philippines]], the day is officially known as ''Huwebes Santo'' or \"Maundy Thursday\" (the term \"Holy Thursday\" is rarely used). Most businesses are closed during the [[Easter Triduum]], with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday. Terrestrial television and radio stations either go completely off-air during the Triduum or operate on shorter hours with special programming; cable channels usually retain their normal programming. Newspapers do not publish on Good Friday and Black Saturday.\n\n===Public holiday===\n[[File:ChristWashingFeet.JPG|thumb|''Christus'', by the Lutheran [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].

In the UK, civil servants were traditionally granted a half-day holiday (known as \"privilege leave\") on this date, but that was abolished after 2012.\n\n===Seven Churches Visitation===\n{{main|Seven Churches Visitation}}\nThe tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday is an ancient practice, probably originating in [[Rome]].<ref name=Hill>{{Cite web |url=http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |title=Hill, William. \"Join the 7-church visits\", Diocese of Pittsburgh, April 11, 2014 |access-date=30 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521120610/http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and occurs among the faithful in countries around the world.\n\nIn [[India]], the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per [[Station of the Cross]]. Traditionally, this is performed on Maundy Thursday evening but is more often done on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] for the duration of the rite. It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the tradition is called ''[[Visita Iglesia]]'' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], \"church visit\"), where people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the [[Stations of the Cross]]. The Stations are often distributed amongst one, seven, or fourteen churches; the custom until the 1970s was to pray all fourteen in each church. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of [[Intramuros]] that stood until the 1945 [[Bombing of Manila]].<ref>Of the seven, only [[Manila Cathedral]] and [[San Agustin Church, Manila|San Agust\u00edn Church]] remain ''[[in situ]]'' following the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]].</ref> The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the [[Blessed Sacrament]] in the [[Altar of Repose]] on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the [[Pope]]), the Stations of the Cross were recited. Some Filipino liturgists{{who|date=March 2013}}, however, have sought to revive the original vigil before the Blessed Sacrament, and have composed prayers to guide contemporary worshippers.\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Ave Maria]], and the ''[[Gloria Patri]]''. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8&nbsp;pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, [[hot cross bun]]s and other local snacks like the traditional ''kueh ko chee''. Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.\n\n==See also==\n{{Death of Jesus |Holy Week}}\n* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Easter Triduum]]\n* [[Friday of Sorrows|Friday of Sorrows (Friday before Palm Sunday)]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[wikt:maundy|Maundy]]\n* [[Paschal cycle]]\n* [[Tenebrae (service)]]\n* [[Thursday of the Dead]]\n* [[Tristis est anima mea (responsory)]], second responsory for the Tenebrae at Maundy Thursday\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Maundy Thursday}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Maundy Thursday}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-homily-for-chrism-mass-full-text Pope Francis, \"Homily for Chrism Mass\", ''News.va'', March 28, 2013]\n* [http://www.saintcd.com/2017/04/09/chrism-mass-its-symbols-and-their-meaning/ Cosentino, Tony. \"Chrism Mass: its Symbols and Their Meaning\", Diocese of St. Catherine's, Ontario]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Philippine national holidays}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Thursday observances]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek traditions]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Peru]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Spain]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Iceland]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Norway]]\n", "name_user": "99v", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCustoms and names from around the world", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maundy_Thursday"}

The common name \u2018cranesbill\u2019 comes from the shape of the unsprung column, which in some species is long and looks like the bill of a [[Crane (bird)|crane]]. However, many species in this genus do not have a long beak-like column.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Confusion with ''Pelargonium''==\n[[File:Geranium sanguineum02.jpg|thumb|right|Showing the \"bill\" and seed dispersal mechanism of ''Geranium pratense'']]\nConfusingly, \"geranium\" is also the [[common name]] of members of the genus ''[[Pelargonium]]'', which are also in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Geraniaceae]] and are widely grown as [[horticulture|horticultural]] [[bedding (horticulture)|bedding]] plants. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] originally included all the species in one genus, ''Geranium'', but they were later separated into two genera by [[Charles L\u2019H\u00e9ritier]] in 1789. Other former members of the genus are now classified in ''[[Erodium]]'', including the plants known as filarees in North America.\n\nThe term \"hardy geranium\" is often applied to horticultural ''Geranium''s to distinguish them from the ''Pelargonium''s, which are not winter-hardy in [[temperate climate|temperate]] horticulture. However, not all ''Geranium'' species are winter-hardy (see below).\n\nThe shape of the flowers offers one way of distinguishing between the two genera ''Geranium'' and ''Pelargonium''. ''Geranium'' flowers have five very similar petals, and are thus radially symmetrical ([[actinomorphic]]), whereas ''Pelargonium'' (and also ''Erodium'') flowers have two upper petals which are different from the three lower petals, so the flowers have a single plane of symmetry ([[zygomorphic]]).\n\n==Cultivation==\n<!-- repetitive :''See also the [[List of cranesbill species]]''.-->\n\nA number of geranium species are cultivated for horticultural use and for pharmaceutical products.\nSome of the more commonly grown species include:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[Geranium cinereum]]''\n*''[[Geranium clarkei]]'' (Clarke's geranium)\n*''[[Geranium dalmaticum]]''\n*''[[Geranium endressii]]'' (Endres's cranesbill)\n*''[[Geranium erianthum]]'' (wooly geranium)\n*''[[Geranium fremontii]]'' (Fremont's geranium)\n*''[[Geranium himalayense]]'', often sold under ''Geranium grandiflorum''\n*''[[Geranium ibericum]]'' (Caucasus geranium),\n*''[[Geranium macrorrhizum]]'' (bigroot cranesbill or bigroot geranium)      \n*''[[Geranium maculatum]]'' (wild geranium)\n*''[[Geranium maderense]]'' (giant herb robert)\n*''[[Geranium \u00d7 magnificum]]'' (showy geranium)\n*''[[Geranium phaeum]]'' (dusky cranesbill)\n*''[[Geranium platypetalum]]'' (broad-petaled geranium)\n*''[[Geranium pratense]]'' (meadow cranesbill)\n*''[[Geranium psilostemon]]'' (Armenian cranesbill)\n*''[[Geranium renardii]]'' (Renard geranium)\n*''[[Geranium sanguineum]]'' (bloody cranesbill)\n*''[[Geranium subcaulescens]]'' (grey cranesbill)\n*''[[Geranium sylvaticum]]'' (wood cranesbill)\n{{div col end}}\n\nAll the above species are perennials and generally winter-hardy plants, grown for their attractive flowers and foliage.

They are found throughout the [[temperateness|temperate]] regions of the world and the mountains of the tropics, but mostly in the eastern part of the [[Mediterranean region]]. \n\nThe palmately cleft [[Leaf|leaves]] are broadly circular in form. The flowers have five petals and are coloured white, pink, purple or blue, often with distinctive veining. Geraniums will grow in any soil as long as it is not waterlogged. [[Plant propagation|Propagation]] is by semiripe cuttings in summer, by seed, or by division in autumn or spring. \n\nGeraniums are eaten by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including [[brown-tail]], [[ghost moth]], and [[mouse moth]].

The group justifies its ideology on verse 2:216 of the [[Quran]]. Extrapolating from this verse, the group asserts that military jihad is a religious obligation of all Muslims and defines the many circumstances under which it must be carried out. In a pamphlet entitled \"Why Are We Waging Jihad?\", the group states that all of [[India]] along with many other countries were once ruled by Muslims and were Muslim lands, which is their duty to take it back from the non-Muslims.

Hurst & Co., 2004) mentioned three training camps in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]], the principal one is the Umm-al-Qura training camp at [[Muzaffarabad]]. Every month five hundred militants are trained in these camps. Muhammad Amir Rana in his ''A to Z of Jehadi Organizations in Pakistan'' (Lahore: Mashal, 2004) listed five training camps. Four of them, the Muaskar-e-Taiba, the Muaskar-e-Aqsa, the Muaskar Umm-al-Qura and the Muaskar Abdullah bin Masood are in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Markaz Mohammed bin Qasim training camp is in [[Sanghar District]] of [[Sindh]]. Ten thousand militants had been trained in these camps till 2004.\n\n===Funding===\nThe government of Pakistan began to fund the LeT during the early 1990s and by around 1995 the funding had grown considerably. During this time the army and the ISI helped establish the LeT's military structure with the specific intent to use the militant group against India. The LeT also obtained funds through efforts of the MDI's Department of Finance.<ref name='tankel201104' />\n\nUntil 2002, the LeT collected funds through public fundraising events usually using charity boxes in shops and mosques. The group also received money through donations at MDI offices, through personal donations collected at public celebrations of an operative's martyrdom, and through its website.<ref name='tankel201104' /> The LeT also collected donations from the Pakistani immigrant community in the [[Persian Gulf]] and United Kingdom, Islamic Non-Governmental Organizations, and Pakistani and Kashmiri businessmen.<ref name=\"satp\" /><ref name='tankel201104' /><ref>\n[https://fas.org/irp/world/para/lashkar.htm Lashkar-e-Taiba] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723125658/http://fas.org/irp/world/para/lashkar.htm |date=23 July 2015 }}, Federation of American Scientists Intelligence Resource Program\n</ref> LeT operatives have also been apprehended in India, where they had been obtaining funds from sections of the Muslim community.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/jul/28lashkar.htm |title=Meet the Lashkar-e-Tayiba's fundraiser |publisher=Rediff.com |date=31 December 2004 |accessdate=17 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120000114/http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/jul/28lashkar.htm |archive-date=20 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}\n</ref>\n\nAlthough many of the funds collected went towards legitimate uses, e.g. factories and other businesses, a significant portion was dedicated to military activities.
