The broad field may also be referred to as '''environmental genomics''', '''ecogenomics''' or '''community genomics'''.\n\nWhile traditional [[microbiology]] and microbial [[genome sequencing]] and [[genomics]] rely upon cultivated [[clone (genetics)|clonal]] [[microbiological culture|cultures]], early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed that the vast majority of [[biodiversity|microbial biodiversity]] had been missed by cultivation-based methods.<ref name=\"Hugenholz1998\" />\n\nBecause of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world.<ref name=\"MarcoD2011\" /> As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall, metagenomics now allows [[microbial ecology]] to be investigated at a much greater scale and detail than before. Recent studies use either \"shotgun\" or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities.<ref name=\"Eisen2007\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"metagenomics\" was first used by [[Jo Handelsman]], [[Jon Clardy]], [[Robert M. Goodman]], Sean F. Brady, and others, and first appeared in publication in 1998.<ref name=\"Handelsman1998\"/> The term metagenome referenced the idea that a collection of genes sequenced from the environment could be analyzed in a way analogous to the study of a single [[genome]]. In 2005, Kevin Chen and [[Lior Pachter]] (researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]) defined metagenomics as \"the application of modern genomics technique without the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species\".<ref name=\"Chen2005\"/>\n\n==History==\nConventional [[sequencing]] begins with a culture of identical cells as a source of [[DNA]]. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be [[Microbiological culture|cultured]] and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S [[ribosomal]] [[RNA]] (rRNA) sequences which are relatively short, often [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S [[rRNA]] sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured [[species]], indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA genes taken directly from the environment revealed that [[Microbiological culture|cultivation]] based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and [[archaea]]l species in a sample.<ref name=\"Hugenholz1998\" /> Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed that the vast majority of microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.\n\nEarly [[molecular biology|molecular work]] in the field was conducted by [[Norman R. Pace]] and colleagues, who used [[PCR]] to explore the diversity of ribosomal RNA sequences.<ref name=\"Lane1985\"/> The insights gained from these breakthrough studies led Pace to propose the idea of cloning DNA directly from environmental samples as early as 1985.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Pace NR, Stahl DA, Lane DJ, Olsen GJ | chapter = The Analysis of Natural Microbial Populations by Ribosomal RNA Sequences |date=1986 |pages=1\u201355| veditors = Marshall KC | title =Advances in Microbial Ecology| volume = 9 |publisher=Springer US |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0611-6_1 |isbn=978-1-4757-0611-6 }}</ref> This led to the first report of isolating and [[DNA cloning|cloning]] bulk DNA from an environmental sample, published by Pace and colleagues in 1991<ref name=\"Pace1991\"/> while Pace was in the Department of Biology at [[Indiana University]]. Considerable efforts ensured that these were not [[PCR]] false positives and supported the existence of a complex community of unexplored species. Although this methodology was limited to exploring highly conserved, [[Noncoding DNA|non-protein coding genes]], it did support early microbial morphology-based observations that diversity was far more complex than was known by culturing methods. Soon after that, Healy reported the metagenomic isolation of functional genes from \"zoolibraries\" constructed from a complex culture of environmental organisms grown in the laboratory on dried [[grass]]es in 1995.<ref name=\"Healy1995\"/> After leaving the Pace laboratory, [[Edward DeLong]] continued in the field and has published work that has largely laid the groundwork for environmental phylogenies based on signature 16S sequences, beginning with his group's construction of libraries from [[marine biology|marine]] samples.<ref name=\"Stein1996\"/>\n\nIn 2002, [[Mya Breitbart]], [[Forest Rohwer]], and colleagues used environmental shotgun sequencing (see below) to show that 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses.<ref name=\"Breitbart2002\"/> Subsequent studies showed that there are more than a thousand [[viral species]] in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many [[bacteriophages]]. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Joint Genome Institute]] sequenced DNA extracted from an [[acid mine drainage]] system.<ref name=\"Tyson2004\"/> This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and [[archaea]] that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.<ref name=\"Hugenholz2002\"/>\n\n[[File:Flow diagram of a typical metagenome projects.tiff|thumb|200px|Flow diagram of a typical metagenome project<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas T, Gilbert J, Meyer F | title = Metagenomics - a guide from sampling to data analysis | journal = Microbial Informatics and Experimentation | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22587947 | pmc = 3351745 | doi = 10.1186/2042-5783-2-3 }}</ref>]]\nBeginning in 2003, [[Craig Venter]], leader of the privately funded parallel of the [[Human Genome Project]], has led the [[Global Ocean Sampling Expedition]] (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the [[Sargasso Sea]], found DNA from nearly 2000 different [[species]], including 148 types of [[bacteria]] never before seen.<ref name=\"Venter2004\"/> Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the [[West Coast of the United States]], and completed a two-year expedition to explore the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of [[plankton]].<ref name=\"yooseph2010\"/>\n\nIn 2005 Stephan C. Schuster at [[Penn State University]] and colleagues published the first sequences of an environmental sample generated with [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]], in this case massively parallel [[pyrosequencing]] developed by [[454 Life Sciences]].<ref name=\"Poinar2005\"/> Another early paper in this area appeared in 2006 by Robert Edwards, [[Forest Rohwer]], and colleagues at [[San Diego State University]].<ref name=\"Edwards2006\"/>\n\n==Sequencing==\n{{Main|DNA sequencing}}\n\nRecovery of DNA sequences longer than a few thousand [[base pair]]s from environmental [[Sample (material)|samples]] was very difficult until recent advances in [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] techniques allowed the construction of [[Library (biology)|libraries]] in [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs), which provided better [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] for [[molecular cloning]].<ref name=\"Beja2000\"/>\n[[File:Environmental shotgun sequencing.png|thumb|250px|Environmental Shotgun Sequencing (ESS). (A) Sampling from habitat; (B) filtering particles, typically by size; (C) Lysis and DNA extraction; (D) cloning and library construction; (E) sequencing the clones; (F) sequence assembly into contigs and scaffolds.]]\n\n===Shotgun metagenomics===\nAdvances in [[bioinformatics]], refinements of DNA amplification, and the proliferation of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of [[shotgun sequencing]] to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the [[human genome project|human genome]], randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and [[Sequence assembly|reconstructs]] them into a [[consensus sequence]]. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community.<ref name=\"segata2013\"/> Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.<ref name=\"Tyson2004\" />\n\n===High-throughput sequencing===\nAn advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing one of the main biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling. The first metagenomic studies conducted using [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]] used massively parallel [[pyrosequencing|454 pyrosequencing]].<ref name=\"Poinar2005\"/> Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the [[Ion semiconductor sequencing|Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine]], the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] MiSeq or HiSeq and the [[ABI Solid Sequencing|Applied Biosystems SOLiD]] system.<ref name=\"rodrigue2010\"/> These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than [[Sanger sequencing]]; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400&nbsp;bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25\u201375&nbsp;bp reads.<ref name=\"schuster2008\"/> Historically, these read lengths were significantly shorter than the typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750&nbsp;bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200\u2013500&nbsp;megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20\u201350&nbsp;gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years.<ref name=\"nmeth2009\"/>\n\nAn emerging approach combines shotgun sequencing and [[chromosome conformation capture]] (Hi-C), which measures the proximity of any two DNA sequences within the same cell, to guide microbial genome assembly.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stewart RD, Auffret MD, Warr A, Wiser AH, Press MO, Langford KW, Liachko I, Snelling TJ, Dewhurst RJ, Walker AW,

name=\"committee2007\" /> Furthermore, the increased use of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA sequences]] that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample.<ref name=\"koonin2008\"/> Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric [[contig]]s.<ref name='koonin2008' />\n\nThere are several assembly programs, most of which can use information from [[paired-end tag]]s in order to improve the accuracy of assemblies.

[[Binning (Metagenomics)|Binning]] is the process of associating a particular sequence with an organism.<ref name='koonin2008'/> In similarity-based binning, methods such as [[BLAST]] are used to rapidly search for phylogenetic markers or otherwise similar sequences in existing public databases. This approach is implemented in [[MEGAN]].<ref name=\"MEGAN2007\"/> Another tool, PhymmBL, uses [[Markov model|interpolated Markov model]]s to assign reads.<ref name='wooley2010'/> [http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan MetaPhlAn] and [[AMPHORA]] are methods based on unique clade-specific markers for estimating organismal relative abundances with improved computational performances.<ref name=\"segata2012\"/> Other tools, like [https://motu-tool.org/ mOTUs]<ref name=\"sunagawa2013\"/><ref name=\"milanese2019\"/> and MetaPhyler,<ref name=\"liu2011\"/> use universal marker genes to profile prokaryotic species. With the [https://motu-tool.org/ mOTUs profiler] is possible to profile species without a reference genome, improving the estimation of microbial community diversity.<ref name=\"milanese2019\"/> Recent methods, such as [https://github.com/seqan/slimm SLIMM], use read coverage landscape of individual reference genomes to minimize false-positive hits and get reliable relative abundances.<ref name=\"DadiRenard2017\"/> In composition based binning, methods use intrinsic features of the sequence, such as oligonucleotide frequencies or [[codon usage bias]].<ref name='wooley2010'/> Once sequences are binned, it is possible to carry out comparative analysis of diversity and richness.\n\n===Data integration===\n\nThe massive amount of exponentially growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that is complicated by the complexity of the [[metadata]] associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling.<ref name=\"committee2007\"/> This information is necessary both to ensure [[replicability]] and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).<ref name=\"pagani2011\"/>\n\nSeveral tools have been developed to integrate metadata and sequence data, allowing downstream comparative analyses of different datasets using a number of ecological indices. In 2007, Folker Meyer and Robert Edwards and a team at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and the [[University of Chicago]] released the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology server ([[MG-RAST]]) a community resource for metagenome data set analysis.<ref name=\"Meyer2008\"/> As of June 2012 over 14.8 terabases (14x10<sup>12</sup> bases) of DNA have been analyzed, with more than 10,000 public data sets freely available for comparison within MG-RAST. Over 8,000 users now have submitted a total of 50,000 metagenomes to MG-RAST. The [[Integrated Microbial Genomes System|Integrated Microbial Genomes/Metagenomes]] (IMG/M) system also provides a collection of tools for functional analysis of microbial communities based on their metagenome sequence, based upon reference isolate genomes included from the [http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/w/main.cgi Integrated Microbial Genomes] (IMG) system and the [http://jgi.doe.gov/programs/GEBA/index.html Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA)] project.<ref name=\"markowitz2012\"/>\n\nOne of the first standalone tools for analysing high-throughput metagenome shotgun data was [[MEGAN]] (MEta Genome ANalyzer).<ref name=\"MEGAN2011\"/><ref name=\"MEGAN2007\"/> A first version of the program was used in 2005 to analyse the metagenomic context of DNA sequences obtained from a mammoth bone.<ref name=\"Poinar2005\" /> Based on a BLAST comparison against a reference database, this tool performs both taxonomic and functional binning, by placing the reads onto the nodes of the NCBI taxonomy using a simple lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm or onto the nodes of the [http://www.theseed.org/wiki/Main_Page SEED] or [[KEGG]] classifications, respectively.<ref name=\"mitra2011\"/>\n\nWith the advent of fast and inexpensive sequencing instruments, the growth of databases of DNA sequences is now exponential (e.g., the NCBI GenBank database <ref name=\"benson2013\"/>). Faster and efficient tools are needed to keep pace with the high-throughput sequencing, because the BLAST-based approaches such as MG-RAST or MEGAN run slowly to annotate large samples (e.g., several hours to process a small/medium size dataset/sample <ref name=\"bazinet2012\"/>). Thus, ultra-fast classifiers have recently emerged, thanks to more affordable powerful servers. These tools can perform the taxonomic annotation at extremely high speed, for example CLARK <ref name=\"ounit2015\"/> (according to CLARK's authors, it can classify accurately \"32 million metagenomic short reads per minute\"). At such a speed, a very large dataset/sample of a billion short reads can be processed in about 30 minutes.\n\nWith the increasing availability of samples containing ancient DNA and due to the uncertainty associated with the nature of those samples (ancient DNA damage),<ref name=\"falcon\">{{cite biorxiv | vauthors = Pratas D, Pinho AJ, Silva RM, Rodrigues JM, Hosseini M, Caetano T, Ferreira PJ |title=FALCON: a method to infer metagenomic composition of ancient DNA |date=February 2018 |biorxiv=267179 }}</ref> a fast tool capable of producing conservative similarity estimates has been made available. According to FALCON's authors, it can use relaxed thresholds and edit distances without affecting the memory and speed performance.\n\n===Comparative metagenomics===\n\nComparative analyses between metagenomes can provide additional insight into the function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health.<ref name=\"kurokawa2007\"/> Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made at the level of sequence composition (comparing [[GC-content]] or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be made on the basis of 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or\u2014in the case of low-diversity communities\u2014by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as [[Gene cluster|COG]] or [[KEGG]], and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance.<ref name=\"mitra2011\"/> This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the ''community'' as a whole rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.<ref name=\"wooley2010\" />\n\nAdditionally, several studies have also utilized oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al.<ref name=\"willner2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Willner D, Thurber RV, Rohwer F | title = Metagenomic signatures of 86 microbial and viral metagenomes | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 1752\u201366 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19302541 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01901.x }}</ref> and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al.<ref name = \"ghosh2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghosh TS, Mohammed MH, Rajasingh H, Chadaram S, Mande SS | title = HabiSign: a novel approach for comparison of metagenomes and rapid identification of habitat-specific sequences | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 12 Suppl 13 | issue = Supplement 13 | pages = S9 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22373355 | pmc = 3278849 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-12-s13-s9 }}</ref> This latter study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns can be used to identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools<ref name=\"Fimereli2013\"/> or Compareads<ref name=\"Maillet2013\"/> detect similar reads between two read sets. The [[similarity measure]] they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length ''k'' shared by pairs of reads.\n\nA key goal in comparative metagenomics is to identify microbial group(s) which are responsible for conferring specific characteristics to a given environment. However, due to issues in the sequencing technologies artifacts need to be accounted for like in metagenomeSeq.<ref name=\"paulson2013\" /> Others have characterized inter-microbial interactions between the resident microbial groups.

Notably, this layout algorithm also enables grouping of the metagenomes based on the probable inter-microbial interaction patterns rather than simply comparing abundance values of various taxonomic groups. In addition, the tool implements several interactive GUI-based functionalities that enable users to perform standard comparative analyses across microbiomes.\n\n==Data analysis==\n\n===Community metabolism===\nIn many bacterial communities, natural or engineered (such as [[bioreactor]]s), there is significant division of labor in metabolism ([[Syntrophy]]), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others.<ref name=\"werner2011\"/> In one such system, the [[methanogen]]ic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several [[syntrophy|syntrophic]] species ([[Syntrophobacterales]] and [[Synergistia]]) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste ([[methane]]).<ref name=\"mcinerney2009\"/> Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with [[microarray]]s or [[proteomics]] researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with [[metabolomic]]s and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.<ref name=\"kiltgord2011\"/>\n\n===Metatranscriptomics===\n{{Further|Transcriptome|Transcriptomics technologies}}\n{{Main|Metatranscriptomics}}\n\nMetagenomics allows researchers to access the functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> The extraction and analysis of metagenomic [[mRNA]] (the '''metatranscriptome''') provides information on the [[Gene regulation|regulation]] and [[Gene expression|expression]] profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the [[MRNA#Degradation|short half-life]] of mRNA, for example) in the collection of environmental RNA there have been relatively few ''[[In situ#Biology|in situ]]'' metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> While originally limited to [[DNA microarray|microarray]] technology, metatranscriptomics studies have made use of [[transcriptomics technologies]] to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community,<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.<ref name=\"leininger2006\"/>\n\n===Viruses===\n{{Main|Viral metagenomics}}\n\nMetagenomic sequencing is particularly useful in the study of viral communities. As viruses lack a shared universal phylogenetic marker (as [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S RNA]] for bacteria and archaea, and [[18S ribosomal RNA|18S RNA]] for eukarya), the only way to access the genetic diversity of the viral community from an environmental sample is through metagenomics. Viral metagenomes (also called viromes) should thus provide more and more information about viral diversity and evolution.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paez-Espino D, Eloe-Fadrosh EA, Pavlopoulos GA, Thomas AD, Huntemann M, Mikhailova N, Rubin E, Ivanova NN, Kyrpides NC | display-authors = 6 | title = Uncovering Earth's virome | journal = Nature | volume = 536 | issue = 7617 | pages = 425\u201330 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27533034 | doi = 10.1038/nature19094 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4zh090xt | bibcode = 2016Natur.536..425P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paez-Espino D, Chen IA, Palaniappan K, Ratner A, Chu K, Szeto E, Pillay M, Huang J, Markowitz VM, Nielsen T, Huntemann M, K Reddy TB, Pavlopoulos GA, Sullivan MB, Campbell BJ, Chen F, McMahon K, Hallam SJ, Denef V, Cavicchioli R, Caffrey SM, Streit WR, Webster J, Handley KM, Salekdeh GH, Tsesmetzis N, Setubal JC, Pope PB, Liu WT, Rivers AR, Ivanova NN, Kyrpides NC | display-authors = 6 | title = IMG/VR: a database of cultured and uncultured DNA Viruses and retroviruses | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 45 | issue = D1 | pages = D457\u2013D465 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27799466 | pmc = 5210529 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw1030 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paez-Espino D, Roux S, Chen IA, Palaniappan K, Ratner A, Chu K, Huntemann M, Reddy TB, Pons JC, Llabr\u00e9s M, Eloe-Fadrosh EA, Ivanova NN, Kyrpides NC | display-authors = 6 | title = IMG/VR v.2.0: an integrated data management and analysis system for cultivated and environmental viral genomes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 47 | issue = D1 | pages = D678\u2013D686 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30407573 | pmc = 6323928 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gky1127 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paez-Espino D, Pavlopoulos GA, Ivanova NN, Kyrpides NC | title = Nontargeted virus sequence discovery pipeline and virus clustering for metagenomic data | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 1673\u20131682 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28749930 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2017.063 | url = https://escholarship.org/content/qt1549t4d3/qt1549t4d3.pdf?t=p2n6i2 }}</ref><ref name=\"Kristensen\"/> For example, a metagenomic pipeline called [[Giant Virus Finder]] showed the first evidence of existence of [[Girus|giant viruses]] in a saline desert<ref name=\"connectome\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerepesi C, Grolmusz V | title = Giant viruses of the Kutch Desert | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 161 | issue = 3 | pages = 721\u20134 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26666442 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-015-2720-8 | arxiv = 1410.1278 }}</ref> and in Antarctic dry valleys \n.<ref name=\"kettes\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerepesi C, Grolmusz V | title = The \"Giant Virus Finder\" discovers an abundance of giant viruses in the Antarctic dry valleys | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 162 | issue = 6 | pages = 1671\u20131676 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28247094 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-017-3286-4 | arxiv = 1503.05575 }}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\nMetagenomics has the potential to advance knowledge in a wide variety of fields.

The study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria. Using Illumina GA sequence data and SOAPdenovo, a de Bruijn graph-based tool specifically designed for assembly short reads, they were able to generate 6.58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total contig length of 10.3 Gb and a N50 length of 2.2 kb.\n\nThe study demonstrated that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% of the known phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important for the health of the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients' gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.\n\nWhile these studies highlight some potentially valuable medical applications, only 31\u201348.8% of the reads could be aligned to 194 public human gut bacterial genomes and 7.6\u201321.2% to bacterial genomes available in GenBank which indicates that there is still far more research necessary to capture novel bacterial genomes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin J, Li R, Raes J, Arumugam M, Burgdorf KS, Manichanh C, Nielsen T, Pons N, Levenez F, Yamada T, Mende DR, Li J, Xu J, Li S, Li D, Cao J, Wang B, Liang H, Zheng H, Xie Y, Tap J, Lepage P, Bertalan M, Batto JM, Hansen T, Le Paslier D, Linneberg A, Nielsen HB, Pelletier E, Renault P, Sicheritz-Ponten T, Turner K, Zhu H, Yu C, Li S, Jian M, Zhou Y, Li Y, Zhang X, Li S, Qin N, Yang H, Wang J, Brunak S, Dor\u00e9 J, Guarner F, Kristiansen K, Pedersen O, Parkhill J, Weissenbach J, Bork P, Ehrlich SD, Wang J | display-authors = 6 | title = A human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing | journal = Nature | volume = 464 | issue = 7285 | pages = 59\u201365 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20203603 | pmc = 3779803 | doi = 10.1038/nature08821 | bibcode = 2010Natur.464...59. }}</ref>\n\n===Infectious disease diagnosis===\nDifferentiating between infectious and non-infectious illness, and identifying the underlying etiology of infection, can be quite challenging.

Metagenomic sequencing shows promise as a sensitive and rapid method to diagnose infection by comparing genetic material found in a patient's sample to a database of thousands of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Binning (Metagenomics)|Binning]]\n*[[Sewage#Epidemiology|Epidemiology and sewage]]\n*[[Metaproteomics]]\n*[[Microbial ecology]]\n*[[Pathogenomics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!-- Converted to LDR format\n     using [[User:PleaseStand/References segregator]] -->\n\n<ref name=\"Hugenholz1998\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Hugenholtz P, Goebel BM, Pace NR | title = Impact of culture-independent studies on the emerging phylogenetic view of bacterial diversity | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 180 | issue = 18 | pages = 4765\u201374 | date = September 1998 | doi = 10.1128/JB.180.18.4765-4774.1998 | pmid = 9733676 | pmc = 107498 }}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Eisen2007\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisen JA | title = Environmental shotgun sequencing: its potential and challenges for studying the hidden world of microbes | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = e82 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17355177 | pmc = 1821061 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050082 }}\n</ref>\n<ref name= MarcoD2011>\n{{cite book\n  | editor = Marco, D\n  | year=2011\n  | title=Metagenomics: Current Innovations and Future Trends\n  | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]]\n  | isbn= 978-1-904455-87-5}}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"Handelsman1998\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Handelsman J, Rondon MR, Brady SF, Clardy J, Goodman RM | title = Molecular biological access to the chemistry of unknown soil microbes: a new frontier for natural products | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = R245-9 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9818143 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-5521(98)90108-9 }}.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Chen2005\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen K, Pachter L | title = Bioinformatics for whole-genome shotgun sequencing of microbial communities | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 106\u201312 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16110337 | pmc = 1185649 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010024 | bibcode = 2005PLSCB...1...24C }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lane1985\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Lane DJ, Pace B, Olsen GJ, Stahl DA, Sogin ML, Pace NR | title = Rapid determination of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences for phylogenetic analyses | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 82 | issue = 20 | pages = 6955\u20139 | date = October 1985 | pmid = 2413450 | pmc = 391288 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.82.20.6955 | bibcode = 1985PNAS...82.6955L }}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref name=\"Pace1985\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Pace NR, Stahl DA, Lane DJ, Olsen GJ |year= 1985|title= Analyzing natural microbial populations by rRNA sequences|journal= ASM News|volume= 51|pages= 4\u201312|url= http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=913954&q=Analyzing+natural+microbial+populations+by+rRNA+sequences&uid=790164755&setcookie=yes|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120404174757/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=913954&q=Analyzing+natural+microbial+populations+by+rRNA+sequences&uid=790164755&setcookie=yes\n|archive-date= 4 April 2012|df= dmy-all}}</ref> -->\n\n<ref name=\"Maillet2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maillet N, Lemaitre C, Chikhi R, Lavenier D, Peterlongo P | title = Compareads: comparing huge metagenomic experiments | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 13 Suppl 19 | issue = Suppl 19 | pages = S10 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23282463 | pmc = 3526429 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-13-S19-S10 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Fimereli2013\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Fimereli D, Detours V, Konopka T | title = TriageTools: tools for partitioning and prioritizing analysis of high-throughput sequencing data | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 7 | pages = e86 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23408855 | pmc = 3627586 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt094 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Pace1991\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt TM, DeLong EF, Pace NR | title = Analysis of a marine picoplankton community by 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 173 | issue = 14 | pages = 4371\u20138 | date = July 1991 | pmid = 2066334 | pmc = 208098 | doi = 10.1128/jb.173.14.4371-4378.1991 | authorlink = Norman R.

stream receiving acid drainage from surface coal mining.]]\n'''Metagenomics''' is the study of [[genetics|genetic]] material recovered directly from [[Natural environment|environmental]] samples. The broad field may also be referred to as '''environmental genomics''', '''ecogenomics''' or '''community genomics'''. \n\nWhile traditional [[microbiology]] and microbial [[genome sequencing]] and [[genomics]] rely upon cultivated [[clone (genetics)|clonal]] [[microbiological culture|cultures]], early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed that the vast majority of [[biodiversity|microbial biodiversity]] had been missed by cultivation-based methods.<ref name=\"Hugenholz1998\" /> \n\nBecause of its ability to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world.<ref name=\"MarcoD2011\" /> As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall, metagenomics now allows [[microbial ecology]] to be investigated at a much greater scale and detail than before. Recent studies use either \"shotgun\" or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] directed sequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities.<ref name=\"Eisen2007\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"metagenomics\" was first used by [[Jo Handelsman]], [[Jon Clardy]], [[Robert M. Goodman]], Sean F. Brady, and others, and first appeared in publication in 1998.<ref name=\"Handelsman1998\"/> The term metagenome referenced the idea that a collection of genes sequenced from the environment could be analyzed in a way analogous to the study of a single [[genome]]. In 2005, Kevin Chen and [[Lior Pachter]] (researchers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]) defined metagenomics as \"the application of modern genomics technique without the need for isolation and lab cultivation of individual species\".<ref name=\"Chen2005\"/>\n\n==History==\nConventional [[sequencing]] begins with a culture of identical cells as a source of [[DNA]]. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be [[Microbiological culture|cultured]] and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S [[ribosomal]] [[RNA]] (rRNA) sequences which are relatively short, often [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S [[rRNA]] sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured [[species]], indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA genes taken directly from the environment revealed that [[Microbiological culture|cultivation]] based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and [[archaea]]l species in a sample.<ref name=\"Hugenholz1998\" /> Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed that the vast majority of microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.\n\nEarly [[molecular biology|molecular work]] in the field was conducted by [[Norman R. Pace]] and colleagues, who used [[PCR]] to explore the diversity of ribosomal RNA sequences.<ref name=\"Lane1985\"/> The insights gained from these breakthrough studies led Pace to propose the idea of cloning DNA directly from environmental samples as early as 1985.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Pace NR, Stahl DA, Lane DJ, Olsen GJ | chapter = The Analysis of Natural Microbial Populations by Ribosomal RNA Sequences |date=1986 |pages=1\u201355| veditors = Marshall KC | title =Advances in Microbial Ecology| volume = 9 |publisher=Springer US |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0611-6_1 |isbn=978-1-4757-0611-6 }}</ref> This led to the first report of isolating and [[DNA cloning|cloning]] bulk DNA from an environmental sample, published by Pace and colleagues in 1991<ref name=\"Pace1991\"/> while Pace was in the Department of Biology at [[Indiana University]]. Considerable efforts ensured that these were not [[PCR]] false positives and supported the existence of a complex community of unexplored species. Although this methodology was limited to exploring highly conserved, [[Noncoding DNA|non-protein coding genes]], it did support early microbial morphology-based observations that diversity was far more complex than was known by culturing methods. Soon after that, Healy reported the metagenomic isolation of functional genes from \"zoolibraries\" constructed from a complex culture of environmental organisms grown in the laboratory on dried [[grass]]es in 1995.<ref name=\"Healy1995\"/> After leaving the Pace laboratory, [[Edward DeLong]] continued in the field and has published work that has largely laid the groundwork for environmental phylogenies based on signature 16S sequences, beginning with his group's construction of libraries from [[marine biology|marine]] samples.<ref name=\"Stein1996\"/>\n\nIn 2002, [[Mya Breitbart]], [[Forest Rohwer]], and colleagues used environmental shotgun sequencing (see below) to show that 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses.<ref name=\"Breitbart2002\"/> Subsequent studies showed that there are more than a thousand [[viral species]] in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many [[bacteriophages]]. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Joint Genome Institute]] sequenced DNA extracted from an [[acid mine drainage]] system.<ref name=\"Tyson2004\"/> This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and [[archaea]] that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.<ref name=\"Hugenholz2002\"/>\n\n[[File:Flow diagram of a typical metagenome projects.tiff|thumb|200px|Flow diagram of a typical metagenome project<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas T, Gilbert J, Meyer F | title = Metagenomics - a guide from sampling to data analysis | journal = Microbial Informatics and Experimentation | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22587947 | pmc = 3351745 | doi = 10.1186/2042-5783-2-3 }}</ref>]]\nBeginning in 2003, [[Craig Venter]], leader of the privately funded parallel of the [[Human Genome Project]], has led the [[Global Ocean Sampling Expedition]] (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the [[Sargasso Sea]], found DNA from nearly 2000 different [[species]], including 148 types of [[bacteria]] never before seen.<ref name=\"Venter2004\"/> Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the [[West Coast of the United States]], and completed a two-year expedition to explore the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of [[plankton]].<ref name=\"yooseph2010\"/>\n\nIn 2005 Stephan C. Schuster at [[Penn State University]] and colleagues published the first sequences of an environmental sample generated with [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]], in this case massively parallel [[pyrosequencing]] developed by [[454 Life Sciences]].<ref name=\"Poinar2005\"/> Another early paper in this area appeared in 2006 by Robert Edwards, [[Forest Rohwer]], and colleagues at [[San Diego State University]].<ref name=\"Edwards2006\"/>\n\n==Sequencing==\n{{Main|DNA sequencing}}\n\nRecovery of DNA sequences longer than a few thousand [[base pair]]s from environmental [[Sample (material)|samples]] was very difficult until recent advances in [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] techniques allowed the construction of [[Library (biology)|libraries]] in [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs), which provided better [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] for [[molecular cloning]].<ref name=\"Beja2000\"/>\n[[File:Environmental shotgun sequencing.png|thumb|250px|Environmental Shotgun Sequencing (ESS). (A) Sampling from habitat; (B) filtering particles, typically by size; (C) Lysis and DNA extraction; (D) cloning and library construction; (E) sequencing the clones; (F) sequence assembly into contigs and scaffolds.]]\n\n===Shotgun metagenomics===\nAdvances in [[bioinformatics]], refinements of DNA amplification, and the proliferation of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of [[shotgun sequencing]] to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the [[human genome project|human genome]], randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and [[Sequence assembly|reconstructs]] them into a [[consensus sequence]]. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community.<ref name=\"segata2013\"/> Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.<ref name=\"Tyson2004\" /> \n\n===High-throughput sequencing===\nAn advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing one of the main biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling. The first metagenomic studies conducted using [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]] used massively parallel [[pyrosequencing|454 pyrosequencing]].<ref name=\"Poinar2005\"/> Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the [[Ion semiconductor sequencing|Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine]], the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] MiSeq or HiSeq and the [[ABI Solid Sequencing|Applied Biosystems SOLiD]] system.<ref name=\"rodrigue2010\"/> These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than [[Sanger sequencing]]; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400&nbsp;bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25\u201375&nbsp;bp reads.<ref name=\"schuster2008\"/> Historically, these read lengths were significantly shorter than the typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750&nbsp;bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200\u2013500&nbsp;megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20\u201350&nbsp;gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years.<ref name=\"nmeth2009\"/> \n\nAn emerging approach combines shotgun sequencing and [[chromosome conformation capture]] (Hi-C), which measures the proximity of any two DNA sequences within the same cell, to guide microbial genome assembly.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stewart RD, Auffret MD, Warr A, Wiser AH, Press MO, Langford KW, Liachko I, Snelling TJ, Dewhurst RJ, Walker AW,

data from genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher [[Fold coverage|coverage]] while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant.<ref name=\"committee2007\" /> Furthermore, the increased use of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA sequences]] that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample.<ref name=\"koonin2008\"/> Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric [[contig]]s.<ref name='koonin2008' />\n\nThere are several assembly programs, most of which can use information from [[paired-end tag]]s in order to improve the accuracy of assemblies. Some programs, such as [[Phrap]] or [[Celera]] Assembler, were designed to be used to assemble single [[genome]]s but nevertheless produce good results when assembling metagenomic data sets.<ref name='wooley2010' /> Other programs, such as [[Velvet assembler]], have been optimized for the shorter reads produced by second-generation sequencing through the use of [[de Bruijn graph]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Namiki T, Hachiya T, Tanaka H, Sakakibara Y | title = MetaVelvet: an extension of Velvet assembler to de novo metagenome assembly from short sequence reads | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 20 | pages = e155 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22821567 | pmc = 3488206 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks678 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zerbino DR, Birney E | title = Velvet: algorithms for de novo short read assembly using de Bruijn graphs | journal = Genome Research | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 821\u20139 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18349386 | pmc = 2336801 | doi = 10.1101/gr.074492.107 }}</ref> The use of reference genomes allows researchers to improve the assembly of the most abundant microbial species, but this approach is limited by the small subset of microbial phyla for which sequenced genomes are available.<ref name='koonin2008' /> After an assembly is created, an additional challenge is \"metagenomic deconvolution\", or determining which sequences come from which species in the sample.<ref name='Burton2014' />\n\n===Gene prediction===\n{{Main|Gene prediction}}\n\nMetagenomic analysis [[Pipeline (software)|pipelines]] use two approaches in the annotation of coding regions in the assembled contigs.<ref name='koonin2008' /> The first approach is to identify genes based upon [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with genes that are already publicly available in [[sequence database]]s, usually by [[BLAST]] searches. This type of approach is implemented in the program [[MEGAN]]4.<ref name=\"MEGAN2011\" /> The second, ''[[ab initio]]'', uses intrinsic features of the sequence to predict coding regions based upon gene training sets from related organisms. This is the approach taken by programs such as [[GeneMark]]<ref name=\"Zhu2010\" /> and [[GLIMMER]]. The main advantage of ''ab initio'' prediction is that it enables the detection of coding regions that lack homologs in the sequence databases; however, it is most accurate when there are large regions of contiguous genomic DNA available for comparison.<ref name=\"wooley2010\" />\n\n===Species diversity===\n[[File:A Novel Representation Of The Tree Of Life.png|400px|thumb|A 2016 representation of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hug LA, Baker BJ, Anantharaman K, Brown CT, Probst AJ, Castelle CJ, Butterfield CN, Hernsdorf AW, Amano Y, Ise K, Suzuki Y, Dudek N, Relman DA, Finstad KM, Amundson R, Thomas BC, Banfield JF | display-authors = 6 | title = A new view of the tree of life | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 16048 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27572647 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.48 }}</ref>]]\n{{Main|Species diversity}}\n\nGene annotations provide the \"what\", while measurements of [[Biodiversity|species diversity]] provide the \"who\".<ref name=\"konopka2008\"/> In order to connect community composition and function in metagenomes, sequences must be binned.

With the [https://motu-tool.org/ mOTUs profiler] is possible to profile species without a reference genome, improving the estimation of microbial community diversity.<ref name=\"milanese2019\"/> Recent methods, such as [https://github.com/seqan/slimm SLIMM], use read coverage landscape of individual reference genomes to minimize false-positive hits and get reliable relative abundances.<ref name=\"DadiRenard2017\"/> In composition based binning, methods use intrinsic features of the sequence, such as oligonucleotide frequencies or [[codon usage bias]].<ref name='wooley2010'/> Once sequences are binned, it is possible to carry out comparative analysis of diversity and richness.\n\n===Data integration===\n\nThe massive amount of exponentially growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that is complicated by the complexity of the [[metadata]] associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling.<ref name=\"committee2007\"/> This information is necessary both to ensure [[replicability]] and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).<ref name=\"pagani2011\"/>\n\nSeveral tools have been developed to integrate metadata and sequence data, allowing downstream comparative analyses of different datasets using a number of ecological indices. In 2007, Folker Meyer and Robert Edwards and a team at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] and the [[University of Chicago]] released the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology server ([[MG-RAST]]) a community resource for metagenome data set analysis.<ref name=\"Meyer2008\"/> As of June 2012 over 14.8 terabases (14x10<sup>12</sup> bases) of DNA have been analyzed, with more than 10,000 public data sets freely available for comparison within MG-RAST. Over 8,000 users now have submitted a total of 50,000 metagenomes to MG-RAST. The [[Integrated Microbial Genomes System|Integrated Microbial Genomes/Metagenomes]] (IMG/M) system also provides a collection of tools for functional analysis of microbial communities based on their metagenome sequence, based upon reference isolate genomes included from the [http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/w/main.cgi Integrated Microbial Genomes] (IMG) system and the [http://jgi.doe.gov/programs/GEBA/index.html Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA)] project.<ref name=\"markowitz2012\"/>\n\nOne of the first standalone tools for analysing high-throughput metagenome shotgun data was [[MEGAN]] (MEta Genome ANalyzer).<ref name=\"MEGAN2011\"/><ref name=\"MEGAN2007\"/> A first version of the program was used in 2005 to analyse the metagenomic context of DNA sequences obtained from a mammoth bone.<ref name=\"Poinar2005\" /> Based on a BLAST comparison against a reference database, this tool performs both taxonomic and functional binning, by placing the reads onto the nodes of the NCBI taxonomy using a simple lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm or onto the nodes of the [http://www.theseed.org/wiki/Main_Page SEED] or [[KEGG]] classifications, respectively.<ref name=\"mitra2011\"/>\n\nWith the advent of fast and inexpensive sequencing instruments, the growth of databases of DNA sequences is now exponential (e.g., the NCBI GenBank database <ref name=\"benson2013\"/>). Faster and efficient tools are needed to keep pace with the high-throughput sequencing, because the BLAST-based approaches such as MG-RAST or MEGAN run slowly to annotate large samples (e.g., several hours to process a small/medium size dataset/sample <ref name=\"bazinet2012\"/>). Thus, ultra-fast classifiers have recently emerged, thanks to more affordable powerful servers. These tools can perform the taxonomic annotation at extremely high speed, for example CLARK <ref name=\"ounit2015\"/> (according to CLARK's authors, it can classify accurately \"32 million metagenomic short reads per minute\"). At such a speed, a very large dataset/sample of a billion short reads can be processed in about 30 minutes.\n\nWith the increasing availability of samples containing ancient DNA and due to the uncertainty associated with the nature of those samples (ancient DNA damage),<ref name=\"falcon\">{{cite biorxiv | vauthors = Pratas D, Pinho AJ, Silva RM, Rodrigues JM, Hosseini M, Caetano T, Ferreira PJ |title=FALCON: a method to infer metagenomic composition of ancient DNA |date=February 2018 |biorxiv=267179 }}</ref> a fast tool capable of producing conservative similarity estimates has been made available. According to FALCON's authors, it can use relaxed thresholds and edit distances without affecting the memory and speed performance.\n\n===Comparative metagenomics===\n\nComparative analyses between metagenomes can provide additional insight into the function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health.<ref name=\"kurokawa2007\"/> Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made at the level of sequence composition (comparing [[GC-content]] or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be made on the basis of 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or\u2014in the case of low-diversity communities\u2014by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as [[Gene cluster|COG]] or [[KEGG]], and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance.<ref name=\"mitra2011\"/> This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the ''community'' as a whole rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.<ref name=\"wooley2010\" />\n\nAdditionally, several studies have also utilized oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al.<ref name=\"willner2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Willner D, Thurber RV, Rohwer F | title = Metagenomic signatures of 86 microbial and viral metagenomes | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 1752\u201366 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19302541 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01901.x }}</ref> and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al.<ref name = \"ghosh2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghosh TS, Mohammed MH, Rajasingh H, Chadaram S, Mande SS | title = HabiSign: a novel approach for comparison of metagenomes and rapid identification of habitat-specific sequences | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 12 Suppl 13 | issue = Supplement 13 | pages = S9 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22373355 | pmc = 3278849 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-12-s13-s9 }}</ref> This latter study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns can be used to identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats.

The [[similarity measure]] they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length ''k'' shared by pairs of reads.\n\nA key goal in comparative metagenomics is to identify microbial group(s) which are responsible for conferring specific characteristics to a given environment. However, due to issues in the sequencing technologies artifacts need to be accounted for like in metagenomeSeq.<ref name=\"paulson2013\" /> Others have characterized inter-microbial interactions between the resident microbial groups.

Notably, this layout algorithm also enables grouping of the metagenomes based on the probable inter-microbial interaction patterns rather than simply comparing abundance values of various taxonomic groups. In addition, the tool implements several interactive GUI-based functionalities that enable users to perform standard comparative analyses across microbiomes.\n\n==Data analysis==\n\n===Community metabolism===\nIn many bacterial communities, natural or engineered (such as [[bioreactor]]s), there is significant division of labor in metabolism ([[Syntrophy]]), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others.<ref name=\"werner2011\"/> In one such system, the [[methanogen]]ic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several [[syntrophy|syntrophic]] species ([[Syntrophobacterales]] and [[Synergistia]]) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste ([[methane]]).<ref name=\"mcinerney2009\"/> Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with [[microarray]]s or [[proteomics]] researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with [[metabolomic]]s and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.<ref name=\"kiltgord2011\"/>\n\n===Metatranscriptomics===\n{{Further|Transcriptome|Transcriptomics technologies}}\n{{Main|Metatranscriptomics}}\n\nMetagenomics allows researchers to access the functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> The extraction and analysis of metagenomic [[mRNA]] (the '''metatranscriptome''') provides information on the [[Gene regulation|regulation]] and [[Gene expression|expression]] profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the [[MRNA#Degradation|short half-life]] of mRNA, for example) in the collection of environmental RNA there have been relatively few ''[[In situ#Biology|in situ]]'' metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date.<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> While originally limited to [[DNA microarray|microarray]] technology, metatranscriptomics studies have made use of [[transcriptomics technologies]] to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community,<ref name=\"simon2011\"/> first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.<ref name=\"leininger2006\"/>\n\n===Viruses===\n{{Main|Viral metagenomics}}\n\nMetagenomic sequencing is particularly useful in the study of viral communities. As viruses lack a shared universal phylogenetic marker (as [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S RNA]] for bacteria and archaea, and [[18S ribosomal RNA|18S RNA]] for eukarya), the only way to access the genetic diversity of the viral community from an environmental sample is through metagenomics.

This is part of the [[Human Microbiome Project|Human Microbiome initiative]] with primary goals to determine if there is a core [[human microbiome]], to understand the changes in the human microbiome that can be correlated with human health, and to develop new technological and [[bioinformatics]] tools to support these goals.<ref name=\"NelsonWhite\" />\n\nAnother medical study as part of the MetaHit (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract) project consisted of 124 individuals from Denmark and Spain consisting of healthy, overweight, and irritable bowel disease patients. The study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria. Using Illumina GA sequence data and SOAPdenovo, a de Bruijn graph-based tool specifically designed for assembly short reads, they were able to generate 6.58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total contig length of 10.3 Gb and a N50 length of 2.2 kb.\n\nThe study demonstrated that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% of the known phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important for the health of the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients' gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.\n\nWhile these studies highlight some potentially valuable medical applications, only 31\u201348.8% of the reads could be aligned to 194 public human gut bacterial genomes and 7.6\u201321.2% to bacterial genomes available in GenBank which indicates that there is still far more research necessary to capture novel bacterial genomes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin J, Li R, Raes J, Arumugam M, Burgdorf KS, Manichanh C, Nielsen T, Pons N, Levenez F, Yamada T, Mende DR, Li J, Xu J, Li S, Li D, Cao J, Wang B, Liang H, Zheng H, Xie Y, Tap J, Lepage P, Bertalan M, Batto JM, Hansen T, Le Paslier D, Linneberg A, Nielsen HB, Pelletier E, Renault P, Sicheritz-Ponten T, Turner K, Zhu H, Yu C, Li S, Jian M, Zhou Y, Li Y, Zhang X, Li S, Qin N, Yang H, Wang J, Brunak S, Dor\u00e9 J, Guarner F, Kristiansen K, Pedersen O, Parkhill J, Weissenbach J, Bork P, Ehrlich SD, Wang J | display-authors = 6 | title = A human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing | journal = Nature | volume = 464 | issue = 7285 | pages = 59\u201365 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20203603 | pmc = 3779803 | doi = 10.1038/nature08821 | bibcode = 2010Natur.464...59. }}</ref>\n\n===Infectious disease diagnosis===\nDifferentiating between infectious and non-infectious illness, and identifying the underlying etiology of infection, can be quite challenging.

He advocated and implemented close ties of the military to science for purposes of advanced weapons development. He was the head of the Army Ordnance Office, Senator of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]], first president of the Reich Research Council, the first general officer to be a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, as well as being a professor at both the University of Berlin and the Berlin Technical University. He was an early and key supporter of the development of ballistic rockets as weapons. The military-scientific infrastructure he helped implement supported the German nuclear energy program, known as the Uranium Club. Being depressed over heavy criticism from Hitler for shortfalls in munitions production, he committed suicide in 1940. He was given a State funeral.\n\n==Career==\n\nFrom 1898, Becker was a military engineer.<ref name=\"HH F Becker\">{{Harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|loc=Appendix F; see the entry for Carl Becker}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1901 to 1903, Becker studied at the Munich Artillery and Engineering School. From 1906 to 1911, he studied at the Berlin Military Engineering Academy, specializing in [[ballistics]] under Carl Julius Cranz; from 1908 to 1911, he was a teaching assistant at the Ballistics Laboratory there. From 1911 to 1914, he was a member of the Artillery Examining Board.<ref name=\"HH F Becker\"/>  In 1913, Becker co-authored a revision of Cranz' classic text, ''Lehrbuch der Ballistik''.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Becker held two positions. From 1914 to 1916, he commanded a [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|42-cm mortar]] battery. From 1917 to 1919, he was an advisor on artillery ballistics at the Weapons and Equipment Inspection (''Inspektion f\u00fcr Waffen und Ger\u00e4t''), which later became the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (HWA, Army Ordnance Office).<ref name=\"HH F Becker\"/><ref>''Document 75. [[Erich Schumann|E. Schumann]]: Armed Forces and Research'' p. 209, in {{Harvnb|Hentschel|Hentschel|1996|pp=207\u2013220}}.</ref>\n\nFrom 1919 to 1923, Becker studied [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]]. He was awarded a doctorate of engineering in 1922, with a thesis on [[cathode|cathodic]] change of [[phenol]].<ref name=\"HH F Becker\"/>\n\nFrom 1922, Major Becker was an advisor to the HWA inspections office.<ref name=\"HH F Becker\"/>\n\nBecker was aware of the advantages of a close relationship between the military and science in the development of future weapons technology. As early as 1924, he recommended the establishment of a central laboratory of chemistry and physics. But only when he was director of the Ballistics and Ammunition Department of the Weapons and Equipment Inspection (''Inspektion f\u00fcr Waffen und Ger\u00e4t'') was he able to implement his recommendation.

He was the head of the Army Ordnance Office, Senator of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]], first president of the Reich Research Council, the first general officer to be a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, as well as being a professor at both the University of Berlin and the Berlin Technical University. He was an early and key supporter of the development of ballistic rockets as weapons. The military-scientific infrastructure he helped implement supported the German nuclear energy program, known as the Uranium Club. Being depressed over heavy criticism from Hitler for shortfalls in munitions production, he committed suicide in 1940.

From 1906 to 1911, he studied at the Berlin Military Engineering Academy, specializing in [[ballistics]] under Carl Julius Cranz; from 1908 to 1911, he was a teaching assistant at the Ballistics Laboratory there. From 1911 to 1914, he was a member of the Artillery Examining Board.<ref name=\"HH F Becker\"/>  In 1913, Becker co-authored a revision of Cranz' classic text, ''Lehrbuch der Ballistik''.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Becker held two positions. From 1914 to 1916, he commanded a [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|42-cm mortar]] battery. From 1917 to 1919, he was an advisor on artillery ballistics at the Weapons and Equipment Inspection (''Inspektion f\u00fcr Waffen und Ger\u00e4t''), which later became the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (HWA, Army Ordnance Office).<ref name=\"HH F Becker\"/><ref>''Document 75.
