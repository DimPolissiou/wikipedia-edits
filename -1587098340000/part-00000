It was originally to be released in 2019 by [[RCA Records]], but now the release date is undetermined.<ref name=\"Surgery\"/> Cyrus completed the original version of the album between 2017 and May 2019, and stated that work began shortly before the release of her sixth studio album ''[[Younger Now]]'' in September 2017. However, recording sessions continued following several happenings in Cyrus' personal life, including the end of her relationship with husband [[Liam Hemsworth]] in August 2019. Cyrus' health issues and vocal cord surgery in November 2019 delayed progress on the project until early 2020.\n\n''She Is Miley Cyrus'' is described by Cyrus as \"genre-less\" and a \"mosaic of all the things that [she's] been before.\" She stated that it would feature elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[alternative music]] that are commonly associated with her fourth and fifth studio albums ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013) and ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]'' (2015), and are in contrast to the [[country pop]] sound of ''Younger Now''. Cyrus collaborated with producers including [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Mark Ronson]], and [[Andrew Wyatt]] from [[Miike Snow]]. Featured artists will include [[Ghostface Killah]], [[RuPaul]], and [[Swae Lee]].\n\n''She Is Miley Cyrus'' will consist of three six-song EPs &ndash; ''[[She Is Coming]]'', ''She Is Here'', and ''She Is Everything'' &ndash; which will be released before the full-length album. The first EP was released on May 31, 2019; although the second EP was to be released mid-year and the third EP was to be released by the end of 2019, their release dates are unscheduled {{as of|2020|03|lc=y}}. The lead single, \"[[Mother's Daughter (song)|Mother's Daughter]]\", was released from ''She Is Coming'' on June 11, 2019, and peaked at number 54 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second single, \"[[Slide Away (Miley Cyrus song)|Slide Away]]\", was released separately from the EPs on August 16, and peaked at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"capfm\"/>\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"[''Younger Now''] was obviously a little bit more country influenced, but I still really love pop music and I love music that can be played at the club.\"\n| source = \u2014 Cyrus discussing her shift in musical direction since ''Younger Now'' (2017)<ref name=\"Teases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3106509/miley-cyrus-teases-seventh-album-mike-will-made-it/|title=Miley Cyrus's Next Album Will Probably Sound More Like Bangerz Than Younger Now|last=Roth|first=Madeline|publisher=MTV|date=December 11, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref>\n| width  = 25%\n| align  = left\n}}\n\nCyrus grew distant from the mainstream hip hop culture she was involved with while working on her albums ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013) and ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]'' (2015), and leaned towards \"rootsy\" country music elements while making her sixth studio album ''[[Younger Now]]'' (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7783997/miley-cyrus-cover-story-new-music-malibu|title=Miley Cyrus Breaks Silence on Rootsy New Music, Fiance Liam Hemsworth & America: 'Unity Is What We Need'|last=Norris|first=John|work=Billboard|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref> The album was released on September 29, 2017 to lukewarm critical and commercial performance.

It was originally to be released in 2019 by [[RCA Records]], but now the release date is undetermined.<ref name=\"Surgery\"/> Cyrus completed the original version of the album between 2017 and May 2019, and stated that work began shortly before the release of her sixth studio album ''[[Younger Now]]'' in September 2017. However, recording sessions continued following several happenings in Cyrus' personal life, including the end of her relationship with husband [[Liam Hemsworth]] in August 2019. Cyrus' health issues and vocal cord surgery in November 2019 delayed progress on the project until early 2020.\n\n''She Is Miley Cyrus'' is described by Cyrus as \"genre-less\" and a \"mosaic of all the things that [she's] been before.\" She stated that it would feature elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[alternative music]] that are commonly associated with her fourth and fifth studio albums ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013) and ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]'' (2015), and are in contrast to the [[country pop]] sound of ''Younger Now''. Cyrus collaborated with producers including [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Mark Ronson]], and [[Andrew Wyatt]] from [[Miike Snow]]. Featured artists will include [[Ghostface Killah]], [[RuPaul]], and [[Swae Lee]].\n\n''She Is Miley Cyrus'' will consist of three six-song EPs &ndash; ''[[She Is Coming]]'', ''She Is Here'', and ''She Is Everything'' &ndash; which will be released before the full-length album. The first EP was released on May 31, 2019; although the second EP was to be released mid-year and the third EP was to be released by the end of 2019, their release dates are unscheduled {{as of|2020|03|lc=y}}. The lead single, \"[[Mother's Daughter (song)|Mother's Daughter]]\", was released from ''She Is Coming'' on June 11, 2019, and peaked at number 54 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second single, \"[[Slide Away (Miley Cyrus song)|Slide Away]]\", was released separately from the EPs on August 16, and peaked at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"capfm\"/>\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"[''Younger Now''] was obviously a little bit more country influenced, but I still really love pop music and I love music that can be played at the club.\"\n| source = \u2014 Cyrus discussing her shift in musical direction since ''Younger Now'' (2017)<ref name=\"Teases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3106509/miley-cyrus-teases-seventh-album-mike-will-made-it/|title=Miley Cyrus's Next Album Will Probably Sound More Like Bangerz Than Younger Now|last=Roth|first=Madeline|publisher=MTV|date=December 11, 2018|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref>\n| width  = 25%\n| align  = left\n}}\n\nCyrus grew distant from the mainstream hip hop culture she was involved with while working on her albums ''[[Bangerz]]'' (2013) and ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]'' (2015), and leaned towards \"rootsy\" country music elements while making her sixth studio album ''[[Younger Now]]'' (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7783997/miley-cyrus-cover-story-new-music-malibu|title=Miley Cyrus Breaks Silence on Rootsy New Music, Fiance Liam Hemsworth & America: 'Unity Is What We Need'|last=Norris|first=John|work=Billboard|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=December 17, 2018}}</ref> The album was released on September 29, 2017 to lukewarm critical and commercial performance.

The song is also associated with the region, having been used by the supporters of [[Bobby Shafto|Robert Shafto]] (sometimes spelt Shaftoe), who was an eighteenth-century [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for County Durham (c. 1730\u201397), and later the borough of [[Downton (UK Parliament constituency)|Downton]] in [[Wiltshire]].<ref name=opie1997/> Supporters used another verse in the 1761 election:\n\n:Bobby Shafto's looking out,\n:All his ribbons flew about,\n:All the ladies gave a shout,\n:Hey for Bobby Shafto!<ref name=opie1997/>\n\nThe song is said to relate the story of how he broke the heart of Bridget Belasyse of [[Brancepeth Castle]], County Durham, where his brother Thomas was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], when he married Anne Duncombe of [[Duncombe Park]] in Yorkshire.

The song is also associated with the region, having been used by the supporters of [[Bobby Shafto|Robert Shafto]] (sometimes spelt Shaftoe), who was an eighteenth-century [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for County Durham (c. 1730\u201397), and later the borough of [[Downton (UK Parliament constituency)|Downton]] in [[Wiltshire]].<ref name=opie1997/> Supporters used another verse in the 1761 election:\n\n:Bobby Shafto's looking out,\n:All his ribbons flew about,\n:All the ladies gave a shout,\n:Hey for Bobby Shafto!<ref name=opie1997/>\n\nThe song is said to relate the story of how he broke the heart of Bridget Belasyse of [[Brancepeth Castle]], County Durham, where his brother Thomas was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], when he married Anne Duncombe of [[Duncombe Park]] in Yorkshire.

The platform on which food is printed consists of a standard 3-axis stage with a computer controlled extrusion head. This extrusion head pushes food materials through a nozzle typically by way of compressed air or squeezing. The nozzles can vary with respect to what type of food is being extruded or the desired printing speed<ref>Mantihal, S., Prakash, S., Godoi, F. C., & Bhandari, B. (2017). Optimization of chocolate 3D printing by correlating thermal and flow properties with 3D structure modeling. ''Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies'', ''44'', 21\u201329. doi: 10.1016/j.ifset.2017.09.012</ref> (typically the smaller the nozzle the longer the food printing will take). As the food is printed, the extrusion head moves along the 3-axis stage printing the desired food. Some printed food requires additional processing such as baking or frying before consumption.\n\nExtrusion based food printers can be purchased for household use, are typically compact in size, and have a low maintenance cost. Comparatively, extrusion based printing provides the user with more material choices. However, these food materials are usually soft, and as a result, makes printing complex food structures difficult. In addition, long fabrication times and deformations due to temperature fluctuations with additional baking or frying require further research and development to overcome.\n\n=====Hot-melt and room temperature=====\nIn Hot-melt extrusion, the extrusion head heats the food material slightly above the material's melting point. The melted material is then extruded from the head and then solidifies soon thereafter. This allows the material to be easily manipulated into the desired form or model. Foods such as chocolate are used in this technique because of its ability to melt and solidify quickly.<ref name=\":3\">Hao, L., Mellor, S., Seaman, O., Henderson, J., Sewell, N., & Sloan, M. (2010). Material characterization and process development for chocolate additive layer manufacturing. ''Virtual and Physical Prototyping'', ''5''(2), 57-64.</ref>\n\nOther food materials do not inherently require a heating element in order to be printed. Food materials such as jelly, frosting, puree, and similar food materials with appropriate viscosity can be printed at room temperature without prior melting.\n\n====Selective laser sintering====\n[[File:SelectiveLaserSintering.svg|thumb|451x451px|Selective Laser Sintering Process]]\nIn [[selective laser sintering]], powdered food materials are heated by and bonded together forming a solid structure. This process is completed by bonding the powdered material layer by layer with a laser as the heat source. After a layer is completed with the desired areas bonded, it is then covered by a new unbonded layer of powder. Certain parts of this new unbonded layer are heated by the laser in order to bond it with the structure. This process continues in a vertical upwards manner until the desired food model is constructed. After construction, unbonded material can then be recycled and used to print another food model.\n\nSelective laser sintering enables the construction of complex shapes and models and the ability to create different food textures. It is limited by the range of suitable food materials, namely powdered ingredients.<ref name=\":0\">CandyFab (2007). The CandyFab project. Available at <nowiki>http://wiki</nowiki>. candyfab.org/Main_Page. Accessed Dec 2019</ref> Due to this limitation, selective laser sintering has been used primarily for creating sweets/candies.\n\n====Binder jetting====\n[[File:BinderJetting.svg|thumb|274x274px|Binder Jetting Process]]\nSimilarly to selective laser sintering, binder jetting uses powdered food materials to create a model layer by layer. Instead of using heat to bond the materials together, a liquid binder is used. After bonding the desired areas of a layer, a new layer of powder is then spread over the bonded layer covering it. Certain parts of this new layer are then bonded to the previous layer. The process is repeated until the desired food model is constructed.\n\nAs with selective laser sintering, binder jetting enables the construction of complex shapes and models and the ability to create different food textures.<ref name=\":4\">Southerland, D., Walters, P., & Huson, D.

This includes processing activities such as baking, frying, cleaning, etc. This phase can be one of the most critical to 3D printed food, as the printed food needs to be safe for consumption. An additional concern in post processing is the deformation of the printed food due to the strain of these additional processes. Current methods involve trial and error. That is, combining food additives with the materials/ingredients to  improve the integrity of complex structures and to ensure the printed structure retains its shape.<ref name=\":7\" /> Additives such as [[transglutaminase]]<ref name=\":7\" /> and [[:de:Hydrokolloide|hydrocolloids]]<ref name=\":2\" /> have been added to ingredients in order to help retain the printed shape while printing and after cooking.\n\nAdditionally, recent research has produced a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBpolaB4DqA visual simulation] for baking breads, cookies, pancakes and similar materials that consist of dough or batter (mixtures of water, flour, eggs, fat, sugar and leavening agents).<ref>Ding, M., Han, X., Wang, S., Gast, T.

Among other reasons, this has led to the new promising technology of meat bioprinting. One alternative to livestock farming is cultured meat, also known as lab-grown meat. [[Cultured meat]] is produced by taking a small biopsy from animals, extracting the [[myosatellite cell]]s and adding growth serum to multiply the cells. The resulting product is then used as a material for bioprinting meat. The post-processing phase, among other steps, includes adding flavour, vitamins and iron to the product. Yet another alternative is printing a [[meat analogue]]. [[Novameat]], a Spanish startup has been able to print a plant-based steak and mimic the texture and appearance of real meat.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.3dnatives.com/en/3d-printed-meat-040620194/|title=3D printed meat, is the future of meat meatless?|date=2019-06-04|website=3Dnatives|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==== Creative food design ====\n[[File:Menjar elaborat per Foodini.jpg|thumb|Chef storytelling: Alvar Aalto Vase]]\nFood presentation and food appearance customization for individuals is a big trend in the food industry. So far food customization and creative designs have required hand-made skills, which results in low production rate and high cost. 3D food printing can overcome this problem by providing the necessary tools for creative food design even for home users.<ref name=\":1\" /> 3D food printing has enabled some intricate designs which cannot be accomplished with traditional food manufacturing. Brand logos, text, signatures, pictures can now be printed on some food products like pastries and coffee. Complex geometric shapes have also been printed, mainly using sugar. With 3D printing, chefs can now turn their visual inspirations into signature culinary creations. Another benefit is being able to print nutritious meals in shapes that appeal to children.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Reduced food waste ====\nWorldwide, one third of the total food produced for consumption, around 1.6 billion tons per year, goes to waste. Food waste happens during processing, distribution and consumption. 3D food printing is a very promising way of reducing food waste during the phase of consumption, by utilizing food products like meat off-cuts, distorted fruits and vegetables, sea food by-products and perishables. These products can be processed in a suitable form for printing.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SQl2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA373&lpg=PA373&dq=Chapter+13+-+Future+Outlook+of+3D+Food+Printing#v=onepage&q=Chapter%2013%20-%20Future%20Outlook%20of%203D%20Food%20Printing&f=false|title=Fundamentals of 3D Food Printing and Applications|last=Godoi|first=Fernanda C.|last2=Bhandari|first2=Bhesh R.|last3=Prakash|first3=Sangeeta|last4=Zhang|first4=Min|date=2018-11-02|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-814565-4|language=en}}</ref> Upprinting Food, a Dutch startup, has been blending and combining different ingredients from food waste to create purees which are then used as materials for 3D printing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3dnatives.com/en/3d-printed-snacks-210220195/|title=Food waste converted into delicious 3D printed snacks|date=2019-02-21|website=3Dnatives|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> Chefs are also creating different dishes from leftover food using 3D food printers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waste360.com/food-waste/3d-printer-helps-chefs-get-creative-while-cutting-food-waste|title=3D Printer Helps Chefs Get Creative While Cutting Food Waste|date=2020-01-08|website=Waste360|language=en|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n==== Structure ====\nUnlike traditionally prepared food, the variety of food that can be manufactured using 3D printing is limited by the physical characteristics of the materials. Food materials are generally much softer than the weakest plastic used in 3D printing, making the printed structures very fragile.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2014/1/8/the-six-challenges-of-3d-food-printing.html|title=The Six Challenges of 3D Food Printing|website=Fabbaloo|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> So far, most studies use trial and error as an approach to overcoming this challenge, but scientists are working on developing new methods that are able to predict the behavior of different materials during the printing process. These methods are developed by analyzing the [[Rheology|rheological]] properties of the materials and their relation to the printing stability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Sicong|last2=Stieger|first2=Markus A.|last3=van der Goot|first3=Atze Jan|last4=Schutyser|first4=Maarten A.

This makes the designing process a very complex task and so far there is no available software that accounts for that. Building such software is also a complex task due to the vast variety of food materials.<ref name=\":8\" /> Considering that personal users who incorporate 3D food printing in their kitchens represent a significant part of the overall users, the design of the software interface adds to the complexity. The interface of such software should be simple and have high [[usability]] while still providing enough features and customization options for the user without causing cognitive overload.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Speed ====\nThe current speed of 3D printing food could be sufficient for home use, but the process is very slow  for mass production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://all3dp.com/1/3d-printed-food-3d-printing-food/|title=3D Printed Food: A Culinary Guide to 3D Printing Food|website=All3DP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Simple designs take 1 to 2 minutes, detailed designs take 3 to 7 minutes, and more intricate designs take even longer.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://3dfoodprinting.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-3D-Food-Printing041419.pdf|title=The Ultimate Guide to 3D Food Printing|last=Kakuk|first=Collette|date=2019|website=3dfoodprinting.us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The speed of printing food is tightly correlated to the rheological properties of the materials. Research shows that high printing speed results in low fidelity samples due to the dragging effect, while very low speed causes instability in material deposition.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nIn order for 3D food printing to find its way to the food industry, the printing speed needs improvement or the cost of such technology should be affordable enough for companies to operate several printers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://3dfoodprintingconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Nesli-Sozer-3D-Food-Printing-Conference_Sozer28062017.pdf|title=3D food printing: A Disruptive Food Manufacturing Technology|last=S\u00f6zer|first=Venlo Nesli|date=28 June 2017|website=3dfoodprintingconference|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Multi-material printing ====\nThe color, flavor and texture of food are of crucial importance when fabricating an edible product, thus in most cases it is required that a food printer supports multi-material printing. The current available 3D food printers are limited to using a few different materials due to the challenge of developing multiple extruder capabilities. This limits the variety of food products that can be 3D printed, leaving out complex dishes that require a lot of different materials.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Safety ====\nWhen 3D printing food, the safety is very crucial. A food printer must ensure safety along the entire path taken by the food material.<ref name=\":8\" /> Due to the possibility of food getting stuck somewhere along the path, bacteria accumulation is a major concern. Microbial stability is a crucial parameter of the quality of the printed food, thus it needs to be addressed both during the design of the printer and during the printing process.<ref name=\":12\" /> On the other hand, the materials that come into contact with the food are not a concern since high quality printers use stainless steal and BPA-free materials.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Copyright ====\nExisting food products in the market such as chocolates in various shapes could easily be scanned and the obtained 3D models could be used to replicate those products. These 3D models could then be disseminated via Internet leading to copyright infringement. There are laws regulating copyright issues but it is not clear whether they will be sufficient to cover all aspects of a field like 3D food printing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dlg.org/fileadmin/downloads/food/Expertenwissen/Lebensmitteltechnologie/e_2017_4_Expertenwissen_3_D_Druck.pdf|title=3D Food printing: What options the new technology offers|last=Vogt|first=Sebastian|date=2017|website=DLG|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[3D printing|3D Printing]]\n* [[Multi-material 3D printing]]\n* [[3D bioprinting]]\n* [[3D scanning|3D Scanning]]\n* [[3D modeling|3D Modelling]]\n* [[Fused filament fabrication|Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)]]\n* [[selective laser sintering|Selective Laser Sintering]]\n* [[Inkjet printing|Inkjet Printing]]\n* [[Internet of things|IoT]]\n* [[Fab@Home]]\n* [[Transglutaminase]]\n* [[:de:Hydrokolloide|Hydrocolloids]]\n* [[Viscosity]]\n* [[Entomophagy]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:3D printing]]\n[[Category:Food preparation]]\n", "text_old": "'''3D food printing''' is the process of manufacturing food products using a variety of additive manufacturing techniques.

The platform on which food is printed consists of a standard 3-axis stage with a computer controlled extrusion head. This extrusion head pushes food materials through a nozzle typically by way of compressed air or squeezing. The nozzles can vary with respect to what type of food is being extruded or the desired printing speed<ref>Mantihal, S., Prakash, S., Godoi, F. C., & Bhandari, B. (2017). Optimization of chocolate 3D printing by correlating thermal and flow properties with 3D structure modeling. ''Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies'', ''44'', 21\u201329. doi: 10.1016/j.ifset.2017.09.012</ref> (typically the smaller the nozzle the longer the food printing will take). As the food is printed, the extrusion head moves along the 3-axis stage printing the desired food. Some printed food requires additional processing such as baking or frying before consumption.\n\nExtrusion based food printers can be purchased for household use, are typically compact in size, and have a low maintenance cost. Comparatively, extrusion based printing provides the user with more material choices. However, these food materials are usually soft, and as a result, makes printing complex food structures difficult. In addition, long fabrication times and deformations due to temperature fluctuations with additional baking or frying require further research and development to overcome.\n\n=====Hot-melt and room temperature=====\nIn Hot-melt extrusion, the extrusion head heats the food material slightly above the material's melting point. The melted material is then extruded from the head and then solidifies soon thereafter. This allows the material to be easily manipulated into the desired form or model. Foods such as chocolate are used in this technique because of its ability to melt and solidify quickly.<ref name=\":3\">Hao, L., Mellor, S., Seaman, O., Henderson, J., Sewell, N., & Sloan, M. (2010). Material characterization and process development for chocolate additive layer manufacturing. ''Virtual and Physical Prototyping'', ''5''(2), 57-64.</ref>\n\nOther food materials do not inherently require a heating element in order to be printed. Food materials such as jelly, frosting, puree, and similar food materials with appropriate viscosity can be printed at room temperature without prior melting.\n\n====Selective laser sintering====\n[[File:SelectiveLaserSintering.svg|thumb|451x451px|Selective Laser Sintering Process]]\nIn [[selective laser sintering]], powdered food materials are heated by and bonded together forming a solid structure. This process is completed by bonding the powdered material layer by layer with a laser as the heat source. After a layer is completed with the desired areas bonded, it is then covered by a new unbonded layer of powder. Certain parts of this new unbonded layer are heated by the laser in order to bond it with the structure. This process continues in a vertical upwards manner until the desired food model is constructed. After construction, unbonded material can then be recycled and used to print another food model.\n\nSelective laser sintering enables the construction of complex shapes and models and the ability to create different food textures. It is limited by the range of suitable food materials, namely powdered ingredients.<ref name=\":0\">CandyFab (2007). The CandyFab project. Available at <nowiki>http://wiki</nowiki>. candyfab.org/Main_Page. Accessed Dec 2019</ref> Due to this limitation, selective laser sintering has been used primarily for creating sweets/candies.\n\n====Binder jetting====\n[[File:BinderJetting.svg|thumb|274x274px|Binder Jetting Process]]\nSimilarly to selective laser sintering, binder jetting uses powdered food materials to create a model layer by layer. Instead of using heat to bond the materials together, a liquid binder is used. After bonding the desired areas of a layer, a new layer of powder is then spread over the bonded layer covering it. Certain parts of this new layer are then bonded to the previous layer. The process is repeated until the desired food model is constructed.\n\nAs with selective laser sintering, binder jetting enables the construction of complex shapes and models and the ability to create different food textures.<ref name=\":4\">Southerland, D., Walters, P., & Huson, D.

Foodjet. Available at: <nowiki>http://foodjet.nl/</nowiki>. Accessed Dec 2019</ref> By utilizing gravity, edible food ink is dropped onto the surface of the food, typically a cookie, cake, or other candy.

In one instance, multiple printheads are used to print multiple materials/ingredients, as this can speed up production, efficiency, and lead to interesting design patterns.<ref name=\":5\" /> In another instance, there is one printhead, and when a different ingredient is required, the printer exchanges the material being printed.<ref>Foodini (2014).

This includes processing activities such as baking, frying, cleaning, etc. This phase can be one of the most critical to 3D printed food, as the printed food needs to be safe for consumption. An additional concern in post processing is the deformation of the printed food due to the strain of these additional processes. Current methods involve trial and error. That is, combining food additives with the materials/ingredients to  improve the integrity of complex structures and to ensure the printed structure retains its shape.<ref name=\":7\" /> Additives such as [[transglutaminase]]<ref name=\":7\" /> and [[:de:Hydrokolloide|hydrocolloids]]<ref name=\":2\" /> have been added to ingredients in order to help retain the printed shape while printing and after cooking.\n\nAdditionally, recent research has produced a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBpolaB4DqA visual simulation] for baking breads, cookies, pancakes and similar materials that consist of dough or batter (mixtures of water, flour, eggs, fat, sugar and leavening agents).<ref>Ding, M., Han, X., Wang, S., Gast, T.

Among other reasons, this has led to the new promising technology of meat bioprinting. One alternative to livestock farming is cultured meat, also known as lab-grown meat. [[Cultured meat]] is produced by taking a small biopsy from animals, extracting the [[myosatellite cell]]s and adding growth serum to multiply the cells. The resulting product is then used as a material for bioprinting meat. The post-processing phase, among other steps, includes adding flavour, vitamins and iron to the product. Yet another alternative is printing a [[meat analogue]]. [[Novameat]], a Spanish startup has been able to print a plant-based steak and mimic the texture and appearance of real meat.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.3dnatives.com/en/3d-printed-meat-040620194/|title=3D printed meat, is the future of meat meatless?|date=2019-06-04|website=3Dnatives|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==== Creative food design ====\n[[File:Menjar elaborat per Foodini.jpg|thumb|Chef storytelling: Alvar Aalto Vase]]\nFood presentation and food appearance customization for individuals is a big trend in the food industry. So far food customization and creative designs have required hand-made skills, which results in low production rate and high cost. 3D food printing can overcome this problem by providing the necessary tools for creative food design even for home users.<ref name=\":1\" /> 3D food printing has enabled some intricate designs which cannot be accomplished with traditional food manufacturing. Brand logos, text, signatures, pictures can now be printed on some food products like pastries and coffee. Complex geometric shapes have also been printed, mainly using sugar. With 3D printing, chefs can now turn their visual inspirations into signature culinary creations. Another benefit is being able to print nutritious meals in shapes that appeal to children.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Reduced food waste ====\nWorldwide, one third of the total food produced for consumption, around 1.6 billion tons per year, goes to waste. Food waste happens during processing, distribution and consumption. 3D food printing is a very promising way of reducing food waste during the phase of consumption, by utilizing food products like meat off-cuts, distorted fruits and vegetables, sea food by-products and perishables. These products can be processed in a suitable form for printing.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SQl2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA373&lpg=PA373&dq=Chapter+13+-+Future+Outlook+of+3D+Food+Printing#v=onepage&q=Chapter%2013%20-%20Future%20Outlook%20of%203D%20Food%20Printing&f=false|title=Fundamentals of 3D Food Printing and Applications|last=Godoi|first=Fernanda C.|last2=Bhandari|first2=Bhesh R.|last3=Prakash|first3=Sangeeta|last4=Zhang|first4=Min|date=2018-11-02|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-814565-4|language=en}}</ref> Upprinting Food, a Dutch startup, has been blending and combining different ingredients from food waste to create purees which are then used as materials for 3D printing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3dnatives.com/en/3d-printed-snacks-210220195/|title=Food waste converted into delicious 3D printed snacks|date=2019-02-21|website=3Dnatives|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> Chefs are also creating different dishes from leftover food using 3D food printers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waste360.com/food-waste/3d-printer-helps-chefs-get-creative-while-cutting-food-waste|title=3D Printer Helps Chefs Get Creative While Cutting Food Waste|date=2020-01-08|website=Waste360|language=en|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n==== Structure ====\nUnlike traditionally prepared food, the variety of food that can be manufactured using 3D printing is limited by the physical characteristics of the materials. Food materials are generally much softer than the weakest plastic used in 3D printing, making the printed structures very fragile.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2014/1/8/the-six-challenges-of-3d-food-printing.html|title=The Six Challenges of 3D Food Printing|website=Fabbaloo|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> So far, most studies use trial and error as an approach to overcoming this challenge, but scientists are working on developing new methods that are able to predict the behavior of different materials during the printing process. These methods are developed by analyzing the [[Rheology|rheological]] properties of the materials and their relation to the printing stability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Sicong|last2=Stieger|first2=Markus A.|last3=van der Goot|first3=Atze Jan|last4=Schutyser|first4=Maarten A.

This makes the designing process a very complex task and so far there is no available software that accounts for that. Building such software is also a complex task due to the vast variety of food materials.<ref name=\":8\" /> Considering that personal users who incorporate 3D food printing in their kitchens represent a significant part of the overall users, the design of the software interface adds to the complexity. The interface of such software should be simple and have high [[usability]] while still providing enough features and customization options for the user without causing cognitive overload.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Speed ====\nThe current speed of 3D printing food could be sufficient for home use, but the process is very slow  for mass production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://all3dp.com/1/3d-printed-food-3d-printing-food/|title=3D Printed Food: A Culinary Guide to 3D Printing Food|website=All3DP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Simple designs take 1 to 2 minutes, detailed designs take 3 to 7 minutes, and more intricate designs take even longer.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://3dfoodprinting.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-3D-Food-Printing041419.pdf|title=The Ultimate Guide to 3D Food Printing|last=Kakuk|first=Collette|date=2019|website=3dfoodprinting.us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The speed of printing food is tightly correlated to the rheological properties of the materials. Research shows that high printing speed results in low fidelity samples due to the dragging effect, while very low speed causes instability in material deposition.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nIn order for 3D food printing to find its way to the food industry, the printing speed needs improvement or the cost of such technology should be affordable enough for companies to operate several printers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://3dfoodprintingconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Nesli-Sozer-3D-Food-Printing-Conference_Sozer28062017.pdf|title=3D food printing: A Disruptive Food Manufacturing Technology|last=S\u00f6zer|first=Venlo Nesli|date=28 June 2017|website=3dfoodprintingconference|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Multi-material printing ====\nThe color, flavor and texture of food are of crucial importance when fabricating an edible product, thus in most cases it is required that a food printer supports multi-material printing. The current available 3D food printers are limited to using a few different materials due to the challenge of developing multiple extruder capabilities. This limits the variety of food products that can be 3D printed, leaving out complex dishes that require a lot of different materials.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Safety ====\nWhen 3D printing food, the safety is very crucial. A food printer must ensure safety along the entire path taken by the food material.<ref name=\":8\" /> Due to the possibility of food getting stuck somewhere along the path, bacteria accumulation is a major concern. Microbial stability is a crucial parameter of the quality of the printed food, thus it needs to be addressed both during the design of the printer and during the printing process.<ref name=\":12\" /> On the other hand, the materials that come into contact with the food are not a concern since high quality printers use stainless steal and BPA-free materials.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Copyright ====\nExisting food products in the market such are chocolates in various shapes could easily be scanned and the obtained 3D models could be used to replicate those products. These 3D models could then be disseminated via Internet leading to copyright infringement. There are laws regulating copyright issues but it is not clear whether they will be sufficient to cover all aspects of a field like 3D food printing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dlg.org/fileadmin/downloads/food/Expertenwissen/Lebensmitteltechnologie/e_2017_4_Expertenwissen_3_D_Druck.pdf|title=3D Food printing: What options the new technology offers|last=Vogt|first=Sebastian|date=2017|website=DLG|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[3D printing|3D Printing]]\n* [[Multi-material 3D printing]]\n* [[3D bioprinting]]\n* [[3D scanning|3D Scanning]]\n* [[3D modeling|3D Modelling]]\n* [[Fused filament fabrication|Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)]]\n* [[selective laser sintering|Selective Laser Sintering]]\n* [[Inkjet printing|Inkjet Printing]]\n* [[Internet of things|IoT]]\n* [[Fab@Home]]\n* [[Transglutaminase]]\n* [[:de:Hydrokolloide|Hydrocolloids]]\n* [[Viscosity]]\n* [[Entomophagy]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:3D printing]]\n[[Category:Food preparation]]\n", "name_user": "Billposer", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCopyright:corrected word", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_food_printing"}

According to one QAnon video, the battle between Trump and \"the cabal\" is of \"biblical proportions\", a \"fight for earth, of good versus evil.\" The forthcoming reckoning is said by some QAnon supporters to be a \"[[The Repture|reverse rapture]]\" which means not only the end of the world as it is now known, but a new beginning as well, with salvation and a utopia on earth for the survivors.<ref name=haaretz />\n\nAccording to a [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] polling, 76% of Americans said they had never heard of the QAnon movement.

According to an August 2018 [[Qualtrics]] poll for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 58% of Floridians are familiar enough with QAnon to have an opinion about it. Among those who did have an opinion, most were unfavorable toward the QAnon movement. The average score on the feeling thermometer was just above 20. This is a very negative rating, and about half of what [\u2026] other political figures [\u2026] enjoy. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/30/the-qanon-conspiracy-movement-is-very-unpopular-our-new-poll-finds/|title=Analysis &#124; New poll: the QAnon conspiracy movement is very unpopular|first1=Joseph|last1=Uscinski|first2=Casey|last2=Klofstad|website=Washington Post}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/30/the-qanon-conspiracy-movement-is-very-unpopular-our-new-poll-finds/|title=New poll: the QAnon conspiracy movement is very unpopular|last=Uscinski|first=Joseph|last2=Klofstad|first2=Casey|date=August 30, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref> Positive feelings toward QAnon were found to be strongly correlated with one's proneness to conspiracy thinking.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nExperts have classified the appeal of QAnon as similar to that of religious cults. According to expert in online conspiracy Renee DiResta, the QAnon pattern is similar to enticement into cults in the pre-Internet era, where as the targeted person was led deeper and deeper into the group's secrets, they become more and more isolated from friends and family outside of the cult.<ref name=\":11\" /> In the Internet age, QAnon virtual communities have little \"real world\" connection with each other, but online, they can number in the tens of thousands.<ref name=\":11\" /> Rachel Bernstein, an expert on cults who specializes in recovery therapy, says that \"What a movement such as QAnon has going for it, and why it will catch on like wildfire, is that it makes people feel connected to something important that other people don't yet know about. ... All cults will provide this feeling of being special.\" There is no self-correction process within the group, since the self-reinforcing true believers are immune to correction, fact-checking, or counter-speech, which is drowned out in the [[groupthink]] of the cult.<ref name=\":11\">Diresta, Renee (November 13, 2018) [https://www.wired.com/story/online-conspiracy-groups-qanon-cults/ \"Online Conspiracy Groups Are a Lot Like Cults\"] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''</ref>\n\nQAnon is an example of what historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] called in 1954 \"[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]\", in which history and political trends are seen in apocalyptic terms: <blockquote>The paranoid spokesman ... traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point. Like [[millennialism|religious millennialists]] he expresses the anxiety of those who are living through the last days and he is sometimes disposed to set a date for the apocalypse... Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, what is necessary is not compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Since the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable, he must be totally eliminated &ndash; if not from the world, at least from the theatre of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention.<ref name=salon0819 /></blockquote>\n\nTravis View, a researcher who studies QAnon, says of it that it is as addictive as a video game, and offers the \"player\" the appealing possibility of being involved in something of world-historical importance. According to View, \"You can sit at your computer and search for information and then post about what you find, and Q basically promises that through this process, you are going to radically change the country, institute this incredible, almost bloodless revolution, and then be part of this historical movement that will be written about for generations.\" View compares this to mundane political involvement in which one's efforts might help to get a state legislator elected. QAnon, says View, competes not in the marketplace of ideas, but in the marketplace of realities.<ref>Rosenberg, Alyssa (August 7, 2019) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/07/qanon-isnt-just-conspiracy-theory-its-highly-effective-game/ \"I understand the temptation to dismiss QAnon. Here\u2019s why we can\u2019t.\"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref>\n\nNonetheless, some QAnon believers have eventually started to realize that they have been isolated from family and loved ones, and suffer loneliness because of it. For some, this is a pathway to slowly beginning the process of divesting themselves of their cultish beliefs, while for others, the isolation reinforces the benefits they get from belonging to the cult. View says that,\n<blockquote>People in the QAnon community often talk about alienation from family and friends. ... Though they typically talk about how Q frayed their relationships on private Facebook groups. But they think these issues are temporary and primarily the fault of others. They often comfort themselves by imagining that there will be a moment of vindication sometime in the near future which will prove their beliefs right. They imagine that after this happens, not only will their relationships be restored, but people will turn to them as leaders who understand what's going on better than the rest of us.<ref name=beast>Weill, Kelly (December 22, 2018) [https://www.thedailybeast.com/christmas-is-the-loneliest-time-for-qanon-fans \"Christmas Is the Loneliest Time for Qanon Fans\"] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''</ref></blockquote>\nSome Q followers break away when they recognize the content of the theories is not self-consistent, or they see that some of the content is directly aimed at getting donations from a specific audience, such as evangelical or conservative Christians. This then \"breaks the spell\" the conspiracies had over them. Others start watching Q-debunking videos; one former believer says that the videos \"saved\" her.<ref name=beast />\n\nDisillusionment can also come from the failure of the theories' predictions. Q had predicted Republican success in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 US midterm elections]], and claimed that [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] was involved in secret work for Trump, with apparent tensions between them a cover. When Democrats made significant gains and Trump fired Sessions, there was disillusionment among many in the Q community.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Chapman, Matthew |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/11/15/qanons-true-believers-are-devastated-as-the-conspiracy-theory-goes-down-in-flames/ |title=QAnon's true believers are devastated as the conspiracy theory goes down in flames |date=November 15, 2018|newspaper=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |author=Rothscild, Mike |url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-jeff-sessions-2018-midterms/ |title=Jeff Sessions, the 2018 midterms, and the continued grift of QAnon |date=November 9, 2018|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]}}</ref> Further disillusionment came when the predicted December 5 mass arrest and imprisonment in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] of enemies of Donald Trump did not occur, nor did the dismissal of charges against Trump's former National Security Advisor, [[Michael Flynn]]. For some these failures began the process of separation from the QAnon cult, while others urged [[direct action]] in the form of an insurrection against the government. Such a response to a failed prophecy is not unusual: apocalyptic cults such as [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]], the [[People's Temple]], the [[Manson Family]], and [[Aum Shinrikyo]] resorted to [[mass suicide]] or [[mass murder]] when their expectations for revelations or the fulfillment of their prophecies did not come about. Psychologist [[Robert Lifton]] calls it \"forcing the end\". This phenomenon is being seen among some QAnon believers.<ref name=beast /> Travis View echoes the concern that disillusioned QAnon believers might take matters into their own hands,<ref name=haaretz /> as Pizzagate believer [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory#Criminal responses|Edgar Maddison Welch]] did in 2016, [[#Hoover Dam incident|Matthew Phillip Wright]] did at [[Hoover Dam]] in 2018, and [[#Murder of Frank Cali|Anthony Comello]] did in 2019 when he murdered [[Mafia]] boss [[Frank Cali]], believing himself to be under the protection of President Trump.\n\nProminent QAnon follower Liz Crokin, who in 2018 asserted that [[John F.

According to one QAnon video, the battle between Trump and \"the cabal\" is of \"biblical proportions\", a \"fight for earth, of good versus evil.\" The forthcoming reckoning is said by some QAnon supporters to be a \"[[The Repture|reverse rapture]]\" which means not only the end of the world as it is now known, but a new beginning as well, with salvation and a utopia on earth for the survivors.<ref name=haaretz />\n\nAccording to a [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] polling, 76% of Americans said they had never heard of the QAnon movement.

According to an August 2018 [[Qualtrics]] poll for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 58% of Floridians are familiar enough with QAnon to have an opinion about it.

According to expert in online conspiracy Renee DiResta, the QAnon pattern is similar to enticement into cults in the pre-Internet era, where as the targeted person was led deeper and deeper into the group's secrets, they become more and more isolated from friends and family outside of the cult.<ref name=\":11\" /> In the Internet age, QAnon virtual communities have little \"real world\" connection with each other, but online, they can number in the tens of thousands.<ref name=\":11\" /> Rachel Bernstein, an expert on cults who specializes in recovery therapy, says that \"What a movement such as QAnon has going for it, and why it will catch on like wildfire, is that it makes people feel connected to something important that other people don't yet know about. ... All cults will provide this feeling of being special.\" There is no self-correction process within the group, since the self-reinforcing true believers are immune to correction, fact-checking, or counter-speech, which is drowned out in the [[groupthink]] of the cult.<ref name=\":11\">Diresta, Renee (November 13, 2018) [https://www.wired.com/story/online-conspiracy-groups-qanon-cults/ \"Online Conspiracy Groups Are a Lot Like Cults\"] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''</ref>\n\nQAnon is an example of what historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] called in 1954 \"[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]\", in which history and political trends are seen in apocalyptic terms: <blockquote>The paranoid spokesman ... traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point. Like [[millennialism|religious millennialists]] he expresses the anxiety of those who are living through the last days and he is sometimes disposed to set a date for the apocalypse... Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, what is necessary is not compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Since the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable, he must be totally eliminated &ndash; if not from the world, at least from the theatre of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention.<ref name=salon0819 /></blockquote>\n\nTravis View, a researcher who studies QAnon, says of it that it is as addictive as a video game, and offers the \"player\" the appealing possibility of being involved in something of world-historical importance. According to View, \"You can sit at your computer and search for information and then post about what you find, and Q basically promises that through this process, you are going to radically change the country, institute this incredible, almost bloodless revolution, and then be part of this historical movement that will be written about for generations.\" View compares this to mundane political involvement in which one's efforts might help to get a state legislator elected. QAnon, says View, competes not in the marketplace of ideas, but in the marketplace of realities.<ref>Rosenberg, Alyssa (August 7, 2019) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/07/qanon-isnt-just-conspiracy-theory-its-highly-effective-game/ \"I understand the temptation to dismiss QAnon. Here\u2019s why we can\u2019t.\"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref>\n\nNonetheless, some QAnon believers have eventually started to realize that they have been isolated from family and loved ones, and suffer loneliness because of it. For some, this is a pathway to slowly beginning the process of divesting themselves of their cultish beliefs, while for others, the isolation reinforces the benefits they get from belonging to the cult. View says that,\n<blockquote>People in the QAnon community often talk about alienation from family and friends. ... Though they typically talk about how Q frayed their relationships on private Facebook groups. But they think these issues are temporary and primarily the fault of others. They often comfort themselves by imagining that there will be a moment of vindication sometime in the near future which will prove their beliefs right. They imagine that after this happens, not only will their relationships be restored, but people will turn to them as leaders who understand what's going on better than the rest of us.<ref name=beast>Weill, Kelly (December 22, 2018) [https://www.thedailybeast.com/christmas-is-the-loneliest-time-for-qanon-fans \"Christmas Is the Loneliest Time for Qanon Fans\"] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''</ref></blockquote>\nSome Q followers break away when they recognize the content of the theories is not self-consistent, or they see that some of the content is directly aimed at getting donations from a specific audience, such as evangelical or conservative Christians. This then \"breaks the spell\" the conspiracies had over them. Others start watching Q-debunking videos; one former believer says that the videos \"saved\" her.<ref name=beast />\n\nDisillusionment can also come from the failure of the theories' predictions. Q had predicted Republican success in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 US midterm elections]], and claimed that [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Sessions]] was involved in secret work for Trump, with apparent tensions between them a cover. When Democrats made significant gains and Trump fired Sessions, there was disillusionment among many in the Q community.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Chapman, Matthew |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/11/15/qanons-true-believers-are-devastated-as-the-conspiracy-theory-goes-down-in-flames/ |title=QAnon's true believers are devastated as the conspiracy theory goes down in flames |date=November 15, 2018|newspaper=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |author=Rothscild, Mike |url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-jeff-sessions-2018-midterms/ |title=Jeff Sessions, the 2018 midterms, and the continued grift of QAnon |date=November 9, 2018|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]}}</ref> Further disillusionment came when the predicted December 5 mass arrest and imprisonment in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] of enemies of Donald Trump did not occur, nor did the dismissal of charges against Trump's former National Security Advisor, [[Michael Flynn]]. For some these failures began the process of separation from the QAnon cult, while others urged [[direct action]] in the form of an insurrection against the government. Such a response to a failed prophecy is not unusual: apocalyptic cults such as [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]], the [[People's Temple]], the [[Manson Family]], and [[Aum Shinrikyo]] resorted to [[mass suicide]] or [[mass murder]] when their expectations for revelations or the fulfillment of their prophecies did not come about. Psychologist [[Robert Lifton]] calls it \"forcing the end\".

There are two known species: '''''Long yellow thing  crassispina''''' and '''''B. parvula''''', both described in 2015. Individuals are pale yellow and unpatterned, and range from around 1.0 to 1.8&nbsp;mm in body length, with females being slightly larger than males. The eyes are reduced or entirely absent.

Eyes are absent or highly reduced, visible only as remnants in ''B. crassispina''. The [[cephalothorax]] or [[prosoma]] is broadly oval when viewed from above, and the abdomen or [[opisthosoma]] is somewhat oval-shaped, and rounded at the rear.

''B. parvula'' are smaller, with males and females measuring around 1.0 and 1.1&nbsp;mm, respectively. In addition to size, male ''B. crassispina '' can be distinguished from male ''B. parvula'' by the presence of two large bristles (setae) on the palpal tibiae (the penultimate segments of the [[pedipalp]]s) and two rows of setae on the sternum (the ventral portion of the cephalothorax).
