The rulers of both those countries sought to control Serb princes to use them as allies in the [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars]]. The first war between [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]] occurred during the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Presian of Bulgaria|Presian]] between 839 and 842, precipitated by Byzantine diplomacy. Later after series of campaigns the Bulgarian [[Tsar|Emperor]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] destroyed the Serb state in 924. The Bulgarian Emperor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] granted formal independence to Serbia in 931 and appointed his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107 as its ruler. They were again subjected by Emperor [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuil]] in 998.\n\nIn the 13th century [[Stefan Dragutin of Serbia|Stefan Dragutin]] and his brother [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Milutin]] fought against the Bulgarian governors of [[Belgrade]] and [[Brani\u010devo (region)|Brani\u010devo]], [[Darman and Kudelin]] and managed to defeat them. In 1327 the Emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium signed an anti-Serbian alliance to stop Serbia's growing power but in 1330 Bulgarian Emperor [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael III Shishman]] was defeated by [[Stefan Uro\u0161 III De\u010danski of Serbia|Stefan De\u010danski]] in the [[battle of Velbazhd]].\n\n==Wars of the 9th century==\n{{Main|Bulgarian-Serbian War (839-842)|Bulgarian-Serbian War (853)}}\nAccording to Byzantine sources, the Bulgarians and the Serbs co-existed peacefully prior to the 9th century.<ref>''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', ed.

The latter was given to his vassal, the Serbian zhupan Valkan. However, in 1203 the Bulgarian army pushed the Serbs out of Ni\u0161 (which Fine suggests had been under Serbian rule since the 1190s){{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=48}} and defeated the Hungarians in battles along the Morava river.<ref>Andreev, J.

In 1290 Dragutin invaded the province but was defeated by Darman and Kudelin, who then attacked his lands. Dragutin had to ask his brother [[Stefan Milutin]], the King of Serbia, to help him. In 1291 they defeated the Bulgarians, who fled to Vidin. The despot of Vidin also fought the Serbs, but the war was unsuccessful and Vidin was sacked. Bulgaria lost the Belgrade and Branicevo provinces forever.\n\n==War of 1330==\n{{Main|Battle of Velbazhd}}\n\nAfter 1291 [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and Serbia maintained friendly relations. In 1296 the Bulgarian Emperor [[Smilets of Bulgaria|Smilets]] married his daughter [[Teodora of Bulgaria, Queen of Serbia|Theodora]] to the future Serbian King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 III De\u010danski of Serbia|Stefan Uro\u0161 III De\u010danski]]. The sister of De\u010danski [[Anna Neda of Serbia|Anna Neda]] was married to the Bulgarian Emperor [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael III Shishman]]. However, the growth of the Serbian Kingdom in the late 13th and early 14th century raised serious concern in the royal courts in [[Tarnovo]] and Constantinople \u2013 while both Empires had numerous external and internal problems, the Serbs expanded their state in northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\n[[Image:The-Balkans-in-1355.png|thumb|The Balkans in 1355, with Serbia at its greatest extent.]]\n\nOn 13 May 1327 Michael III Shishman and [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] signed a treaty against Serbia and agreed to launch a joint campaign.<ref>Nicephori Gregoras.

In the meantime the Bulgarian army, which numbered around 15,000 men, attacked from the east. On 24 July the armies of Bulgaria and Serbia (which numbered between 15,000{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=271}} and 18,000 men<ref>[http://ald-bg.narod.ru/materiali/Velbajd.htm The battle of Velbazhd]</ref>) met near the town of Velbazhd ([[Kyustendil]]). Despite the one-day truce agreed by the two rulers, the Serbs broke their word and attacked the Bulgarians while the latter were scattered to search for provisions.<ref>\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e. \u0416\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0441. 183</ref> Caught by surprise and outnumbered, the Bulgarians tried to organize resistance but were defeated.

After short negotiations near the castle of Izvor, Belaur and De\u010danski concluded a peace treaty according to which the Bulgarian throne was inherited by the son of Michael III Shishman and Anna Neda, [[Ivan Stephen of Bulgaria|Ivan Stefan]]. Bulgaria did not lose territory but was unable to stop the Serbian expansion in Macedonia. Fine writes that although sources mention no territorial changes, many scholars believe that the Serbs seized [[Ni\u0161]] and the surrounding region in the aftermath of the battle.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=272}}\n\n==Conclusion==\nThe battle of Velbazhd initiated a period of twenty years when Serbia was the dominant power in the Balkans for the first time. Their new king, [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], conquered Macedonia, [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], and [[Thessaly]] in 1331, and he was crowned [[Tsar]] (Emperor) in 1346 with the help of the Bulgarians. After he died in 1355, his state was divided into several independent states, as was Bulgaria during the rule of Ivan Alexander in 1371. In the 15th century both states were conquered by the [[Ottoman Turks]].\n\n==Conflicts==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Conflict\n! Time period\n!

The rulers of both those countries sought to control Serb princes to use them as allies in the [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars]]. The first war between [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]] occurred during the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Presian of Bulgaria|Presian]] between 839 and 842, precipitated by Byzantine diplomacy. Later after series of campaigns the Bulgarian [[Tsar|Emperor]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] destroyed the Serb state in 924. The Bulgarian Emperor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] granted formal independence to Serbia in 931 and appointed his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107 as its ruler. They were again subjected by Emperor [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuil]] in 998.\n\nIn the 13th century [[Stefan Dragutin of Serbia|Stefan Dragutin]] and his brother [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Milutin]] fought against the Bulgarian governors of [[Belgrade]] and [[Brani\u010devo (region)|Brani\u010devo]], [[Darman and Kudelin]] and managed to defeat them. In 1327 the Emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium signed an anti-Serbian alliance to stop Serbia's growing power but in 1330 Bulgarian Emperor [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael III Shishman]] was defeated by [[Stefan Uro\u0161 III De\u010danski of Serbia|Stefan De\u010danski]] in the [[battle of Velbazhd]].\n\n==Wars of the 9th century==\n{{Main|Bulgarian-Serbian War (839-842)|Bulgarian-Serbian War (853)}}\nAccording to Byzantine sources, the Bulgarians and the Serbs co-existed peacefully prior to the 9th century.<ref>''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', ed.
