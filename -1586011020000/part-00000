One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\nThe play portrays the chance meeting, subsequent love affair, and eventual parting of a married woman and a physician. The sadness of their serious and secretive affair is contrasted throughout the play with the boisterous, uncomplicated relationship of a second couple. ''Still Life'' differs from most of the plays in the cycle by having an unhappy ending.\n\nThe play was first produced in London in May 1936 and was staged in New York in October of that year. It has been revived frequently and has been adapted for television and radio and, as ''[[Brief Encounter]]'', for the cinema.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25\u201327 and 52</ref> He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref> Coward finished writing all ten of the plays by the end of August 1935.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 188; and Hoare, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in ''[[The Assumption of Hannele|Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them.

It charts the love affair between Laura Jesson, a housewife, and Alec Harvey, a married physician. The location is the refreshment room of \"Milford Junction\" railway station.\n\nIn the first scene, Myrtle, who runs the station buffet, rebuffs the attempts of Albert, the ticket-inspector, to flirt with her. Laura is waiting for her train home after shopping. She is in pain from a piece of grit that has been blown into her eye. Alec introduces himself as a doctor and quickly removes it for her. She thanks him and goes to catch her train.\n\nThree months later, Alec and Laura are once more in the refreshment room. It becomes clear that after their first meeting they encountered each other a second time by chance and have enjoyed each other's company to the extent of arranging to lunch together and go to the cinema. There have been several such meetings. Laura is beginning to wonder about the propriety of meeting him so often, but Alec reminds her that he too is married, with children and other responsibilities.\n\nIn the third scene, set in October, Albert and Myrtle continue their slightly combative flirtation. Alec and Laura come in, and over coffee they admit that they are in love with each other. They are both determined not to upset their happy marriages, but will meet secretly. They make arrangements to meet at the flat of a friend of Alec.\n\nBy December, they are both agonised by guilt and agree that their affair must stop. Alec tells Laura that he has been offered an attractive medical post in South Africa, and will accept it unless she asks him not to.\n\nThe fifth and final scene is set in March. Albert seems to be making progress with Myrtle. Alec and Laura enter. He is leaving to take up his new post in South Africa, and she has come to see him off. They are prevented from having the passionate farewell they both yearn for when Dolly, a talkative friend of hers intrudes into their last moments together, and their final goodbye is cruelly limited to a formal handshake. He leaves, and Laura remains, while Dolly talks on. Suddenly, as the sound of the approaching express train is heard, Laura suddenly rushes out to the platform. She returns \"looking very white and shaky\".<ref>Coward, p. 380</ref> Dolly persuades Myrtle to pour some brandy for Laura, who sips it. The sound of their train is heard, and Dolly gathers up her parcels as the curtain falls.\n\n==Reception==\nCoward himself later said of the play, \"''Still Life'' was the most mature play of the whole series.... It is well written, economical and well constructed: the characters, I think, are true, and I can say now, reading it with detachment after so many years, that I am proud to have written it.\"<ref name=nc>Coward, unnumbered introductory page</ref> John Lahr, in his 1982 book on Coward's plays, disagreed: \"when he wrote himself into the role of an ardent heterosexual lover... the characterisation is wooden. The master of the comic throw-away becomes too loquacious when he gets serious, and his fine words ring false.\"<ref>Lahr, p. 3</ref> At the first production, critical opinion agreed with Coward. ''[[The Times]]'' called it \"a serious and sympathetic study of humdrum people suddenly trapped by love\" and strongly praised Coward both for the play and his performance.<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 23 May 1936, p. 12</ref> In a 1989 study of Coward, Milton Levin wrote:\n{{blockindent|The theme that basic decency wins out is hardly a novel idea. Yet, both characters and their situation are endowed with a weight and substance that are rare for Coward. In large part the solidity of the refreshment room gives such reality to the lovers, but they are also very carefully observed individuals. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the whole play is given life and its fullest pathos by the restrained dialogue, in which little is said but much implied.<ref name=levin47>Levin, p. 47</ref>|}}\nLevin suggests that when Laura rushes onto the platform as the express train thunders by she has suicide in mind;<ref name=levin47/> this possibility is made explicit in the film adaptation of the play, ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.<ref>Ashby and Higson, p. 183</ref>\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\nA Broadway revival in 1967 starred [[Priscilla Morrill]] and [[Denholm Elliott]] as Laura and Alec.<ref>[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/tonight-at-830-2943 \"Tonight at 8.30\"], Internet Broadway Database.

One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\nThe play portrays the chance meeting, subsequent love affair, and eventual parting of a married woman and a physician. The sadness of their serious and secretive affair is contrasted throughout the play with the boisterous, uncomplicated relationship of a second couple. ''Still Life'' differs from most of the plays in the cycle by having an unhappy ending.\n\nThe play was first produced in London in May 1936 and was staged in New York in October of that year. It has been revived frequently and has been adapted for television and radio and, as ''[[Brief Encounter]]'', for the cinema.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre and wrote several early in his career.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 25\u201327 and 52</ref> He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref> Coward finished writing all ten of the plays by the end of August 1935.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 188; and Hoare, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in ''[[The Assumption of Hannele|Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them.

It charts the love affair between Laura Jesson, a housewife, and Alec Harvey, a married physician. The location is the refreshment room of \"Milford Junction\" railway station.\n\nIn the first scene, Myrtle, who runs the station buffet, rebuffs the attempts of Albert, the ticket-inspector, to flirt with her. Laura is waiting for her train home after shopping. She is in pain from a piece of grit that has been blown into her eye. Alec introduces himself as a doctor and quickly removes it for her. She thanks him and goes to catch her train.\n\nThree months later, Alec and Laura are once more in the refreshment room. It becomes clear that after their first meeting they encountered each other a second time by chance and have enjoyed each other's company to the extent of arranging to lunch together and go to the cinema. There have been several such meetings. Laura is beginning to wonder about the propriety of meeting him so often, but Alec reminds her that he too is married, with children and other responsibilities.\n\nIn the third scene, set in October, Albert and Myrtle continue their slightly combative flirtation. Alec and Laura come in, and over coffee they admit that they are in love with each other. They are both determined not to upset their happy marriages, but will meet secretly. They make arrangements to meet at the flat of a friend of Alec.\n\nBy December, they are both agonised by guilt and agree that their affair must stop. Alec tells Laura that he has been offered an attractive medical post in South Africa, and will accept it unless she asks him not to.\n\nThe fifth and final scene is set in March. Albert seems to be making progress with Myrtle. Alec and Laura enter. He is leaving to take up his new post in South Africa, and she has come to see him off. They are prevented from having the passionate farewell they both yearn for when Dolly, a talkative friend of hers intrudes into their last moments together, and their final goodbye is cruelly limited to a formal handshake. He leaves, and Laura remains, while Dolly talks on. Suddenly, as the sound of the approaching express train is heard, Laura suddenly rushes out to the platform. She returns \"looking very white and shaky\".<ref>Coward, p. 380</ref> Dolly persuades Myrtle to pour some brandy for Laura, who sips it. The sound of their train is heard, and Dolly gathers up her parcels as the curtain falls.\n\n==Reception==\nCoward himself later said of the play, \"''Still Life'' was the most mature play of the whole series.... It is well written, economical and well constructed: the characters, I think, are true, and I can say now, reading it with detachment after so many years, that I am proud to have written it.\"<ref name=nc>Coward, unnumbered introductory page</ref> John Lahr, in his 1982 book on Coward's plays, disagreed: \"when he wrote himself into the role of an ardent heterosexual lover... the characterisation is wooden. The master of the comic throw-away becomes too loquacious when he gets serious, and his fine words ring false.\"<ref>Lahr, p. 3</ref> At the first production, critical opinion agreed with Coward. ''[[The Times]]'' called it \"a serious and sympathetic study of humdrum people suddenly trapped by love\" and strongly praised Coward both for the play and his performance.<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 23 May 1936, p. 12</ref> In a 1989 study of Coward, Milton Levin wrote:\n{{blockindent|The theme that basic decency wins out is hardly a novel idea. Yet, both characters and their situation are endowed with a weight and substance that are rare for Coward. In large part the solidity of the refreshment room gives such reality to the lovers, but they are also very carefully observed individuals. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the whole play is given life and its fullest pathos by the restrained dialogue, in which little is said but much implied.<ref name=levin47>Levin, p. 47</ref>|}}\nLevin suggests that when Laura rushes onto the platform as the express train thunders by she has suicide in mind;<ref name=levin47/> this possibility is made explicit in the film adaptation of the play, ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.<ref>Ashby and Higson, p. 183</ref>\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\nA Broadway revival in 1967 starred [[Priscilla Morrill]] and [[Denholm Elliott]] as Laura and Alec.<ref>[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/tonight-at-830-2943 \"Tonight at 8.30\"], Internet Broadway Database.

His [[temple name]] was \"Taizu\" (\u592a\u7956) while his [[posthumous name]] was \"Emperor Gao\" (\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d); \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\". Liu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born in a peasant family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the [[Qin dynasty]] as a [[law enforcement officer]] in his home town [[Pei County]], within the [[Chu (state)|conquered state of Chu]].  With the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]]'s death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his [[civil service]] position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother. It was used as a formal way of addressing an old woman at the time. See the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdcanoce=0&cdqchi=\u5aaadictionary definition of \u5aaa].</ref> lit. \"Old Madam Liu\"). According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling Qin dynasty, a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]].

He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.

Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the \"Four Haos of Mount Shang\" ({{zh|c=\u5546\u5c71\u56db\u7693|p=Sh\u0101ng Sh\u0101n S\u00ec H\u00e0o}}), to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him. After some drinks, Liu Bang played the [[guqin]] and sang the ''Song of the Great Wind''.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.guoxue.com/art/ss000/hvsc001/dfg005.htm \u5927\u98ce\u6b4c]</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n'''\u300a\u5927\u98a8\u6b4c\u300b'''\n|\n'''Song of the Great Wind'''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5927\u98a8\u8d77\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da\uff0c\n|\n''A great wind came forth,''<br />\n''the clouds rose on high''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5a01\u52a0\u6d77\u5167\u516e\u6b78\u6545\u9109\uff0c\n|\n''Now that my might rules all within the seas,''<br />\n''I have returned to my old village''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5b89\u5f97\u731b\u58eb\u516e\u5b88\u56db\u65b9\uff01\n|\n''Where will I find brave men''<br />\n''to guard the four corners of my land?''\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite book| author = John Minford|author2=Joseph S.

He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother. It was used as a formal way of addressing an old woman at the time. See the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdcanoce=0&cdqchi=\u5aaadictionary definition of \u5aaa].</ref> lit. \"Old Madam Liu\"). According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling Qin dynasty, a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]]. Instigated by his advisor [[Fan Zeng]] and Cao Wushang (\u66f9\u7121\u50b7), an informer from Liu Bang's camp, he decided to set a trap to kill Liu Bang.  He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.  However, Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was a close friend of Liu Bang's strategist [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]], and managed to persuade his nephew to not personally order Liu Bang's execution on the feast.  Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the \"Four Haos of Mount Shang\" ({{zh|c=\u5546\u5c71\u56db\u7693|p=Sh\u0101ng Sh\u0101n S\u00ec H\u00e0o}}), to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him. After some drinks, Liu Bang played the [[guqin]] and sang the ''Song of the Great Wind''.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.guoxue.com/art/ss000/hvsc001/dfg005.htm \u5927\u98ce\u6b4c]</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n'''\u300a\u5927\u98a8\u6b4c\u300b'''\n|\n'''Song of the Great Wind'''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5927\u98a8\u8d77\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da\uff0c\n|\n''A great wind came forth,''<br />\n''the clouds rose on high''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5a01\u52a0\u6d77\u5167\u516e\u6b78\u6545\u9109\uff0c\n|\n''Now that my might rules all within the seas,''<br />\n''I have returned to my old village''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5b89\u5f97\u731b\u58eb\u516e\u5b88\u56db\u65b9\uff01\n|\n''Where will I find brave men''<br />\n''to guard the four corners of my land?''\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite book| author = John Minford|author2=Joseph S.

'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSoul Music has no presenter, focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began, it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol, Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.  Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first eco-thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her. \n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie, and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University, and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has won critical acclaim and some awards include a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack and a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime, and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the Christchurch Studios in Clifton to record dramas. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed, the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as the performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012 The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership. It was staged to celebrate the best of BBC Radio 4 in conjunction with appropriate non-commercial partners including St George's Bristol, The British Library, Bristol City Council, University of the West of England, Pervasive Media Studios, Bristol University, QEH Bristol and BBC Radio Bristol.\n\nSome of the events and involvement with the creative people of Bristol were captured in this blog\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2012/03/more_than_words_festival_-_day_1.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2013 BBC Network Radio in Bristol celebrated the arrival of Radio 4's Food Programme to the city by inviting food professionals, food groups and food lovers to join them in an innovative community partnership festival called \"Bristol Food Connections\", bringing people together around good food.  The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.

It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSoul Music has no presenter, focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began, it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol, Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.  Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first eco-thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her. \n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie, and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University, and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has won critical acclaim and some awards include a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack and a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the ChristChurch Studios in Clifton to record drama. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012 The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership. It was staged to celebrate the best of BBC Radio 4 in conjunction with appropriate non-commercial partners including St George's Bristol, The British Library, Bristol City Council, University of the West of England, Pervasive Media Studios, Bristol University, QEH Bristol and BBC Radio Bristol.\n\nSome of the events and involvement with the creative people of Bristol were captured in this blog\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2012/03/more_than_words_festival_-_day_1.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2013 BBC Network Radio in Bristol celebrated the arrival of Radio 4's Food Programme to the city by inviting food professionals, food groups and food lovers to join them in an innovative community partnership festival called \"Bristol Food Connections\", bringing people together around good food.  The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.

These sails allowed Austronesians to embark on long-distance voyaging. In some cases, however, they were one-way voyages. The failure of pandanus to establish populations in [[Rapa Nui]] (Easter Island) and [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) is believed to have isolated their settlements from the rest of Polynesia.<ref name=\"Kirch2012\">{{cite book|first1=Patrick Vinton|last1=Kirch|title =A Shark Going Inland Is My Chief: The Island Civilization of Ancient Hawai'i|publisher =University of California Press|year =2012|pages=25-26|isbn = 9780520953833|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=CDQy8OOicF4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallaher2014\">{{cite book|first1=Timothy|last1=Gallaher|editor1-first=Lia O'Neill M.A.|editor1-last=Keawe|editor2-first=Marsha|editor2-last=MacDowell|editor3-first=C.

Traditionally the people from Nusantara archipelago use the tanja sail, but starting in the 19th century the [[Madurese people]] developed the lete sail. \"''Lete''\" actually means lateen, but the existence of ''pekaki'' (lower spar/boom) indicates that the ''layar lete'' is crab claw sail.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Prahu: Traditional Sailingboat of Indonesia|last=Horridge|first=Adrian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Smaller Crab Claw Sail.JPG|thumb|right|Crab claw sail being constructed for ''Hot Buoys'' trimaran.  Notice pocket in right hand edge of sail to hold spar.  Second spar in this particular configuration is not required since a [[bolt-rope]] holds the sail's upper edge and the mast is located in the back of the sailboat. Note lack of shaping.]]\nThe crab claw sail consists of a sail, approximately an [[triangle|isosceles triangle]] in shape.  The equal length sides are usually longer than the third side, with [[spar (sailing)|spars]] along the long sides.\n\nThe crab claw may also traditionally be constructed with curved spars, giving the edges of the sail along the spars a convex shape, while the leech of the sail is often quite concave to keep it stiff on the trailing edge.  These features give it its distinct, claw-like shape.  Modern crab claws generally have straighter spars and a less convex leech, which gives more sail area for a given length of spar. Spars may taper towards the leech. The structure helps the sail to spill gusts.\n\nThe crab claw characteristically widens upwards, putting more sail area higher above the ocean, where the wind is stronger and steadier. This increases the [[Forces_on_sails#Rotational_forces_on_sailing_craft|heeling moment]]: the sails tend to blow the watercraft over. For this reason, crabclaws are typically used on [[multihull]]s, which resist heeling more strongly.\n\nThe sail is [[shunt (sailing)|shunted]]; the bow becomes the stern, and the mast rake is also reversed. The vessel therefore always has the ''[[Ama (sailing)|ama]]'' (and sidestay, if there is one) to windward, and has no [[Lateen#Later_development|bad tack]]\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sail_plan_proa.svg|[[Proa]]: single mast with crab claw sail\nFile:Rigging-crabclaws1-sail.svg|Proa-like crabclaw\nFile:Rigging-crabclaws2-sail.svg|New Guinea-style crabclaw rig\nFile:Rigging-crabclaws3-sail.svg|Crabclaw amalgamating mast and '\u014dpe'a\nFile:CanoeTacking.webm|shunting manoevre\n</gallery>\n\n===Proa===\nIn a [[proa]], the forward intersection of the spars is placed towards the bow.  The sail is supported by a short mast attached near the middle of the upper spar, and the forward corner is attached to the hull.  The lower spar, or boom, is attached at the forward intersection, but is not attached to the mast. The proa has a permanent windward and leeward side, and exchanges one end for the other when coming about.\n\nTo tack, or switch directions across the wind, the forward corner of the sail is loosened and then transferred to the opposite end of the boat, a process called ''shunting''.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Gross\n | first = Jeffrey L.\n | title = Waipio Valley: A Polynesian Journey from Eden to Eden\n | publisher = Xlibris Corporation\n | date = 2016\n | location =\n | pages = 626\n | language =\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=l-DyDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT470&dq=shunt+crab+claw+sail#v=onepage&q=shunt&f=false\n | isbn = 9781479798469 }}</ref> To shunt, the proa's sheet is let out. The joined corner of the spars is then transferred to the opposite end of the boat.  While remaining attached to the top of the mast, the upper spar tilts to vertical and beyond as the forward corner moves past the mast and onward to the other end of the boat.  Meanwhile, the [[mainsheet]] is detached and used to rotate the rearward end of the boom through a horizontal half circle. The spar join is then re-attached at the new \"forward\" end of the boat and the mainsheet is re-tightened at the new \"rearward\" end.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://proafile.com/multihull-boats/article/proa-rig-options-crab-claw\n | title = Proa Rig Options: Crab Claw\n | last = Editor\n | first =\n | date = July 23, 2014\n | website = proafile.com\n | publisher = Proa File\n | access-date = 2017-04-21\n | quote = }}\n</ref>\n\n=== Tepukei ===\n[[File:S\u00fcdseeabteilung in Ethnological Museum Berlin 11d.jpg|thumb|The ''Maunga Nefe'', a ''[[tepukei|te puke]]'' or ''folafolau'' was built on [[Taumako]] and sailed out of [[Nifiloli]]; it was used for travel and trading within the [[Santa Cruz archipelago]]]]\n{{main|Tepukei}}\nA shunting rig with the sail propped vertically at the bow, very similar to the proa rig described above.\n\n===Non-shunting crab claw===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Hokule'a.jpg|[[Hokule'a]], a bluewater ''wa\u02bba kaulua'', with curved-spar, curved-leech crabclaw sails, in 1976.\nFile:Hokule'aSailing2009.jpg|[[Hokule'a]] in 2009, with simpler crab-claw sails.\nFile:Hokulea2.jpg|[[Hokule'a]] with her kaula pe'a (''sail lines'') tightened to partly close her crab-claw sails.<ref name=parts>{{cite web|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/kalai_waa/parts.html|title=Parts of the Hawaiian Canoe|author=|date=|website=archive.hokulea.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\nThe term \"crabclaw sail\" is also used for non-shunting sails that widen upwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/03/06/news/story04.html|title=starbulletin.com - News - /2007/03/06/|first=Honolulu|last=Star-Bulletin|date=|website=archives.starbulletin.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The '\u014dpe'a, the upper spar, is braced up so high that it is nearly parallel to the mast (as in a [[gunter rig]]).

Marchaj, a researcher who has experimented extensively with both modern rigs for racing sailboats and traditional sailing rigs from around the world, has done wind tunnel testing of scale models of crab-claw rigs. One popular but disputed theory is that the crab-claw wing works like a [[delta wing]], generating [[vortex lift]]. Since the crab claw does not lie symmetric to the airflow, like an aircraft delta wing, but rather lies with the lower spar nearly parallel to the water, the airflow is not symmetric. However, the presence of the water, close to the lower spar and parallel to it, makes the airflow behave roughly like the airflow over half of a delta wing, as though a \"reflection\" in the water provided the other half (apart from a narrow gap near the water, which causes a small difference there).\n\t \nThis can clearly be seen in Marchaj's wind tunnel photos published in ''Sail Performance: Techniques to Maximise Sail Power'' (1996). The vortex on the top spar of the sail is much larger, covering most of the sail area, while the lower vortex is very small and stays close to the spar. Marchaj attributes the large lifting power of the sail to lift generated by the vortices, while others attribute the power to a favourable mix of aspect ratio, camber and (lack of) twist at this point of sail.<ref name=sailpower>{{cite book | author=Marchaj, C.

These sails allowed Austronesians to embark on long-distance voyaging. In some cases, however, they were one-way voyages. The failure of pandanus to establish populations in [[Rapa Nui]] (Easter Island) and [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) is believed to have isolated their settlements from the rest of Polynesia.<ref name=\"Kirch2012\">{{cite book|first1=Patrick Vinton|last1=Kirch|title =A Shark Going Inland Is My Chief: The Island Civilization of Ancient Hawai'i|publisher =University of California Press|year =2012|pages=25-26|isbn = 9780520953833|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=CDQy8OOicF4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallaher2014\">{{cite book|first1=Timothy|last1=Gallaher|editor1-first=Lia O'Neill M.A.|editor1-last=Keawe|editor2-first=Marsha|editor2-last=MacDowell|editor3-first=C.

Traditionally the people from Nusantara archipelago use the tanja sail, but starting in the 19th century the [[Madurese people]] developed the lete sail. \"''Lete''\" actually means lateen, but the existence of ''pekaki'' (lower spar/boom) indicates that the ''layar lete'' is crab claw sail.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Prahu: Traditional Sailingboat of Indonesia|last=Horridge|first=Adrian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1981|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Smaller Crab Claw Sail.JPG|thumb|right|Crab claw sail being constructed for ''Hot Buoys'' trimaran.  Notice pocket in right hand edge of sail to hold spar.  Second spar in this particular configuration is not required since a [[bolt-rope]] holds the sail's upper edge and the mast is located in the back of the sailboat. Note lack of shaping.]]\nThe crab claw sail consists of a sail, approximately an [[triangle|isosceles triangle]] in shape.  The equal length sides are usually longer than the third side, with [[spar (sailing)|spars]] along the long sides.\n\nThe crab claw may also traditionally be constructed with curved spars, giving the edges of the sail along the spars a convex shape, while the leech of the sail is often quite concave to keep it stiff on the trailing edge.  These features give it its distinct, claw-like shape.  Modern crab claws generally have straighter spars and a less convex leech, which gives more sail area for a given length of spar. Spars may taper towards the leech. The structure helps the sail to spill gusts.\n\nThe crab claw characteristically widens upwards, putting more sail area higher above the ocean, where the wind is stronger and steadier. This increases the [[Forces_on_sails#Rotational_forces_on_sailing_craft|heeling moment]]: the sails tend to blow the watercraft over. For this reason, crabclaws are typically used on [[multihull]]s, which resist heeling more strongly.\n\nThe sail is [[shunt (sailing)|shunted]]; the bow becomes the stern, and the mast rake is also reversed. The vessel therefore always has the ''[[Ama (sailing)|ama]]'' (and sidestay, if there is one) to windward, and has no [[Lateen#Later_development|bad tack]]\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sail_plan_proa.svg|[[Proa]]: single mast with crab claw sail\nFile:Rigging-crabclaws1-sail.svg|Proa-like crabclaw\nFile:Rigging-crabclaws2-sail.svg|New Guinea-style crabclaw rig\nFile:Rigging-crabclaws3-sail.svg|Crabclaw amalgamating mast and '\u014dpe'a\nFile:CanoeTacking.webm|shunting manoevre\n</gallery>\n\n===Proa===\nIn a [[proa]], the forward intersection of the spars is placed towards the bow.  The sail is supported by a short mast attached near the middle of the upper spar, and the forward corner is attached to the hull.  The lower spar, or boom, is attached at the forward intersection, but is not attached to the mast. The proa has a permanent windward and leeward side, and exchanges one end for the other when coming about.\n\nTo tack, or switch directions across the wind, the forward corner of the sail is loosened and then transferred to the opposite end of the boat, a process called ''shunting''.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Gross\n | first = Jeffrey L.\n | title = Waipio Valley: A Polynesian Journey from Eden to Eden\n | publisher = Xlibris Corporation\n | date = 2016\n | location =\n | pages = 626\n | language =\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=l-DyDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT470&dq=shunt+crab+claw+sail#v=onepage&q=shunt&f=false\n | isbn = 9781479798469 }}</ref> To shunt, the proa's sheet is let out. The joined corner of the spars is then transferred to the opposite end of the boat.  While remaining attached to the top of the mast, the upper spar tilts to vertical and beyond as the forward corner moves past the mast and onward to the other end of the boat.  Meanwhile, the [[mainsheet]] is detached and used to rotate the rearward end of the boom through a horizontal half circle. The spar join is then re-attached at the new \"forward\" end of the boat and the mainsheet is re-tightened at the new \"rearward\" end.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://proafile.com/multihull-boats/article/proa-rig-options-crab-claw\n | title = Proa Rig Options: Crab Claw\n | last = Editor\n | first =\n | date = July 23, 2014\n | website = proafile.com\n | publisher = Proa File\n | access-date = 2017-04-21\n | quote = }}\n</ref>\n\n=== Tepukei ===\n[[File:S\u00fcdseeabteilung in Ethnological Museum Berlin 11d.jpg|thumb|The ''Maunga Nefe'', a ''[[tepukei|te puke]]'' or ''folafolau'' was built on [[Taumako]] and sailed out of [[Nifiloli]]; it was used for travel and trading within the [[Santa Cruz archipelago]]]]\n{{main|Tepukei}}\nA shunting rig with the sail propped vertically at the bow, very similar to the proa rig described above.\n\n===Non-shunting crab claw===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Hokule'a.jpg|[[Hokule'a]], a bluewater ''wa\u02bba kaulua'', with curved-spar, curved-leech crabclaw sails, in 1976.\nFile:Hokule'aSailing2009.jpg|[[Hokule'a]] in 2009, with simpler crab-claw sails.\nFile:Hokulea2.jpg|[[Hokule'a]] with her kaula pe'a (''sail lines'') tightened to partly close her crab-claw sails.<ref name=parts>{{cite web|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/kalai_waa/parts.html|title=Parts of the Hawaiian Canoe|author=|date=|website=archive.hokulea.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\nThe term \"crabclaw sail\" is also used for non-shunting sails that widen upwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/03/06/news/story04.html|title=starbulletin.com - News - /2007/03/06/|first=Honolulu|last=Star-Bulletin|date=|website=archives.starbulletin.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> The '\u014dpe'a, the upper spar, is braced up so high that it is nearly parallel to the mast (as in a [[gunter rig]]).
