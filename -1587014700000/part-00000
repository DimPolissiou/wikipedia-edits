Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2013red and grey.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks.

'''jaguarundi''' (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'') ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) is a wild [[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2013red and grey.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

Individuals in captivity have been found to be more gregarious.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Home range]]s tend to be large; a study in Brazil recorded home ranges {{convert|1.4|\u2013|18|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size for females, while those of males measured {{convert|8.5|\u2013|25.3|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area.<ref name=Hunter/> Two males in Belize were recorded to have exceptionally large home ranges spanning an area of {{convert|88|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi}}, while the home range of a female in the same region measured {{convert|13|\u2013|20|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.<ref name=Nowak/> Population densities are typically low, around {{convert|0.01|to|0.05|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}, though the Llanos in Costa Rica and Venezuela have recorded figures as high as {{convert|0.2|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bellani/>\n\nMarking behavior could serve as a means of olfactory or visual communication; individuals in captivity have been observed scraping areas with their hind feet (sometimes with urination), clawing on logs, rubbing objects with their heads and leaving feces uncovered. Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas.

He has worked as a band member, [[session musician]], [[sideman]], and leader of his own ensembles. He is the older brother of the drummers  John Wackerman and [[Brooks Wackerman]]. He is the father of [[American Idol]] contestant Sophia Wackerman.\n\n==Musical career==\nChad Wackerman was raised in [[Seal Beach, California]], in a family immersed in music. His father Chuck Wackerman, a drummer, is an award-winning music teacher who has taught at both high school and [[middle school]] levels with a specialization in [[jazz]]. Chad and his brothers, John Wackerman, and [[Brooks Wackerman]] are all proficient drummers and multi-instrumentalists. John recorded an album titled ''Drum Duets Vol.1''.<ref name=\"Chad Wackerman bio1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chadwackerman.com/faqs.html|title=Chad Wackerman Website|last=Wackerman|first=Chad|date=2001\u20132006 |work=Official Website Faqs|publisher=Evolutionweb.com |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>\n\nChad joined the [[Bill Watrous]] band in 1978, and then worked with [[Frank Zappa]] from 1981 to 1988. Gaining and keeping a place in Zappa's band was not easy; Zappa demanded high musical standards and imposed exacting discipline in rehearsal and on tour. The auditions for his band were gruelling, according to [[Steve Vai]] and Chad himself.<ref name=\"Chad Wackerman bio1\"/>\nTwo pieces of music, \"Mo 'n Herb's Vacation\", and \"[[The Black Page]]\"  were considered exceptionally difficult. Only three drummers throughout Zappa's career were able to play them successfully: Wackerman, [[Terry Bozzio]], and [[Vinnie Colaiuta]].\n\nIn addition to appearing on Zappa's rock albums and tours, Chad performed with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in 1983 on a concert and recording session of Zappa's compositions.\n\n==Sideman and session musician==\n[[File:Allan Holdsworth, Chad Wackerman and Jimmy Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wackerman (centre) with [[Allan Holdsworth]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (bassist)|Jimmy Johnson]] in 2006]]\nIn 1985, Chad toured with, but did not record for, Australian rock act [[Men at Work]]. He played on the album and supporting video ''[[One Voice (Barbra Streisand album)|One Voice]]'' with [[Barbra Streisand]].

He has worked as a band member, [[session musician]], [[sideman]], and leader of his own ensembles. He is the older brother of the drummers  John Wackerman and [[Brooks Wackerman]].\n\n==Musical career==\nChad Wackerman was raised in [[Seal Beach, California]], in a family immersed in music. His father Chuck Wackerman, a drummer, is an award-winning music teacher who has taught at both high school and [[middle school]] levels with a specialization in [[jazz]]. Chad and his brothers, John Wackerman, and [[Brooks Wackerman]] are all proficient drummers and multi-instrumentalists. John recorded an album titled ''Drum Duets Vol.1''.<ref name=\"Chad Wackerman bio1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chadwackerman.com/faqs.html|title=Chad Wackerman Website|last=Wackerman|first=Chad|date=2001\u20132006 |work=Official Website Faqs|publisher=Evolutionweb.com |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>\n\nChad joined the [[Bill Watrous]] band in 1978, and then worked with [[Frank Zappa]] from 1981 to 1988. Gaining and keeping a place in Zappa's band was not easy; Zappa demanded high musical standards and imposed exacting discipline in rehearsal and on tour. The auditions for his band were gruelling, according to [[Steve Vai]] and Chad himself.<ref name=\"Chad Wackerman bio1\"/>\nTwo pieces of music, \"Mo 'n Herb's Vacation\", and \"[[The Black Page]]\"  were considered exceptionally difficult. Only three drummers throughout Zappa's career were able to play them successfully: Wackerman, [[Terry Bozzio]], and [[Vinnie Colaiuta]].\n\nIn addition to appearing on Zappa's rock albums and tours, Chad performed with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in 1983 on a concert and recording session of Zappa's compositions.\n\n==Sideman and session musician==\n[[File:Allan Holdsworth, Chad Wackerman and Jimmy Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wackerman (centre) with [[Allan Holdsworth]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (bassist)|Jimmy Johnson]] in 2006]]\nIn 1985, Chad toured with, but did not record for, Australian rock act [[Men at Work]]. He played on the album and supporting video ''[[One Voice (Barbra Streisand album)|One Voice]]'' with [[Barbra Streisand]]. He has also recorded albums and toured with diverse artists such as [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Andy Summers]], [[Ed Mann]], [[Albert Lee]], [[Colin Hay]], [[Dweezil Zappa]] and [[Tom Grant (jazz musician)|Tom Grant]].
