There an estimated 20,000 Assyrians who trace their ancestry to the tribe, dispersed throughout the world in Iraq and Iran mainly.<ref name=autogenerated1>Solomon (Sawa) Solomon from Nineveh Magazine 1st & 2nd quarter 1997, vol. 20, no 1&2.</ref>{{Verification needed}}\n\n{{Nochiya Tribe}}\n\n== People ==\nThe [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of the [[Nochiya Region]] were simple farmers who owned cattle and grew food. They were known particularly for their fine [[tobacco]], which was their main source of income along with herding sheep. [[Prayer]] and [[fasting]] were strictly observed in the villages of the Nochiya Assyrians. An Englishman visiting the [[Nochiya Region]] in the late 19th century noted that \"''there is perhaps no Assyrian district where simple piety and loyal devotion to the church of their fathers is more beautifully seen than in [[Nochiya Region|Nochiya]]''\".<ref name=autogenerated3>http://www.zyworld.com/Assyrian/The%20Assyrians%20of%20Shamizdin,%20Turkey.htm</ref> Nochiyaye were and are still today most famous for their [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] faith and for being the guardians of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]'s canon laws, which they have faithfully preserved.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2005/11.2.05/index_wed.php Zinda 2 November 2005<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nCollectively, the ten clan-districts of the [[Nochiya Region]] contained some 65 villages that eventually became known as the Nochiya Tribe in 1663, with the appointment of the first [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[\u015eemdinli]] from the [[Matran family]] of the Gida House. However, The Ottoman Empire did not integrate the Nochiyaye as an official tribe within their \"[[millet]]\" social structure; nonetheless, they were recognized as an independent tribe by their Assyrian and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] neighbors.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Syriac alphabet}}\nAll [[Assyrian tribes]] speak the same language, [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]], but differ in their dialects.  The Nochiya tribe all speak with the same dialects, from [[Targawar]] in the north to [[Rawandiz]] in the south.  It is practically impossible to differentiate between their [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Aramaic dialects]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\nThis is one of the most bonding factors in Assyrian tribes and it's interesting that the tribes adjacent to the Nochiyaye; [[Urmia|Urmijnaye]] to the east, Gawarnaye to the north, [[Jilu|Jilwaye]] to the west and Barwarnayeh to the southwest, all have completely different [[Accent (dialect)|accents]], to the point that some are almost unintelligible to the Nochiyaye.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n=== Society ===\nThe Nochiya tribe was not a \"tribal confederation,\" but was based on the \"bond of kinship\" (''tukhma'').  This point is important and what it means is that the ten clans are not just unified by leadership or geographical factors alone but primarily by blood and so, cannot be separated; they are shackled by the \"bond of kinship,\" which defines their tribal affinity to outsiders.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\nTo further illustrate this point, the Rawandiz clan in the late 19th century changed both religious and leadership loyalty to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] faith but did not change their tribal identity. In fact, they still proudly identify themselves as \"Catholic Nochiyaye\".<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\nKinship is an essential ingredient and the basis of any tribe. By contrast, some European tribes are only paternally related; however, Assyrian tribes are both paternal and maternal. The Nochiyaye are mostly paternal descendants of the [[Matran family]] of the Gida House; the rest are mostly related maternally.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n===Leadership===\nAn Assyrian tribe must have both religious and civil leaders to qualify as a tribe. This principle is called ''Gooraneh''.\n\nIn the case of Nochiyaye it was the Metropolitan (''Matran'') of [[Shamizdin]] who was the religious chief and his brother, the civil chief, presided over the local lords (''Maliks'') of the [[Nochiya Region]], such as Malik Tammu of Sararu, Malik Breemu of Badtemu, Malik Diryawish of Ambeh and Malik Samu of Baigardeh.\n\nThe Matran controlled the religious figures such as Mar Dinkha of Tees, Mar Youkhanan of Dariyan, and others, such as the archdeacons and priests within the tribe. He was primarily the Archbishop of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and was second in command only to the [[Patriarch]], [[Shimun XXI Eshai]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shamizdin Flowers.jpg|250px|left|thumb| [[Crown imperial (flower)|Crown Imperial]] - native flower of Hakkari]]\n{{main|Nochiya Tribal Region|List of Nochiyaye settlements}}\n\nThe Nochiya Tribes territory is unique in that it goes through three different countries: [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and [[Iraq]]. The reason for this is because the Nochiya Tribes presence in the region predates these international borders, and because they were not consulted or considered when these international borders were drawn through their lands, similar to how the United States often drew state borders through Native American tribal territory. The Turkey-Iran border was created in 1515 after the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] split the [[Targawar]], [[Bagzadeh]] and [[Margawar]] Clans away from the central [[\u015eemdinli]] district in Turkey, with the Nochiyaye lands within the [[Zagros mountain]] range in the eastern part of their territory becoming part of Iran literally overnight. The Turkey-Iraq border was created in 1926, with the signing of the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], and cut away the Bradost, Rawanduz, and Sherwan Clans from the Shamizdin district in Turkey. However, at this point, no Nochiyaye even live within the heart of their territory in Shamizdin anymore.\n\n===Districts===\nThe [[Nochiya Region]] is an area which consists of [[province]]s, [[district]]s and [[sub-district]]s. The Nochiya Region lies in three different countries: western Iran, northeastern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, with Its ''de jure'' capital based in Mar Ishu,(modern day [[Karakilise, \u015eemdinli]]) as that is where its Metropolitan bishop resided and his cathedral was located historically. The districts that make up parts of the Nochiya Region are [[\u015eemdinli]] in Turkey, [[Soran District]] in Iraq, and the [[Silvaneh District]] in Iran.\n\nRustaqa was the central sub-district of the [[Nochiya Region]]. To the north of [[Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde, Hakkari|Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde]], in the district of [[\u015eemdinli]], [[Turkey]], were the clan-districts of [[Khumara]] and Dairaneh; to the east, in the district of [[Urmia]], [[Persia]], were the sub-districts of [[Bagzadeh]], [[Margawar]] and [[Targawar]]. To the south, in what is now [[Arbil Governorate|Arbil]], [[Iraq]], were the sub-districts of Gargan, Bradost, Sherwan and [[Rawandiz]].\n\nTo this day, the Nochiyayeh people still speak, read, and write Leshana Ateeka (Aramaic).

His death coincides with the feast celebrated every year in memory of Mar Tooma Shlikha ([[Saint Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas the Apostle]]).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War I]] the [[Assyrian Genocide]] took place within the [[Ottoman Empire]], which decimated the Nochiyaye, along with all the other [[Assyrian Tribes]] of the [[Hakkari]] mountains. In 1915 The Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains, under the rule of Patriarch [[Shimun XIX Benyamin]], joined the Allied side of the war due to being promised independence and aid by the [[United Kingdom|British]], because the Turks were at the time massacring other ethnic Assyrians(particularly Chaldean and Syriac Catholics) in [[Bitlis]] and [[Diyarbakir]], and because the Turks executed his brother who was studying in [[Istanbul]] in April of that year. Therefore, The Patriarch declared war against the Ottoman Empire and rallied his people alongside the British, [[Russian Empire|Russians]], and [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenians]], in what was known as the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. The Assyrians of the Hakkari Mountains fought hard against the Turks for three years, but were eventually forced to flee the region, as their allies abandoned them, with the Russians leaving due to the [[Russian Revolution]], and the Armenians being too overwhelmed to give aid, while The British ''decided'' not to give them any aid, and in doing so betrayed them. Therefore, The Assyrians had to leave because they were surrounded by hostile Muslim [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] and had no means to continuously fight against them as they were too severely outmanned and outgunned without Allied support. So in 1918, all the Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains fled to Iran to catch British train lines which would take them to Iraq, and they never returned again.\n\n===Urmia, Iran (1915\u20131918)===\nMost [[Nochiyaye]] had already fled Turkey during 1915 into the [[Urmia]] region of [[Iran]], but in 1918 the [[Persian Campaign|Turks invaded Persia]] and the Urmia region was raided, so they fled along with other Assyrians who fled the Hakkari mountains in that same year due to the collapse of Allied support. Led by the metropolitan Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho IX, the tribe left Iran in 1918 on a long journey west into Iran to catch British trains that would take them to [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]].\n\n===Baqubah (1918\u20131920)===\nIn a matter of just a few years, the population of the Nochiya Tribe was drastically reduced from around 12,000 to 4,000. In [[Baqubah]], the 4,000 [[Nochiya Assyrians]] fresh off the trains stayed in the camps for two years under the care of the British Army. As the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] were segregated into large tents according to tribe, the Nochiya Assyrians had a separate dwelling area.\n\n===Sumail (1920\u20131928)===\nIn 1920, they relocated again- this time to [[Sumail]] and the villages around it (such as Graipan) for a period of eight years until 1928, before they eventually settled in the Arbil province, whereupon they were distributed amongst various villages. After the [[Simele Massacre]], the majority of the [[Targawar]] and [[Margawar]] [[Nochiya Assyrians]] headed for [[Habbaniyah]], while some others sought refuge in [[Baghdad]] and [[Kirkuk]]. Some other tribal members fled to [[Syria]], where they established the village of [[Tell Fuweidat Jazira]].\n\n===Arbil Province (1928\u20131963)===\nMost Nochiya fled to other regions of Iraq, but the [[Matran family]] and other tribal members settled in twelve villages in the [[Arbil]] province named [[Harir]], Batas, Qalatdeh, Hinareh, [[Darbandokeh]], Almandana, Qoba, Alaneh, Sarishmeh, Hawdiyan, [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], and [[Bidial]]. Graipan and Hazarjut were two villages in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] that were also partly inhabited by Nochiyaye.\n\nThere were three main reasons why they chose the governorate of Arbil. Firstly, it was geographically closer to the original [[Nochiya Region]] than other areas like [[Duhok, Iraq|Dohuk]]. Secondly, there was some friction with other tribes, namely the Lower Tyari tribe, which chose the Dohuk province since it too was closer to their former Turkish district. Thirdly, it was at the suggestion of Ishmael Beg of [[Rawandiz]] and Said Taha of Nehri, who, by then, had been appointed governor of the [[Rawandiz District]]. They had settled in Batas and invited [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] to be their new neighbor again since they shared clan territories pre-1915. A fourth reason may have been because there were also other, more friendly Assyrian tribes in the region such as the Rawandiz, Bradost and Sherwan.\n\nThe Nochiyaye stayed in these villages for 35 years until July 1963, when they were defeated while fighting alongside the Kurds in the [[First Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War]] for an independent [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]]. After this upheaval, the Nochiyaye left their villages and fled to major cities such as Arbil, Kirkuk and Baghdad. The residents of Hawdiyan and Bidial, however, were not uprooted by the war; they remained in their respective villages.\n\n===Modern Nochiyaye (1963 - present)===\nDuring the early 1960s, many [[Nochiya Assyrians]] resided in the city of [[Baghdad]] in the Assyrian suburb of [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]]. A few hundred Nochiyaye still live in Iran in [[Silvaneh District]] as well. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of the Nochiyaye immigrated to [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australia]] (Particularly [[Sydney]]). Some 3,500 Nochiyaye remain in [[Iraq]], with approximately half of them living in Baghdad and the other half in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]], primarily Arbil Governorate in [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], [[Darbandokeh]], Hawdiyan, [[Harir]], [[Bidial]] and [[Shaqlawa]]. However, after the fall of Iraq in 2003 and the chaos which ensued, many Nochiyaye living in Baghdad have moved to the villages in Arbil Governorate. Therefore, Renewed efforts were made to re-establish some of those villages which over time were abandoned, and now villages like Harir, Cairu, and Zariwan have been repopulated. Unlike other Assyrian villages in Iraq, Nochiyaye live in close proximity with Kurds, and in many cases live in the same villages.\n\n==Notable Nochiyaye==\n'''Nochiyaye''' ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Syriac]]: <big><big>\u0722\u0718\u073f\u071f\u071d\u073c\u071d\u0710</big></big> ''Nochiyaye''), also known as '''Nochiya Assyrians''', is the term given to the [[Assyrian people]] of the Nochiya Tribe.\n\n===Religious Figures===\n*Assyrian Church of the East:\n**[[Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]] - [[Mar Ishu]], NOCHIYA - Last Metropolitan of Shamizdin, d.1977, Baghdad\n**[[Mar Dinkha IV]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Patriarch\n**[[Mar Emmanuel Yosip]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Bishop, Diocese of Canada\n\n===Political Activists===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Previous Secretary General, Assyrian Universal Alliance, Chicago\n*Kurdistan Democratic Party:\n**[[Fawzi Hariri]] - [[Harir]], Iraq - \u2018Iraqi Minister for Industry' & 'Elected INC Member'\n**[[Sargis Aghajan]] - [[Diyana]], Iraq\n\n===Others===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Professor at [[Western Michigan University]]\n*[http://www.geniro.net Geniro] - Tees, - Darbandokeh, Pop Singer, Canada brother of Ninos Dikho\n\n==See also==\n* [[Assyrian people]]\n* [[Assyrian Tribes]]\n* [[List of Assyrians]]\n* [[List of Assyrian settlements]]\n* [[Jilu]], a tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Tyari]], another tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Y\u00fcksekova|Gawar]], an Assyrian tribe in Hakkari\n* [[Anda\u00e7, Uludere|Halmon]], an Assyrian tribe in [[Sirnak province]], bordering Hakkari\n* [[\u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca|Ashita]], an Assyrian tribe in Tyari\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Nochiya Tribe| ]]\n\n[[es:Nochiya]]\n[[ku:N\u00eaw\u00e7iya]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses2|Nochiya}}\n{{more sources}}\n[[File:Group of Targawar Assyrian Warriors.jpg|300px|thumb|A group of [[Mavana|Mawana]] <big>(\u072b\u0735\u0726\u0732\u071b\u0722\u0735\u071d\u0739\u0710</big>) Nochiyaye men belonging to the [[Targawar]] sub-district, [[Iran]].

They were known particularly for their fine [[tobacco]], which was their main source of income along with herding sheep. [[Prayer]] and [[fasting]] were strictly observed in the villages of the Nochiya Assyrians. An Englishman visiting the [[Nochiya Region]] in the late 19th century noted that \"''there is perhaps no Assyrian district where simple piety and loyal devotion to the church of their fathers is more beautifully seen than in [[Nochiya Region|Nochiya]]''\".<ref name=autogenerated3>http://www.zyworld.com/Assyrian/The%20Assyrians%20of%20Shamizdin,%20Turkey.htm</ref> Nochiyaye were and are still today most famous for their [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] faith and for being the guardians of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]'s canon laws, which they have faithfully preserved.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/2005/11.2.05/index_wed.php Zinda 2 November 2005<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nCollectively, the ten clan-districts of the [[Nochiya Region]] contained some 65 villages that eventually became known as the Nochiya Tribe in 1663, with the appointment of the first [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[\u015eemdinli]] from the [[Matran family]] of the Gida House. However, The Ottoman Empire did not integrate the Nochiyaye as an official tribe within their \"[[millet]]\" social structure; nonetheless, they were recognized as an independent tribe by their Assyrian and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] neighbors.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Syriac alphabet}}\nAll [[Assyrian tribes]] speak the same language, [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]], but differ in their dialects.  The Nochiya tribe all speak with the same dialects, from [[Targawar]] in the north to [[Rawandiz]] in the south.  It is practically impossible to differentiate between their [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Aramaic dialects]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\nThis is one of the most bonding factors in Assyrian tribes and it's interesting that the tribes adjacent to the Nochiyaye; [[Urmia|Urmijnaye]] to the east, Gawarnaye to the north, [[Jilu|Jilwaye]] to the west and Barwarnayeh to the southwest, all have completely different [[Accent (dialect)|accents]], to the point that some are almost unintelligible to the Nochiyaye.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n=== Society ===\nThe Nochiya tribe was not a \"tribal confederation,\" but was based on the \"bond of kinship\" (''tukhma'').  This point is important and what it means is that the ten clans are not just unified by leadership or geographical factors alone but primarily by blood and so, cannot be separated; they are shackled by the \"bond of kinship,\" which defines their tribal affinity to outsiders.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\nTo further illustrate this point, the Rawandiz clan in the late 19th century changed both religious and leadership loyalty to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] faith but did not change their tribal identity. In fact, they still proudly identify themselves as \"Catholic Nochiyaye\".<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\nKinship is an essential ingredient and the basis of any tribe. By contrast, some European tribes are only paternally related; however, Assyrian tribes are both paternal and maternal. The Nochiyaye are mostly paternal descendants of the [[Matran family]] of the Gida House; the rest are mostly related maternally.<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n===Leadership===\nAn Assyrian tribe must have both religious and civil leaders to qualify as a tribe. This principle is called ''Gooraneh''.\n\nIn the case of Nochiyaye it was the Metropolitan (''Matran'') of [[Shamizdin]] who was the religious chief and his brother, the civil chief, presided over the local lords (''Maliks'') of the [[Nochiya Region]], such as Malik Tammu of Sararu, Malik Breemu of Badtemu, Malik Diryawish of Ambeh and Malik Samu of Baigardeh.\n\nThe Matran controlled the religious figures such as Mar Dinkha of Tees, Mar Youkhanan of Dariyan, and others, such as the archdeacons and priests within the tribe. He was primarily the Archbishop of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and was second in command only to the [[Patriarch]], [[Shimun XXI Eshai]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Verification needed}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shamizdin Flowers.jpg|250px|left|thumb| [[Crown imperial (flower)|Crown Imperial]] - native flower of Hakkari]]\n{{main|Nochiya Tribal Region|List of Nochiyaye settlements}}\n\nThe Nochiya Tribes territory is unique in that it goes through three different countries: [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and [[Iraq]]. The reason for this is because the Nochiya Tribes presence in the region predates these international borders, and because they were not consulted or considered when these international borders were drawn through their lands, similar to how the United States often drew state borders through Native American tribal territory. The Turkey-Iran border was created in 1515 after the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] split the [[Targawar]], [[Bagzadeh]] and [[Margawar]] Clans away from the central [[\u015eemdinli]] district in Turkey, with the Nochiyaye lands within the [[Zagros mountain]] range in the eastern part of their territory becoming part of Iran literally overnight. The Turkey-Iraq border was created in 1926, with the signing of the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]], and cut away the Bradost, Rawanduz, and Sherwan Clans from the Shamizdin district in Turkey. However, at this point, no Nochiyaye even live within the heart of their territory in Shamizdin anymore.\n\n===Districts===\nThe [[Nochiya Region]] is an area which consists of [[province]]s, [[district]]s and [[sub-district]]s. The Nochiya Region lies in three different countries: western Iran, northeastern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, with Its ''de jure'' capital based in Mar Ishu,(modern day [[Karakilise, \u015eemdinli]]) as that is where its Metropolitan bishop resided and his cathedral was located historically. The districts that make up parts of the Nochiya Region are [[\u015eemdinli]] in Turkey, [[Soran District]] in Iraq, and the [[Silvaneh District]] in Iran.\n\nRustaqa was the central sub-district of the [[Nochiya Region]]. To the north of [[Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde, Hakkari|Da\u011f \u0130\u00e7inde]], in the district of [[\u015eemdinli]], [[Turkey]], were the clan-districts of [[Khumara]] and Dairaneh; to the east, in the district of [[Urmia]], [[Persia]], were the sub-districts of [[Bagzadeh]], [[Margawar]] and [[Targawar]]. To the south, in what is now [[Arbil Governorate|Arbil]], [[Iraq]], were the sub-districts of Gargan, Bradost, Sherwan and [[Rawandiz]].\n\nTo this day, the Nochiyayeh people still speak, read, and write Leshana Ateeka (Aramaic). Although Nochiyayeh have lost their land in Semdinli, they remain in the [[Margawar]] subdistrict of Iran in the same villages as before, such as [[Mavana]], and in new villages established in [[Arbil Province]] of Iraqi Kurdistan like [[Shaqlawa]] and are still a very important group within the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Eastern-Assyrian Rite]] church community.\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Christianity in Nochiya}}\nThere were at least six monasteries and more than 40 churches within the [[Nochiya Region]].

The Assyrians of the Hakkari Mountains fought hard against the Turks for three years, but were eventually forced to flee the region, as their allies abandoned them, with the Russians leaving due to the [[Russian Revolution]], and the Armenians being too overwhelmed to give aid, while The British ''decided'' not to give them any aid, and in doing so betrayed them. Therefore, The Assyrians had to leave because they were surrounded by hostile Muslim [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] and had no means to continuously fight against them as they were too severely outmanned and outgunned without Allied support. So in 1918, all the Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains fled to Iran to catch British train lines which would take them to Iraq, and they never returned again.\n\n===Urmia, Iran (1915\u20131918)===\nMost [[Nochiyaye]] had already fled Turkey during 1915 into the [[Urmia]] region of [[Iran]], but in 1918 the [[Persian Campaign|Turks invaded Persia]] and the Urmia region was raided, so they fled along with other Assyrians who fled the Hakkari mountains in that same year due to the collapse of Allied support. Led by the metropolitan Mar Iskhaq Khnanisho IX, the tribe left Iran in 1918 on a long journey west into Iran to catch British trains that would take them to [[Mandatory Iraq|Iraq]].\n\n===Baqubah (1918\u20131920)===\nIn a matter of just a few years, the population of the Nochiya Tribe was drastically reduced from around 12,000 to 4,000. In [[Baqubah]], the 4,000 [[Nochiya Assyrians]] fresh off the trains stayed in the camps for two years under the care of the British Army. As the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] were segregated into large tents according to tribe, the Nochiya Assyrians had a separate dwelling area.\n\n===Sumail (1920\u20131928)===\nIn 1920, they relocated again- this time to [[Sumail]] and the villages around it (such as Graipan) for a period of eight years until 1928, before they eventually settled in the Arbil province, whereupon they were distributed amongst various villages. After the [[Simele Massacre]], the majority of the [[Targawar]] and [[Margawar]] [[Nochiya Assyrians]] headed for [[Habbaniyah]], while some others sought refuge in [[Baghdad]] and [[Kirkuk]]. Some other tribal members fled to [[Syria]], where they established the village of [[Tell Fuweidat Jazira]].\n\n===Arbil Province (1928\u20131963)===\nMost Nochiya fled to other regions of Iraq, but the [[Matran family]] and other tribal members settled in twelve villages in the [[Arbil]] province named [[Harir]], Batas, Qalatdeh, Hinareh, [[Darbandokeh]], Almandana, Qoba, Alaneh, Sarishmeh, Hawdiyan, [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], and [[Bidial]]. Graipan and Hazarjut were two villages in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] that were also partly inhabited by Nochiyaye.\n\nThere were three main reasons why they chose the governorate of Arbil. Firstly, it was geographically closer to the original [[Nochiya Region]] than other areas like [[Duhok, Iraq|Dohuk]]. Secondly, there was some friction with other tribes, namely the Lower Tyari tribe, which chose the Dohuk province since it too was closer to their former Turkish district. Thirdly, it was at the suggestion of Ishmael Beg of [[Rawandiz]] and Said Taha of Nehri, who, by then, had been appointed governor of the [[Rawandiz District]]. They had settled in Batas and invited [[Mar Yosip Khnanisho]] to be their new neighbor again since they shared clan territories pre-1915. A fourth reason may have been because there were also other, more friendly Assyrian tribes in the region such as the Rawandiz, Bradost and Sherwan.\n\nThe Nochiyaye stayed in these villages for 35 years until July 1963, when they were defeated while fighting alongside the Kurds in the [[First Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War]] for an independent [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]]. After this upheaval, the Nochiyaye left their villages and fled to major cities such as Arbil, Kirkuk and Baghdad. The residents of Hawdiyan and Bidial, however, were not uprooted by the war; they remained in their respective villages.\n\n===Modern Nochiyaye (1963 - present)===\nDuring the early 1960s, many [[Nochiya Assyrians]] resided in the city of [[Baghdad]] in the Assyrian suburb of [[Dora, Baghdad|Dora]]. A few hundred Nochiyaye still live in Iran in [[Silvaneh District]] as well. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of the Nochiyaye immigrated to [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australia]] (Particularly [[Sydney]]). Some 3,500 Nochiyaye remain in [[Iraq]], with approximately half of them living in Baghdad and the other half in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan Region]], primarily Arbil Governorate in [[Diana, Iraq|Diana]], [[Darbandokeh]], Hawdiyan, [[Harir]], [[Bidial]] and [[Shaqlawa]]. However, after the fall of Iraq in 2003 and the chaos which ensued, many Nochiyaye living in Baghdad have moved to the villages in Arbil Governorate. Therefore, Renewed efforts were made to re-establish some of those villages which over time were abandoned, and now villages like Harir, Cairu, and Zariwan have been repopulated. Unlike other Assyrian villages in Iraq, Nochiyaye live in close proximity with Kurds, and in many cases live in the same villages.\n\n==Notable Nochiyaye==\n'''Nochiyaye''' ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Syriac]]: <big><big>\u0722\u0718\u073f\u071f\u071d\u073c\u071d\u0710</big></big> ''Nochiyaye''), also known as '''Nochiya Assyrians''', is the term given to the [[Assyrian people]] of the Nochiya Tribe.\n\n===Religious Figures===\n*Assyrian Church of the East:\n**[[Saint Mar Yosip Khnanisho X]] - [[Mar Ishu]], NOCHIYA - Last Metropolitan of Shamizdin, d.1977, Baghdad\n**[[Mar Dinkha IV]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Patriarch\n**[[Mar Emmanuel Yosip]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Bishop, Diocese of Canada\n\n===Political Activists===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Previous Secretary General, Assyrian Universal Alliance, Chicago\n*Kurdistan Democratic Party:\n**[[Fawzi Hariri]] - [[Harir]], Iraq - \u2018Iraqi Minister for Industry' & 'Elected INC Member'\n**[[Sargis Aghajan]] - [[Diyana]], Iraq\n\n===Others===\n*[[Dr. Emanuel Kamber]] - [[Darbandokeh]], Iraq - Professor at [[Western Michigan University]]\n*[http://www.geniro.net Geniro] - Tees, - Darbandokeh, Pop Singer, Canada brother of Ninos Dikho\n\n==See also==\n* [[Assyrian people]]\n* [[Assyrian Tribes]]\n* [[List of Assyrians]]\n* [[List of Assyrian settlements]]\n* [[Jilu]], a tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Tyari]], another tribe in the Hakkari province\n* [[Y\u00fcksekova|Gawar]], an Assyrian tribe in Hakkari\n* [[Anda\u00e7, Uludere|Halmon]], an Assyrian tribe in [[Sirnak province]], bordering Hakkari\n* [[\u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca|Ashita]], an Assyrian tribe in Tyari\n* [[Matran Family]]\n* [[Christianity in Nochiya]]\n* [[List of Nochiyaye]]\n* [[List of Nochiyaye settlements]]\n* [[Nochiya Region]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Nochiya Tribe| ]]\n\n[[es:Nochiya]]\n[[ku:N\u00eaw\u00e7iya]]\n", "name_user": "Sems\u00fbr\u00ee", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:redirects", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nochiya_tribe"}

Often referencing a system as \"legacy\" means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it. This can also imply that the system is out of date or in need of replacement.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe first use of the term \"legacy\" to describe computer systems probably occurred in the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}  By the 1980s it was commonly used to refer to existing computer systems to distinguish them from the design and implementation of new systems. Legacy was often heard during a conversion process, for example, when moving data from the legacy system to a new database.\n\nWhile this term may indicate that some engineers may feel that a system is out of date, a legacy system can continue to be used for a variety of reasons. It may simply be that the system still provides for the users' needs. In addition, the decision to keep an old system may be influenced by economic reasons such as [[return on investment]] challenges or [[vendor lock-in]], the inherent challenges of [[change management]], or a variety of other reasons other than functionality. [[Backward compatibility]] (such as the ability of newer systems to handle legacy [[file format]]s and [[character encoding]]s) is a goal that [[software developer]]s often include in their work.\n\nEven if it is no longer used, a legacy system may continue to impact the organization due to its historical role. Historic data may not have been converted into the new system format and may exist within the new system with the use of a customized [[schema crosswalk]], or may exist only in a [[data warehouse]]. In either case, the effect on [[business intelligence]] and [[operational reporting]] can be significant.  A legacy system may include procedures or terminology which are no longer relevant in the current context, and may hinder or confuse understanding of the methods or technologies used.\n\nOrganizations can have compelling reasons for keeping a legacy system, such as:\n* The system works satisfactorily, and the owner sees no reason to change it.\n* The costs of redesigning or replacing the system are prohibitive because it is large, [[monolithic system|monolithic]], and/or complex.\n* Retraining on a new system would be costly in lost time and money, compared to the anticipated appreciable benefits of replacing it (which may be zero).\n* The system requires near-constant [[availability]], so it cannot be taken out of service, and the cost of designing a new system with a similar availability level is high. Examples include systems to handle customers' accounts in [[bank]]s, [[computer reservations system]]s, [[air traffic control]], energy distribution ([[power grid]]s), [[nuclear power plant]]s, military defense installations, and systems such as the [[TOPS]] database.\n* The way that the system works is not well understood. Such a situation can occur when the designers of the system have left the organization, and the system has either not been fully documented or documentation has been lost.\n* The user expects that the system can easily be replaced when this becomes necessary.\n* Newer systems perform undesirable (especially for individual or non-institutional users) secondary functions such as ''a'') tracking and reporting of user activity and/or ''b'') automatic updating that creates \"[[Backdoor (computing)|back-door]]\" security vulnerabilities and leaves end users dependent on the good faith and honesty of the vendor providing the updates.  This problem is especially acute when these secondary functions of a newer system cannot be disabled.\n\n==Problems posed by legacy computing==\nLegacy systems are considered to be potentially problematic by some software engineers for several reasons.<ref>(for example, see Bisbal et al., 1999).</ref>\n* If legacy [[software]] runs on only antiquated [[computer hardware|hardware]], the cost of maintaining the system may eventually outweigh the cost of replacing both the software and hardware unless some form of [[emulator|emulation]] or [[backward compatibility]] allows the software to run on new hardware.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lamb|first1=John|title=Legacy systems continue to have a place in the enterprise|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Legacy-systems-continue-to-have-a-place-in-the-enterprise|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=Computer Weekly|date=June 2008}}</ref>\n* These systems can be hard to maintain, improve, and expand because there is a general lack of understanding of the system; the staff who were experts on it have retired or forgotten what they knew about it, and staff who entered the field after it became \"legacy\" never learned about it in the first place. This can be worsened by lack or loss of documentation. [[Comair]] airline company fired its CEO in 2004 due to the failure of an antiquated legacy crew scheduling system that ran into a limitation not known to anyone in the company.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephanie Overby |url=http://www.cio.com/article/112103/Comair_s_Christmas_Disaster_Bound_To_Fail |title=Comair's Christmas Disaster: Bound To Fail - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership |publisher=CIO.com |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n* Legacy systems may have vulnerabilities in older operating systems or applications due to lack of security patches being available or applied. There can also be production configurations that cause security problems. These issues can put the legacy system at risk of being compromised by attackers or knowledgeable insiders.<ref>{{cite web|author=Razermouse |url=http://www.mousesecurity.com/?p=220 |title=The Danger of Legacy Systems |publisher=Mousesecurity.com |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2012-04-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323165836/http://www.mousesecurity.com/?p=220 |archivedate=March 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n* Integration with newer systems may also be difficult because new software may use completely different technologies.  Integration across technology is quite common in computing, but integration between newer technologies and substantially older ones is not common.  There may simply not be sufficient demand for integration technology to be developed.  Some of this \"glue\" code is occasionally developed by vendors and enthusiasts of particular legacy technologies.\n*Budgetary constraints often lead corporations to not address the need of replacement or migration of a legacy system. However, companies often don\u2019t consider the increasing supportability costs (people, software and hardware, all mentioned above) and do not take into consideration the enormous loss of capability or business continuity if the legacy system were to fail. Once these considerations are well understood, then based on the proven ROI of a new, more secure, updated technology stack platform is not as costly as the alternative - and the budget is found.\n*Due to the fact that most legacy programmers are entering retirement age and the number of young engineers replacing them is very small, there is an alarming shortage of available workforce. This in turn results in difficulty in maintaining legacy systems, as well as an increase in costs of procuring experienced programmers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernizationhub.com|title=Benefits of Mainframe Modernization|website=Modernization Hub|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-23}}</ref>\n\n==Improvements on legacy software systems==\nWhere it is impossible to replace legacy systems through the practice of [[application retirement]], it is still possible to enhance (or \"re-face\") them. Most development often goes into adding new interfaces to a legacy system.  The most prominent technique is to provide a Web-based interface to a terminal-based mainframe application. This may reduce staff productivity due to slower response times and slower mouse-based operator actions, yet it is often seen as an \"upgrade\", because the interface style is familiar to unskilled users and is easy for them to use. John McCormick discusses such strategies that involve [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcn.com/state/vol6_no6/guide/748-1.html |title=Mainframe-web middleware - John McCormick |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2000-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205103954/http://www.gcn.com/state/vol6_no6/guide/748-1.html |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPrinting improvements are problematic because legacy software systems often add no formatting instructions, or they use protocols that are not usable in modern PC/Windows printers. A print server can be used to intercept the data and translate it to a more modern code. [[Rich Text Format|Rich Text Format (RTF)]] or [[PostScript]] documents may be created in the legacy application and then interpreted at a PC before being printed.\n\nBiometric security measures are difficult to implement on legacy systems.  A workable solution is to use a [[telnet]] or [[http]] proxy server to sit between users and the mainframe to implement secure access to the legacy application.\n\nThe change being undertaken in some organizations is to switch to [[automated business process]] (ABP) software which generates complete systems. These systems can then interface to the organizations' legacy systems and use them as [[Information repository|data repositories]]. This approach can provide a number of significant benefits: the users are insulated from the inefficiencies of their legacy systems, and the changes can be incorporated quickly and easily in the ABP software.\n\n[[Model-driven engineering|Model-driven]] [[reverse engineering|reverse]] and [[forward engineering]] approaches can be also used for the improvement of legacy software.<ref>{{Citation | title = Software modernization and cloudification using the ARTIST migration methodology and framework | journal = Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience | year = 2014 | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.12694/scpe.v15i2.980| last1 = Menychtas | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Konstanteli | first2 = Kleopatra | last3 = Alonso | first3 = Juncal | last4 = Orue-Echevarria | first4 = Leire | last5 = Gorronogoitia | first5 = Jesus | last6 = Kousiouris | first6 = George | last7 = Santzaridou | first7 = Christina | last8 = Bruneliere | first8 = Hugo | last9 = Pellens | first9 = Bram | last10 = Stuer | first10 = Peter | last11 = Strauss | first11 = Oliver | last12 = Senkova | first12 = Tatiana | last13 = Varvarigou | first13 = Theodora | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==NASA example==\n\nAndreas Hein, from the Technical University of Munich, researched the use of legacy systems in space exploration.  According to Hein, legacy systems are attractive for reuse if an organization has the capabilities for verification, validation, testing, and operational history.<ref>{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems & Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014  | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author = A.M.

For software systems, the capability to use and maintain the system are crucial. Otherwise the system will become less and less understandable and maintainable.\n\nAccording to Hein, verification, validation, testing, and operational history increases the confidence in a system's reliability and quality. However, accumulating this history is often expensive. NASA's now retired [[Space Shuttle]] program used a large amount of 1970s-era technology. Replacement was cost-prohibitive because of the expensive requirement for flight certification.  The original hardware completed the expensive integration and certification requirement for flight, but any new equipment would have had to go through that entire process again.  This long and detailed process required extensive tests of the new components in their new configurations before a single unit could be used in the Space Shuttle program. Thus any new system that started the certification process becomes a ''[[de facto]]'' legacy system by the time it is approved for flight.\n\nAdditionally, the entire Space Shuttle system, including ground and launch vehicle assets, was designed to work together as a closed system.  Since the specifications did not change, all of the certified systems and components performed well in the roles for which they were designed.<ref>{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems & Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014 | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540| page =3 }}</ref>  Even before the Shuttle was scheduled to be retired in 2010, NASA found it advantageous to keep using many pieces of 1970s technology rather than to upgrade those systems and recertify the new components.\n\n==Additional uses of the term ''Legacy'' in computing==\nThe term ''legacy support'' is often used in conjunction with legacy systems. The term may refer to a feature of modern software.  For example, [[Operating system]]s with \"legacy support\" can detect and use older hardware. The term may also be used to refer to a business function; e.g.  A software or hardware vendor that is supporting, or providing [[software maintenance]], for older products.\n\nA \"legacy\" product may be a product that is no longer sold, has lost substantial market share, or is a version of a product that is not current.  A legacy product may have some advantage over a modern product making it appealing for customers to keep it around. A product is only truly \"obsolete\" if it has [[Pareto efficiency|an advantage to nobody]] \u2013 if no person making a rational decision would choose to acquire it new.\n\nThe term \"legacy mode\" often refers specifically to [[backward compatibility]]. A software product that is capable of performing as though it were a previous version of itself, is said to be \"running in legacy mode.\"  This kind of feature is common in operating systems and internet browsers, where many applications depend on these underlying components.\n\nThe [[Mainframe computer|computer mainframe]] era saw many applications running in legacy mode. In the modern business computing environment, [[n-tier]], or [[3-tier]] [[Computer architecture|architectures]] are more difficult to place into legacy mode as they include many components making up a single system.\n\n[[Virtual machine|Virtualization]] technology is a recent innovation allowing legacy systems to continue to operate on modern hardware by running older operating systems and browsers on a software system that emulates legacy hardware.\n\n==Brownfield architecture==\n\nProgrammers have borrowed the term [[Brownfield land|''brownfield'']] from the construction industry, where  previously developed land (often polluted and abandoned) is described as ''brownfield''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid186_gci1062754,00.html |title=Definition of greenfield and brownfield deployment |publisher=Searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n\n* ''Brownfield architecture'' is a type of software or network architecture that incorporates legacy systems.\n* ''Brownfield deployment'' is an upgrade or addition to an existing software or network architecture that retains legacy components.\n\n==Alternative view==\nThere is an alternate favorable opinion &mdash; growing since the end of the Dotcom bubble in 1999 &mdash; that legacy systems are simply computer systems in working use:\n\n{{quote|\"[[Legacy code]]\" often differs from its suggested alternative by actually working and scaling.|[[q:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++]]}}\n\nIT analysts estimate that the cost of replacing [[business logic]] is about five times that of reuse,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} even discounting the risk of system failures and security breaches. Ideally, businesses would never have to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] most core business logic: ''debits = credits'' is a perennial requirement.\n\nThe IT industry is responding with \"legacy modernization\" and \"legacy transformation\": refurbishing existing business logic with new user interfaces, sometimes using [[screen scraping]] and service-enabled access through [[web service]]s. These techniques allow organizations to understand their existing code assets (using discovery tools), provide new user and application interfaces to existing code, improve workflow, contain costs, minimize risk, and enjoy classic qualities of service (near 100% uptime, security, scalability, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThis trend also invites reflection on what makes legacy systems so durable. Technologists are relearning the importance of sound [[Computer architecture|architecture]] from the start, to avoid costly and risky rewrites. The most common legacy systems tend to be those which embraced well-known IT architectural principles, with careful planning and strict methodology during implementation. Poorly designed systems often don't last, both because they wear out and because their inherent faults invite replacement. Thus, many organizations are rediscovering the value of both their legacy systems and the theoretical underpinnings of those systems.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Application retirement]]\n* [[Software rot|Bitrot]]\n* [[Data migration]]\n* [[Deprecation]]\n* [[Digital dark age]]\n* [[Legacy code]]\n* [[Legacy encoding]]\n* [[Legacy-free PC]]\n* [[Legacy port]]\n* [[Software archaeology]]\n* [[Software brittleness]]\n* [[Software entropy]]\n* [[Stovepipe system]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://www.academia.edu/8441540/How_to_Assess_Heritage_Systems_in_the_Early_Phases A.M.

Most development often goes into adding new interfaces to a legacy system.  The most prominent technique is to provide a Web-based interface to a terminal-based mainframe application. This may reduce staff productivity due to slower response times and slower mouse-based operator actions, yet it is often seen as an \"upgrade\", because the interface style is familiar to unskilled users and is easy for them to use. John McCormick discusses such strategies that involve [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcn.com/state/vol6_no6/guide/748-1.html |title=Mainframe-web middleware - John McCormick |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2000-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205103954/http://www.gcn.com/state/vol6_no6/guide/748-1.html |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPrinting improvements are problematic because legacy software systems often add no formatting instructions, or they use protocols that are not usable in modern PC/Windows printers. A print server can be used to intercept the data and translate it to a more modern code. [[Rich Text Format|Rich Text Format (RTF)]] or [[PostScript]] documents may be created in the legacy application and then interpreted at a PC before being printed.\n\nBiometric security measures are difficult to implement on legacy systems.  A workable solution is to use a [[telnet]] or [[http]] proxy server to sit between users and the mainframe to implement secure access to the legacy application.\n\nThe change being undertaken in some organizations is to switch to [[automated business process]] (ABP) software which generates complete systems. These systems can then interface to the organizations' legacy systems and use them as [[Information repository|data repositories]]. This approach can provide a number of significant benefits: the users are insulated from the inefficiencies of their legacy systems, and the changes can be incorporated quickly and easily in the ABP software.\n\n[[Model-driven engineering|Model-driven]] [[reverse engineering|reverse]] and [[forward engineering]] approaches can be also used for the improvement of legacy software.<ref>{{Citation | title = Software modernization and cloudification using the ARTIST migration methodology and framework | journal = Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience | year = 2014 | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.12694/scpe.v15i2.980| last1 = Menychtas | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Konstanteli | first2 = Kleopatra | last3 = Alonso | first3 = Juncal | last4 = Orue-Echevarria | first4 = Leire | last5 = Gorronogoitia | first5 = Jesus | last6 = Kousiouris | first6 = George | last7 = Santzaridou | first7 = Christina | last8 = Bruneliere | first8 = Hugo | last9 = Pellens | first9 = Bram | last10 = Stuer | first10 = Peter | last11 = Strauss | first11 = Oliver | last12 = Senkova | first12 = Tatiana | last13 = Varvarigou | first13 = Theodora | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==NASA example==\n\nAndreas Hein, from the Technical University of Munich, researched the use of legacy systems in space exploration.  According to Hein, legacy systems are attractive for reuse if an organization has the capabilities for verification, validation, testing, and operational history.<ref>{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems & Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014  | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author = A.M.

For software systems, the capability to use and maintain the system are crucial. Otherwise the system will become less and less understandable and maintainable.\n\nAccording to Hein, verification, validation, testing, and operational history increases the confidence in a system's reliability and quality. However, accumulating this history is often expensive. NASA's now retired [[Space Shuttle]] program used a large amount of 1970s-era technology. Replacement was cost-prohibitive because of the expensive requirement for flight certification.  The original hardware completed the expensive integration and certification requirement for flight, but any new equipment would have had to go through that entire process again.  This long and detailed process required extensive tests of the new components in their new configurations before a single unit could be used in the Space Shuttle program. Thus any new system that started the certification process becomes a ''[[de facto]]'' legacy system by the time it is approved for flight.\n\nAdditionally, the entire Space Shuttle system, including ground and launch vehicle assets, was designed to work together as a closed system.  Since the specifications did not change, all of the certified systems and components performed well in the roles for which they were designed.<ref>{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems & Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014 | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540| page =3 }}</ref>  Even before the Shuttle was scheduled to be retired in 2010, NASA found it advantageous to keep using many pieces of 1970s technology rather than to upgrade those systems and recertify the new components.\n\n==Additional uses of the term ''Legacy'' in computing==\nThe term ''legacy support'' is often used in conjunction with legacy systems. The term may refer to a feature of modern software.  For example, [[Operating system]]s with \"legacy support\" can detect and use older hardware. The term may also be used to refer to a business function; e.g.  A software or hardware vendor that is supporting, or providing [[software maintenance]], for older products.\n\nA \"legacy\" product may be a product that is no longer sold, has lost substantial market share, or is a version of a product that is not current.  A legacy product may have some advantage over a modern product making it appealing for customers to keep it around. A product is only truly \"obsolete\" if it has [[Pareto efficiency|an advantage to nobody]] \u2013 if no person making a rational decision would choose to acquire it new.\n\nThe term \"legacy mode\" often refers specifically to [[backward compatibility]]. A software product that is capable of performing as though it were a previous version of itself, is said to be \"running in legacy mode.\"  This kind of feature is common in operating systems and internet browsers, where many applications depend on these underlying components.\n\nThe [[Mainframe computer|computer mainframe]] era saw many applications running in legacy mode. In the modern business computing environment, [[n-tier]], or [[3-tier]] [[Computer architecture|architectures]] are more difficult to place into legacy mode as they include many components making up a single system.\n\n[[Virtual machine|Virtualization]] technology is a recent innovation allowing legacy systems to continue to operate on modern hardware by running older operating systems and browsers on a software system that emulates legacy hardware.\n\n==Brownfield architecture==\n\nProgrammers have borrowed the term [[Brownfield land|''brownfield'']] from the construction industry, where  previously developed land (often polluted and abandoned) is described as ''brownfield''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid186_gci1062754,00.html |title=Definition of greenfield and brownfield deployment |publisher=Searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n\n* ''Brownfield architecture'' is a type of software or network architecture that incorporates legacy systems.\n* ''Brownfield deployment'' is an upgrade or addition to an existing software or network architecture that retains legacy components.\n\n==Alternative view==\nThere is an alternate favorable opinion &mdash; growing since the end of the Dotcom bubble in 1999 &mdash; that legacy systems are simply computer systems in working use:\n\n{{quote|\"[[Legacy code]]\" often differs from its suggested alternative by actually working and scaling.|[[q:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++]]}}\n\nIT analysts estimate that the cost of replacing [[business logic]] is about five times that of reuse,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} even discounting the risk of system failures and security breaches. Ideally, businesses would never have to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] most core business logic: ''debits = credits'' is a perennial requirement.\n\nThe IT industry is responding with \"legacy modernization\" and \"legacy transformation\": refurbishing existing business logic with new user interfaces, sometimes using [[screen scraping]] and service-enabled access through [[web service]]s. These techniques allow organizations to understand their existing code assets (using discovery tools), provide new user and application interfaces to existing code, improve workflow, contain costs, minimize risk, and enjoy classic qualities of service (near 100% uptime, security, scalability, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThis trend also invites reflection on what makes legacy systems so durable. Technologists are relearning the importance of sound [[Computer architecture|architecture]] from the start, to avoid costly and risky rewrites. The most common legacy systems tend to be those which embraced well-known IT architectural principles, with careful planning and strict methodology during implementation. Poorly designed systems often don't last, both because they wear out and because their inherent faults invite replacement. Thus, many organizations are rediscovering the value of both their legacy systems and the theoretical underpinnings of those systems.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Application retirement]]\n* [[Software rot|Bitrot]]\n* [[Data migration]]\n* [[Deprecation]]\n* [[Digital dark age]]\n* [[Legacy code]]\n* [[Legacy encoding]]\n* [[Legacy-free PC]]\n* [[Legacy port]]\n* [[Software archaeology]]\n* [[Software brittleness]]\n* [[Software entropy]]\n* [[Stovepipe system]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://www.academia.edu/8441540/How_to_Assess_Heritage_Systems_in_the_Early_Phases A.M.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams. However, if so desired, a user may still rebuild the toolchain or reinstall the base system software during or after a normal stage3 installation, effectively simulating the old bootstrap process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#Bootstrapping_the_Base_System_.28Optional_but_Recommended.29|title=Sakaki's EFI Install Guide/Building the Gentoo Base System Minus Kernel|publisher=Sakaki|date=2014-07-04|accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Gentoo Reference Platform===\nFrom 2003 until 2008, the '''Gentoo Reference Platform''' (GRP) was a snapshot of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process, to give faster access to fully functional Gentoo installation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/10/10/intro_gentoo.html|title=Gentoo Linux Reloaded|author=[[Daniel Robbins (computer programmer)|Daniel Robbins]]|date=2002-10-10|accessdate=2007-01-04|work=[[O'Reilly Media|LinuxDevCenter.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.osnews.com/story/6206|title=Gentoo Linux 2004.0 Released|author=Sven Vermeulen|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2018-02-10|work=[[OSNews]]}}</ref> These packages included [[KDE]], [[X Window System]], [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[GNOME]], and [[Mozilla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|title=Gentoo Linux Documentation|accessdate=2018-02-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108142459/https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|archivedate=2014-01-08|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Once the installation was complete, the packages installed as part of the GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built though Portage which would be built using the users' system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Major changes, such as changing the layout of how files are installed across the entire system, typically involve a profile upgrade and may require rebuilding all installed software. These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]). Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media, and switched to two-digit year-based naming after the discontinuation of versioned media. The following new profile versions have been released after 2008.0:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Version\n!

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 19,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.<ref name=\"Negus2006\">{{cite book|author=Chris Negus|title=Live Linux CDs: Building and Customizing Bootables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S3eUgb39C8C&pg=PA224|year=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall Professional|isbn=978-0-13-243274-0|pages=224\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA single invocation of portage's {{mono|emerge}} command can update the local copy of the portage tree, search for a package, or download, compile, and install one or more packages and their dependencies. The built-in features can be set for individual packages, or globally, with so-called \"USE flags\".<ref name=\"Negus2006\"/>\n\nPortage provides a way to set the amount of processes that can run and the maximum load average for the processor cores using the {{mono|EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS}} flag <ref>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</ref> in either the default configuration file at <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code> or a file that <code>export</code>s the flag, like in <code>/root/.bashrc</code>.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]).

However, over the years Gentoo has suffered from dropping popularity. In 2003, Gentoo was the fourth most popular and dropped to seventh in 2004, ninth in 2005, tenth in 2006 and thirteenth in 2007. For 2008, Gentoo dropped to 18th, but the following year it ended its dropping streak by rising to 17th. Gentoo was placed 18th in 2010, 20th in 2011, 22nd in 2012, 33rd in 2013, 38th in 2014, and 45th in 2015.
