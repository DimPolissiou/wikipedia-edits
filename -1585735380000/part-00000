The charter was granted by [[James I]]. The school moved to its current site in [[Croydon]] in 1975. A school for girls, [[Mary Datchelor Girl's School]], was established in Camberwell in 1877. It was built on two houses at 15 and 17 Grove Lane, the location of a former manor house. All except one of its 30 pupils came from the parish of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London. The funding for the school came from a bequest from Mary Datchelor, who died childless. Proceeds of a property in [[Threadneedle Street]] used as a coffee-house were used to pay for apprenticeships for the poor boys of the parish, but as demographics in the City changed, it was decided to set up a school. By the 1970s, the school was receiving funding from the [[Clothworkers' Company]] and the [[Inner London Education Authority]] funded teaching posts. The school came under pressure from ILEA to become co-educational and comprehensive. Faced with this choice or becoming fully private, the school's governors instead decided to close in 1981. The school buildings were later used as offices for the charity [[Save the Children]] but have now been converted to flats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.southwark.gov.uk/objects/317/mary-datchelor-school-camberwell-grove;jsessionid=BB9D9B6B2FAF4191B8CFC96178470121|title=Mary Datchelor School, Camberwell Grove \u2013 Works \u2013 Southwark Heritage|website=heritage.southwark.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F100193|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk/mary-datchelor-school/4593161554|title=Mary Datchelor School \u2013 Exploring Southwark|website=www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk}}</ref>[[Camberwell Collegiate School]]\nwas an independent school located on the eastern side of Camberwell Grove, directly opposite the Grove Chapel.

The charter was granted by [[James I]]. The school moved to its current site in [[Croydon]] in 1975. A school for girls, [[Mary Datchelor Girl's School]], was established in Camberwell in 1877. It was built on two houses at 15 and 17 Grove Lane, the location of a former manor house. All except one of its 30 pupils came from the parish of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London. The funding for the school came from a bequest from Mary Datchelor, who died childless. Proceeds of a property in [[Threadneedle Street]] used as a coffee-house were used to pay for apprenticeships for the poor boys of the parish, but as demographics in the City changed, it was decided to set up a school. By the 1970s, the school was receiving funding from the [[Clothworkers' Company]] and the [[Inner London Education Authority]] funded teaching posts. The school came under pressure from ILEA to become co-educational and comprehensive. Faced with this choice or becoming fully private, the school's governors instead decided to close in 1981. The school buildings were later used as offices for the charity [[Save the Children]] but have now been converted to flats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.southwark.gov.uk/objects/317/mary-datchelor-school-camberwell-grove;jsessionid=BB9D9B6B2FAF4191B8CFC96178470121|title=Mary Datchelor School, Camberwell Grove \u2013 Works \u2013 Southwark Heritage|website=heritage.southwark.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F100193|title=The Discovery Service|first=The National|last=Archives|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk/mary-datchelor-school/4593161554|title=Mary Datchelor School \u2013 Exploring Southwark|website=www.exploringsouthwark.co.uk}}</ref>[[Camberwell Collegiate School]]\nwas an independent school located on the eastern side of Camberwell Grove, directly opposite the Grove Chapel.

It has a similar monumental impressiveness to Gilbert Scott's other local buildings, [[Battersea Power Station]] and the [[Tate Modern]], although its simplicity is partly the result of repeated budget cuts during its construction: much more detail, including carved Gothic stonework surrounding the windows, was originally planned. Camberwell is home to one of London's largest teaching hospitals, [[King's College Hospital]] with associated medical school the Guy's King's and St Thomas' (GKT) School of Medicine.

He was later enrolled at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he graduated in 1869.

He complained about his memory not working correctly among other things so during the summer of his second year he went to Block Island in Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Here, he studied while participating in activities like fishing and sailing.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He then took a competitive exam to apply for an internship at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in New York even though this program was only open to students with medical degrees.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted did very well on the exam and was awarded the internship for House Surgeon at Bellevue where he remained for a year.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" />\n\nHalsted spent most of his internship in the medical wards but also helped with some surgical operations.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> The conditions in the hospital were very unsanitary; bleeding patients was a common practice during this time, and surgical tools weren't as well cared for as they are modernly.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Interns ran around the hospital with buckets full of pus from the patients.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> During the internship, Halsted was introduced to the idea of antiseptic through physicians using Joseph Lister's technique created in 1867.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> This sparked an interest in Halsted, and he helped with the issue of infections at Bellevue during the rest of the internship.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> He ended his academic career in the top ten of his medical school class. He then participated in a competition that placed him at the top of his class.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He graduated in 1877 with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree.<ref>{{cite news|title=William Stewart Halsted|work=[[Annals of Surgery]]|pmc = 1448951}}</ref>\n\n== Medical career ==\nAfter graduation, Halsted joined the [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital|New York Hospital]] as house physician in April 1878, where he introduced the hospital chart which tracks the patient's temperature, pulse and respiration. It was at New York Hospital that Halsted met the pathologist [[William H. Welch]], who would become his closest friend. He left New York Hospital in October 1878.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" />\n\nHalsted had exhausted all of the medical training opportunities the United States had to offer in his position, for there was no program to train recent medical school graduates for a career in medicine at this time.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted then went to Europe to study under the tutelage of several prominent surgeons and scientists, including [[Edoardo Bassini]], [[Ernst von Bergmann]], [[Theodor Billroth]], [[Heinrich Braun]], [[Hans Chiari]], [[Friedrich von Esmarch]], [[Albert von K\u00f6lliker]], [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]], [[Max Schede]], [[Adolph St\u00f6hr]], [[Richard von Volkmann]], [[Anton W\u00f6lfler]], [[Emil Zuckerkandl]].<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> He became especially close to Anton Woelfler among others which gave him unlimited access to resources.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> The relationships Halsted forged with these future leaders in their fields would last a lifetime.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> During this time in Europe, cancer was just starting to be studied more widely, making the timing of his arrival ideal.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> This experience inspired him with multiple new medical ideas and practices that he would contribute to in the United States.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted returned to New York in 1880 and for the next six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. Like when Halsted visited Europe, it was an opportune time for Halsted's involvement because surgery was on the brink of various important discoveries.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He operated at multiple hospitals including the Chambers Street Hospital, College of Physicians and Surgeons where he was Assistant Demonstrator in Anatomy, Charity Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and [[Mount Sinai West]] (formerly Roosevelt Hospital) where he was a visiting physician at all three, and Emigrant Hospital where he was Surgeon-in-Chief.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> At Bellevue Hospital, he convinced the hospital to erect a tent that was used as his surgical area where he could practice the idea of antiseptic surgery.

Halsted and Dr. Richard Hall were the only colleagues who became addicted that would survive their cocaine problems.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted maintained an active career while dealing with his addiction for five years. Although, there were some clues to his condition during this time.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted published an article in 1885 in the ''New York Medical Journal'', and it was incoherent. This showcased what state Halsted was in with his addiction to cocaine.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /><ref name=\"Ember Gerald\" /> His close friend [[Harvey Firestone]] recognized the gravity of the situation, and arranged for Halsted to be abducted and put aboard a steamer headed for Europe.  In the two weeks it took to complete the voyage, Halsted underwent an early, crude form of detoxification.  Upon his return to the United States he became addicted again, and was sent to [[Butler Hospital|Butler Sanatorium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where they attempted to cure his cocaine addiction with morphine. He was there for seven months.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Even though he remained dependent upon morphine for the remainder of his life, he continued his career as a pioneering surgeon; many of his innovations remain standard operating room procedures.<ref>Imber, G.

Halsted began working in Welch's experimental laboratory, and he presented a paper at Harvard Medical School. Although, soon after, he was readmitted to Butler Hospital and remained there for nine months. He returned to Baltimore thereafter.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> When Johns Hopkins University Hospital opened in May 1889, he became Head of the Outpatient Department, acting Surgeon to the Hospital, and Associate Professor of Surgery after being recommended by Welch when the first choice for the position fell through. These lesser positions alluded to the fact that the administration was still worried about Halsted's past cocaine addiction. In 1890, he was appointed Surgeon-in-Chief of the hospital.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> In 1892, Halsted joined Welch, [[William Osler]], and [[Howard Kelly]] in founding the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], and was appointed its first Professor of Surgery.<ref>Imber (2011), pp. 162-4.</ref> Although, compared to his teaching in New York, Halsted's teaching was declining. He would pay attention to specific students and ignore the rest. But, he would also give certain residents that worked under him unprecedented learning experiences because of the amount of responsibility he awarded them.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> During these years at Johns Hopkins, he is credited with multiple achievements in the surgical world.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" />\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nHalsted was credited with starting the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States at Johns Hopkins. He based this mainly on the ideas that he obtained in Europe, especially those of the Germans, Austrians, and Swiss. This was the foundation for the residency training programs in place today.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> The program began with an internship of undefined length (individuals advanced once Halsted believed they were ready for the next level of training), followed by six years as an assistant resident, and then two years as house surgeon. This program was also developed to create role models and teachers for the next generation of surgeons.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted trained many of the prominent academic surgeons of the time, including [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] and [[Walter Dandy]], founders of the surgical subspecialty of [[neurosurgery]]; and [[Hugh H. Young]], a founder of the specialty of [[urology]].<ref>Imber (2011), pp. 183-5.</ref> His methods of training surgeons spread, first to the rest of Baltimore and then throughout the United States.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Many prominent figures in medical surgery were affected and influenced by his new system of training, and it has had a profound impact on American medicine.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" />\n[[File:William Stewart Halsted, Surgical papers Wellcome L0004968.jpg|thumb|Radical mastectomy]]\nHalsted held the belief that cancers spread through the bloodstream, which led him to think that sufficient local removal of the tumor would cure the cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/history-of-cancer/cancer-treatment-surgery.html}}</ref> This belief led him to perform  the first [[radical mastectomy]] for breast cancer in the U.S. at [[Roosevelt Hospital]] in New York in 1882;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1u4x_iGiHNEC&pg=PA721# ''The Breast: Comprehensive Management of Benign and Malignant Diseases, Volume 2'' by Kirby I.

This caused great disfigurement of the women operated on.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted presented his findings at the [[American Surgical Association]] conference in New Orleans in 1898, concluding that the procedure significantly decreased the percentage of local reoccurrence.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> He also presented more findings in 1907, showing the same results.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Although, the radical mastectomy throughout the years has come under fire. It is now known that survival from breast cancer is more closely related to how much the cancer has spread before surgery than how much is removed during surgery.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted created multiple techniques for surgery so damage to tissues and blood supply would be minimized. Some of these new advances included different types of forceps, sutures, and ligatures.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> He was also the first to introduce rubber gloves into the operating room for surgery in 1889, drastically increasing the sanitization of operations.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> Although, this wasn't originally championed for sanitary reasons.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" /> The main reason for the introduction of these rubber gloves was to protect the hands of his scrub nurse, [[Caroline Hampton]]. She was allergic to the antiseptic so Halsted facilitated an arrangement with [[Goodyear Rubber Company]] to make rubber gloves. Caroline Hampton would later become his wife.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" />\n\nHe is also known for many other medical and surgical achievements. Besides working on breast cancer, Halsted also contributed to the surgical treatment for other diseases including vascular aneurysm, inguinal hernia, and a certain kind of primary carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> In addition, he helped develop anesthesia, an integral part of modern surgery.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> As one of the first proponents of [[hemostasis]] and investigators of [[wound healing]], Halsted pioneered [[Halsted's principles]], modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, exact approximation of tissue in wound closures without excessive tightness, and gentle handling of tissues.\n\nOther achievements included the introduction of latex surgical glove and advances in [[thyroid]], [[biliary tract]], [[hernia]],<ref name=\"Halsted1893\">{{cite journal|last=Halsted|first=WS|title=The radical cure of inguinal hernia in the male|journal=[[Annals of Surgery]]|volume=17|issue=5|pages=542\u201356|year=1893|pmc=1492972|pmid=17859917}}</ref> intestinal and arterial [[aneurysm]] surgery.\n\n[[H.L. Mencken]] considered Halsted the greatest physician of the whole Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken's praise of his achievements when he reviewed [[William George MacCallum|Dr. MacCallum]]'s 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. \"His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, he was the first to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and hard to describe. It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. Antisepsis and asepsis, coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted changed all that. He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. [[William James Mayo|Dr. William Mayo]], one of the cofounders of the [[Mayo Clinic]], once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Markel|first1=Howard|title=An Anatomy of Addiction: Sigmond Freud, William Halstead, and the Miracle Drug, Cocaine|date=July 19, 2011|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1400078790|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189 189]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189}}</ref> Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of [[Ambroise Par\u00e9]]: 'God cured him; I assisted.'

He was later enrolled at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he graduated in 1869. Halsted entered [[Yale College]] after a year of studying at home.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> At Yale, Halsted was captain of the football team, played baseball and rowed on the crew team, but his academic achievements were below average.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> One of his social setbacks was in his senior year when he wasn't accepted into the prestigious Skull and Bones Secret Society.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> At the end of his senior year at Yale, a newfound interest in medicine seemed to arise.

He complained about his memory not working correctly among other things so during the summer of his second year he went to Block Island in Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Here, he studied while participating in activities like fishing and sailing.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He then took a competitive exam to apply for an internship at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in New York even though this program was only open to students with medical degrees.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted did very well on the exam and was awarded the internship for House Surgeon at Bellevue where he remained for a year.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" />\n\nHalsted spent most of his internship in the medical wards but also helped with some surgical operations.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> The conditions in the hospital were very unsanitary; bleeding patients was a common practice during this time, and surgical tools weren't as well cared for as they are modernly.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Interns ran around the hospital with buckets full of pus from the patients.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> During the internship, Halsted was introduced to the idea of antiseptic through physicians using Joseph Lister's technique created in 1867.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> This sparked an interest in Halsted, and he helped with the issue of infections at Bellevue during the rest of the internship.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> He ended his academic career in the top ten of his medical school class. He then participated in a competition that placed him at the top of his class.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He graduated in 1877 with a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree.<ref>{{cite news|title=William Stewart Halsted|work=[[Annals of Surgery]]|pmc = 1448951}}</ref>\n\n== Medical career ==\nAfter graduation, Halsted joined the [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital|New York Hospital]] as house physician in April 1878, where he introduced the hospital chart which tracks the patient's temperature, pulse and respiration. It was at New York Hospital that Halsted met the pathologist [[William H. Welch]], who would become his closest friend. He left New York Hospital in October 1878.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" />\n\nHalsted had exhausted all of the medical training opportunities the United States had to offer in his position, for there was no program to train recent medical school graduates for a career in medicine at this time.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted then went to Europe to study under the tutelage of several prominent surgeons and scientists, including [[Edoardo Bassini]], [[Ernst von Bergmann]], [[Theodor Billroth]], [[Heinrich Braun]], [[Hans Chiari]], [[Friedrich von Esmarch]], [[Albert von K\u00f6lliker]], [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]], [[Max Schede]], [[Adolph St\u00f6hr]], [[Richard von Volkmann]], [[Anton W\u00f6lfler]], [[Emil Zuckerkandl]].<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> He became especially close to Anton Woelfler among others which gave him unlimited access to resources.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> The relationships Halsted forged with these future leaders in their fields would last a lifetime.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> During this time in Europe, cancer was just starting to be studied more widely, making the timing of his arrival ideal.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> This experience inspired him with multiple new medical ideas and practices that he would contribute to in the United States.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted returned to New York in 1880 and for the next six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. Like when Halsted visited Europe, it was an opportune time for Halsted's involvement because surgery was on the brink of various important discoveries.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He operated at multiple hospitals including the Chambers Street Hospital, College of Physicians and Surgeons where he was Assistant Demonstrator in Anatomy, Charity Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and [[Mount Sinai West]] (formerly Roosevelt Hospital) where he was a visiting physician at all three, and Emigrant Hospital where he was Surgeon-in-Chief.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> At Bellevue Hospital, he convinced the hospital to erect a tent that was used as his surgical area where he could practice the idea of antiseptic surgery. This project cost $10,000 at the time.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted also started teaching, but he greatly strayed from classical teaching methods. He reformed the classroom by creating a more hands-on experience coupled with theory for his students who were generally at the top of their classes.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher due to this. In 1882 he performed one of the first [[gallbladder]] operations in the United States, a [[cholecystotomy]] performed on his mother on the kitchen table at 2&nbsp;am in which he removed seven gallstones.<ref name=\"Ember Gerald\">{{Cite journal|last=Gerald|first=Ember|title=Genius on the Edge: The Bizarre Double Life of Dr. William Stewart halsted|url=http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.28.0a/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&S=BHNAFPLCFLDDNCOLNCFKMBMCHPCHAA00&returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3f%26Full%2bText%3dL%257cS.sh.22.23%257c0%257c00000542-201106000-00046%26S%3dBHNAFPLCFLDDNCOLNCFKMBMCHPCHAA00&directlink=http%3a%2f%2fovidsp.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCMCMBOLFL00%2ffs046%2fovft%2flive%2fgv023%2f00000542%2f00000542-201106000-00046.pdf&filename=Genius+on+the+Edge%3a+The+Bizarre+Double+Life+of+Dr.+William+Stewart+Halsted.&pdf_key=FPDDNCMCMBOLFL00&pdf_index=/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/00000542/00000542-201106000-00046|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=114|issue=6|pages=1496\u20131497|via=|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e318216e9fa|year=2011|pmc=2898614}}</ref> His mother completely recovered.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Halsted also performed one of the first emergency blood transfusions in the United States.<ref name=\"Ember Gerald\" /> He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth.

Halsted and Dr. Richard Hall were the only colleagues who became addicted that would survive their cocaine problems.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted maintained an active career while dealing with his addiction for five years. Although, there were some clues to his condition during this time.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted published an article in 1885 in the ''New York Medical Journal'', and it was incoherent. This showcased what state Halsted was in with his addiction to cocaine.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /><ref name=\"Ember Gerald\" /> His close friend [[Harvey Firestone]] recognized the gravity of the situation, and arranged for Halsted to be abducted and put aboard a steamer headed for Europe.  In the two weeks it took to complete the voyage, Halsted underwent an early, crude form of detoxification.  Upon his return to the United States he became addicted again, and was sent to [[Butler Hospital|Butler Sanatorium]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where they attempted to cure his cocaine addiction with morphine. He was there for seven months.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> Even though he remained dependent upon morphine for the remainder of his life, he continued his career as a pioneering surgeon; many of his innovations remain standard operating room procedures.<ref>Imber, G. ''Genius on the Edge: The Bizarre Double Life of Dr. William Stewart Halsted''.  Kaplan Publishing (2010), pp. 138-43.</ref> However, his addiction to cocaine ended his medical career in New York City.<ref name=\"Peter Olch\" />\n[[File:Four doctors 1907.jpg|thumb|The four doctors: Osler, Halsted, Welch, and Kelly]]\nFollowing his discharge from Butler in 1886, Halsted moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] to join his friend William Welch in organizing and launching the new [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Halsted began working in Welch's experimental laboratory, and he presented a paper at Harvard Medical School. Although, soon after, he was readmitted to Butler Hospital and remained there for nine months. He returned to Baltimore thereafter.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /> When Johns Hopkins University Hospital opened in May 1889, he became Head of the Outpatient Department, acting Surgeon to the Hospital, and Associate Professor of Surgery after being recommended by Welch when the first choice for the position fell through. These lesser positions alluded to the fact that the administration was still worried about Halsted's past cocaine addiction. In 1890, he was appointed Surgeon-in-Chief of the hospital.<ref name=\"Michael Osborne\" /><ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> In 1892, Halsted joined Welch, [[William Osler]], and [[Howard Kelly]] in founding the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], and was appointed its first Professor of Surgery.<ref>Imber (2011), pp. 162-4.</ref> Although, compared to his teaching in New York, Halsted's teaching was declining. He would pay attention to specific students and ignore the rest. But, he would also give certain residents that worked under him unprecedented learning experiences because of the amount of responsibility he awarded them.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Peter Olch\" /> During these years at Johns Hopkins, he is credited with multiple achievements in the surgical world.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" />\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nHalsted was credited with starting the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States at Johns Hopkins. He based this mainly on the ideas that he obtained in Europe, especially those of the Germans, Austrians, and Swiss. This was the foundation for the residency training programs in place today.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> The program began with an internship of undefined length (individuals advanced once Halsted believed they were ready for the next level of training), followed by six years as an assistant resident, and then two years as house surgeon. This program was also developed to create role models and teachers for the next generation of surgeons.<ref name=\"JL Cameron\" /> Halsted trained many of the prominent academic surgeons of the time, including [[Harvey Williams Cushing]] and [[Walter Dandy]], founders of the surgical subspecialty of [[neurosurgery]]; and [[Hugh H.

This caused great disfigurement of the women operated on.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Halsted presented his findings at the [[American Surgical Association]] conference in New Orleans in 1898, concluding that the procedure significantly decreased the percentage of local reoccurrence.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> He also presented more findings in 1907, showing the same results.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" /> Although, the radical mastectomy throughout the years has come under fire. It is now known that survival from breast cancer is more closely related to how much the cancer has spread before surgery than how much is removed during surgery.<ref name=\"Siddhartha Mukherjee\" />\n\nHalsted created multiple techniques for surgery so damage to tissues and blood supply would be minimized. Some of these new advances included different types of forceps, sutures, and ligatures.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> He was also the first to introduce rubber gloves into the operating room for surgery in 1889, drastically increasing the sanitization of operations.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> Although, this wasn't originally championed for sanitary reasons.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" /> The main reason for the introduction of these rubber gloves was to protect the hands of his scrub nurse, [[Caroline Hampton]]. She was allergic to the antiseptic so Halsted facilitated an arrangement with [[Goodyear Rubber Company]] to make rubber gloves. Caroline Hampton would later become his wife.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /><ref name=\"LF Haas\" />\n\nHe is also known for many other medical and surgical achievements. Besides working on breast cancer, Halsted also contributed to the surgical treatment for other diseases including vascular aneurysm, inguinal hernia, and a certain kind of primary carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> In addition, he helped develop anesthesia, an integral part of modern surgery.<ref name=\"Kim Ock-Joo\" /> As one of the first proponents of [[hemostasis]] and investigators of [[wound healing]], Halsted pioneered [[Halstead's principles|Halsted's principles]], modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, exact approximation of tissue in wound closures without excessive tightness, and gentle handling of tissues.\n\nOther achievements included the introduction of latex surgical glove and advances in [[thyroid]], [[biliary tract]], [[hernia]],<ref name=\"Halsted1893\">{{cite journal|last=Halsted|first=WS|title=The radical cure of inguinal hernia in the male|journal=[[Annals of Surgery]]|volume=17|issue=5|pages=542\u201356|year=1893|pmc=1492972|pmid=17859917}}</ref> intestinal and arterial [[aneurysm]] surgery.\n\n[[H.L. Mencken]] considered Halsted the greatest physician of the whole Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken's praise of his achievements when he reviewed [[William George MacCallum|Dr. MacCallum]]'s 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. \"His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, he was the first to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and hard to describe. It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. Antisepsis and asepsis, coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted changed all that. He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. [[William James Mayo|Dr. William Mayo]], one of the cofounders of the [[Mayo Clinic]], once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Markel|first1=Howard|title=An Anatomy of Addiction: Sigmond Freud, William Halstead, and the Miracle Drug, Cocaine|date=July 19, 2011|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1400078790|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189 189]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780375423307/page/189}}</ref> Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of [[Ambroise Par\u00e9]]: 'God cured him; I assisted.'

SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine the higher the website ranks in the [[Search_engine_results_page|search engine results page (SERP)]]. These visitors can then be converted into customers.<ref>Ortiz-Cordova, A. and Jansen, B. J.

The former instead is more focused on national or international searches.\n\n== History ==\n[[Webmaster]]s and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early [[World Wide Web|Web]]. Initially, all webmasters only needed to submit the address of a page, or [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], to the various engines which would send a \"[[Web crawler|spider]]\" to \"crawl\" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be [[Index (search engine)|indexed]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thinkpink.com/bp/Thesis/Thesis.pdf| title=Finding What People Want: Experiences with the WebCrawler|accessdate=May 7, 2007| publisher=The Second International WWW Conference Chicago, USA, October 17\u201320, 1994|author=Brian Pinkerton}}</ref> The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an [[search engine indexing|indexer]], extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located, and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains. All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date.\n\nWebsite owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2048891/intro-search-engine-optimization|title=Intro to Search Engine Optimization {{!}} Search Engine Watch|website=searchenginewatch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref> creating an opportunity for both [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] and [[black hat hacking|black hat]] SEO practitioners.

Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm|title=Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia|author=Cory Doctorow|date=August 26, 2001|publisher=e-LearningGuru|accessdate=May 8, 2007 |archiveurl = http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm |archivedate = April 9, 2007|author-link=Cory Doctorow}}</ref>{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Web content providers also manipulated some attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tilde/InterNet/Search/1998_WWW7.html|title=What is a tall poppy among web pages?|date=April 1998|publisher=Proc. 7th Int.

Flynn|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy relying so much on factors such as [[keyword density]] which were exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their [[Search engine results page|results page]]s showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2016/01/20/is-keyword-density-still-important-for-seo/2/#2ef69ba36733 |title=Is Keyword Density Still Important for SEO|author=Jason Demers|date=January 20, 2016|magazine=Forbes|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}</ref> Since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search, poor quality or irrelevant search results could lead users to find other search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate. In 2005, an annual conference, AIRWeb (Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web), was created to bring together practitioners and researchers concerned with search engine optimization and related topics.<ref name=\"airweb\">{{cite web|url=http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/|title=AIRWeb|publisher=Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web, annual conference|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCompanies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client websites banned from the search results.

The 2013 [[Google Hummingbird]] update featured an algorithm change designed to improve Google's natural language processing and semantic understanding of web pages. Hummingbird's language processing system falls under the newly recognized term of ''''Conversational Search'''' where the system pays more attention to each word in the query in order to better match the pages to the meaning of the query rather than a few words <ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: All About The New Google \"Hummingbird\" Algorithm|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816|website=www.searchengineland.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>. With regards to the changes made to search engine optimization, for content publishers and writers, Hummingbird is intended to resolve issues by getting rid of irrelevant content and spam, allowing [[Google]] to produce high-quality content and rely on them to be 'trusted' authors.\n\nIn January 2020, Google rolled out a broad algorithm update called Google January 2020 Core Update. According to the algorithm update, rank priority will be given to the pages with fresh and quality information over obsolete data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/google-core-update-january-2020/|title=Google Update January 2020: Latest News and Analysis|website=Searchmetrics.com}}</ref> For e.g., if some search for \"best movies\", then the best movies of 2019 will be ranking above best movies of 2015 for the keyword.

The update has got mixed reactions from webmasters and SEO professionals. A huge drop was noticed in the rankings of many websites after rolling out the update. If you notice a drop in your website's ranking, it's not because Google has penalized your website or blacklisted it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudspeakerspeak.com/news/january-2020-core-update|title=Google January 2020 Core Update: How It Will Affect Your Search Rankings|website=loudspeakerspeak.com}}</ref> Rank of dictionary websites was seen to be improved to a significant level by Moz' Pete Meyers. 2019 has seen four algorithm updates from google.

Websites getting more inbound links, or stronger links, are presumed to be more important and what the user is searching for. In this example, since website B is the recipient of numerous inbound links, it ranks more highly in a web search. And the links \"carry through\", such that website C, even though it only has one inbound link, has an inbound link from a highly popular site (B) while site E does not. Note: Percentages are rounded.]]\nThe leading search engines, such as [[Google]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Yahoo!]], use [[Web crawler|crawlers]] to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. The [[Yahoo!

Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a [[meta tag]] specific to robots (usually <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\"> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the [[root directory]] is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/newspapers-amok-new-york-times-spamming-google-la-times-hijacking-carscom-11169|title=Newspapers Amok!

Adding relevant keywords to a web page's metadata, including the [[HEAD tag|title tag and meta description]], will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listings, thus increasing traffic. [[URL canonicalization]] of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the [[canonical link element]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2009/02/12/partnering-to-help-solve-duplicate-content-issues|title=Bing \u2013 Partnering to help solve duplicate content issues \u2013 Webmaster Blog \u2013 Bing Community|publisher=www.bing.com|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}</ref> or via [[301 redirect]]s can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all count towards the page's link popularity score. <!--add ref here to Rhea Drysdale article on PageRank and Playdoh-->\n\n=== White hat versus black hat techniques ===\nSEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend as part of good design (\"white hat\"), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve (\"black hat\"). The search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them [[spamdexing]]. Industry commentators have classified these methods, and the practitioners who employ them, as either [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] SEO, or [[black hat hacking|black hat]] SEO.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Goodman|publisher=SearchEngineWatch|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3483941|title=Search Engine Showdown: Black hats vs. White hats at SES|accessdate=May 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222004138/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3483941|archivedate=February 22, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jill Whalen|url=http://www.searchengineguide.com/whalen/2004/1116_jw1.html|title=Black Hat/White Hat Search Engine Optimization|publisher=searchengineguide.com|accessdate=May 9, 2007|date=November 16, 2004|author-link=Jill Whalen}}</ref>\n\nAn SEO technique is considered white hat if it conforms to the search engines' guidelines and involves no deception.

Does Google recommend working with companies that offer to make my site Google-friendly? | accessdate=April 18, 2007}}</ref> are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online \"spider\" algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility,<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Hagans|publisher=[[A List Apart]]|url=http://alistapart.com/articles/accessibilityseo|title=High Accessibility Is Effective Search Engine Optimization|date = November 8, 2005 | accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref> although the two are not identical.\n\n[[spamdexing|Black hat SEO]] attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines, or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible [[Span and div|div]], or positioned off screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as [[cloaking]]. Another category sometimes used is [[Grey hat|grey hat SEO]]. This is in between black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings.\n\nSearch engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms, or by a manual site review. One example was the February 2006 Google removal of both [[BMW]] Germany and [[Ricoh]] Germany for use of deceptive practices.<ref name=\"intwebspam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/ramping-up-on-international-webspam/|publisher=mattcutts.com/blog | title=Ramping up on international webspam|author=Matt Cutts|date=February 4, 2006|accessdate=May 9, 2007|author-link=Matt Cutts }}</ref> Both companies, however, quickly apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google's search engine results page.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 9, 2007|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/recent-reinclusions/|publisher = mattcutts.com/blog | title=Recent reinclusions|author=Matt Cutts|date=February 7, 2006|author-link=Matt Cutts}}</ref>\n\n== As marketing strategy ==\nSEO is not an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet marketing strategies can be more effective, such as paid advertising through pay per click [[Pay per click|(PPC)]] campaigns, depending on the site operator's goals.

Initially, all webmasters only needed to submit the address of a page, or [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], to the various engines which would send a \"[[Web crawler|spider]]\" to \"crawl\" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be [[Index (search engine)|indexed]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thinkpink.com/bp/Thesis/Thesis.pdf| title=Finding What People Want: Experiences with the WebCrawler|accessdate=May 7, 2007| publisher=The Second International WWW Conference Chicago, USA, October 17\u201320, 1994|author=Brian Pinkerton}}</ref> The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server. A second program, known as an [[search engine indexing|indexer]], extracts information about the page, such as the words it contains, where they are located, and any weight for specific words, as well as all links the page contains. All of this information is then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date.\n\nWebsite owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2048891/intro-search-engine-optimization|title=Intro to Search Engine Optimization {{!}} Search Engine Watch|website=searchenginewatch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-29}}</ref> creating an opportunity for both [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] and [[black hat hacking|black hat]] SEO practitioners.

To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their [[Search engine results page|results page]]s showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2016/01/20/is-keyword-density-still-important-for-seo/2/#2ef69ba36733 |title=Is Keyword Density Still Important for SEO|author=Jason Demers|date=January 20, 2016|magazine=Forbes|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}</ref> Since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search, poor quality or irrelevant search results could lead users to find other search sources.

Additionally several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of [[iframe]]s, [[Flash animation|Flash]] and JavaScript.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchengineland.com/google-loses-backwards-compatibility-on-paid-link-blocking-pagerank-sculpting-20408 |title=Google Loses \"Backwards Compatibility\" On Paid Link Blocking & PageRank Sculpting |publisher=searchengineland.com |accessdate=August 17, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/personalized-search-for-everyone.html|title=Personalized Search for everyone|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref> On June 8, 2010 a new web indexing system called [[Google Caffeine]] was announced. Designed to allow users to find news results, forum posts and other content much sooner after publishing than before, Google caffeine was a change to the way Google updated its index in order to make things show up quicker on Google than before. According to Carrie Grimes, the software engineer who announced Caffeine for Google, \"Caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for web searches than our last index...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/our-new-search-index-caffeine.html |title=Our new search index: Caffeine |publisher=Google: Official Blog|accessdate=May 10, 2014 }}</ref> [[Google Instant]], real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Relevance Meets Real-Time Web |publisher=[[Google Blog]]|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/relevance-meets-real-time-web.html }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2011, Google announced the [[Google Panda|Panda]] update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice. However, Google implemented a new system which punishes sites whose content is not unique.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Search Quality Updates |publisher=[[Google Blog]]|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/finding-more-high-quality-sites-in.html}}</ref> The 2012 [[Google Penguin]] attempted to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine.<ref>{{cite web|title=What You Need to Know About Google's Penguin Update |publisher=[[Inc.com]]|url=http://www.inc.com/aaron-aders/what-you-need-to-know-about-googles-penguin-update.html}}</ref> Although [[Google Penguin]] has been presented as an algorithm aimed at fighting web spam, it really focuses on spammy links<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-penguin-looks-mostly-link-source-says-google-260902|title=Google Penguin looks mostly at your link source, says Google|date=2016-10-10|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-US}}</ref> by gauging the quality of the sites the links are coming from. The 2013 [[Google Hummingbird]] update featured an algorithm change designed to improve Google's natural language processing and semantic understanding of web pages. Hummingbird's language processing system falls under the newly recognized term of ''''Conversational Search'''' where the system pays more attention to each word in the query in order to better match the pages to the meaning of the query rather than a few words <ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: All About The New Google \"Hummingbird\" Algorithm|url=https://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816|website=www.searchengineland.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>. With regards to the changes made to search engine optimization, for content publishers and writers, Hummingbird is intended to resolve issues by getting rid of irrelevant content and spam, allowing [[Google]] to produce high-quality content and rely on them to be 'trusted' authors.\n\n== Methods ==\n\n=== Getting indexed ===\n[[File:PageRanks-Example.svg|thumb|350px|Search engines use complex mathematical algorithms to interpret which websites a user seeks. In this diagram, if each bubble represents a website, programs sometimes called ''spiders'' examine which sites link to which other sites, with arrows representing these links. Websites getting more inbound links, or stronger links, are presumed to be more important and what the user is searching for. In this example, since website B is the recipient of numerous inbound links, it ranks more highly in a web search. And the links \"carry through\", such that website C, even though it only has one inbound link, has an inbound link from a highly popular site (B) while site E does not. Note: Percentages are rounded.]]\nThe leading search engines, such as [[Google]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Yahoo!]], use [[Web crawler|crawlers]] to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. The [[Yahoo! Directory]] and [[DMOZ]], two major directories which closed in 2014 and 2017 respectively, both required manual submission and human editorial review.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2167881|title=Submitting To Directories: Yahoo & The Open Directory|date=March 12, 2007|accessdate=May 15, 2007|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519052103/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2167881|archivedate=May 19, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Google offers [[Google Webmaster Tools|Google Search Console]], for which an XML [[Sitemap]] feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40318&topic=8514|title=What is a Sitemap file and why should I have one?|accessdate=March 19, 2007}}</ref> in addition to their URL submission console.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url |title=Search Console - Crawl URL |accessdate=2015-12-18 }}</ref> Yahoo! formerly operated a paid submission service that guaranteed crawling for a [[Pay per click|cost per click]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2167871|title=Submitting To Search Crawlers: Google, Yahoo, Ask & Microsoft's Live Search|date=March 12, 2007|accessdate=May 15, 2007|publisher=[[Search Engine Watch]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510090932/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2167871#Teoma|archivedate=May 10, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> however, this practice was discontinued in 2009.\n\n[[Web search engine|Search engine]] crawlers may look at a number of different factors when [[Web crawler|crawling]] a site. Not every page is indexed by the search engines. The distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled.<ref name=\"cho\">{{cite web|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/347/|title=Efficient crawling through URL ordering|author=Cho, J., Garcia-Molina, H.|year=1998|publisher=Proceedings of the seventh conference on World Wide Web, Brisbane, Australia|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\nToday, most people are searching on Google using a mobile device.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html|title=Mobile-first Index|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}</ref> In November 2016, Google announced a major change to the way crawling websites and started to make their index mobile-first, which means the mobile version of your website becomes the starting point for what Google includes in their index.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Phan |first1=Doantam |title=Mobile-first Indexing |url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html |website=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog |accessdate=16 January 2019 |date=4 November 2016}}</ref> In May 2019, Google updated the rendering engine of their crawler to be the latest version of Chromium (74 at the time of the announcement).

The delay was to allow webmasters time to update their code that responded to particular bot User-Agent strings.  Google ran evaluations and felt confident the impact would be minor.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/10/updating-user-agent-of-googlebot.html|title=Updating the user agent of Googlebot|website=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Preventing crawling ===\n{{main article|Robots Exclusion Standard}}\nTo avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard [[robots.txt]] file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a [[meta tag]] specific to robots (usually <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\"> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the [[root directory]] is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/newspapers-amok-new-york-times-spamming-google-la-times-hijacking-carscom-11169|title=Newspapers Amok!

LA Times Hijacking Cars.com?|publisher=[[Search Engine Land]]|date=May 8, 2007|accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Increasing prominence ===\nA variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. [[Methods of website linking|Cross linking]] between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility.<ref name=\"Shari\">{{cite web |url=http://www.clickz.com/3623372 |title=The Most Important SEO Strategy | publisher = ClickZ | work = clickz.com |accessdate=April 18, 2010 }}</ref>\nWriting content that includes frequently searched keyword phrase, so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic.<ref name=\"Shari\" /> Updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page's metadata, including the [[HEAD tag|title tag and meta description]], will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listings, thus increasing traffic. [[URL canonicalization]] of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the [[canonical link element]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2009/02/12/partnering-to-help-solve-duplicate-content-issues|title=Bing \u2013 Partnering to help solve duplicate content issues \u2013 Webmaster Blog \u2013 Bing Community|publisher=www.bing.com|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}</ref> or via [[301 redirect]]s can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all count towards the page's link popularity score. <!--add ref here to Rhea Drysdale article on PageRank and Playdoh-->\n\n=== White hat versus black hat techniques ===\nSEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend as part of good design (\"white hat\"), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve (\"black hat\"). The search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them [[spamdexing]]. Industry commentators have classified these methods, and the practitioners who employ them, as either [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] SEO, or [[black hat hacking|black hat]] SEO.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Goodman|publisher=SearchEngineWatch|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3483941|title=Search Engine Showdown: Black hats vs. White hats at SES|accessdate=May 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222004138/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3483941|archivedate=February 22, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jill Whalen|url=http://www.searchengineguide.com/whalen/2004/1116_jw1.html|title=Black Hat/White Hat Search Engine Optimization|publisher=searchengineguide.com|accessdate=May 9, 2007|date=November 16, 2004|author-link=Jill Whalen}}</ref>\n\nAn SEO technique is considered white hat if it conforms to the search engines' guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines<ref name=\"g-wmguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html|title=Google's Guidelines on Site Design|accessdate=April 18, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"ms-wmguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/webmaster-guidelines-30fba23a|title=Bing Webmaster Guidelines |publisher = bing.com | accessdate=September 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/webmasters/seo.html|title=What's an SEO? Does Google recommend working with companies that offer to make my site Google-friendly? | accessdate=April 18, 2007}}</ref> are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online \"spider\" algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility,<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Hagans|publisher=[[A List Apart]]|url=http://alistapart.com/articles/accessibilityseo|title=High Accessibility Is Effective Search Engine Optimization|date = November 8, 2005 | accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref> although the two are not identical.\n\n[[spamdexing|Black hat SEO]] attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines, or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible [[Span and div|div]], or positioned off screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as [[cloaking]]. Another category sometimes used is [[Grey hat|grey hat SEO]]. This is in between black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings.\n\nSearch engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms, or by a manual site review. One example was the February 2006 Google removal of both [[BMW]] Germany and [[Ricoh]] Germany for use of deceptive practices.<ref name=\"intwebspam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/ramping-up-on-international-webspam/|publisher=mattcutts.com/blog | title=Ramping up on international webspam|author=Matt Cutts|date=February 4, 2006|accessdate=May 9, 2007|author-link=Matt Cutts }}</ref> Both companies, however, quickly apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google's search engine results page.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 9, 2007|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/recent-reinclusions/|publisher = mattcutts.com/blog | title=Recent reinclusions|author=Matt Cutts|date=February 7, 2006|author-link=Matt Cutts}}</ref>\n\n== As marketing strategy ==\nSEO is not an appropriate strategy for every website, and other Internet marketing strategies can be more effective, such as paid advertising through pay per click [[Pay per click|(PPC)]] campaigns, depending on the site operator's goals.

[[Google]] has been one of the companies that are utilizing the popularity of mobile usage by encouraging websites to use their [[Google Search Console]], the '''Mobile-Friendly Test''', which allows companies to measure up their website to the search engine results and how user-friendly it is.\n\nSEO may generate an adequate [[return on investment]]. However, search engines are not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals.
