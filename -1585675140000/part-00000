The function of VADs is different from that of [[artificial cardiac pacemaker]]s; some are for short-term use, typically for patients recovering from [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) and for patients recovering from [[cardiac surgery]]; some are for long-term use (months to years to perpetuity), typically for patients suffering from advanced [[heart failure]].\n\nVADs are designed to assist either the right [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of ventricular assistance device applied depends upon the type of underlying [[heart disease]], and upon the pulmonary arterial-resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left-ventricle assistance device (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (as it is sufficient in most cases -the right side of the heart is then often already able to make use of the heavily increased blood flow-), but when the pulmonary arterial-resistance is high, then an (additional) right-ventricle assistance device (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation. If both a LVAD and a RVAD is needed a BiVAD is normally used, rather than a separate LVAD and an RVAD.\n\nNormally, the long-term VAD is used as a [[bridge to transplantation]] (BTT)\u2014keeping the patient alive, and in reasonably good condition, and able to await the heart transplant outside of the hospital.\nOther \"bridges\" include bridge to candidacy, bridge to decision, and bridge to recovery. \nIn some instances VAD's are also used as [[destination therapy]] (DT). In this instance, the patient shall not undergo a heart transplantion and the VAD is what the patient will use for the remainder of their life.<ref name=\"content.nejm.org\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Birks | first1 = EJ| last2 = Tansley | first2 = PD | last3 = Hardy | first3 = J|display-authors=etal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053063 | title = Left Ventricular Assist Device and Drug Therapy for the Reversal of Heart Failure | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 355 | issue = 18 | pages = 1873\u20131884 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17079761 }}</ref><ref name=\"ventracor.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080204022437/http://www.ventracor.com/news_item.asp?newsID=431 \"First VentrAssist Heart Recovery Featured on National TV\"].

Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin.  In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of the rotor's axis.<ref name=fukamachi_2005>{{cite journal |last= Fukamachi |first= Kiyo |author2=Smedira, Nicholas  |date=August 2005 |title= Smaller, Safer, Totally Implantable LVADs: Fact or Fantasy?|journal= American College of Cardiology Current Journal Review |volume= 14 |issue= 8 |pages= 40\u201342 |doi=10.1016/j.accreview.2005.06.001}}</ref>\n\nAn important issue with continuous flow pumps is the method used to suspend the rotor.

Stanley Crawford.\nThe first successful implantation of a left ventricular assist device was completed in 1966 by Dr. [[Michael E. DeBakey]] to a 37-year-old woman. A paracorporeal (external) circuit was able to provide mechanical support for 10 days after the surgery.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kirklin|first1=JK|last2=Naftel|first2=DC|title=Mechanical circulatory support: registering a therapy in evolution.|journal=[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation: Heart Failure]]|date=September 2008|volume=1|issue=3|pages=200\u20135|pmid=19808290|doi=10.1161/circheartfailure.108.782599|pmc=3437761}}</ref> The first successful long-term implantation of an artificial LVAD was conducted in 1988 by Dr. [[William F.

Devices of this kind include the HeartMate IP LVAS, which was approved for use in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in October 1994. These devices began to gain acceptance in the late 1990s as heart surgeons including [[Eric Rose]], [[O. H. Frazier]] and [[Mehmet Oz]] began popularizing the concept that patients could live outside the hospital. Media coverage of outpatients with VADs underscored these arguments.<ref>{{cite video|url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2617eheart.html|title=Electric Heart|publisher=PBS}}</ref>\n\nMore recent work has concentrated on continuous flow pumps, which can be roughly categorized as either centrifugal pumps or [[Axial flow pump|axial flow]] [[impeller]] driven pumps.  These pumps have the advantage of greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability.  These devices are  referred to as second generation VADs. A side effect is that the user will not have a [[pulse]],<ref>\nDan Baum.\n[http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-02/no-pulse-how-doctors-reinvented-human-heart \"No Pulse: How Doctors Reinvented the Human Heart\"].\nPopular Science.\n2012.\n</ref>\nor that the pulse intensity will be seriously reduced.<ref>\n[http://columbiasurgery.org/lvad/vad-faqs \"VAD FAQs\"].\nColumbia University Medical Center.\nquote: \"A patient who is implanted with a HeartMate II usually has a dampened pulse.\"\nViewed 2016-08-27.\n</ref>\n\nThird generation VADs suspend the impeller in the pump using either hydrodynamic or electromagnetic suspension, thus removing the need for bearings and reducing the number of moving parts to one.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nAnother technology undergoing clinical trials is the use of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using percutaneous cables. Apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action. A pulsatile pump using this technology has CE Mark approval and is in clinical trials for US FDA approval.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nA very different approach in the early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta. Inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand\u2014in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle. A proposed refinement is to use the patient's skeletal muscle, driven by a [[pacemaker]],  to power this device which would make it truly self-contained. However a similar operation ([[cardiomyoplasty]]) was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results.  In any case, it has substantial potential advantages in avoiding the need to operate on the heart itself and in avoiding any contact between blood and the device. This approach involves a return to a pulsatile flow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n[[Peter Houghton]] was the longest surviving recipient of a VAD for permanent use.

The function of VADs is different from that of [[artificial cardiac pacemaker]]s; some are for short-term use, typically for patients recovering from [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) and for patients recovering from [[cardiac surgery]]; some are for long-term use (months to years to perpetuity), typically for patients suffering from advanced [[heart failure]].\n\nVADs are designed to assist either the right [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] (RVAD) or the left ventricle (LVAD), or to assist both ventricles (BiVAD). The type of ventricular assistance device applied depends upon the type of underlying [[heart disease]], and upon the pulmonary arterial-resistance, which determines the workload of the right ventricle. The left-ventricle assistance device (LVAD) is the most common device applied to a defective heart (as it is sufficient in most cases -the right side of the heart is then often already able to make use of the heavily increased blood flow-), but when the pulmonary arterial-resistance is high, then an (additional) right-ventricle assistance device (RVAD) might be necessary to resolve the problem of cardiac circulation. If both a LVAD and a RVAD is needed a BiVAD is normally used, rather than a separate LVAD and an RVAD.\n\nNormally, the long-term VAD is used as a [[bridge to transplantation]] (BTT)\u2014keeping the patient alive, and in reasonably good condition, and able to await the heart transplant outside of the hospital.\nOther \"bridges\" include bridge to candidacy, bridge to decision, and bridge to recovery. \nIn some instances VAD's are also used as [[destination therapy]] (DT). In this instance, the patient shall not undergo a heart transplantion and the VAD is what the patient will use for the remainder of their life.<ref name=\"content.nejm.org\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Birks | first1 = EJ| last2 = Tansley | first2 = PD | last3 = Hardy | first3 = J|display-authors=etal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053063 | title = Left Ventricular Assist Device and Drug Therapy for the Reversal of Heart Failure | journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 355 | issue = 18 | pages = 1873\u20131884 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17079761 }}</ref><ref name=\"ventracor.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080204022437/http://www.ventracor.com/news_item.asp?newsID=431 \"First VentrAssist Heart Recovery Featured on National TV\"].

In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of the rotor's axis.<ref name=fukamachi_2005>{{cite journal |last= Fukamachi |first= Kiyo |author2=Smedira, Nicholas  |date=August 2005 |title= Smaller, Safer, Totally Implantable LVADs: Fact or Fantasy?|journal= American College of Cardiology Current Journal Review |volume= 14 |issue= 8 |pages= 40\u201342 |doi=10.1016/j.accreview.2005.06.001}}</ref>\n\nAn important issue with continuous flow pumps is the method used to suspend the rotor.

Devices of this kind include the HeartMate IP LVAS, which was approved for use in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in October 1994. These devices began to gain acceptance in the late 1990s as heart surgeons including [[Eric Rose]], [[O. H. Frazier]] and [[Mehmet Oz]] began popularizing the concept that patients could live outside the hospital. Media coverage of outpatients with VADs underscored these arguments.<ref>{{cite video|url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2617eheart.html|title=Electric Heart|publisher=PBS}}</ref>\n\nMore recent work has concentrated on continuous flow pumps, which can be roughly categorized as either centrifugal pumps or [[Axial flow pump|axial flow]] [[impeller]] driven pumps.  These pumps have the advantage of greater simplicity resulting in smaller size and greater reliability.  These devices are  referred to as second generation VADs. A side effect is that the user will not have a [[pulse]],<ref>\nDan Baum.\n[http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-02/no-pulse-how-doctors-reinvented-human-heart \"No Pulse: How Doctors Reinvented the Human Heart\"].\nPopular Science.\n2012.\n</ref>\nor that the pulse intensity will be seriously reduced.<ref>\n[http://columbiasurgery.org/lvad/vad-faqs \"VAD FAQs\"].\nColumbia University Medical Center.\nquote: \"A patient who is implanted with a HeartMate II usually has a dampened pulse.\"\nViewed 2016-08-27.\n</ref>\n\nThird generation VADs suspend the impeller in the pump using either hydrodynamic or electromagnetic suspension, thus removing the need for bearings and reducing the number of moving parts to one.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nAnother technology undergoing clinical trials is the use of trans cutaneous induction to power and control the device rather than using percutaneous cables. Apart from the obvious cosmetic advantage this reduces the risk of infection and the consequent need to take preventative action. A pulsatile pump using this technology has CE Mark approval and is in clinical trials for US FDA approval.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nA very different approach in the early stages of development is the use of an inflatable cuff around the aorta. Inflating the cuff contracts the aorta and deflating the cuff allows the aorta to expand\u2014in effect the aorta becomes a second left ventricle. A proposed refinement is to use the patient's skeletal muscle, driven by a [[pacemaker]],  to power this device which would make it truly self-contained. However a similar operation ([[cardiomyoplasty]]) was tried in the 1990s with disappointing results.  In any case, it has substantial potential advantages in avoiding the need to operate on the heart itself and in avoiding any contact between blood and the device. This approach involves a return to a pulsatile flow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n[[Peter Houghton]] was the longest surviving recipient of a VAD for permanent use.

Officials of the administration, the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP) also withdrew their support for President Estrada.\n\n[[Image:NDS reverse 200 Philippine peso bill.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Gloria Macapagal Arroyo displayed on a [[Philippine two hundred peso bill|two hundred peso bill]], being sworn in as president by Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. in January 2001.]]\nDays after leaving [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]], President Estrada's lawyers questioned the legitimacy of Arroyo's presidency before the Supreme Court. He reiterated that he had not resigned as president and that at most, Arroyo was just serving in an acting capacity. The high court, however, voted unanimously to uphold the legitimacy of Arroyo's succession. As a consequence, Estrada no longer enjoys immunity from charges being filed against him.\n\nIn the last week of April 2001, the Sandiganbayan ordered the arrest of Estrada and his son, then mayor [[Jinggoy Estrada]], for plunder charges. A few days later, Estrada supporters protested his arrest, gathered at the EDSA Shrine, and staged what they called, [[EDSA III]] \u2013 comparing their actions to the People Power revolution of 1986 and January 2001.\n\nThousands of protesters demanded the release of Estrada. Eventually, they also called for the ouster of Arroyo and the reinstatement of the former. On May 1, 2001, they marched towards Malaca\u00f1ang to force Arroyo to give in to their demands. Violence erupted when the protesters attempted to storm the presidential palace and the military and police were ordered to use their arms to drive them back. Arroyo declared a state of rebellion because of the violence and prominent political personalities affiliated with Estrada were charged and arrested. The so-called EDSA III was the first serious political challenge to the Arroyo presidency.\n\n====Corruption charges and Oakwood Mutiny====\n{{Main|Oakwood mutiny}}\nThe Oakwood mutiny occurred in the Philippines on July 27, 2003. A group of 321 armed soldiers who called themselves \"''Bagong Katipuneros''\"<ref name=\"laurel\">{{cite news | last =Laurel | first =Herman T | title =Small setback... | work=The Daily Tribune | date = February 22, 2006 | url =http://www.tribune.net.ph/20060222/commentary/20060222com5.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020715/http://www.tribune.net.ph/20060222/commentary/20060222com5.html | archivedate=September 28, 2007 | accessdate = August 10, 2007}}</ref> led by Army Capt. [[Gerardo Gambala]] and Navy Lt. [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] took over the Oakwood Premier Ayala Center (now [[Ascott Makati]]) serviced apartment tower in [[Makati City]] to show the [[Filipino people]] the alleged corruption of the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration, believing that the President was going to declare [[martial law]].\n\n====2004 Presidential Election====\n{{Infobox President styles\n|name=Gloria Macapagal Arroyo\n|image = [[File:Seal of the President of the Philippines.svg|50px]]\n|dipstyle= [[Excellency|Her Excellency]]\n|offstyle= Your Excellency\n|altstyle= Madam President\n}}\nArticle VII Section 4 of the [[1987 Constitution]] explicitly states that the president of the Philippines can only serve for one term. However, the same provision also implicitly states that a president's successor who has not served for more than four years can still seek a full term for the presidency. Although Arroyo fell under this category, she initially announced on December 30, 2002 that she would not seek the presidency in 2004. She emphasized that she would devote her remaining months in office to serving the people and improving the economy of the Philippines.\n\nIn October 2003, Arroyo changed her mind and announced that she would contest the May 2004 presidential elections and seek a direct mandate from the people. She explained, \"There is a higher cause to change society...in a way that nourishes our future\". With her decision, the initial criticisms hurled against Arroyo centered on her lack of word of honor.\n\nAs predicted by SWS exit polls, Arroyo won the election by a margin of over one million votes against Poe. However, the congressional canvassing was quite contentious as opposition lawmakers in the National Board of Canvassers argued that there were many discrepancies in the election returns and that insinuations of cheating were raised. On June 23, 2004, Congress proclaimed Arroyo and [[Noli de Castro]] as president and vice president, respectively.\n\n===Second term (2004\u20132010)===\n\n====2004 Presidential Election rigging allegations====\n[[Image:arroyo inauguration.jpg|thumb|225px|Arroyo taking her Oath of Office for a full term as president before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]] in [[Cebu City]] on June 30, 2004.]]\nOn June 30, 2004, in a break with tradition, Arroyo first delivered her inaugural speech at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] in Manila. She then departed for [[Cebu City]] for her oath taking, the first time that a Philippine president took the oath of office outside of [[Luzon]].\n\nAllegations of cheating against Arroyo gained momentum one year after the May 2004 elections. In a press conference held on June 10, 2005, [[Samuel Ong]], former deputy director of the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) claimed to have audio recordings of wiretapped conversations between Arroyo and an official of the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC). [[Virgilio Garcillano]], a former COMELEC commissioner, would later be identified as the official talking to Arroyo. According to Ong, the recordings allegedly proved that Arroyo ordered the rigging of the national elections for her to win by around one million votes against Poe.\n\nThe recordings of Ong became known as the [[Hello Garci scandal|Hello Garci controversy]] and triggered massive protests against Arroyo. Key members of her cabinet resigned from their respective posts and urged Arroyo to do the same. On June 27, 2005, Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to a COMELEC official, claiming it was a \"lapse in judgement\". She, however, denied influencing the outcome of the elections and declared that she won the elections fairly. Arroyo did not resign despite the pressures coming from various sectors of society.\n\nThe Hello Garci controversy became the basis of the impeachment case filed against Arroyo in 2005.\nAttempts to impeach Arroyo failed later that year. Another impeachment case was filed against Arroyo in 2006 but was also defeated at the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nIn October 2007, lawyer Alan Paguia filed an impeachment complaint against Arroyo in connection with the issue of bribery. Paguia's complaint was based on the revelation of [[Pampanga]] Governor [[Ed Panlilio]] that various governors received half a million pesos from Malaca\u00f1ang. The impeachment case, as of the middle of October 2007, has already been referred to the House of Representatives Committee on Justice.\n\n====State of Emergency====\n\n{{Main|2006 state of emergency in the Philippines}}\n\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 5 June 2009-5.jpg|thumb|President Arroyo with Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], June 9, 2009]]\n\nOn February 24, 2006, a plot to take over the government was uncovered by authorities, allegedly headed by Gen. [[Danilo Lim]] and other rightist military adventurists. General Lim and some of his men were arrested. To face the threat posed by enemies of the state, Arroyo issued Presidential Proclamation 1017 (PP 1017) and used it as basis in declaring a state of emergency throughout the Philippines. According to Arroyo, this declaration was done to quell the military rebellion, stop lawless violence, and promote peace and stability. PP 1017 also empowered the government to enforce warrantless arrests and take over strategic private utilities companies.\n\nOn February 25, 2006, the police raided the office of the ''Daily Tribune'', a newspaper known as a critic of the Arroyo administration. The government then issued a journalism guidelines to address the threat posed by critics in the media. Presidential Management Staff chief [[Michael Defensor]] said that the guidelines were necessary in order to cope with the emergency situation.\n\nThe state of emergency existed for about one week with the purpose of curbing further violence, illegal rallies, and public disturbance throughout the Philippines. The police and the military dispersed demonstrators and protesters, especially those along [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Aside from General Lim, prominent personalities were also arrested in connection with their alleged participation in the attempt to overthrow the government. Among those arrested were:\n\n# Col. Ariel Querubin \u2013 leader of a group of [[Philippine Marines]] who engaged the government in a political stand-off at [[Fort Bonifacio]] on February 25, 2005\n# [[Randy David]] \u2013 led a protest rally without securing the necessary permit\n# [[Crispin Beltran]] \u2013 party-list representative of [[Anakpawis]] charged with inciting to sedition and rebellion\n# Batasan Five \u2013 party-list representatives charged with rebellion and were placed under the custody of the House of Representatives; [[Bayan Muna]]'s [[Teodoro Casi\u00f1o]], [[Satur Ocampo]], and [[Joel Virador]]; [[Gabriela Women's Party|Gabriela]]'s [[Liza Maza]], and Anakpawis' [[Rafael Mariano]]\n\nPP 1017 was lifted on March 3, 2006 but members of the opposition, private lawyers, and concerned citizens challenged its constitutionality before the Supreme Court. On May 4, the high court declared the proclamation constitutional. However, it also said that it was illegal for the government to implement warrantless arrests and seize private institutions and companies.\n\n====Charter Change====\nArroyo currently spearheads a controversial plan for an overhaul of the constitution to transform the present unitary and presidential republic with a [[bicameral legislature]] into a federal parliamentary government with a [[unicameral legislature]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Lira|last=Dalangin-Fernandez|url=http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=12106|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727190950/http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=12106|archivedate=July 27, 2006|title=People's support for Charter change 'nowhere to go but up'|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=July 27, 2006|accessdate=July 27, 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:George W.

On January 16, 2001, the impeachment trial also took a new direction. Private prosecutors walked out of the trial when pro-Estrada senators prevented the opening of an evidence (a brown envelope) containing bank records allegedly owned by President Estrada. With the walkout, the impeachment trial was not completed and Filipinos eventually took to the streets in masses to continue the clamor for President Estrada's resignation.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GMA's Inaugural 2001.jpg|thumb|225px|Arroyo Takes a Oath in [[EDSA Shrine]]]] -->\nFrom January 17 to 20, 2001, [[2001 EDSA Revolution|hundreds of thousands]] of Filipinos gathered at [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA), the site of the original [[People Power Revolution]]. The clamor for a change in the presidency gained momentum as various sectors of Philippine society \u2013 professionals, students, artists, politicians, leftist and rightist groups \u2013 joined what became known as EDSA II. Officials of the administration, the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP) also withdrew their support for President Estrada.\n\n[[Image:Php bill 200 back.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Gloria Macapagal Arroyo displayed on a [[Philippine two hundred peso bill|two hundred peso bill]], being sworn in as president by Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. in January 2001.]]\nDays after leaving [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]], President Estrada's lawyers questioned the legitimacy of Arroyo's presidency before the Supreme Court. He reiterated that he had not resigned as president and that at most, Arroyo was just serving in an acting capacity. The high court, however, voted unanimously to uphold the legitimacy of Arroyo's succession. As a consequence, Estrada no longer enjoys immunity from charges being filed against him.\n\nIn the last week of April 2001, the Sandiganbayan ordered the arrest of Estrada and his son, then mayor [[Jinggoy Estrada]], for plunder charges. A few days later, Estrada supporters protested his arrest, gathered at the EDSA Shrine, and staged what they called, [[EDSA III]] \u2013 comparing their actions to the People Power revolution of 1986 and January 2001.\n\nThousands of protesters demanded the release of Estrada. Eventually, they also called for the ouster of Arroyo and the reinstatement of the former. On May 1, 2001, they marched towards Malaca\u00f1ang to force Arroyo to give in to their demands. Violence erupted when the protesters attempted to storm the presidential palace and the military and police were ordered to use their arms to drive them back. Arroyo declared a state of rebellion because of the violence and prominent political personalities affiliated with Estrada were charged and arrested. The so-called EDSA III was the first serious political challenge to the Arroyo presidency.\n\n====Corruption charges and Oakwood Mutiny====\n{{Main|Oakwood mutiny}}\nThe Oakwood mutiny occurred in the Philippines on July 27, 2003.

[[Gerardo Gambala]] and Navy Lt. [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] took over the Oakwood Premier Ayala Center (now [[Ascott Makati]]) serviced apartment tower in [[Makati City]] to show the [[Filipino people]] the alleged corruption of the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration, believing that the President was going to declare [[martial law]].\n\n====2004 Presidential Election====\n{{Infobox President styles\n|name=Gloria Macapagal Arroyo\n|image = [[File:Seal of the President of the Philippines.svg|50px]]\n|dipstyle= [[Excellency|Her Excellency]]\n|offstyle= Your Excellency\n|altstyle= Madam President\n}}\nArticle VII Section 4 of the [[1987 Constitution]] explicitly states that the president of the Philippines can only serve for one term. However, the same provision also implicitly states that a president's successor who has not served for more than four years can still seek a full term for the presidency. Although Arroyo fell under this category, she initially announced on December 30, 2002 that she would not seek the presidency in 2004. She emphasized that she would devote her remaining months in office to serving the people and improving the economy of the Philippines.\n\nIn October 2003, Arroyo changed her mind and announced that she would contest the May 2004 presidential elections and seek a direct mandate from the people. She explained, \"There is a higher cause to change society...in a way that nourishes our future\". With her decision, the initial criticisms hurled against Arroyo centered on her lack of word of honor.\n\nAs predicted by SWS exit polls, Arroyo won the election by a margin of over one million votes against Poe. However, the congressional canvassing was quite contentious as opposition lawmakers in the National Board of Canvassers argued that there were many discrepancies in the election returns and that insinuations of cheating were raised. On June 23, 2004, Congress proclaimed Arroyo and [[Noli de Castro]] as president and vice president, respectively.\n\n===Second term (2004\u20132010)===\n\n====2004 Presidential Election rigging allegations====\n[[Image:arroyo inauguration.jpg|thumb|225px|Arroyo taking her Oath of Office for a full term as president before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]] in [[Cebu City]] on June 30, 2004.]]\nOn June 30, 2004, in a break with tradition, Arroyo first delivered her inaugural speech at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] in Manila. She then departed for [[Cebu City]] for her oath taking, the first time that a Philippine president took the oath of office outside of [[Luzon]].\n\nAllegations of cheating against Arroyo gained momentum one year after the May 2004 elections. In a press conference held on June 10, 2005, [[Samuel Ong]], former deputy director of the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) claimed to have audio recordings of wiretapped conversations between Arroyo and an official of the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC). [[Virgilio Garcillano]], a former COMELEC commissioner, would later be identified as the official talking to Arroyo. According to Ong, the recordings allegedly proved that Arroyo ordered the rigging of the national elections for her to win by around one million votes against Poe.\n\nThe recordings of Ong became known as the [[Hello Garci scandal|Hello Garci controversy]] and triggered massive protests against Arroyo. Key members of her cabinet resigned from their respective posts and urged Arroyo to do the same. On June 27, 2005, Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to a COMELEC official, claiming it was a \"lapse in judgement\". She, however, denied influencing the outcome of the elections and declared that she won the elections fairly. Arroyo did not resign despite the pressures coming from various sectors of society.\n\nThe Hello Garci controversy became the basis of the impeachment case filed against Arroyo in 2005.\nAttempts to impeach Arroyo failed later that year. Another impeachment case was filed against Arroyo in 2006 but was also defeated at the [[Philippine House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].\n\nIn October 2007, lawyer Alan Paguia filed an impeachment complaint against Arroyo in connection with the issue of bribery. Paguia's complaint was based on the revelation of [[Pampanga]] Governor [[Ed Panlilio]] that various governors received half a million pesos from Malaca\u00f1ang. The impeachment case, as of the middle of October 2007, has already been referred to the House of Representatives Committee on Justice.\n\n====State of Emergency====\n\n{{Main|2006 state of emergency in the Philippines}}\n\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 5 June 2009-5.jpg|thumb|President Arroyo with Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], June 9, 2009]]\n\nOn February 24, 2006, a plot to take over the government was uncovered by authorities, allegedly headed by Gen. [[Danilo Lim]] and other rightist military adventurists. General Lim and some of his men were arrested. To face the threat posed by enemies of the state, Arroyo issued Presidential Proclamation 1017 (PP 1017) and used it as basis in declaring a state of emergency throughout the Philippines. According to Arroyo, this declaration was done to quell the military rebellion, stop lawless violence, and promote peace and stability. PP 1017 also empowered the government to enforce warrantless arrests and take over strategic private utilities companies.\n\nOn February 25, 2006, the police raided the office of the ''Daily Tribune'', a newspaper known as a critic of the Arroyo administration. The government then issued a journalism guidelines to address the threat posed by critics in the media. Presidential Management Staff chief [[Michael Defensor]] said that the guidelines were necessary in order to cope with the emergency situation.\n\nThe state of emergency existed for about one week with the purpose of curbing further violence, illegal rallies, and public disturbance throughout the Philippines. The police and the military dispersed demonstrators and protesters, especially those along [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Aside from General Lim, prominent personalities were also arrested in connection with their alleged participation in the attempt to overthrow the government. Among those arrested were:\n\n# Col. Ariel Querubin \u2013 leader of a group of [[Philippine Marines]] who engaged the government in a political stand-off at [[Fort Bonifacio]] on February 25, 2005\n# [[Randy David]] \u2013 led a protest rally without securing the necessary permit\n# [[Crispin Beltran]] \u2013 party-list representative of [[Anakpawis]] charged with inciting to sedition and rebellion\n# Batasan Five \u2013 party-list representatives charged with rebellion and were placed under the custody of the House of Representatives; [[Bayan Muna]]'s [[Teodoro Casi\u00f1o]], [[Satur Ocampo]], and [[Joel Virador]]; [[Gabriela Women's Party|Gabriela]]'s [[Liza Maza]], and Anakpawis' [[Rafael Mariano]]\n\nPP 1017 was lifted on March 3, 2006 but members of the opposition, private lawyers, and concerned citizens challenged its constitutionality before the Supreme Court. On May 4, the high court declared the proclamation constitutional. However, it also said that it was illegal for the government to implement warrantless arrests and seize private institutions and companies.\n\n====Charter Change====\nArroyo currently spearheads a controversial plan for an overhaul of the constitution to transform the present unitary and presidential republic with a [[bicameral legislature]] into a federal parliamentary government with a [[unicameral legislature]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Lira|last=Dalangin-Fernandez|url=http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=12106|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727190950/http://newsinfo.inq7.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=12106|archivedate=July 27, 2006|title=People's support for Charter change 'nowhere to go but up'|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=July 27, 2006|accessdate=July 27, 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:George W.

His satirical reporting on the [[Scopes Trial]], which he dubbed the \"Monkey Trial,\" also gained him attention.\n\nAs a scholar, Mencken is known for ''[[The American Language]]'', a multi-volume study of how the English language is spoken in the United States. As an admirer of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], he was an outspoken opponent of [[organized religion]], [[theism]], [[populism]], and [[representative democracy]], the latter of which he viewed as systems in which inferior men dominated their superiors.<ref name=\"Democracy\"/> Mencken was a supporter of scientific progress, and was critical of [[osteopathic]] and [[chiropractic]] medicine. He was also an ardent critic of economics.\n\nMencken opposed the American entry into both [[American entry into World War I|World War I]] and [[Military history of the United States during World War II|World War II]].

He was the son of Anna Margaret (Abhau) and [[August Mencken Sr.]], a cigar factory owner. He was of [[German Americans|German ancestry]] and spoke [[German language|German]] in his childhood.<ref>{{citation |last=Sowell |first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Sowell |title=Migrations and Cultures: A World View |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |place=[[New York City|New York]] |year=1996 |page=82 |isbn=978-0465045891 |quote= ... it may be indicative of how long German cultural ties endured [in the United States] that the German language was spoken in childhood by such disparate twentieth-century American figures as famed writer H.

Mencken, baseball stars [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]], and by the Nobel Prize-winning economist [[George Stigler]].}}</ref> When Henry was three, his family moved into a new home at 1524 Hollins Street facing Union Square park in the [[Union Square, Baltimore|Union Square]] neighborhood of old West Baltimore. Apart from five years of married life, Mencken was to live in that house for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |title=Detailed description |publisher=Mencken's home |place=Baltimore |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027092318/http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2005 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his best-selling memoir ''[[Happy Days, 1880\u20131892|Happy Days]]'', he described his childhood in Baltimore as \"placid, secure, uneventful and happy.\"<ref>''Happy Days'', p. vii</ref>\n\nWhen he was nine years old, he read [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'', which he later described as \"the most stupendous event in my life.\"<ref>St. Petersburg Times&nbsp;\u2013 September 23, 1987</ref> He became determined to become a writer and read voraciously. In one winter while in high school he read [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and then \"proceeded backward to [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Richard Steele|Steele]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]] and the other magnificos of the Eighteenth century.\" He read the entire canon of [[Shakespeare]] and became an ardent fan of [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Thomas Huxley]].{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | pp = 90\u201393}} As a boy, Mencken also had practical interests, photography and chemistry in particular, and eventually had a home chemistry laboratory in which he performed experiments of his own devising, some of them inadvertently dangerous.<ref>''Newspaper Days, 1899\u20131906'', p. 58.</ref>\n\nHe began his primary education in the mid-1880s at Professor Knapp's School on the east side of Holliday Street between East Lexington and Fayette Streets, next to the [[Holliday Street Theatre]] and across from the newly constructed [[Baltimore City Hall]]. The site today is the [[War Memorial Plaza|War Memorial and City Hall Plaza]] laid out in 1926 in memory of World War I dead. At 15, in June 1896, he graduated as valedictorian from the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]], at the time a males-only mathematics, technical and science-oriented public high school.\n\nHe worked for three years in his father's cigar factory. He disliked the work, especially the sales aspect of it, and resolved to leave, with or without his father's blessing. In early 1898 he took a writing class at the Cosmopolitan University.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | p = 93}} This was to be the entirety of Mencken's formal education in journalism, or in any other subject. Upon his father's death a few days after Christmas in the same year, the business passed to his uncle, and Mencken was free to pursue his career in journalism. He applied in February 1899 to the ''Morning Herald'' newspaper (which became the ''[[Baltimore Morning Herald]]'' in 1900) and was hired part-time, but still kept his position at the factory for a few months. In June he was hired as a full-time reporter.\n\n==Career==\nMencken served as a reporter at the ''Herald'' for six years. Less than two-and-a-half years after the [[Great Baltimore Fire]], the paper was purchased in June 1906 by [[Charles H. Grasty]], the owner and editor of ''[[Baltimore News-American|The News]]'' since 1892, and competing owner and publisher Gen. [[Felix Agnus]], of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily, ''[[Baltimore News-American|The Baltimore American]].'' They proceeded to divide the staff, assets and resources of ''The Herald'' between them. Mencken then moved to ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', where he worked for Charles H. Grasty. He continued to contribute to ''The Sun,'' ''The Evening Sun'' (founded 1910) and ''The Sunday Sun'' full-time until 1948, when he stopped writing after suffering a [[stroke]].\n\nMencken began writing the editorials and opinion pieces that made his name at ''The Sun.'' On the side, he wrote short stories, a novel, and even poetry, which he later revealed. In 1908, he became a literary critic for ''[[The Smart Set]]'' magazine, and in 1924 he and [[George Jean Nathan]] founded and edited ''[[The American Mercury]]'', published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America. In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Sara Haardt.jpg|thumb|right|Sara (Haardt) Mencken]]\nIn 1930, Mencken married [[Sara Haardt]], a [[German-American]] professor of English at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led an unsuccessful effort in [[Alabama]] to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |type=short biographical sketch |publisher=AL |title=Sara Haardt}}</ref><ref>Alabama rejected the Nineteenth Amendment on September 22, 1919, though it later ratified it as a symbolic gesture on September 8, 1953.</ref> The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage \"the end of hope\" and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, had gone to the altar. \"The [[Holy Spirit]] informed and inspired me,\" Mencken said. \"Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this one seemed to be a superb one.\"<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/txt/about/about_hlm.htm |title=Mencken |type=bio |publisher=Mencken house}}</ref> Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the [[American South]]. Haardt was in poor health from [[tuberculosis]] throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of [[meningitis]], leaving Mencken grief-stricken.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |title=The Real South: Famous People |publisher=AL |contribution=Literary Figures: Sally Haardt}}</ref> He had always championed her writing and, after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title ''Southern Album''.\n\n===Great Depression, war and after===\n[[File:H L Mencken Carl Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Mencken photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1932]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Mencken did not support the [[New Deal]]. This cost him popularity, as did his strong reservations regarding U.S. participation in [[World War II]], and his overt contempt for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He ceased writing for ''The Baltimore Sun'' for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor, while serving as an adviser for the paper that had been his home for nearly his entire career. In 1948, he briefly returned to the political scene, covering the presidential election in which President [[Harry S. Truman]] faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Thomas Dewey]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]]. His later work consisted of humorous, anecdotal, and nostalgic essays, first published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', then collected in the books ''Happy Days'', ''Newspaper Days'', and ''Heathen Days''.\n\n===Last days===\nOn November 23, 1948, Mencken suffered a [[stroke]], which left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable to read or write and able to speak only with difficulty. After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to [[classical music]] and, after some recovery of his ability to speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself in the past tense, as if he were already dead. During the last year of his life, his friend and biographer [[William Manchester]] read to him daily.<ref>{{Citation |last=Filkins |first=Dexter | author-link = Dexter Filkins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/14/arts/14MANC.html |title=Ailing Churchill Biographer Says He Can't Finish Trilogy |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}}.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMencken died in his sleep on January 29, 1956.<ref>{{cite news |title=HL Mencken, 75, Dies in Baltimore |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F14FF3C58157B93C2AA178AD85F428585F9 |quote=HL Mencken was found dead in bed early today. The 75-year-old author, editor, critic and newspaper man had lived in retirement since suffering a cerebral hemorrhage in 1948 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 1956 |accessdate=June 15, 2008}}</ref> He was interred in Baltimore's [[Loudon Park Cemetery]].<ref>[https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-loudon-park-cemetery-20180607-story.html ''Baltimore Sun'']</ref>\n\nThough it does not appear on his tombstone, during his ''Smart Set'' days Mencken wrote a joking epitaph for himself:\n\n{{quote|If, after I depart this vale, you ever remember me and have thought to please my ghost, forgive some sinner and wink your eye at some homely girl.<ref>\"Epitaph,\" ''Smart Set'', December 3, 1921, p. 33.\"</ref>}}\n\nA very small, short, and private service was held, in accordance with Mencken's wishes.<ref>\"Mencken: The American Iconoclast\" By Marion Elizabeth Rodgers. Page 549</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nMencken was preoccupied with his legacy, and kept his papers, letters, newspaper clippings and columns, even grade school report cards. After his death, these materials were made available to scholars in stages in 1971, 1981, and 1991, and include hundreds of thousands of letters sent and received; the only omissions were strictly personal letters received from women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Beliefs==\nIn his capacity as editor, Mencken became close friends with the leading literary figures of his time, including [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[F.&nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Joseph Hergesheimer]], [[Anita Loos]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[James Branch Cabell]], and [[Alfred A. Knopf Sr.|Alfred Knopf]], as well as a mentor to several young reporters, including [[Alistair Cooke]]. He also championed artists whose works he considered worthy. For example, he asserted that books such as ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street'' (1929), by [[Eddie Cantor]] (ghost-written by [[David Freedman]]) did more to pull America out of the [[Great Depression]] than all government measures combined. He also mentored [[John Fante]]. [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] illustrated an edition of Mencken's book ''Europe After 8:15''.\n\nMencken also published many works under various pseudonyms, including [[Owen Hatteras]], John H Brownell, William Drayham, WLD Bell, and [[Charles Angoff]].<ref>{{Citation |first=SL |last=Harrison |title=AKA HL Mencken: Selected Pseudonymous Writings |publisher=Wolf Den Books |year=2005}}</ref> As a ghostwriter for the physician [[Leonard K. Hirshberg]], he wrote a series of articles and (in 1910) most of a book about the care of babies.\n\nMencken admired German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (he was the first writer to provide a scholarly analysis in English of Nietzsche's views and writings) and [[Joseph Conrad]]. His humor and satire owe much to [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Mark Twain]]. He did much to defend Dreiser despite freely admitting his faults, including stating forthrightly that Dreiser often wrote badly and was a gullible man. Mencken also expressed his appreciation for [[William Graham Sumner]] in a 1941 collection of Sumner's essays, and regretted never having known Sumner personally. In contrast, Mencken was scathing in his criticism of the German philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]], whom he described as \"an extremely dull author\" and whose famous book ''Philosophy of 'As If''' he dismissed as an unimportant \"foot-note to all existing systems.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355}}</ref>\n\nMencken recommended for publication philosopher and author [[Ayn Rand]]'s first novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', calling it \"a really excellent piece of work.\" Shortly afterward, Rand addressed him in correspondence as \"the greatest representative of a philosophy\" to which she wanted to dedicate her life, \"individualism,\" and later listed him as her favorite columnist.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Berliner | editor-first = Michael |title=Letters |first=Ayn |last=Rand |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |pages=10 (Mencken's opinion of the novel), 13\u201314 (Rand's praise of Mencken)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Inherit333-1.JPG|thumb|Mencken is fictionalized in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (a fictionalized version of the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]] of 1925) as the cynical sarcastic atheist E.&nbsp;K.

He particularly relished Mark Twain's depiction of a succession of gullible and ignorant townspeople\u2014\"boobs,\" as Mencken referred to them\u2014who are repeatedly gulled by a pair of colorful [[con men]]: the (deliberately) pathetic [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn#The Duke and the Dauphin|\"Duke\" and \"Dauphin]],\" with whom [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck]] and [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]] travel down the [[Mississippi River]].

Mencken was a keen cheerleader of scientific progress but skeptical of economic theories and critical of [[osteopathic]]/[[chiropractic]] medicine. He also debunked the idea of objective news reporting since \"truth is a commodity that the masses of undifferentiated men cannot be induced to buy,\" adding a humorous description of how \"Homo Boobus,\" like \"higher mammalia,\" is moved by \"whatever gratifies his prevailing yearnings.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=A gang of pecksniffs: And other comments on newspaper publishers, editors and reporters|last=Mencken|first=H.

The play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' is a fictionalized version of the trial, and, as noted above, the cynical reporter E.K. Hornbeck is based on Mencken. In 1926, he deliberately had himself arrested for selling an issue of ''The American Mercury'' that was [[banned in Boston]] under the [[Comstock laws]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=104 |publisher=Mass Moments |title=HL Mencken Arrested in Boston}}</ref> Mencken heaped scorn not only on the public officials he disliked, but also on the contemporary state of American elective politics itself.\n\nIn the summer of 1926, Mencken followed with great interest the [[Los Angeles]] grand jury inquiry into the famous Canadian-American evangelist [[Aimee Semple McPherson]]. She was accused of faking her reported [[kidnapping]] and the case attracted national attention. There was every expectation Mencken would continue his previous pattern of anti-fundamentalist articles, this time with a searing critique of McPherson. Unexpectedly, he came to her defense, identifying various local religious and civic groups which were using the case as an opportunity to pursue their respective ideological agendas against the embattled [[Pentecostal]] minister.<ref>{{Citation |first=Matthew Avery |last=Sutton |title=Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2007 |pages=119\u201320}}</ref> He spent several weeks in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], and wrote many scathing and satirical columns on the movie industry and the southern California culture. After all charges had been dropped against McPherson, Mencken revisited the case in 1930 with a sarcastically biting and observant article. He wrote that since many of that town's residents acquired their ideas \"of the true, the good and the beautiful\" from the movies and newspapers, \"Los Angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |title=The American Mercury |year=1930}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931 the [[Arkansas]] legislature passed a motion to pray for Mencken's soul after he had called the state the \"apex of moronia.\"<ref>''Manchester'', p. 252</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1930s Mencken feared [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal liberalism]] as a powerful force. Mencken, says Charles A. Fecher, was, \"deeply conservative, resentful of change, looking back upon the 'happy days' of a bygone time, wanted no part of the world that the New Deal promised to bring in.\"<ref>{{cite book| editor-first =Charles A | editor-last = Fecher |title=Diary |first=HL |last=Mencken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMsufJS6uu0C&pg=PT28 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday]] |location=New York City|page=28| isbn = 9780307808868 }}</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===Race and elitism===\nIn addition to his identification of races with castes, Mencken had views about the superior individual within communities. He believed that every community produced a few people of clear superiority. He considered groupings on a par with hierarchies, which led to a kind of natural [[elitism]] and natural [[aristocracy]]. \"Superior\" individuals, in Mencken's view, were those wrongly oppressed and disdained by their own communities, but nevertheless distinguished by their will and personal achievement, not by race or birth.\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?10797-1/diary-hl-mencken ''Booknotes'' interview with Charles Fecher on ''The Diary of H.L. Mencken'', January 28, 1990], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nIn 1989, per his instructions, Alfred A. Knopf published Mencken's \"secret diary\" as ''The Diary of H.&nbsp;L. Mencken''. According to an Associated Press story, Mencken's views shocked even the \"sympathetic scholar who edited it,\" [[Charles A. Fecher]] of Baltimore.<ref name=\"latimes1989\"/> There is a club in Baltimore called the [[Maryland Club]] which had one [[Jewish]] member, and that member died. Mencken said, \"There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable,\" according to the article. The diary also quoted him as saying of blacks, in September 1943, that \"it is impossible to talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything.\"\n\nMencken opposed [[lynching]]. For example, he had this to say about a Maryland incident:\n\n{{quote|Not a single bigwig came forward in the emergency, though the whole town knew what was afoot. Any one of a score of such bigwigs might have halted the crime, if only by threatening to denounce its perpetrators, but none spoke. So Williams was duly hanged, burned and mutilated.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}}}\n\nMencken also wrote:\n\n{{quote|I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American Negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the Negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated Negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a Negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert Rives|last1=La Monte|authorlink1=Robert Rives La Monte|first2=HL|last2=Mencken|title=Men versus the Man: A Correspondence between Robert Rives La Monte, Socialist, and H.

Mencken'' (written by [[Terry Teachout]]), journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] described Mencken as a [[German nationalism|German nationalist]], \"an antihumanist as much as an atheist,\" who was \"prone to the hyperbole and sensationalism he distrusted in others.\" Hitchens also criticized Mencken for writing a scathing critique of [[Franklin Roosevelt]] but nothing equally negative of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/books/a-smart-set-of-one.html |title=A Smart Set of One |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |authorlink= Christopher Hitchens |date=November 17, 2002 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=July 12, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n====Anglo-Saxons====\nMencken countered the arguments for Anglo-Saxon superiority prevalent in his time in a 1923 essay entitled \"The Anglo-Saxon,\" which argued that if there was such a thing as a pure \"Anglo-Saxon\" race, it was defined by its inferiority and cowardice. \"The normal American of the 'pure-blooded' majority goes to rest every night with an uneasy feeling that there is a burglar under the bed and he gets up every morning with a sickening fear that his underwear has been stolen.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=HL|last=Mencken|title=The Anglo-Saxon|newspaper=[[Baltimore Evening Sun]]|date=July 1923}}</ref>\n\n====Jews====\nIn the 1930 edition of ''[[Treatise on the Gods]]'', Mencken wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Jews could be put down very plausibly as the most unpleasant race ever heard of. As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom. Their fortitude, such as it is, is wasted upon puerile objects, and their charity is mainly a form of display.<ref>{{cite book|first=HL|last=Mencken|title=Treatise on the Gods|publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday]]|location=New York City|date=1930|pages=345\u201346}}</ref>}}\n\nThat passage was removed from subsequent editions at his express direction.<ref>Hobson, Fred C. ''Mencken: A Life''. (1995), p. 477</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Gore Vidal]] later deflected claims of anti-Semitism against Mencken:\n\n{{quote|Far from being an anti-Semite, Mencken was one of the first journalists to denounce the persecution of the Jews in Germany at a time when ''[[The New York Times]]'', say, was notoriously reticent. On November 27, 1938, Mencken writes (''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''), \"It is to be hoped that the poor Jews now being robbed and mauled in Germany will not take too seriously the plans of various politicians to rescue them.\" He then reviews the various schemes to \"rescue\" the Jews from the Nazis, who had not yet announced their own [[Holocaust|final solution]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Gore|last1=Vidal|authorlink=Gore Vidal|first2=Marion Elizabeth|last2=Rodgers|title=The Impossible H.L.

Why shouldn't the United States take in a couple hundred thousand of them, or even all of them?<ref>Gore Vidal, \"Foreword,\" In H.L. Mencken, ''The Impossible H.L. Mencken'' (New York, NY: Doubleday, 1991) p. xxxi.</ref>}}\n\n===Democracy===\n{{quote|Democracy gives [the beatification of mediocrity] a certain appearance of objective and demonstrable truth. The mob man, functioning as citizen, gets a feeling that he is really important to the world\u2014that he is genuinely running things. Out of his maudlin herding after rogues and [[Charlatan|mountebanks]] there comes to him a sense of vast and mysterious power\u2014which is what makes archbishops, police sergeants, the grand [[goblin]]s of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other such magnificoes happy. And out of it there comes, too, a conviction that he is somehow wise, that his views are taken seriously by his betters\u2014which is what makes United States Senators, fortune tellers and Young Intellectuals happy. Finally, there comes out of it a glowing consciousness of a high duty triumphantly done which is what makes hangmen and husbands happy.}}\n\nThis sentiment is fairly consistent with Mencken's distaste for common notions and the philosophical outlook he unabashedly set down throughout his life as a writer (drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche and [[Herbert Spencer]], among others).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigeye.com/mencken.htm |title=Last Words by H. L. Mencken |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMencken wrote as follows about the difficulties of good men reaching national office when such campaigns must necessarily be conducted remotely:<blockquote>The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre\u2014the man who can most easily adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.\n\nThe Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Bayard vs. Lionheart|work=Baltimore Evening Sun|last=Mencken|first=H. L.|date=July 26, 1920|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Science and mathematics===\nMencken defended the evolutionary views of [[Charles Darwin]] but spoke unfavorably of many prominent physicists and had little regard for pure mathematics. Regarding Charles Angoff, Mencken said:\n\n{{quote|[Isaac Newton] was a mathematician, which is mostly hogwash, too. Imagine measuring infinity! That's a laugh.<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\">Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 141</ref>}}\n\nIn response, Angoff said: \"Well, without mathematics there wouldn't be any engineering, no chemistry, no physics.\" Mencken responded: \"That's true, but it's reasonable mathematics. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, division, that's what real mathematics is. The rest is baloney. Astrology. Religion. All of our sciences still suffer from their former attachment to religion, and that is why there is so much metaphysics and astrology, the two are the same, in science.\"<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\"/>\n\nElsewhere, he spoke of the nonsense of higher mathematics and \"probability\" theory, after he read Angoff's article for [[Charles S. Peirce]] in the ''American Mercury''. \"So you believe in that garbage, too\u2014theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability. I can make no sense of it, and I don't believe you can either, and I don't think your god Peirce knew what he was talking about.\"<ref>Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 194</ref>\n\nMencken also repeated these opinions multiple times in articles for the ''American Mercury''. He said mathematics is simply a fiction, compared with individual facts that make up science. In a review for Vaihinger's ''The Philosophy of \"As If'',\" he said:\n\n{{quote|The human mind, at its present stage of development, cannot function without the aid of fictions, but neither can it function without the aid of facts\u2014save, perhaps, when it is housed in the skull of a university professor of philosophy. Of the two, the facts are enormously the more important. In certain metaphysical fields, e.g. those of mathematics, law, theology, osteopathy and ethics\u2014the fiction will probably hold out for many years, but elsewhere the fact slowly ousts it, and that ousting is what is called intellectual progress. Very few fictions remain in use in anatomy, or in plumbing and gas-fitting; they have even begun to disappear from economics.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1924oct-00253}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken repeatedly identified mathematics with metaphysics and theology. According to Mencken, mathematics is necessarily infected with metaphysics because of the tendency of many mathematical people to engage in metaphysical speculation. In a review for A. N. Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education'', Mencken remarked that despite his agreement with Whitehead's thesis and approval of his writing style, \"now and then he falls into mathematical jargon and pollutes his discourse with equations,\" and \"[t]here are moments when he seems to be following some of his mathematical colleagues into the gaudy metaphysics which now entertains them.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=June 1929 |title=What Is It All About? |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVII |number=66 |pages=251\u201352 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929jun-00251}}</ref> For Mencken, theology is characterized by the fact that it uses correct reasoning from false premises. Mencken also uses the term \"theology\" more generally, to refer to the use of logic in science or any other field of knowledge. In a review for both A. S. Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and Joseph Needham's ''Man a Machine'', Mencken forcefully ridiculed the use of reasoning to establish any fact in science, because theologians happen to be masters of \"logic\" and yet are mental defectives:\n\n{{quote|Is there anything in the general thinking of theologians which makes their opinion on the point of any interest or value? What have they ever done in other fields to match the fact-finding of the biologists? I can find nothing in the record. Their processes of thought, taking one day with another, are so defective as to be preposterous. True enough, they are masters of logic, but they always start out from palpably false premises.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=April 1929 |title=The Riddle of the Universe |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVI |number=64 |pages=509\u201310 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929apr-00509}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken also wrote a review for Sir James Jeans's book, ''The Mysterious Universe'', in which he said that mathematics is not necessary for physics. Instead of mathematical \"speculation\" (such as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]), Mencken believed physicists should just directly look at individual facts in the laboratory like chemists:\n\n{{quote|If chemists were similarly given to fanciful and mystical guessing, they would have hatched a quantum theory forty years ago to account for the variations that they observed in atomic weights. But they kept on plugging away in their laboratories without calling in either mathematicians or theologians to aid them, and eventually they discovered the isotopes, and what had been chaos was reduced to the most exact sort of order.<ref name=\"Mencken 252\u201354\">{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=February 1931 |title=The Eternal Conundrum |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XXII |number=86 |pages=252\u201354 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1931feb-00252}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the same article which he later re-printed in the ''Mencken Chrestomathy'', Mencken primarily contrasts what real scientists do, which is to simply directly look at the existence of \"shapes and forces\" confronting them instead of (such as in statistics) attempting to speculate and use mathematical models. Physicists and especially astronomers are consequently not real scientists, because when looking at shapes or forces, they do not simply \"patiently wait for further light,\" but resort to mathematical theory. There is no need for statistics in scientific physics, since one should simply look at the facts while statistics attempts to construct mathematical models. On the other hand, the really competent physicists do not bother with the \"theology\" or reasoning of mathematical theories (such as in quantum mechanics):\n\n{{quote|[Physicists] have, in late years, made a great deal of progress, though it has been accompanied by a considerable quackery. Some of the notions which they now try to foist upon the world, especially in the astronomical realm and about the atom, are obviously nonsensical, and will soon go the way of all unsupported speculations. But there is nothing intrinsically insoluble about the problems they mainly struggle with, and soon or late really competent physicists will arise to solve them. These really competent physicists, I predict, will be too busy in their laboratories to give any time to either metaphysics or theology. Both are eternal enemies of every variety of sound thinking, and no man can traffic with them without losing something of his good judgment.<ref name=\"Mencken 252\u201354\"/>}}\n\nMencken ridiculed [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], believing that \"in the long run his curved space may be classed with the psychosomatic bumps of Gall and Spurzheim.\"<ref>Mencken, Henry Louis. ''Minority Report, H. L. Mencken's Notebooks''. Alfred A. Knopf (New York, 1956), pp. 273\u201374</ref> In his private letters, he said:\n\n{{quote|It is a well known fact that physicists are greatly given to the supernatural. Why this should be I don't know, but the fact is plain. One of the most absurd of all spiritualists is Sir [[Oliver Lodge]]. I have the suspicion that the cause may be that physics itself, as currently practised, is largely moonshine. Certainly there is a great deal of highly dubious stuff in the work of such men as [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]].<ref>Mencken, Henry Louis. ''Letters of H. L. Mencken''. Alfred A.

The City of Baltimore acquired the property in 1983, and the [[H. L. Mencken House]] became part of the City Life Museums. It has been closed to general admission since 1997, but is opened for special events and group visits by arrangement.\n\n===Papers===\nShortly after [[World War&nbsp;II]], Mencken expressed his intention of bequeathing his books and papers to Baltimore's [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]. At his death, it was in possession of most of the present large collection. As a result, his papers as well as much of his personal library, which includes many books inscribed by major authors, are held in the Library's Central Branch on Cathedral Street in Baltimore. The original third floor ''H.&nbsp;L. Mencken Room and Collection'' housing this collection was dedicated on April 17, 1956. The new Mencken Room, on the first floor of the Library's Annex, was opened in November 2003.\n\nThe collection contains Mencken's typescripts, newspaper and magazine contributions, published books, family documents and memorabilia, clipping books, large collection of presentation volumes, file of correspondence with prominent Marylanders, and the extensive material he collected while he was preparing ''[[The American Language]]''.\n\nOther Mencken related collections of note are at [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], and [[Yale University]].

His satirical reporting on the [[Scopes Trial]], which he dubbed the \"Monkey Trial,\" also gained him attention.\n\nAs a scholar, Mencken is known for ''[[The American Language]]'', a multi-volume study of how the English language is spoken in the United States. As an admirer of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], he was an outspoken opponent of [[organized religion]], [[theism]], [[populism]], and [[representative democracy]], the latter of which he viewed as systems in which inferior men dominated their superiors.<ref name=\"Democracy\"/> Mencken was a supporter of scientific progress, and was critical of [[osteopathic]] and [[chiropractic]] medicine. He was also an ardent critic of economics.\n\nMencken opposed the American entry into both [[American entry into World War I|World War I]] and [[Military history of the United States during World War II|World War II]].

He was the son of Anna Margaret (Abhau) and [[August Mencken Sr.]], a cigar factory owner. He was of [[German Americans|German ancestry]] and spoke [[German language|German]] in his childhood.<ref>{{citation |last=Sowell |first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Sowell |title=Migrations and Cultures: A World View |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |place=[[New York City|New York]] |year=1996 |page=82 |isbn=978-0465045891 |quote= ... it may be indicative of how long German cultural ties endured [in the United States] that the German language was spoken in childhood by such disparate twentieth-century American figures as famed writer H.

Apart from five years of married life, Mencken was to live in that house for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |title=Detailed description |publisher=Mencken's home |place=Baltimore |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027092318/http://www.menckenhouse.org/about/about_house.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2005 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn his best-selling memoir ''[[Happy Days, 1880\u20131892|Happy Days]]'', he described his childhood in Baltimore as \"placid, secure, uneventful and happy.\"<ref>''Happy Days'', p. vii</ref>\n\nWhen he was nine years old, he read [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'', which he later described as \"the most stupendous event in my life.\"<ref>St. Petersburg Times&nbsp;\u2013 September 23, 1987</ref> He became determined to become a writer and read voraciously. In one winter while in high school he read [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and then \"proceeded backward to [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Richard Steele|Steele]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]] and the other magnificos of the Eighteenth century.\" He read the entire canon of [[Shakespeare]] and became an ardent fan of [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Thomas Huxley]].{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | pp = 90\u201393}} As a boy, Mencken also had practical interests, photography and chemistry in particular, and eventually had a home chemistry laboratory in which he performed experiments of his own devising, some of them inadvertently dangerous.<ref>''Newspaper Days, 1899\u20131906'', p. 58.</ref>\n\nHe began his primary education in the mid-1880s at Professor Knapp's School on the east side of Holliday Street between East Lexington and Fayette Streets, next to the [[Holliday Street Theatre]] and across from the newly constructed [[Baltimore City Hall]]. The site today is the [[War Memorial Plaza|War Memorial and City Hall Plaza]] laid out in 1926 in memory of World War I dead. At 15, in June 1896, he graduated as valedictorian from the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]], at the time a males-only mathematics, technical and science-oriented public high school.\n\nHe worked for three years in his father's cigar factory. He disliked the work, especially the sales aspect of it, and resolved to leave, with or without his father's blessing. In early 1898 he took a writing class at the Cosmopolitan University.{{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | p = 93}} This was to be the entirety of Mencken's formal education in journalism, or in any other subject. Upon his father's death a few days after Christmas in the same year, the business passed to his uncle, and Mencken was free to pursue his career in journalism. He applied in February 1899 to the ''Morning Herald'' newspaper (which became the ''[[Baltimore Morning Herald]]'' in 1900) and was hired part-time, but still kept his position at the factory for a few months. In June he was hired as a full-time reporter.\n\n==Career==\nMencken served as a reporter at the ''Herald'' for six years. Less than two-and-a-half years after the [[Great Baltimore Fire]], the paper was purchased in June 1906 by [[Charles H. Grasty]], the owner and editor of ''[[Baltimore News-American|The News]]'' since 1892, and competing owner and publisher Gen. [[Felix Agnus]], of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily, ''[[Baltimore News-American|The Baltimore American]].'' They proceeded to divide the staff, assets and resources of ''The Herald'' between them. Mencken then moved to ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', where he worked for Charles H. Grasty. He continued to contribute to ''The Sun,'' ''The Evening Sun'' (founded 1910) and ''The Sunday Sun'' full-time until 1948, when he stopped writing after suffering a [[stroke]].\n\nMencken began writing the editorials and opinion pieces that made his name at ''The Sun.'' On the side, he wrote short stories, a novel, and even poetry, which he later revealed. In 1908, he became a literary critic for ''[[The Smart Set]]'' magazine, and in 1924 he and [[George Jean Nathan]] founded and edited ''[[The American Mercury]]'', published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America. In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:Sara Haardt.jpg|thumb|right|Sara (Haardt) Mencken]]\nIn 1930, Mencken married [[Sara Haardt]], a [[German-American]] professor of English at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led an unsuccessful effort in [[Alabama]] to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |type=short biographical sketch |publisher=AL |title=Sara Haardt}}</ref><ref>Alabama rejected the Nineteenth Amendment on September 22, 1919, though it later ratified it as a symbolic gesture on September 8, 1953.</ref> The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage \"the end of hope\" and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, had gone to the altar. \"The [[Holy Spirit]] informed and inspired me,\" Mencken said. \"Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this one seemed to be a superb one.\"<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.menckenhouse.org/txt/about/about_hlm.htm |title=Mencken |type=bio |publisher=Mencken house}}</ref> Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the [[American South]]. Haardt was in poor health from [[tuberculosis]] throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of [[meningitis]], leaving Mencken grief-stricken.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.al.com/south/literary3.html |title=The Real South: Famous People |publisher=AL |contribution=Literary Figures: Sally Haardt}}</ref> He had always championed her writing and, after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title ''Southern Album''.\n\n===Great Depression, war and after===\n[[File:H L Mencken Carl Van Vechten.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Mencken photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1932]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], Mencken did not support the [[New Deal]]. This cost him popularity, as did his strong reservations regarding U.S. participation in [[World War II]], and his overt contempt for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He ceased writing for ''The Baltimore Sun'' for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor, while serving as an adviser for the paper that had been his home for nearly his entire career. In 1948, he briefly returned to the political scene, covering the presidential election in which President [[Harry S. Truman]] faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Thomas Dewey]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]]. His later work consisted of humorous, anecdotal, and nostalgic essays, first published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', then collected in the books ''Happy Days'', ''Newspaper Days'', and ''Heathen Days''.\n\n===Last days===\nOn November 23, 1948, Mencken suffered a [[stroke]], which left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable to read or write and able to speak only with difficulty. After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to [[classical music]] and, after some recovery of his ability to speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself in the past tense, as if he were already dead. During the last year of his life, his friend and biographer [[William Manchester]] read to him daily.<ref>{{Citation |last=Filkins |first=Dexter | author-link = Dexter Filkins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/14/arts/14MANC.html |title=Ailing Churchill Biographer Says He Can't Finish Trilogy |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}}.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMencken died in his sleep on January 29, 1956.<ref>{{cite news |title=HL Mencken, 75, Dies in Baltimore |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F14FF3C58157B93C2AA178AD85F428585F9 |quote=HL Mencken was found dead in bed early today.

Page 549</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nMencken was preoccupied with his legacy, and kept his papers, letters, newspaper clippings and columns, even grade school report cards. After his death, these materials were made available to scholars in stages in 1971, 1981, and 1991, and include hundreds of thousands of letters sent and received; the only omissions were strictly personal letters received from women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Beliefs==\nIn his capacity as editor, Mencken became close friends with the leading literary figures of his time, including [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[F.&nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Joseph Hergesheimer]], [[Anita Loos]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[James Branch Cabell]], and [[Alfred A. Knopf Sr.|Alfred Knopf]], as well as a mentor to several young reporters, including [[Alistair Cooke]]. He also championed artists whose works he considered worthy. For example, he asserted that books such as ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street'' (1929), by [[Eddie Cantor]] (ghost-written by [[David Freedman]]) did more to pull America out of the [[Great Depression]] than all government measures combined. He also mentored [[John Fante]]. [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] illustrated an edition of Mencken's book ''Europe After 8:15''.\n\nMencken also published many works under various pseudonyms, including [[Owen Hatteras]], John H Brownell, William Drayham, WLD Bell, and [[Charles Angoff]].<ref>{{Citation |first=SL |last=Harrison |title=AKA HL Mencken: Selected Pseudonymous Writings |publisher=Wolf Den Books |year=2005}}</ref> As a ghostwriter for the physician [[Leonard K. Hirshberg]], he wrote a series of articles and (in 1910) most of a book about the care of babies.\n\nMencken admired German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (he was the first writer to provide a scholarly analysis in English of Nietzsche's views and writings) and [[Joseph Conrad]]. His humor and satire owe much to [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Mark Twain]]. He did much to defend Dreiser despite freely admitting his faults, including stating forthrightly that Dreiser often wrote badly and was a gullible man. Mencken also expressed his appreciation for [[William Graham Sumner]] in a 1941 collection of Sumner's essays, and regretted never having known Sumner personally. In contrast, Mencken was scathing in his criticism of the German philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]], whom he described as \"an extremely dull author\" and whose famous book ''Philosophy of 'As If''' he dismissed as an unimportant \"foot-note to all existing systems.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355}}</ref>\n\nMencken recommended for publication philosopher and author [[Ayn Rand]]'s first novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', calling it \"a really excellent piece of work.\" Shortly afterward, Rand addressed him in correspondence as \"the greatest representative of a philosophy\" to which she wanted to dedicate her life, \"individualism,\" and later listed him as her favorite columnist.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Berliner | editor-first = Michael |title=Letters |first=Ayn |last=Rand |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |pages=10 (Mencken's opinion of the novel), 13\u201314 (Rand's praise of Mencken)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Inherit333-1.JPG|thumb|Mencken is fictionalized in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (a fictionalized version of the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]] of 1925) as the cynical sarcastic atheist E.&nbsp;K.

He particularly relished Mark Twain's depiction of a succession of gullible and ignorant townspeople\u2014\"boobs,\" as Mencken referred to them\u2014who are repeatedly gulled by a pair of colorful [[con men]]: the (deliberately) pathetic [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn#The Duke and the Dauphin|\"Duke\" and \"Dauphin]],\" with whom [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck]] and [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]] travel down the [[Mississippi River]]. These hucksters pose now as earnest fundraisers for [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]]\u2014who get drunk on the proceeds; as pious \"saved\" men collecting money for a far off evangelistic mission\u2014to pirates on the high seas; and as learned doctors of [[phrenology]], although they can barely spell. In the end the townsfolk wise up, and the scoundrels are ridden out on a rail.

He also debunked the idea of objective news reporting since \"truth is a commodity that the masses of undifferentiated men cannot be induced to buy,\" adding a humorous description of how \"Homo Boobus,\" like \"higher mammalia,\" is moved by \"whatever gratifies his prevailing yearnings.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=A gang of pecksniffs: And other comments on newspaper publishers, editors and reporters|last=Mencken|first=H.

The play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' is a fictionalized version of the trial, and, as noted above, the cynical reporter E.K. Hornbeck is based on Mencken. In 1926, he deliberately had himself arrested for selling an issue of ''The American Mercury'' that was [[banned in Boston]] under the [[Comstock laws]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=104 |publisher=Mass Moments |title=HL Mencken Arrested in Boston}}</ref> Mencken heaped scorn not only on the public officials he disliked, but also on the contemporary state of American elective politics itself.\n\nIn the summer of 1926, Mencken followed with great interest the [[Los Angeles]] grand jury inquiry into the famous Canadian-American evangelist [[Aimee Semple McPherson]]. She was accused of faking her reported [[kidnapping]] and the case attracted national attention. There was every expectation Mencken would continue his previous pattern of anti-fundamentalist articles, this time with a searing critique of McPherson. Unexpectedly, he came to her defense, identifying various local religious and civic groups which were using the case as an opportunity to pursue their respective ideological agendas against the embattled [[Pentecostal]] minister.<ref>{{Citation |first=Matthew Avery |last=Sutton |title=Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2007 |pages=119\u201320}}</ref> He spent several weeks in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], and wrote many scathing and satirical columns on the movie industry and the southern California culture. After all charges had been dropped against McPherson, Mencken revisited the case in 1930 with a sarcastically biting and observant article. He wrote that since many of that town's residents acquired their ideas \"of the true, the good and the beautiful\" from the movies and newspapers, \"Los Angeles will remember the testimony against her long after it forgets the testimony that cleared her.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |title=The American Mercury |year=1930}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931 the [[Arkansas]] legislature passed a motion to pray for Mencken's soul after he had called the state the \"apex of moronia.\"<ref>''Manchester'', p. 252</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1930s Mencken feared [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal liberalism]] as a powerful force. Mencken, says Charles A. Fecher, was, \"deeply conservative, resentful of change, looking back upon the 'happy days' of a bygone time, wanted no part of the world that the New Deal promised to bring in.\"<ref>{{cite book| editor-first =Charles A | editor-last = Fecher |title=Diary |first=HL |last=Mencken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMsufJS6uu0C&pg=PT28 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday]] |location=New York City|page=28| isbn = 9780307808868 }}</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===Race and elitism===\nIn addition to his identification of races with castes, Mencken had views about the superior individual within communities. He believed that every community produced a few people of clear superiority. He considered groupings on a par with hierarchies, which led to a kind of natural [[elitism]] and natural [[aristocracy]]. \"Superior\" individuals, in Mencken's view, were those wrongly oppressed and disdained by their own communities, but nevertheless distinguished by their will and personal achievement, not by race or birth.\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?10797-1/diary-hl-mencken ''Booknotes'' interview with Charles Fecher on ''The Diary of H.L. Mencken'', January 28, 1990], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nIn 1989, per his instructions, Alfred A. Knopf published Mencken's \"secret diary\" as ''The Diary of H.&nbsp;L. Mencken''. According to an Associated Press story, Mencken's views shocked even the \"sympathetic scholar who edited it,\" [[Charles A. Fecher]] of Baltimore.<ref name=\"latimes1989\"/> There is a club in Baltimore called the [[Maryland Club]] which had one [[Jewish]] member, and that member died. Mencken said, \"There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable,\" according to the article. The diary also quoted him as saying of blacks, in September 1943, that \"it is impossible to talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything.\"\n\nMencken opposed [[lynching]]. For example, he had this to say about a Maryland incident:\n\n{{quote|Not a single bigwig came forward in the emergency, though the whole town knew what was afoot. Any one of a score of such bigwigs might have halted the crime, if only by threatening to denounce its perpetrators, but none spoke. So Williams was duly hanged, burned and mutilated.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}}}\n\nMencken also wrote:\n\n{{quote|I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American Negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the Negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated Negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a Negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert Rives|last1=La Monte|authorlink1=Robert Rives La Monte|first2=HL|last2=Mencken|title=Men versus the Man: A Correspondence between Robert Rives La Monte, Socialist, and H.

Mencken'' (written by [[Terry Teachout]]), journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] described Mencken as a [[German nationalism|German nationalist]], \"an antihumanist as much as an atheist,\" who was \"prone to the hyperbole and sensationalism he distrusted in others.\" Hitchens also criticized Mencken for writing a scathing critique of [[Franklin Roosevelt]] but nothing equally negative of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/books/a-smart-set-of-one.html |title=A Smart Set of One |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |authorlink= Christopher Hitchens |date=November 17, 2002 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=July 12, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n====Anglo-Saxons====\nMencken countered the arguments for Anglo-Saxon superiority prevalent in his time in a 1923 essay entitled \"The Anglo-Saxon,\" which argued that if there was such a thing as a pure \"Anglo-Saxon\" race, it was defined by its inferiority and cowardice. \"The normal American of the 'pure-blooded' majority goes to rest every night with an uneasy feeling that there is a burglar under the bed and he gets up every morning with a sickening fear that his underwear has been stolen.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=HL|last=Mencken|title=The Anglo-Saxon|newspaper=[[Baltimore Evening Sun]]|date=July 1923}}</ref>\n\n====Jews====\nIn the 1930 edition of ''[[Treatise on the Gods]]'', Mencken wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Jews could be put down very plausibly as the most unpleasant race ever heard of. As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom. Their fortitude, such as it is, is wasted upon puerile objects, and their charity is mainly a form of display.<ref>{{cite book|first=HL|last=Mencken|title=Treatise on the Gods|publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday]]|location=New York City|date=1930|pages=345\u201346}}</ref>}}\n\nThat passage was removed from subsequent editions at his express direction.<ref>Hobson, Fred C. ''Mencken: A Life''. (1995), p. 477</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Gore Vidal]] later deflected claims of anti-Semitism against Mencken:\n\n{{quote|Far from being an anti-Semite, Mencken was one of the first journalists to denounce the persecution of the Jews in Germany at a time when ''[[The New York Times]]'', say, was notoriously reticent. On November 27, 1938, Mencken writes (''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''), \"It is to be hoped that the poor Jews now being robbed and mauled in Germany will not take too seriously the plans of various politicians to rescue them.\" He then reviews the various schemes to \"rescue\" the Jews from the Nazis, who had not yet announced their own [[Holocaust|final solution]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Gore|last1=Vidal|authorlink=Gore Vidal|first2=Marion Elizabeth|last2=Rodgers|title=The Impossible H.L.

Why shouldn't the United States take in a couple hundred thousand of them, or even all of them?<ref>Gore Vidal, \"Foreword,\" In H.L. Mencken, ''The Impossible H.L. Mencken'' (New York, NY: Doubleday, 1991) p. xxxi.</ref>}}\n\n===Democracy===\n{{quote|Democracy gives [the beatification of mediocrity] a certain appearance of objective and demonstrable truth. The mob man, functioning as citizen, gets a feeling that he is really important to the world\u2014that he is genuinely running things. Out of his maudlin herding after rogues and [[Charlatan|mountebanks]] there comes to him a sense of vast and mysterious power\u2014which is what makes archbishops, police sergeants, the grand [[goblin]]s of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other such magnificoes happy. And out of it there comes, too, a conviction that he is somehow wise, that his views are taken seriously by his betters\u2014which is what makes United States Senators, fortune tellers and Young Intellectuals happy. Finally, there comes out of it a glowing consciousness of a high duty triumphantly done which is what makes hangmen and husbands happy.}}\n\nThis sentiment is fairly consistent with Mencken's distaste for common notions and the philosophical outlook he unabashedly set down throughout his life as a writer (drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche and [[Herbert Spencer]], among others).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigeye.com/mencken.htm |title=Last Words by H. L. Mencken |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMencken wrote as follows about the difficulties of good men reaching national office when such campaigns must necessarily be conducted remotely:<blockquote>The larger the mob, the harder the test. In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by force of his personality. But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre\u2014the man who can most easily adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.\n\nThe Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Bayard vs. Lionheart|work=Baltimore Evening Sun|last=Mencken|first=H. L.|date=July 26, 1920|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Science and mathematics===\nMencken defended the evolutionary views of [[Charles Darwin]] but spoke unfavorably of many prominent physicists and had little regard for pure mathematics. Regarding Charles Angoff, Mencken said:\n\n{{quote|[Isaac Newton] was a mathematician, which is mostly hogwash, too. Imagine measuring infinity! That's a laugh.<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\">Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 141</ref>}}\n\nIn response, Angoff said: \"Well, without mathematics there wouldn't be any engineering, no chemistry, no physics.\" Mencken responded: \"That's true, but it's reasonable mathematics. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, division, that's what real mathematics is. The rest is baloney. Astrology. Religion. All of our sciences still suffer from their former attachment to religion, and that is why there is so much metaphysics and astrology, the two are the same, in science.\"<ref name=\"Angoff, Charles 1961 pp. 141\"/>\n\nElsewhere, he spoke of the nonsense of higher mathematics and \"probability\" theory, after he read Angoff's article for [[Charles S. Peirce]] in the ''American Mercury''. \"So you believe in that garbage, too\u2014theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability. I can make no sense of it, and I don't believe you can either, and I don't think your god Peirce knew what he was talking about.\"<ref>Angoff, Charles. ''H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory''. A. S. Barnes (New York, 1961), p. 194</ref>\n\nMencken also repeated these opinions multiple times in articles for the ''American Mercury''. He said mathematics is simply a fiction, compared with individual facts that make up science. In a review for Vaihinger's ''The Philosophy of \"As If'',\" he said:\n\n{{quote|The human mind, at its present stage of development, cannot function without the aid of fictions, but neither can it function without the aid of facts\u2014save, perhaps, when it is housed in the skull of a university professor of philosophy. Of the two, the facts are enormously the more important. In certain metaphysical fields, e.g. those of mathematics, law, theology, osteopathy and ethics\u2014the fiction will probably hold out for many years, but elsewhere the fact slowly ousts it, and that ousting is what is called intellectual progress. Very few fictions remain in use in anatomy, or in plumbing and gas-fitting; they have even begun to disappear from economics.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=October 1924 |title=Philosophers as Liars |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=III |number=10 |pages=253\u201355 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1924oct-00253}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken repeatedly identified mathematics with metaphysics and theology. According to Mencken, mathematics is necessarily infected with metaphysics because of the tendency of many mathematical people to engage in metaphysical speculation. In a review for A. N. Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education'', Mencken remarked that despite his agreement with Whitehead's thesis and approval of his writing style, \"now and then he falls into mathematical jargon and pollutes his discourse with equations,\" and \"[t]here are moments when he seems to be following some of his mathematical colleagues into the gaudy metaphysics which now entertains them.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=June 1929 |title=What Is It All About? |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVII |number=66 |pages=251\u201352 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929jun-00251}}</ref> For Mencken, theology is characterized by the fact that it uses correct reasoning from false premises. Mencken also uses the term \"theology\" more generally, to refer to the use of logic in science or any other field of knowledge. In a review for both A. S. Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and Joseph Needham's ''Man a Machine'', Mencken forcefully ridiculed the use of reasoning to establish any fact in science, because theologians happen to be masters of \"logic\" and yet are mental defectives:\n\n{{quote|Is there anything in the general thinking of theologians which makes their opinion on the point of any interest or value? What have they ever done in other fields to match the fact-finding of the biologists? I can find nothing in the record. Their processes of thought, taking one day with another, are so defective as to be preposterous. True enough, they are masters of logic, but they always start out from palpably false premises.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=April 1929 |title=The Riddle of the Universe |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XVI |number=64 |pages=509\u201310 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1929apr-00509}}</ref>}}\n\nMencken also wrote a review for Sir James Jeans's book, ''The Mysterious Universe'', in which he said that mathematics is not necessary for physics. Instead of mathematical \"speculation\" (such as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]), Mencken believed physicists should just directly look at individual facts in the laboratory like chemists:\n\n{{quote|If chemists were similarly given to fanciful and mystical guessing, they would have hatched a quantum theory forty years ago to account for the variations that they observed in atomic weights. But they kept on plugging away in their laboratories without calling in either mathematicians or theologians to aid them, and eventually they discovered the isotopes, and what had been chaos was reduced to the most exact sort of order.<ref name=\"Mencken 252\u201354\">{{Citation |last=Mencken |first=HL |date=February 1931 |title=The Eternal Conundrum |journal=[[The American Mercury]] |volume=XXII |number=86 |pages=252\u201354 |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmMercury-1931feb-00252}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the same article which he later re-printed in the ''Mencken Chrestomathy'', Mencken primarily contrasts what real scientists do, which is to simply directly look at the existence of \"shapes and forces\" confronting them instead of (such as in statistics) attempting to speculate and use mathematical models. Physicists and especially astronomers are consequently not real scientists, because when looking at shapes or forces, they do not simply \"patiently wait for further light,\" but resort to mathematical theory. There is no need for statistics in scientific physics, since one should simply look at the facts while statistics attempts to construct mathematical models. On the other hand, the really competent physicists do not bother with the \"theology\" or reasoning of mathematical theories (such as in quantum mechanics):\n\n{{quote|[Physicists] have, in late years, made a great deal of progress, though it has been accompanied by a considerable quackery. Some of the notions which they now try to foist upon the world, especially in the astronomical realm and about the atom, are obviously nonsensical, and will soon go the way of all unsupported speculations. But there is nothing intrinsically insoluble about the problems they mainly struggle with, and soon or late really competent physicists will arise to solve them. These really competent physicists, I predict, will be too busy in their laboratories to give any time to either metaphysics or theology. Both are eternal enemies of every variety of sound thinking, and no man can traffic with them without losing something of his good judgment.<ref name=\"Mencken 252\u201354\"/>}}\n\nMencken ridiculed [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], believing that \"in the long run his curved space may be classed with the psychosomatic bumps of Gall and Spurzheim.\"<ref>Mencken, Henry Louis. ''Minority Report, H. L. Mencken's Notebooks''. Alfred A. Knopf (New York, 1956), pp. 273\u201374</ref> In his private letters, he said:\n\n{{quote|It is a well known fact that physicists are greatly given to the supernatural. Why this should be I don't know, but the fact is plain. One of the most absurd of all spiritualists is Sir [[Oliver Lodge]]. I have the suspicion that the cause may be that physics itself, as currently practised, is largely moonshine. Certainly there is a great deal of highly dubious stuff in the work of such men as [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]].<ref>Mencken, Henry Louis. ''Letters of H. L. Mencken''. Alfred A.

The City of Baltimore acquired the property in 1983, and the [[H. L. Mencken House]] became part of the City Life Museums. It has been closed to general admission since 1997, but is opened for special events and group visits by arrangement.\n\n===Papers===\nShortly after [[World War&nbsp;II]], Mencken expressed his intention of bequeathing his books and papers to Baltimore's [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]. At his death, it was in possession of most of the present large collection. As a result, his papers as well as much of his personal library, which includes many books inscribed by major authors, are held in the Library's Central Branch on Cathedral Street in Baltimore. The original third floor ''H.&nbsp;L. Mencken Room and Collection'' housing this collection was dedicated on April 17, 1956. The new Mencken Room, on the first floor of the Library's Annex, was opened in November 2003.\n\nThe collection contains Mencken's typescripts, newspaper and magazine contributions, published books, family documents and memorabilia, clipping books, large collection of presentation volumes, file of correspondence with prominent Marylanders, and the extensive material he collected while he was preparing ''[[The American Language]]''.\n\nOther Mencken related collections of note are at [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], and [[Yale University]].

It flourishes naturally in waterways, and requires little if any care. It is used extensively in Indonesian, Burmese, Thai, Lao, Cambodian, Malay, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Chinese cuisine, especially in rural or ''[[kampung]]'' (village) areas. The vegetable is also extremely popular in [[Taiwan]], where it grows well. During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] in World War II, the vegetable grew remarkably easily in many areas, and became a popular wartime crop. \n\nWater spinach has been found to be cultivated in the following countries:<ref>Austin, Daniel F.

It readily roots from cuttings.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Requirements for climate and soil ===\n\nWater spinach is ideal for [[Subtropics|sub]]-tropical and [[Tropics|tropical]] climate, as it does not grow well below 23.9 \u00b0C and is sensitive to frost. High soil moisture is beneficial for the growth. Clay soils and [[Marsh|marshy]] soils rich in organic matter are suitable for water spinach. The ideal pH range for the growth is from 5 to 7. The provision of shade has been shown to have a positive influence on the yield of water spinach <ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>.\n\n=== Traditional way of cultivation === \n\nWater spinach is cultivated in a variety of systems. In [[Hong Kong]], two methods are traditionally used: The dryland method and the wetland method.\n\nIn '''the dryland method''', water spinach is grown on raised beds which are separated by irrigation ditches. The seeds can be sown directly onto the beds. Alternatively, a nursery may be used and the seedlings are transplanted when they reach a sufficient size. In either case, the distance between the plants should be about 12 cm by the time they are 15 cm tall. Regular irrigation is crucial in the dryland system and so is a sufficient fertilization. Water spinach cultivated with the dryland method is ready for harvest 50 to 60 days after sowing. Harvesting is being done by pulling up the whole plant.<ref>Edie, Harry, and H. Ho. \"Ipomoea Aquatica as a Vegetable Crop in Hong Kong.\" Economic Botany 23.1 (1969): 32-36. Web.</ref>\n\nThe '''wetland method''' is the traditionally more common and important method for cultivation in Hong Kong: In the wetland method, water spinach is cultivated on flat fields surrounded by raised banks, which have oftentimes been used as [[Paddy field|rice paddies]] in the past. These former rice paddies have a heavy clay soil with an iron-pan. This helps to retain water for the water spinach. The seedlings to be used in this methods are usually grown in a nursery on a dry field, as the germination under water is quite poor. Six weeks after sowing the seedlings, cuttings for transplation can be taken from them. One cutting is an approximately 30 cm long cut from the stem containing seven or eight nodes. This is then planted in the field with a spacing of about 40 cm. The field is beforehand prepared by flooding it to a depth of 3 to 5 cm. The soil itself is tramped into a liquid mud so that the cuttings can root easily. Once the plants are established, the depth of the flooding is increased to 15 to 20 cm. The first harvest in the wetland method can usually be done at around 30 days after the transplantation. Also, the harvesting differs from the dryland system: In the wetland, the upper part of the main shoot is cut at about water level. This stimulates lateral growth and produces horizontal shoots carrying vertical branches. After the first harvests, every seven to ten days throughout the summer, these vertical branches can be harvested. After the planting period, the fields are drained and once the fruit of the water spinach is ripe, it is harvested, dried, then trodden to release the seeds which are to be used for the following season.<ref>Edie, Harry, and H.

Generally, it has been shown that a dose of 60 kg [[Nitrogen|N]]/ha is sufficient and that the application of [[Potassium|K]] can be beneficial on the yield. Also, the application of plant growth regulators, for example [[Adenine]] and Zetanine, has been found to be an effective means to promote water spinach growth. One study has determined, that the highest yields are produced with the application of 60 kg/ha of N, 90 kg/ha of [[Phosphorus pentoxide|P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]] and 50 kg/ha of [[Potassium oxide|K<sub>2</sub>O]] for the first harvest. For the second harvest the optimal fertilization was determined as 120 kg/ha of N, 45 kg/ha of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and 100 kg/ha of K<sub>2</sub>O.<ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\n'''Taiwan''': In Taiwan the usual fertilization includes the basic application of about 10 t/ha of cowdung followed by 50 kg/ha of [[Ammonium sulfate|Ammonium Sulphate]] after each harvest.<ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>\n \n'''Bangkok''': In Bangkok it is common to apply about 300 kg/ha of NPK fertilizer twice a month.<ref>Pandey, A.K.

It flourishes naturally in waterways, and requires little if any care. It is used extensively in Indonesian, Burmese, Thai, Lao, Cambodian, Malay, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Chinese cuisine, especially in rural or ''[[kampung]]'' (village) areas. The vegetable is also extremely popular in [[Taiwan]], where it grows well. During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] in World War II, the vegetable grew remarkably easily in many areas, and became a popular wartime crop. \n\nWater spinach has been found to be cultivated in the following countries:<ref>Austin, Daniel F.

It readily roots from cuttings.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Requirements for climate and soil ===\n\nWater spinach is ideal for [[Subtropics|sub]]-tropical and [[Tropics|tropical]] climate, as it does not grow well below 23.9 \u00b0C and is sensitive to frost. High soil moisture is beneficial for the growth. Clay soils and [[Marsh|marshy]] soils rich in organic matter are suitable for water spinach. The ideal pH range for the growth is from 5 to 7. The provision of shade has been shown to have a positive influence on the yield of water spinach <ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>.\n\n=== Traditional way of cultivation === \n\nWater spinach is cultivated in a variety of systems. In [[Hong Kong]], two methods are traditionally used: The dryland method and the wetland method.\n\nIn '''the dryland method''', water spinach is grown on raised beds which are separated by irrigation ditches. The seeds can be sown directly onto the beds. Alternatively, a nursery may be used and the seedlings are transplanted when they reach a sufficient size. In either case, the distance between the plants should be about 12 cm by the time they are 15 cm tall. Regular irrigation is crucial in the dryland system and so is a sufficient fertilization. Water spinach cultivated with the dryland method is ready for harvest 50 to 60 days after sowing. Harvesting is being done by pulling up the whole plant.<ref>Edie, Harry, and H. Ho. \"Ipomoea Aquatica as a Vegetable Crop in Hong Kong.\" Economic Botany 23.1 (1969): 32-36. Web.</ref>\n\nThe '''wetland method''' is the traditionally more common and important method for cultivation in Hong Kong: In the wetland method, water spinach is cultivated on flat fields surrounded by raised banks, which have oftentimes been used as [[Paddy field|rice paddies]] in the past. These former rice paddies have a heavy clay soil with an iron-pan. This helps to retain water for the water spinach. The seedlings to be used in this methods are usually grown in a nursery on a dry field, as the germination under water is quite poor. Six weeks after sowing the seedlings, cuttings for transplation can be taken from them. One cutting is an approximately 30 cm long cut from the stem containing seven or eight nodes. This is then planted in the field with a spacing of about 40 cm. The field is beforehand prepared by flooding it to a depth of 3 to 5 cm. The soil itself is tramped into a liquid mud so that the cuttings can root easily. Once the plants are established, the depth of the flooding is increased to 15 to 20 cm. The first harvest in the wetland method can usually be done at around 30 days after the transplantation. Also, the harvesting differs from the dryland system: In the wetland, the upper part of the main shoot is cut at about water level. This stimulates lateral growth and produces horizontal shoots carrying vertical branches. After the first harvests, every seven to ten days throughout the summer, these vertical branches can be harvested. After the planting period, the fields are drained and once the fruit of the water spinach is ripe, it is harvested, dried, then trodden to release the seeds which are to be used for the following season.<ref>Edie, Harry, and H. Ho. \"Ipomoea Aquatica as a Vegetable Crop in Hong Kong.\" Economic Botany 23.1 (1969): 32-36. Web.</ref>\n\n=== Use of fertilizer ===\nHow much fertilizer is used for the cultivation strongly depends on the region. Most research is from the '80s and '90s. Generally, it has been shown that a dose of 60 kg [[Nitrogen|N]]/ha is sufficient and that the application of [[Potassium|K]] can be beneficial on the yield. Also, the application of plant growth regulators, for example [[Adenine]] and Zetanine, has been found to be an effective means to promote water spinach growth. One study has determined, that the highest yields are produced with the application of 60 kg/ha of N, 90 kg/ha of [[Phosphorus pentoxide|P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]] and 50 kg/ha of [[Potassium oxide|K<sub>2</sub>O]] for the first harvest. For the second harvest the optimal fertilization was determined as 120 kg/ha of N, 45 kg/ha of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and 100 kg/ha of K<sub>2</sub>O.<ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\n'''Taiwan''': In Taiwan the usual fertilization includes the basic application of about 10 t/ha of cowdung followed by 50 kg/ha of [[Ammonium sulfate|Ammonium Sulphate]] after each harvest.<ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>\n \n'''Bangkok''': In Bangkok it is common to apply about 300 kg/ha of NPK fertilizer twice a month.<ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>\n \n'''Indonesia''': In Indonesia, usually 150 kg to 300 kg of NPK are being applied per hectare.<ref>Pandey, A.K. Aquatic Vegetables. Udaipur: Agrotech Academy, 2011. Print.</ref>\n\n== Pathogens and pests ==\nThere are several pathogens and pests reported, affecting ''I. aquatica''.
