In 1988, he was made director of organization of the People's Front of Nigeria which consisted of politicians such as [[Atiku Abubakar]], [[Bola Tinubu]], [[Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila]] and [[Rabiu Kwankwaso]], which was then led by [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua]]. \n\nThe front later joined with the [[Social Democratic Party (Nigeria)|Social Democratic Party]] in 1989. During the conduct of elections for national executive positions in the party, Kingibe was sponsored by the People's Front faction of SDP as the party's chairman, a position he went on to clinch. As party chairman, Kingibe was involved in the organization of party's gubernatorial and presidential primaries in 1991 and 1992 respectively. \n\n=== 1993 presidential election ===\nHowever, after the cancellations of presidential elections in 1992 in which [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua|Shehu Yar'Adua]] was a candidate, Kingibe put himself forward as a presidential candidate. He made a split from his initial camp, the PFN group and used his relationships with SDP state party chairmen to build his campaign. He lost the keenly contested primary conducted in Jos but after much prodding from SDP governors, he was selected by the primary winner, [[MKO Abiola]] as [[Vice-President of Nigeria|Vice-presidential]] running mate, creating a Muslim-Muslim ticket which was initially thought to be a deal breaker in the general elections. The pair won the electoral majority although the result was annulled by abdicating president General [[Ibrahim Babangida]].<ref name=\"Safari Books2\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOVMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=kingibe++pfn&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI7aCfjJ3exgIVAhmSCh3o7gtX#v=onepage&q=kingibe%20%20pfn&f=false/|title=Frank Kokori: The Struggle for June 12|date=2014|publisher=Safari Books|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Abacha administration ===\nKingibe later joined the Abacha administration as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Nigeria)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1993 to 1995, [[Federal Ministry of Interior (Nigeria)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] from 1995 to 1997, and [[Federal Ministries of Nigeria|Minister of Power and Steel]] from 1997 to 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/335406-why-i-abandoned-june-12-joined-abacha-junta-kingibe.html|title=Why I abandoned June 12, joined Abacha junta - Kingibe - Premium Times Nigeria|date=2019-06-17|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Secretary to the Government===\nIn June 2007, he was appointed [[Secretary to the Government of the Federation]].<ref>Idowu Adelusi.

A [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] from [[Borno State|Borno]], he grew up in [[Maiduguri]] and attended primary schools there.

At the university, he became acquainted with the [[Kaduna Mafia]], a group of young western-educated [[intellectuals]], [[civil servants]] and [[Nigerian Armed Forces|military officers]] from [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Nigeria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamji.com/haruna/haruna304.htm|title=Ibrahim Tahir: An Appreciation|last=Daura|first=Mamman|date=|website=Gamji|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> During the [[Nigerian Civil War]], he became the head of features and current affairs at the Broadcasting Corporation of Northern Nigeria. \n\n==Diplomatic service==\nIn 1972, he joined the Nigerian Foreign Service where his first posting was the [[Nigerian High Commission in London]] as a senior political counsellor and later became the head of the political desk. \n\nFollowing the [[1976 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]], Kingibe was seconded to the Supreme Military Headquarters (SMHQ) as the Principal Secretary, Political, from 1976 to 1979, where he was involved in the planning of the military's transfer of power programme, [[States of Nigeria|states creation]] and [[national delimitation]], [[Local government areas of Nigeria|local government reforms]] and the [[Constitution of Nigeria#1979 constitution (Second Republic)|constitutional drafting committee]] of the [[Second Nigerian Republic]].<ref>African Concord (1990).

In 1988, he was made director of organization of the People's Front of Nigeria which consisted of politicians such as [[Atiku Abubakar]], [[Bola Tinubu]], [[Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila]] and [[Rabiu Kwankwaso]], which was then led by [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua]]. \n\nThe front later joined with the [[Social Democratic Party (Nigeria)|Social Democratic Party]] in 1989. During the conduct of elections for national executive positions in the party, Kingibe was sponsored by the People's Front faction of SDP as the party's chairman, a position he went on to clinch. As party chairman, Kingibe was involved in the organization of party's gubernatorial and presidential primaries in 1991 and 1992 respectively. \n\n=== 1993 presidential election ===\nHowever, after the cancellations of presidential elections in 1992 in which [[Shehu Musa Yar'Adua|Shehu Yar'Adua]] was a candidate, Kingibe put himself forward as a presidential candidate. He made a split from his initial camp, the PFN group and used his relationships with SDP state party chairmen to build his campaign. He lost the keenly contested primary conducted in Jos but after much prodding from SDP governors, he was selected by the primary winner, [[MKO Abiola]] as [[Vice-President of Nigeria|Vice-presidential]] running mate, creating a Muslim-Muslim ticket which was initially thought to be a deal breaker in the general elections. The pair won the electoral majority although the result was annulled by abdicating president General [[Ibrahim Babangida]].<ref name=\"Safari Books2\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOVMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=kingibe++pfn&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI7aCfjJ3exgIVAhmSCh3o7gtX#v=onepage&q=kingibe%20%20pfn&f=false/|title=Frank Kokori: The Struggle for June 12|date=2014|publisher=Safari Books|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Abacha administration ===\nKingibe later joined the Abacha administration as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Nigeria)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1993 to 1995, [[Federal Ministry of Interior (Nigeria)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] from 1995 to 1997, and [[Federal Ministries of Nigeria|Minister of Power and Steel]] from 1997 to 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/335406-why-i-abandoned-june-12-joined-abacha-junta-kingibe.html|title=Why I abandoned June 12, joined Abacha junta - Kingibe - Premium Times Nigeria|date=2019-06-17|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===Secretary to the Government===\nIn June 2007, he was appointed [[Secretary to the Government of the Federation]].<ref>Idowu Adelusi.
