He was an historic member of the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democratic Party]] until his expulsion from the political party in December 2007.\n\nZald\u00edvar was married to Mar\u00eda Alicia Larra\u00edn Shaux and had six children. He was the brother of former President of the [[Senate of Chile]] and Interior Minister [[Andr\u00e9s Zald\u00edvar]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\nZald\u00edvar received secondary formation at the ''Instituto de Humanidades Luis Campino''. Then, he went to university at the [[law faculty]] of the [[Catholic University of Chile|Catholic University]] in Chile, which he concluded in 1967. As a partner at the law firm \"Irureta, Zaldivar, Briones y Hern\u00e1ndez\", he worked in his profession until he finished his studies.\n\n===Political life===\nIn 1965 Zald\u00edvar became the university party leader of the Christian Democrat Party (PDC), and from 1970 to 1972 he occupied the post of national counselor for youth of this party. In the following year he became the national leader of the lawyers of the PDC, and filled this position until 1980. He was a co-founder of the Chilean Commission of [[Human Rights]].\n\nFrom 1985 to 1988 Zald\u00edvar was president of the Forum of Political Integration of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. From 1983 to 1989 he was part of the fiscal commission of the PDC. Then from 1983 to 1990 he worked as national counselor of the PDC, then he became premier national vice-president.\n\nIn the [[election]]s of December 1993 Zald\u00edvar was elected senator, and formed the senate's mining commission. He went on to form the commission on national defense and the commission of maritime interests, fishing and [[aquaculture]]. From 2002 to 2006 he was president of the PDC.\n\n====Party expulsion====\nIn early 2006, after he lost the presidency of the PDC to [[Soledad Alvear]], Zald\u00edvar became a vocal critic of the Chilean economic system and voiced his disappointment with the government's \"unwillingness\" to amend it. He frequently came into conflict with Alvear and in August 2007 the Christian Democrat Party's Supreme Tribunal chastised him for his criticisms. Additionally, he was one of the harshest critics of the [[Transantiago]] public transport system, created under the leadership of the [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] coalition to which the Christian Democrats belonged. In November 2007, Zald\u00edvar, together with senators from the [[Alliance for Chile]] and independents [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Carlos Bianchi]], voted against continued funding for the Transantiago, against the wishes of his party's leadership. Alvear and her followers accused Zald\u00edvar of \"siding with the right\" and requested his expulsion from the party. In December, the party leadership formally presented the expulsion request to the Supreme Tribunal of the party, on the basis of his decision to ignore the party wishes on the Transantiago funding bill and for Zald\u00edvar's harsh criticisms of the leadership's actions regarding corruption. The Tribunal finally decided to expel Zald\u00edvar on December 27, 2007. On March 12, 2008 he became President of the Senate with the votes from the right-wing Alliance for Chile.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography|Politics}}\n{{Commons category|Adolfo Zald\u00edvar}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080228045903/http://www.adolfozaldivar.cl/ Official site]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-off}}\n{{Succession box\n| title=[[Senate of Chile|President of the Senate of Chile]]\n| before=[[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]]\n| after=[[Jovino Novoa]]\n| years='''2008\u20132009'''}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{Succession box\n| title=[[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat Party President]]\n| before=[[Ricardo Hormaz\u00e1bal]]\n| after=[[Soledad Alvear]]\n| years='''2002\u20132006'''}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Presidents of the Senate of Chile}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zaldivar, Adolfo}}\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:2013 deaths]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Senate of Chile]]\n[[Category:Members of the Senate of Chile]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Chile to Argentina]]\n[[Category:Pontifical Catholic University of Chile alumni]]\n[[Category:Christian Democratic Party (Chile) politicians]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n|honorific-prefix = \n|name      = Adolfo Zald\u00edvar\n|honorific-suffix = \n|image     = Adolfo_Zald\u00edvar.jpg\n|imagesize = \n|caption   = \n|nationality=[[Chile]]an\n|office      = Chilean Ambassador to Argentina\n|term_start  = April 16, 2010\n|term_end    = February 27, 2013\n|predecessor = Miguel Otero\n|successor   = Milenko Skoknic\n|office2      = [[Senate of Chile|Senator of Chile]]<br /> <small> [[Aisen Region|For Aisen Region]]\n|term_start2  = March 11, 1994\n|term_end2    = March 11, 2010\n|predecessor2 = Hern\u00e1n Vodanovic\n|successor2   = [[Patricio Walker]]\n|office3     = [[President of the Senate of Chile]]\n|term_start3 = March 12, 2008\n|term_end3   = March 13, 2009\n|predecessor3 = [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]]\n|successor3   = [[Jovino Novoa]]\n|birth_date={{Birth date|1943|9|13|mf=y}}\n|birth_place=[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]\n|dead=\n|death_date= {{Death date and age|2013|02|27|1943|9|13|mf=y}}\n|death_place=\n|resting_place = [[Parque del Recuerdo (Chile)|Parque del Recuerdo]]\n|occupation=[[Civil engineering|Lawyer]]\n|spouse= Mar\u00eda Alicia Larra\u00edn\n|party=[[Partido Regionalista de los Independientes]] <small>(2009-2010)</small><br /> [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile]] <small>(1957\u20132007)</small>\n}}\n\n'''Miguel Adolfo Gerardo Zald\u00edvar Larra\u00edn''' (September 13, 1943 \u2013 February 27, 2013) was a [[Chile]]an politician and lawyer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2013/02/674-511050-9-a-los-69-anos-fallece-el-embajador-de-chile-en-argentina-y-ex-senador-adolfo.shtml |title=Adolfo Zald\u00edvar: A los 69 a\u00f1os fallece el embajador de Chile en Argentina y ex senador &#124; Pol\u00edtica |publisher=La Tercera |date=1990-01-01 |accessdate=2013-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227222506/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2013/02/674-511050-9-a-los-69-anos-fallece-el-embajador-de-chile-en-argentina-y-ex-senador-adolfo.shtml |archivedate=2013-02-27 }}</ref> He was senator for [[Ais\u00e9n Region|Ais\u00e9n]] and from March 2008 until his death in February 2013 he had been [[List of Presidents of the Senate of Chile|President of the Chilean Senate]].

Facebook refused to comment on the claims in any of the articles.\n\nThe scandal finally erupted in March 2018 with the emergence of a whistle-blower, an ex-Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]]. He had been an anonymous source for an article in 2017 in [[The Observer]] by Cadwalladr, headlined \"The Great British [[Brexit]] Robbery\".<ref name=\":04\" /> This article went viral but was disbelieved in some quarters, prompting skeptical responses in [[The New York Times]] among others. Cadwalladr worked with Wylie for a year to coax him to come forward as a whistleblower. She later brought in [[Channel 4 News]] in the UK and The New York Times due to legal threats against The Guardian and The Observer by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe three news organisations published simultaneously on March 17, 2018, and caused a huge public outcry. More than $100 billion was knocked off Facebook's market capitalization in days and politicians in the US and UK demanded answers from Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]].
