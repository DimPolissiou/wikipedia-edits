The engagement ring is usually worn on the outside.]]\n\nAn '''engagement ring''' is a [[jewelry ring|ring]] indicating that the person wearing it is [[engagement|engaged]] to be [[marriage|married]], especially in Western cultures. A ring is presented as an [[engagement]] gift by a partner to their prospective spouse when they propose marriage or directly after a marriage proposal is accepted. It represents a formal agreement to future marriage. In Western countries, engagement rings are worn mostly by women, and rings can feature [[diamond]]s or other [[gemstone]]s. The neologism \"'''mangagement ring'''\" is sometimes used for an engagement ring worn by men. In some cultures, men and women wear matching rings, and engagement rings may also be used as wedding rings. In [[Anglo-Saxon countries]], the ring is customarily worn on the left hand [[ring finger]], but customs vary considerably elsewhere across the world.\n\nNeither the [[engagement]] nor any other ring is worn during the wedding ceremony, when the [[wedding ring]] is put by the groom on the finger of the bride as part of the ceremony, and sometimes by the bride onto the groom's finger. After the wedding, the engagement ring is usually put back on and is usually worn on the outside of the wedding ring. Some brides have their engagement and wedding rings permanently soldered together after the wedding.\n\n==History==\n===Ancient times===\nAlthough the ancient Egyptians are sometimes credited with having invented the engagement ring, and the ancient Greeks with having adopted the tradition, the history of the engagement ring can only be reliably traced as far back as ancient Rome.<ref name=\"Toliver2003\">{{cite book|last=Toliver|first=Wendy|title=The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Wedding Etiquette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvImGEVrAO8C&pg=PA19|accessdate=6 November 2013|date=1 March 2003|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8069-9389-8|pages=19\u201320}}</ref><ref name=\"PatrickThompson2009\">{{cite book|last1=Patrick|first1=Bethanne Kelly|last2=Thompson|first2=John Milliken|title=An Uncommon History of Common Things|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcaXzXPP8ooC&pg=PA81|accessdate=6 November 2013|year=2009|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0420-3|page=81}}</ref><ref name=\"Inc.2008\">{{cite book|author=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|title=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ea-bAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1623|accessdate=6 November 2013|date=1 May 2008|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59339-492-9|page=1623}}</ref><ref name=\"Hersch2010\">{{cite book|last=Hersch|first=Karen K.|title=The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZEJQPjc4sIC&pg=PA41|accessdate=6 November 2013|date=24 May 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-12427-0|pages=41\u201342}}</ref><ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/weddings/2007/06/diamonds_are_a_girls_worst_friend.html |title=Diamonds Are a Girl's Worst Friend |last=O'Rourke |first=Meghan |date=11 June 2007 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn many countries, engagement rings are placed on the ring finger of the left hand.

At one time Roman citizens wore rings made of iron. In later years senators who served as ambassadors were given gold [[Seal (emblem)#The Western tradition|seal rings]] for official use when abroad. Later the privilege of wearing gold rings was extended to other public officials, then to the knights, later to all [[Social class in ancient Rome|freeborn]], and finally under [[Justinian]], to [[freedmen]]. For several centuries it was the custom for Romans to wear iron rings at home, gold rings in public.

The price of the [[gemstone]]s, if any, in the ring depends on the type and quality of the gem. Diamonds have a [[Diamond (gemstone)#Gemological characteristics|standardized description]] that values them according to their carat weight, color, clarity, and cut. Other gemstones, such as [[sapphire]]s, [[rubies]], and [[emerald]]s have different systems. The jewelry may be chosen to honor a family tradition, to use family heirlooms, to have an unusual style, to have [[socially responsible]] characteristics (e.g., a style that is not associated with [[blood diamonds|blood diamond]] controversy or the pollution caused by [[gold mining]] and [[Gold cyanidation|cyanide process]]), to fit the individual's stylistic preferences, or to manage cost.

Three-stone diamond engagement rings, sometimes called ''trinity rings'' or ''trilogy rings'', are rings with three matching diamonds set horizontally in a row with the bigger stone placed in the center.

Similar traditions purportedly date to classical times, dating back from an early usage reportedly referring to the fourth finger of the left hand as containing the ''[[vena amoris]]'' or \"vein of love\".{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} This custom may have its origins in an ancient Egyptian myth that the finger contained a vein leading directly to the heart, or it may simply be because the heart lies slightly to the left side of the body.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} In [[Germany]] the ring is worn on the left hand while engaged, but moved to the right hand when married.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} In Poland and Turkey, the engagement ring and wedding band are traditionally worn on the right hand but modern practice varies considerably.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Legal ownership===\nTradition generally holds that if the betrothal fails because the man himself breaks off the engagement, the woman is not obliged to return the ring. This reflects the ring's role as a form of compensation for the woman's damaged reputation.<ref name=Brinig/> Legally, this condition can be subject to either a modified or a strict fault rule. Under the former, the fianc\u00e9 can demand the return of the ring unless he breaks the engagement. Under the latter, the fianc\u00e9 is entitled to the return unless his actions caused the breakup of the relationship, the same as the traditional approach. However, a no-fault rule is being advanced in some jurisdictions, under which the fianc\u00e9 is always entitled to the return of the ring. The ring only becomes the property of the woman when marriage occurs. An unconditional gift approach is another possibility, wherein the ring is always treated as a gift, to be kept by the fianc\u00e9e whether or not the relationship progresses to marriage. Recent court rulings have determined that the date in which the ring was offered can determine the condition of the gift. E.g. [[Valentine's Day]] and [[Christmas]] are widely recognized as gift-giving holidays in the United States and some other countries. A ring offered in the form of a Christmas present is likely to remain the personal property of the recipient in the event of a breakup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20011023.html |title=Who gets the engagement ring when the wedding is off |publisher=[[FindLaw]] |date=23 October 2001 |first=Joanna |last=Grossman |accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn most states of the United States, engagement rings are considered \"conditional gifts\" under the legal rules of property. This is an exception to the general rule that gifts cannot be revoked once properly given. See, for example, the case of ''Meyer v. Mitnick'', 625 N.W.2d 136 (Michigan, 2001), whose ruling found the following reasoning persuasive: \"the so-called 'modern trend' holds that because an engagement ring is an inherently conditional gift, once the engagement has been broken, the ring should be returned to the donor. Thus, the question of who broke the engagement and why, or who was 'at fault,' is irrelevant. This is the no-fault line of cases.\" Though in certain states, whether a judicial action can be maintained at all to require return of an engagement ring is blocked by statute, as many states have statutes which state that  no civil action shall be maintained for breach of promise to marry.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McConnell|first1=J.

This reflects the ring's role as a form of compensation for the woman's damaged reputation.<ref name=Brinig/> Legally, this condition can be subject to either a modified or a strict fault rule. Under the former, the fianc\u00e9 can demand the return of the ring unless he breaks the engagement. Under the latter, the fianc\u00e9 is entitled to the return unless his actions caused the breakup of the relationship, the same as the traditional approach. However, a no-fault rule is being advanced in some jurisdictions, under which the fianc\u00e9 is always entitled to the return of the ring. The ring only becomes the property of the woman when marriage occurs. An unconditional gift approach is another possibility, wherein the ring is always treated as a gift, to be kept by the fianc\u00e9e whether or not the relationship progresses to marriage. Recent court rulings have determined that the date in which the ring was offered can determine the condition of the gift. E.g. [[Valentine's Day]] and [[Christmas]] are widely recognized as gift-giving holidays in the United States and some other countries. A ring offered in the form of a Christmas present is likely to remain the personal property of the recipient in the event of a breakup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20011023.html |title=Who gets the engagement ring when the wedding is off |publisher=[[FindLaw]] |date=23 October 2001 |first=Joanna |last=Grossman |accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn most states of the United States, engagement rings are considered \"conditional gifts\" under the legal rules of property. This is an exception to the general rule that gifts cannot be revoked once properly given. See, for example, the case of ''Meyer v. Mitnick'', 625 N.W.2d 136 (Michigan, 2001), whose ruling found the following reasoning persuasive: \"the so-called 'modern trend' holds that because an engagement ring is an inherently conditional gift, once the engagement has been broken, the ring should be returned to the donor. Thus, the question of who broke the engagement and why, or who was 'at fault,' is irrelevant. This is the no-fault line of cases.\" Though in certain states, whether a judicial action can be maintained at all to require return of an engagement ring is blocked by statute, as many states have statutes which state that  no civil action shall be maintained for breach of promise to marry.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McConnell|first1=J.

The Supreme Court of New South Wales held that, despite what the man said, the ring remained a conditional gift (partly because his saying that she could keep it reflected his desire to salvage the relationship) and she was ordered to pay him its A$15,250 cost.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/men-own-the-engagement-ring/story-e6frfkp9-1111113566094 |first=Simon |last=Kirby |date=18 May 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2013 |title=Men own the engagement ring |publisher=[[News Limited|news.com.au]] |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn England and Wales, the gift of an engagement ring is presumed to be an absolute gift to the fianc\u00e9e. This presumption may be rebutted however by proving that the ring was given on condition (express or implied) that it must be returned if the marriage did not take place, for whatever reason. This was decided in the case ''Jacobs v Davis'' (1917).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Canada Law Journal: New Series, Volume 53 |year=1917 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRZCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA389 |page=389 |accessdate=2014-12-14}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural variations==\nIn some countries it is common for both men and women to wear engagement rings. The rings are often in the form of a plain band of a precious metal. Sometimes, the engagement ring eventually serves as the wedding ring for the man. In Brazil, for example, the groom and bride-to-be usually wear a plain wedding band on the right hand during the course of their engagement.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/07/male-engagement-rings |title=Male engagement rings: for love or money? |date=7 May 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Rupert |last=Myers |agency=Comment is free |accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> After the wedding, the band is moved to the left hand.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} In Argentina, it is also known for the groom and bride-to-be to wear a plain silver band on the left hand while engaged.
