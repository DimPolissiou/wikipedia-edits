He graduated at the Gansu provincial academy and then served as the Principal at the provincial normal school. He entered the Imperial Civil Service, where he got into the attention of [[Yang Zengxin]], at the time District Magistrate of [[Hezhou]]. When Yang was appointed Governor of [[Xinjiang Province, Republic of China|Xinjiang]] in 1908, Jin followed him as a district magistrate. After the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1911, Jin rose through the ranks during Yang's absolute rule over Xinjiang. In 1927 he was named Provincial Commissioner for Civil Affairs in [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], a post which he held until Yang's assassination in July 1928.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=38}}\n\nAfter taking the Yang's post, Jin sent a telegram to [[Nanking]] asking for [[Kuomintang]]'s recognition of his new post. Kuomintang had no other choice but to recognise Jin as a new governor, but under new terminology he was recognised as Provincial Chairman and Commander-in-Chief, unlike his predecessor Yang who held the titles of Provincial Governor and Military Governor.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=38}}\n\nImmediately after taking power, Jin took steps to strengthen his power by increasing the secret police, doubling the salaries of army and police and introducing new uniforms. The army was later expanded and new weapons were acquired. The administrative system remained almost unchanged, while Jin employed the practice of his predecessor of appointing relatives and fellow provincials. Subsequently, former [[Yunnan]]ese officials, both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] were replaced by Han from Gansu, especially from the region of Hezhou. He appointed his brother Jin Shuhsin as Provincial Commissioner for Military Affairs and another brother Jin Shuchih was given senior military post in [[Kashgar]].{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=38&ndash;39}}\n\nJin expanded Yang's system of internal surveillance and censorship. Besides increasing the strength of both secret and ordinary police, he introduced internal passports which gave him greater control over internal travels thus tightening internal security, as well as giving additional source of revenue for his administration. Traveling outside the province became almost impossible.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=39}}\n\nJin's rule of Xinjiang for about a half-decade was characterized by strife caused by corruption, suppression and disruption. Ethnic and religious conflicts were intensified and resulted in numerous riots against his regime and his eventual downfall. Jin confiscated the local [[Turkic people|Turkic]] lands in order to redistribute them to the Chinese, but he gave these lands to his personal associates. The deception caused the Chinese to become the targets of hatred. Jin also favored the Han over the Turkic (such as the [[Uyghur people|Uighur]]s) and intensified ethnic conflicts between the Uighurs and Chinese. In April 1933 Jin's [[White Emigre|White Russian]] troops changed allegiance, encouraged revolt in Xinjiang, ended his reign and forced him to flee to the [[USSR]]. He was succeeded by [[Sheng Shicai]].{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=71}} Jin incurred the wrath of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) when, without approval, he signed an arms treaty with the [[Soviet Union]]. The Tungan General [[Ma Zhongying]] allied himself with the KMT and his troops became the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)|36th Division of the National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA). Ma was ordered to overthrow Jin.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=106}} Jin however, was overthrown after the [[First Battle of Urumqi (1933)]] by White Russian troops under Colonel [[Pavel Pappengut]]. When he returned to China in October 1933 he was arrested by the KMT, brought to trial in March 1935 and sentenced to 3-1/2 years imprisonment. However, the KMT pardoned him on 10 October 1935 and he was released from prison the next day.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=106}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvxwAAAAMAAJ&dq=aitchen+wu&q=chin+shu-jen+treaty|title=Turkistan Tumult|author=Aitchen Wu, Aichen Wu|year=1984|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-19-583839-4|pages=278|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Who's Who in China; Biographies of Chinese leaders |year=1936 |location=Shanghai|publisher=THE CHINA WEEKLY REVIEW |url=https://archive.org/stream/5edwhoswhoinchina00shanuoft#page/52/mode/2up |page=52 |isbn= | ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Forbes |first=Andrew D.

Jumping classes are commonly seen at [[horse show]]s throughout the world, including the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. Sometimes shows are limited exclusively to jumpers, sometimes jumper classes are offered in conjunction with other English-style events, and sometimes show jumping is but one division of very large, all-breed competitions that include a very wide variety of disciplines. Jumping classes may be governed by various national horse show sanctioning organizations, such as the [[United States Equestrian Federation]] in the [[United States|USA]] or the [[British Showjumping Association]] in [[Great Britain]]. International competitions are governed by the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI, from the body's French name of ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00c9questre Internationale'').\n\n==Hunters or jumpers==\n{{See also|Show hunter|Show hunter (British)}}\n[[File:R3DE StadiumJump.jpg|right|thumb|Proper show jumping attire, as seen in the show jumping phase of a three-day event. Attire at an event includes a mandatory armband as seen here, although the armband is not required in general show jumping.]]\n\nShow jumping events have [[show hunter|hunter]] classes, jumper classes and hunt seat equitation classes.\n\nHunters are judged subjectively on the degree to which they meet an ideal standard of manners, style, and movement. This includes flowing, sweeping movement of the horse, and an ideal hunter should jump with square knees that are tucked-in tightly and a rounded neck. Hunters' appearance should tend toward quiet and soft to give the appearance of effortless grace, and the horse's tack and the rider's attire should be conservative so that nothing detracts from the horse's performance. The horse's tack [[bit (horse)|bits]], [[bridle]]s, [[Crop (implement)|crops]], [[spur]]s, and [[martingale (tack)|martingales]] is tightly regulated because the goal is to showcase the horse's natural ability, and excessive tack takes away from this. Hunters are not allowed to wear boots or polos on their legs when competing to show the judges their fluid movement. Show hunters should be immaculately groomed with their manes and tails neatly braided to emphasize tradition, as well as their beauty and athleticism. Hunter courses are generally simplistic and the jumps are made out of natural-looking materials to represent the sport's fox-hunting origin.\n\nConversely, jumper classes are scored objectively, based entirely on a numerical score determined only by whether the horse attempts the obstacle, clears it, and finishes the course in the allotted time. Every rail that is knocked down during competition results in a 4 fault penalty. There are also time limits per course and failure to be under the time allowed results in a time fault every second over. Jumper courses tend to be much more complex and technical than hunter courses to test the rider's and the horse's skill and athleticism, and jumper jumps are often made with bright colors and are built to look airy instead solid. An ideal jumper is fast, agile, athletic, and brave; the horse's appearance is not near as important as their athletic ability. In jumper classes, the fence heights can be much taller than in hunters or equitation, so to compete at the top level, a horse's jumping ability is the primary focus. Because jumpers are not judged on the horse or rider's appearance, there are fewer restrictions on tack and rider apparel. Many riders will select tack and apparel that match their barn or company's colors as a way to indicate that is who they ride for. However, horses should still be thoroughly groomed and riders should be professional and tasteful with their attire; major events do have specific rules regarding what is permitted. As  show jumping is a large international's sport, it is an event in the summer Olympics.\n\nIn addition to hunters and jumpers, there are [[equitation]] classes, sometimes called [[hunt seat]] equitation, which judges the ability of the rider. The equipment, clothing, and fence styles used in equitation more closely resemble hunter classes, although the technical difficulty of the courses may more closely resemble showjumping events. This is because both disciplines are designed to test the rider's ability to control the horse through a difficult course consisting of rollbacks, [[Combination (jump)|combinations]], and higher obstacles. Equitation is geared towards junior riders (under 18) as a way to promote disciplined and technical riding abilities, but there are equitation classes for adults as well. In the fall, there are four main equitation championships which include the [[USET]] Talent Search Final, the USEF Dover Hunt Seat Medal Final, the Washington International Horse Show Equitation Championship,  and the [[ASPCA]] Maclay Equitation Championship. Winners of these events often go on to become prominent competitors in the equestrian world; equitation classes serve as an important foundation for high-level riding.\n\n==Rules==\n[[Image:Piste2-1-.JPG|thumb|A show jumping course]]\n[[Image:Rolex panorama.jpg|thumb|Show Jump Course]]\n[[Image:ShowJumpCourse.gif|thumb|Diagram of a show jumping course]]\n\nJumper classes are held over a course of show jumping obstacles, including verticals, spreads, and double and triple [[Combination (jump)|combinations]], usually with many turns and changes of direction. The intent is to jump cleanly over a set course within an allotted time. Time faults are assessed for exceeding the time allowance. Jumping faults are incurred for knockdowns and blatant disobedience, such as refusals (when the horse stops before a fence or \"runs out\") (''see \"Modern rules\" below''). Horses are allowed a limited number of refusals before being disqualified. A refusal may lead to a rider exceeding the time allowed on course. Placings are based on the lowest number of points or \"faults\" accumulated. A horse and rider who have not accumulated any jumping faults or penalty points are said to have scored a \"clear round\". Tied entries usually have a jump-off over a raised and shortened course, and the course is timed; if entries are tied for faults accumulated in the jump-off, the fastest time wins.\n\nIn most competitions, riders are allowed to walk the initial course but not the jump-off course (usually the same course with missing jumps, e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or the same course but timed) before competition to plan their ride. Walking the course before the event is a chance for the rider to walk the lines he or she will have to ride, in order to decide how many strides the horse will need to take between each jump and from which angle. Going off course will cost time if minor errors are made and major departures will result in disqualification.\n\nThe higher levels of competition, such as \"A\" or \"AA\" rated shows in the United States, or the international \"Grand Prix\" circuit, present more technical and complex courses. Not only is the height and width (\"spread\") of an obstacle increased to present a greater challenge, technical difficulty also increases with tighter turns and shorter or unusual distances between fences. Horses sometimes also have to jump fences from an angle rather than straight on. For example, a course designer might set up a line so that there are six and a half strides (the standard measure for a canter stride is twelve feet) between the jumps, requiring the rider to adjust the horse's stride dramatically in order to make the distance.\n\nUnlike [[show hunter]] classes, which reward calmness and style, jumper classes require boldness, scope, power, accuracy, and control; speed also is a factor, especially in jump-off courses and speed classes (when time counts even in the first round). The first round of the class consists of the rider and horse have to go around the course without refusing or knocking down any jumps while also staying within the time allowed. If the horse/rider combination completes the first round successfully, then they move on to the second round, called the \"jump-off\". In a jump-off, the rider needs to plan ahead of time because they need to be very speedy and also not have any faults. The jump-off has fewer jumps than the first round but is usually much more difficult. To win this round, the rider has to be the quickest while still not refusing or knocking down any jumps. The rider and the horse also have to be a minimum age to enter competitions such as the Olympics, Olympics age required for you is 18 and for your horse is 9\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Wocklum-Turnierplatz4-Asio.JPG|thumb|The jumping course in [[Balve]]]]\n\nShowjumping is a relatively new [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport. Until the [[Inclosure Acts]], which came into force in [[England]] in the 18th century, there had been little need for horses to jump fences routinely, but with this act of Parliament came new challenges for those who followed foxhounds. The Inclosure Acts brought fencing and boundaries to many parts of the country as common ground was dispersed amongst separate owners. This meant that those wishing to pursue their sport now needed horses that were capable of jumping these obstacles.\n\nIn the early horse shows held in [[France]], there was a parade of competitors who then took off across country for the jumping. This sport was, however, not popular with spectators since they could not follow to watch the jumping. Thus, it was not long before fences began to appear in an arena for the competitions. This became known as ''Lepping''. 1869 was the year \u2018horse leaping\u2019 came to prominence at [[Royal Dublin Society|Dublin]] horse show.<ref>[http://dublinhorseshow.com/history/dublin-horse-show-history History of Dublin Horse Show] - Dublin Horse Show website</ref> Fifteen years later, ''Lepping'' competitions were brought to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and by 1900 most of the more important shows had ''Lepping'' classes. Separate classes were held for women riding [[sidesaddle]].\n\nAt this time, the principal cavalry schools of Europe at Pinerolo and Tor-di-Quinto in Italy, the French school in Saumur, and the Spanish school in Vienna all preferred to use a very deep seat with long stirrups when jumping. While this style of riding may have felt more secure for the rider, it also impeded the freedom of the horse to use its body to the extent needed to clear large obstacles.\n\nAn Italian riding instructor, [[Captain Federico Caprilli]], heavily influenced the world of jumping with his ideas promoting a forward position with shorter stirrups. This style placed the rider in a position that did not interfere with the balance of the horse while negotiating obstacles. This style, now known as the [[jumping position|forward seat]], is commonly used today. The deep, [[Dressage]]-style seat, while useful for riding on the flat and in conditions where control of the horse is of greater importance than freedom of movement, is less suitable for jumping.\n\nThe first major show jumping competition held in England was at Olympia in 1907. Most of the competitors were members of the military and it became clear at this competition and in the subsequent years, that there was no uniformity of rules for the sport. Judges marked on their own opinions. Some marked according to the severity of the obstacle and others marked according to style. Before 1907 there were no penalties for a refusal and the competitor was sometimes asked to miss the fence to please the spectators. The first courses were built with little imagination, many consisting of only a straight bar fence and a water jump. A meeting was arranged in 1923 which led to the formation of the [[BSJA]] in 1925. In the United States, a similar need for national rules for jumping and other equestrian activities led to the formation of the [[American Horse Shows Association]] in 1917, which now is known as the [[United States Equestrian Federation]].\n\nAn early form of show jumping first was incorporated into the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1900. Show jumping in its current format appeared in 1912 and has thrived ever since, its recent popularity due in part to its suitability as a spectator sport that is well adapted for viewing on television.\n\n==Original scoring tariff==\n\n[[Image:Reco vet x-1-.jpg|right|thumb|Riders walking a course]]\nThe original list of faults introduced in Great Britain in 1925 was as follows:\n* [[Refusal (horse)|Refusing]] or [[Refusal (horse)|Running out]] at any fence:\n:1st: 4 faults\n:2nd: another 4 faults added on\n:3rd: elimination (ELM)\n:(At first, stadium jumps were set as a single rail that sometimes would be up to five feet high. Some horses began to duck under these jumps instead, which perhaps is the origin of the term \"ducking out\" at a fence.)\n* Fall of the horse, the rider, or both: elimination\n* Touches: If a horse touched a fence without knocking it down, zero faults\n* Rail down with front hooves: 4 faults\n* Rail down with back hooves: 4 faults\n* Foot in the water jump: If a horse lands with any number of feet in the water: 4 faults. No faults were incurred, however, if the raised block in front of the water was knocked down.\n* Failure to break the timers starting or finishing would result in elimination.\nWater jumps were once at least 15 feet (5 m) wide, although the water often had drained out of them by the time the last competitor jumped. High jumping would start with a pole at around five feet high, but this was later abandoned since many horses went under the pole. It was for this reason that more poles were added and fillers came into use. Time penalties were not counted until 1917.\n\n== Modern rules ==\n[[Image:Zrzutka.gif|thumb|This knockdown will incur 4 penalties or \"faults\"]]\n\nRules have evolved since then, with different national federations having different classes and rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usef.org/|title=US Equestrian|publisher=}}</ref> The international governing body for most major show jumping competitions is the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00c9questre Internationale]] (FEI).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fei.org/|title=FEI.org|website=FEI.org}}</ref> The two most common types of penalties are jumping penalties and time penalties.\n* Jumping Penalties: Jumping penalties are assessed for [[Refusal (horse)|refusals]] and knockdowns, with each refusal or knockdown adding four faults to a competitor's score.\n* Penalties for knockdowns are imposed only when the knockdown changes the height or width of the jump. If a horse or rider knocks down a bottom or middle rail while still clearing the height of the obstacle, providing the rails are directly underneath the top rail, they receive no penalties. Penalties are assessed at the open water when any of the horse's feet touch the water or white tape marking its boundary. If a rail is set over the middle of the water, faults are not accumulated for landing in the water.\n* Refusals: Refusals now are penalized four faults, up from three. Within the last several years, the FEI has decreased the number of refusals resulting in elimination from three to two, and this rule has trickled down from the top levels of FEI competition to other levels of horse shows in the US, however, in such places as Australia, lower levels (below 1.15m usually) may still have the 3 refusals and elimination rule.\n* A refusal that results in the destruction of the integrity of a jump (running into the fence instead of jumping it, displacing poles, gates, flowers, or large clumps of turf or dirt) will not receive four faults for the knockdown, but instead the four faults for refusal and an additional penalty while the timer is stopped for the repair or replacement of the jump. A refusal inside a [[combination (jump)|combination]] (a series of two or more fences with one or two strides between each element) must re-jump the entire combination.\n* Time Penalties: In the past, a common timing rule was a 1/4 second penalty for each second or fraction of a second over the time allowed. Since the early 2000s, this rule was changed by the FEI so that each second or fraction of a second over the time allowed would result in a 1-time penalty (e.g. with a time allowed of 72 seconds, a time of 73.09 seconds would result in 2-time faults).\n* [[combination (jump)|Combinations]]: A refusal at any of the jumps in combination results in the horse having to repeat the entire set of obstacles in the designated order of succession, not just the element refused. So a horse may jump \"A\" and \"B\" without issue but have a refusal at the third fence (C), at which time the rider would have to circle and return to jump fence \"A\" again, giving the horse a second chance to refuse or knock down \"A\" and \"B\". Despite being considered one obstacle, each element may result in penalty points if knocked down. Therefore, if each of the three fences in a triple combination were knocked down, the rider would receive 12 faults (4 per fence, instead of 4 faults for the entire obstacle. \"In and out\" is the informal name designated to combinations with only two elements such as \"A\" and \"B\", and not specific enough for a 3-jump combination.<!--\"in and out\" is the informal name designated to combinations with only two elements such as \"A\" and \"B\", and not specific enough for a 3-jump combination-->\n\n==Tack==\n{{See also|English saddle|Bridle}}\n[[Image:Jkassel IMG 4581 923006 hc.jpg|thumb|Common show jumping tack: jumping saddle, open-front boots, running martingale, and figure-8 noseband]]\n\nShowjumping competitors use a very forward style of [[English saddle]], most often the \"close contact\" design, which has a forward flap and a seat and cantle that is flatter than saddles designed for general all-purpose [[English riding]] or [[dressage]]. This construction allows greater freedom of movement for the rider when in [[jumping position]] and allows a shorter stirrup, allowing the rider to lighten the seat on the horse. Other saddles, such as those designed for [[dressage]], are intended for riders with a deep seat, can hinder a rider over large fences, forcing them into a position that limits the horse's movement and may put the rider dangerously behind the movement of the horse.\n\nAt international levels, saddle pads are usually white and square in shape, allowing the pair to display a sponsorship, national flag, or breeding affiliation. In contrast, riders in [[show hunter]]s and [[equitation]] often use \"fitted\" fleece pads that are the same shape as the saddle. [[Girth (tack)|Girths]] vary in type, but usually have a contour to give room for the horse's elbows, and many have belly guards to protect the underside of the horse from its [[Caulkin|shoe studs]] when the front legs are tightly folded under.\n\n[[Bridle]]s may be used with any style of cavesson [[noseband]], and there are few rules regarding the severity of this equipment. The figure-8 cavesson is the most popular type. Bits may also vary in severity, and competitors may use any bit, or even a \"[[bitless bridle]]\" or a [[mechanical hackamore]]. The ground jury at the show has the right, however, based on veterinary advice, to refuse a bit or bridling scheme if it could cause harm to the horse.\n\nBoots and wraps are worn by almost all horses, due to the fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight turns at speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, because they provide protection for the delicate tendons that run down the back of the leg, but still allow the horse to feel a rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the rear legs, primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.\n\n[[Martingale (tack)|Martingales]] are very common, especially on horses used at the Grand Prix level. The majority of jumpers are ridden in running martingales since these provide the most freedom over fences. Although a standing martingale (a strap connecting directly to the horse's noseband) is commonly seen on [[show hunter]]s and may be helpful in keeping a horse from throwing its head up, it also may be quite dangerous in the event of a stumble, restricting a horse from using its head to regain its balance. For this reason, standing martingales are not used in show jumping or [[eventing]]. [[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]] also are common, used to keep the saddle in place as the horse goes over large fences.\n\n==Rider attire==\n[[File:2008 Olympic equestrian jumping gold medalists.jpg|thumb|2008 Olympic equestrian jumping gold medalists Beezie Madden and Will Simpson]]\nRider attire may be somewhat less formal than that used in [[hunt seat|hunter]] riding. An approved ASTM/SEI [[equestrian helmet]] with a harness is always required, however, and is a practical necessity to protect the rider's head in the event of a fall. Tall boots are required, usually black. Spurs are optional but commonly used. Breeches are traditional in color, usually white, tan, or beige. At approved competitions, depending on sanctioning organization, a dark-colored coat usually is worn (although under the rules of the [[United States Equestrian Federation|USEF]] tweed or wash jackets are allowed in the summer and lighter colors are currently in fashion), with a light-colored (usually white) ratcatcher-style shirt and either a choker or [[stock tie]]. In hot summer weather, many riders wear a simple short-sleeved \"polo\" style shirt with helmet, boots, and breeches, and even where coats are required, the judges may waive the coat rule in extremely hot weather. Gloves, usually black, are optional, as is the plaiting of the horse's mane and tail.\n\nAt [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] Grand Prix levels, the dress is more strictly controlled. Riders must wear white or light-colored shirts, white ties or chokers, black or brown boots, white or light fawn breeches, and red or black jackets. Members of the military, police forces, and national studs, however, retain the right to wear their service uniforms instead of FEI-prescribed dress.<ref>{{cite book|title=FEI Jump Rules 24th Edition |year=2013 |publisher=FEI |page=58 |url=http://fei.org/sites/default/files/JumpRules_24thEd_2013_clean_updated_1.2.13.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504092020/http://fei.org/sites/default/files/JumpRules_24thEd_2013_clean_updated_1.2.13.pdf |archivedate=May 4, 2013 }}</ref>  In some circumstances, members of international teams may wear jackets in their country's respective colors or add national insignia.\n\n==Types of competition==\n[[Image:Hampton-classic1.jpg|thumb|Grand Prix Competition]]\n\n* Grand Prix: the highest level of show jumping. Run under [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI) rules, the horse jumps a course of 10 to 16 obstacles, with heights up to {{convert|1.6|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} and spreads of up to {{convert|2.0|m}}. Grand Prix-level show jumping competitions include the [[Olympics]], the [[World Equestrian Games]], and other series of internationally ranked events. Grand Prix show jumping is normally referred to collectively as five-star [[Concours de Saut International]] (CSI) rules.\n* Speed derby\n* [[Puissance]]: a high-jump competition in which the final wall may reach over seven feet tall. The current, (April 2013), the world record is {{convert|2.47|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, held by Captain Alberto Larraguibel Morales riding Huaso, in 1949.\n* Six-bar: riders jump six fences set in a straight line. In most places, fences are placed at equal distances apart, the first fence is the lowest and each subsequent fence is higher than the one before. Horses either are penalized or eliminated from the competition if they knock down a rail. After each round where more than one competitor goes \"clean,\" or is tied for the fewest faults, the six fences are raised in height for each subsequent round until there is a winner. Occasionally, if there are multiple jump-offs, the final fences may be raised to well over six feet.\n* Gambler's choice/accumulator: An event where exhibitors choose their own course, with each fence cleared worth a given number of points based on difficulty. The entry who accumulates the most points within a set time limit on the course is the winner.\n* Calcutta: A jumping event where spectators bet on which horse will win by means of an auction where the highest bidder has the exclusive bet on a given horse. Although the exact mechanism varies by region and culture, as a rule, the spectator who bets on the winner collects all money bet and then splits the purse with the owner of the winning horse.\n* Maiden, novice, and limit: Jumping classes limited to horses with fewer than one, three, or six wins. Fences are usually lower and time limits more generous.\n* Match race or double slalom: two identical courses are set up in a split arena, and two horses jump over the courses in a timed competition.\n* Touch class: A class held much as a normal show jumping class, except that if the horse touches the jump it is considered four faults.\n* Faults converted: A class in which any faults are converted into seconds on the clock, usually at the rate of 1 second per fault (i.e., one rail = 4 seconds)\n\n==Types of show jumps==\n{{Main|Horse jumping obstacles}}\nShow jumping fences often are colorful, sometimes very elaborate and artistic in design, particularly at the highest levels of competition. Fences are designed to break away if stuck by the horse, both to simplify scoring, but also for safety, particularly to prevent falls by the horse. Types of jumps used include the following:\n[[Image:Surrey county show 20040531.jpg|thumb|An oxer \u2013 England, 2004]]\n[[Image:Roulett1.jpg|thumb|A Liverpool \u2013 California, USA, 2005]]\n\n* Vertical (or upright) \u2013 a jump that consists of poles or planks placed one directly above another with no spread, or width, to jump\n* [[Oxer]] \u2013 two verticals close together, to make the jump wider, also called a spread\n** Square oxer (sometimes known as Box Oxer): both top poles are of an equal height\n** Ascending oxer (usually called a Ramped Oxer): the furthest pole is higher than the first\n** Descending oxer (usually called an Offset Oxer): the furthest pole is lower than the closest\n** Swedish oxer: the poles slant in opposite directions, so that they appear to form an \"X\" shape when seen head on\n* Triple bar \u2013 is a spread fence using three elements of graduating heights\n* Cross rail \u2013 not commonly used in sanctioned horse shows, and sometimes called a \"cross-pole,\" two poles crossed with one end of each pole being on the ground and on jump standards so that the center is lower than the sides; used at small shows and for schooling purposes to help the horse jump in the center of the fence\n* Wall \u2013 this type of jump usually is made to resemble a brick wall, but the \"bricks\" are constructed of a lightweight material and fall easily when knocked\n* Hogsback \u2013 a type of spread fence with three rails where the tallest pole is in the center\n* Filler \u2013 this is not a type of fence, but is a solid part below the poles, such as flower boxes or a rolltop; it also may be a gate\n* [[Combination (jump)|Combination]] \u2013 usually two or three jumps in a row, with no more than two strides between each; two jumps in a row are called double combinations, and three jumps in a row are called triple combinations (if a horse refuses the second or third element in one of these combinations, they must jump the whole combination again, not just any obstacle missed)\n* Fan: the rails on one side of the fence are spread out by standards, making the fence take the shape of a fan when viewed from above\n* [[Water (obstacle)|Open water]]: a wide ditch of water\n* [[Water (obstacle)|Liverpool]]: a ditch or large tray of water under a vertical or oxer\n* Joker \u2013 a tricky fence comprising only a rustic (or unpainted) rail and two wings wherein the lack of filler makes it difficult for a horse to judge their proximity to the fence as well as the fence's height, making it a tricky obstacle usually found only in the upper divisions, and illegal in some competitions\n[[Image:Blenheim Horse Trials 3.jpg|thumb]]\n* brush jump - a jump that has brush or faux grass on the top of it. Normally, the horse is able to see over the top of it and most of the time the horse's belly will hit the grass on top. These jumps have a cut out in the middle and brush on the side. There may be a fence or log on the bottom of the jump. The jump could be anywhere from 2\u20135&nbsp;ft tall. The jump also may be wide, causing the horse to stretch out its legs and chest.\n\nAt international level competitions that are governed by FEI rules, fence heights begin at {{convert|1.50|m}}.<!--need to source to FEI rules here, sooner or later... -->  Other competition levels are given different names in different nations, but are based primarily on the height and spread of fences\n\nIn the United States, jumping levels range from 0\u20139 as follows:\n'''USEF Jumper Levels'''\n* Level 0.

Many [[list of horse breeds|breeds]] of horses have been successful show jumpers, and even some [[grade horse]]s of uncertain breeding have been champions. Most show jumpers are tall horses, over {{hands|16}}, usually of [[Warmblood]] or [[Thoroughbred]] breeding, though horses as small as {{hands|14.1}} have been on the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] teams of various nations and carried riders to Olympic and other international medals. There is no correlation between the size of a horse and its athletic ability, nor do tall horses necessarily have an advantage when jumping. Nonetheless, a taller horse may make a fence appear less daunting to the rider.<ref>Barakat, Christine. \"Why Size Matters.\"  ''Equus,'' October 2007, Issue 361, pp. 36\u201342</ref>\n\n[[Pony|Ponies]] also compete in show jumping competitions in many countries, usually in classes limited to youth riders, defined as those under the age of 16 or 18 years, depending on the sanctioning organization. Pony-sized horses may, on occasion, compete in open competition with adult riders. The most famous example was [[Stroller (horse)|Stroller]], who only stood {{hands|14.1}} but was nonetheless an Individual silver medal winner and part of the Great Britain show jumping team in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], jumping one of the few clean rounds in the competition.

Jumping classes are commonly seen at [[horse show]]s throughout the world, including the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. Sometimes shows are limited exclusively to jumpers, sometimes jumper classes are offered in conjunction with other English-style events, and sometimes show jumping is but one division of very large, all-breed competitions that include a very wide variety of disciplines. Jumping classes may be governed by various national horse show sanctioning organizations, such as the [[United States Equestrian Federation]] in the [[United States|USA]] or the [[British Showjumping Association]] in [[Great Britain]]. International competitions are governed by the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI, from the body's French name of ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00c9questre Internationale'').\n\n==Hunters or jumpers==\n{{See also|Show hunter|Show hunter (British)}}\n[[File:R3DE StadiumJump.jpg|right|thumb|Proper show jumping attire, as seen in the show jumping phase of a three-day event. Attire at an event includes a mandatory armband as seen here, although the armband is not required in general show jumping.]]\n\nShow jumping events have [[show hunter|hunter]] classes, jumper classes and hunt seat equitation classes.\n\nHunters are judged subjectively on the degree to which they meet an ideal standard of manners, style, and movement. This includes flowing, sweeping movement of the horse, and an ideal hunter should jump with square knees that are tucked-in tightly and a rounded neck. Hunters' appearance should tend toward quiet and soft to give the appearance of effortless grace, and the horse's tack and the rider's attire should be conservative so that nothing detracts from the horse's performance. The horse's tack [[bit (horse)|bits]], [[bridle]]s, [[Crop (implement)|crops]], [[spur]]s, and [[martingale (tack)|martingales]] is tightly regulated because the goal is to showcase the horse's natural ability, and excessive tack takes away from this. Hunters are not allowed to wear boots or polos on their legs when competing to show the judges their fluid movement. Show hunters should be immaculately groomed with their manes and tails neatly braided to emphasize tradition, as well as their beauty and athleticism. Hunter courses are generally simplistic and the jumps are made out of natural-looking materials to represent the sport's fox-hunting origin.\n\nConversely, jumper classes are scored objectively, based entirely on a numerical score determined only by whether the horse attempts the obstacle, clears it, and finishes the course in the allotted time. Every rail that is knocked down during competition results in a 4 fault penalty. There are also time limits per course and failure to be under the time allowed results in a time fault every second over. Jumper courses tend to be much more complex and technical than hunter courses to test the rider's and the horse's skill and athleticism, and jumper jumps are often made with bright colors and are built to look airy instead solid. An ideal jumper is fast, agile, athletic, and brave; the horse's appearance is not near as important as their athletic ability. In jumper classes, the fence heights can be much taller than in hunters or equitation, so to compete at the top level, a horse's jumping ability is the primary focus. Because jumpers are not judged on the horse or rider's appearance, there are fewer restrictions on tack and rider apparel. Many riders will select tack and apparel that match their barn or company's colors as a way to indicate that is who they ride for. However, horses should still be thoroughly groomed and riders should be professional and tasteful with their attire; major events do have specific rules regarding what is permitted. As  show jumping is a large international's sport, it is an event in the summer Olympics.\n\nIn addition to hunters and jumpers, there are [[equitation]] classes, sometimes called [[hunt seat]] equitation, which judges the ability of the rider. The equipment, clothing, and fence styles used in equitation more closely resemble hunter classes, although the technical difficulty of the courses may more closely resemble showjumping events. This is because both disciplines are designed to test the rider's ability to control the horse through a difficult course consisting of rollbacks, [[Combination (jump)|combinations]], and higher obstacles. Equitation is geared towards junior riders (under 18) as a way to promote disciplined and technical riding abilities, but there are equitation classes for adults as well. In the fall, there are four main equitation championships which include the [[USET]] Talent Search Final, the USEF Dover Hunt Seat Medal Final, the Washington International Horse Show Equitation Championship,  and the [[ASPCA]] Maclay Equitation Championship. Winners of these events often go on to become prominent competitors in the equestrian world; equitation classes serve as an important foundation for high-level riding.\n\n==Rules==\n[[Image:Piste2-1-.JPG|thumb|A show jumping course]]\n[[Image:Rolex panorama.jpg|thumb|Show Jump Course]]\n[[Image:ShowJumpCourse.gif|thumb|Diagram of a show jumping course]]\n\nJumper classes are held over a course of show jumping obstacles, including verticals, spreads, and double and triple [[Combination (jump)|combinations]], usually with many turns and changes of direction. The intent is to jump cleanly over a set course within an allotted time. Time faults are assessed for exceeding the time allowance. Jumping faults are incurred for knockdowns and blatant disobedience, such as refusals (when the horse stops before a fence or \"runs out\") (''see \"Modern rules\" below''). Horses are allowed a limited number of refusals before being disqualified. A refusal may lead to a rider exceeding the time allowed on course. Placings are based on the lowest number of points or \"faults\" accumulated. A horse and rider who have not accumulated any jumping faults or penalty points are said to have scored a \"clear round\". Tied entries usually have a jump-off over a raised and shortened course, and the course is timed; if entries are tied for faults accumulated in the jump-off, the fastest time wins.\n\nIn most competitions, riders are allowed to walk the initial course but not the jump-off course (usually the same course with missing jumps, e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or the same course but timed) before competition to plan their ride. Walking the course before the event is a chance for the rider to walk the lines he or she will have to ride, in order to decide how many strides the horse will need to take between each jump and from which angle. Going off course will cost time if minor errors are made and major departures will result in disqualification.\n\nThe higher levels of competition, such as \"A\" or \"AA\" rated shows in the United States, or the international \"Grand Prix\" circuit, present more technical and complex courses. Not only is the height and width (\"spread\") of an obstacle increased to present a greater challenge, technical difficulty also increases with tighter turns and shorter or unusual distances between fences. Horses sometimes also have to jump fences from an angle rather than straight on. For example, a course designer might set up a line so that there are six and a half strides (the standard measure for a canter stride is twelve feet) between the jumps, requiring the rider to adjust the horse's stride dramatically in order to make the distance.\n\nUnlike [[show hunter]] classes, which reward calmness and style, jumper classes require boldness, scope, power, accuracy, and control; speed also is a factor, especially in jump-off courses and speed classes (when time counts even in the first round). The first round of the class consists of the rider and horse having to go around the course without refusing or knocking down any jumps while also staying within the time allowed. If the horse/rider combination completes the first round successfully, then they move on to the second round, called the \"jump-off\". In a jump-off, the rider needs to plan ahead of time because they need to be very speedy and also not have any faults. The jump-off has fewer jumps than the first round but is usually much more difficult. To win this round, the rider has to be the quickest while still not refusing or knocking down any jumps.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Wocklum-Turnierplatz4-Asio.JPG|thumb|The jumping course in [[Balve]]]]\n\nShow jumping is a relatively new [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport. Until the [[Inclosure Acts]], which came into force in [[England]] in the 18th century, there had been little need for horses to jump fences routinely, but with this act of Parliament came new challenges for those who followed fox hounds. The Inclosure Acts brought fencing and boundaries to many parts of the country as common ground was dispersed amongst separate owners. This meant that those wishing to pursue their sport now needed horses that were capable of jumping these obstacles.\n\nIn the early horse shows held in [[France]], there was a parade of competitors who then took off across country for the jumping. This sport was, however, not popular with spectators since they could not follow to watch the jumping. Thus, it was not long before fences began to appear in an arena for the competitions. This became known as ''Lepping''. 1869 was the year \u2018horse leaping\u2019 came to prominence at [[Royal Dublin Society|Dublin]] horse show.<ref>[http://dublinhorseshow.com/history/dublin-horse-show-history History of Dublin Horse Show] - Dublin Horse Show website</ref> Fifteen years later, ''Lepping'' competitions were brought to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and by 1900 most of the more important shows had ''Lepping'' classes. Separate classes were held for women riding [[sidesaddle]].\n\nAt this time, the principal cavalry schools of Europe at Pinerolo and Tor-di-Quinto in Italy, the French school in Saumur, and the Spanish school in Vienna all preferred to use a very deep seat with long stirrups when jumping. While this style of riding may have felt more secure for the rider, it also impeded the freedom of the horse to use its body to the extent needed to clear large obstacles.\n\nAn Italian riding instructor, [[Captain Federico Caprilli]], heavily influenced the world of jumping with his ideas promoting a forward position with shorter stirrups. This style placed the rider in a position that did not interfere with the balance of the horse while negotiating obstacles. This style, now known as the [[jumping position|forward seat]], is commonly used today. The deep, [[Dressage]]-style seat, while useful for riding on the flat and in conditions where control of the horse is of greater importance than freedom of movement, is less suitable for jumping.\n\nThe first major show jumping competition held in England was at Olympia in 1907. Most of the competitors were members of the military and it became clear at this competition and in the subsequent years, that there was no uniformity of rules for the sport. Judges marked on their own opinions. Some marked according to the severity of the obstacle and others marked according to style. Before 1907 there were no penalties for a refusal and the competitor was sometimes asked to miss the fence to please the spectators. The first courses were built with little imagination, many consisting of only a straight bar fence and a water jump. A meeting was arranged in 1923 which led to the formation of the [[BSJA]] in 1925. In the United States, a similar need for national rules for jumping and other equestrian activities led to the formation of the [[American Horse Shows Association]] in 1917, which now is known as the [[United States Equestrian Federation]].\n\nAn early form of show jumping first was incorporated into the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1900. Show jumping in its current format appeared in 1912 and has thrived ever since, its recent popularity due in part to its suitability as a spectator sport that is well adapted for viewing on television.\n\n==Original scoring tariff==\n\n[[Image:Reco vet x-1-.jpg|right|thumb|Riders walking a course]]\nThe original list of faults introduced in Great Britain in 1925 was as follows:\n* [[Refusal (horse)|Refusing]] or [[Refusal (horse)|Running out]] at any fence:\n:1st: 4 faults\n:2nd: another 4 faults added on\n:3rd: elimination (ELM)\n:(At first, stadium jumps were set as a single rail that sometimes would be up to five feet high. Some horses began to duck under these jumps instead, which perhaps is the origin of the term \"ducking out\" at a fence.)\n* Fall of the horse, the rider, or both: elimination\n* Touches: If a horse touched a fence without knocking it down, zero faults\n* Rail down with front hooves: 4 faults\n* Rail down with back hooves: 4 faults\n* Foot in the water jump: If a horse lands with any number of feet in the water: 4 faults. No faults were incurred, however, if the raised block in front of the water was knocked down.\n* Failure to break the timers starting or finishing would result in elimination.\nWater jumps were once at least 15 feet (5 m) wide, although the water often had drained out of them by the time the last competitor jumped. High jumping would start with a pole at around five feet high, but this was later abandoned since many horses went under the pole. It was for this reason that more poles were added and fillers came into use. Time penalties were not counted until 1917.\n\n== Modern rules ==\n[[Image:Zrzutka.gif|thumb|This knockdown will incur 4 penalties or \"faults\"]]\n\nRules have evolved since then, with different national federations having different classes and rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usef.org/|title=US Equestrian|publisher=}}</ref> The international governing body for most major show jumping competitions is the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00c9questre Internationale]] (FEI).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fei.org/|title=FEI.org|website=FEI.org}}</ref> The two most common types of penalties are jumping penalties and time penalties.\n* Jumping Penalties: Jumping penalties are assessed for [[Refusal (horse)|refusals]] and knockdowns, with each refusal or knockdown adding four faults to a competitor's score.\n* Penalties for knockdowns are imposed only when the knockdown changes the height or width of the jump. If a horse or rider knocks down a bottom or middle rail while still clearing the height of the obstacle, providing the rails are directly underneath the top rail, they receive no penalties. Penalties are assessed at the open water when any of the horse's feet touch the water or white tape marking its boundary. If a rail is set over the middle of the water, faults are not accumulated for landing in the water.\n* Refusals: Refusals now are penalized four faults, up from three. Within the last several years, the FEI has decreased the number of refusals resulting in elimination from three to two, and this rule has trickled down from the top levels of FEI competition to other levels of horse shows in the US, however in such places as Australia, lower levels (below 1.15m usually) may still have the 3 refusals and elimination rule.\n* A refusal that results in the destruction of the integrity of a jump (running into the fence instead of jumping it, displacing poles, gates, flowers, or large clumps of turf or dirt) will not receive four faults for the knockdown, but instead the four faults for a refusal and an additional penalty while the timer is stopped for the repair or replacement of the jump. A refusal inside a [[combination (jump)|combination]] (a series of two or more fences with one or two strides between each element) must re-jump the entire combination.\n* Time Penalties: In the past, a common timing rule was a 1/4 second penalty for each second or fraction of a second over the time allowed. Since the early 2000s, this rule was changed by the FEI so that each second or fraction of a second over the time allowed would result in 1 time penalty (e.g. with a time allowed of 72 seconds, a time of 73.09 seconds would result in 2 time faults).\n* [[combination (jump)|Combinations]]: A refusal at any of the jumps in combination results in the horse having to repeat the entire set of obstacles in the designated order of succession, not just the element refused. So a horse may jump \"A\" and \"B\" without issue but have a refusal at the third fence (C), at which time the rider would have to circle and return to jump fence \"A\" again, giving the horse a second chance to refuse or knock down \"A\" and \"B\". Despite being considered one obstacle, each element may result in penalty points if knocked down. Therefore, if each of the three fences in a triple combination were knocked down, the rider would receive 12 faults (4 per fence, instead of 4 faults for the entire obstacle. \"In and out\" is the informal name designated to combinations with only two elements such as \"A\" and \"B\", and not specific enough for a 3-jump combination.<!--\"in and out\" is the informal name designated to combinations with only two elements such as \"A\" and \"B\", and not specific enough for a 3-jump combination-->\n\n==Tack==\n{{See also|English saddle|Bridle}}\n[[Image:Jkassel IMG 4581 923006 hc.jpg|thumb|Common show jumping tack: jumping saddle, open-front boots, running martingale, and figure-8 noseband]]\n\nShow jumping competitors use a very forward style of [[English saddle]], most often the \"close contact\" design, which has a forward flap and a seat and cantle that is flatter than saddles designed for general all-purpose [[English riding]] or [[dressage]]. This construction allows greater freedom of movement for the rider when in [[jumping position]] and allows a shorter stirrup, allowing the rider to lighten the seat on the horse. Other saddles, such as those designed for [[dressage]], are intended for riders with a deep seat, can hinder a rider over large fences, forcing them into a position that limits the horse's movement and may put the rider dangerously behind the movement of the horse.\n\nAt international levels, saddle pads are usually white and square in shape, allowing the pair to display a sponsorship, national flag, or breeding affiliation. In contrast, riders in [[show hunter]]s and [[equitation]] often use \"fitted\" fleece pads that are the same shape as the saddle. [[Girth (tack)|Girths]] vary in type, but usually have a contour to give room for the horse's elbows, and many have belly guards to protect the underside of the horse from its [[Caulkin|shoe studs]] when the front legs are tightly folded under.\n\n[[Bridle]]s may be used with any style of cavesson [[noseband]], and there are few rules regarding the severity of this equipment. The figure-8 cavesson is the most popular type. Bits may also vary in severity, and competitors may use any bit, or even a \"[[bitless bridle]]\" or a [[mechanical hackamore]]. The ground jury at the show has the right, however, based on veterinary advice, to refuse a bit or bridling scheme if it could cause harm to the horse.\n\nBoots and wraps are worn by almost all horses, due to the fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight turns at speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, because they provide protection for the delicate tendons that run down the back of the leg, but still allow the horse to feel a rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the rear legs, primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.\n\n[[Martingale (tack)|Martingales]] are very common, especially on horses used at the Grand Prix level. The majority of jumpers are ridden in running martingales since these provide the most freedom over fences. Although a standing martingale (a strap connecting directly to the horse's noseband) is commonly seen on [[show hunter]]s and may be helpful in keeping a horse from throwing its head up, it also may be quite dangerous in the event of a stumble, restricting a horse from using its head to regain its balance. For this reason, standing martingales are not used in show jumping or [[eventing]]. [[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]] also are common, used to keep the saddle in place as the horse goes over large fences.\n\n==Rider attire==\n[[File:2008 Olympic equestrian jumping gold medalists.jpg|thumb|2008 Olympic equestrian jumping gold medalists Beezie Madden and Will Simpson]]\nRider attire may be somewhat less formal than that used in [[hunt seat|hunter]] riding. An approved ASTM/SEI [[equestrian helmet]] with a harness is always required, however, and is a practical necessity to protect the rider's head in the event of a fall. Tall boots are required, usually black. Spurs are optional, but commonly used. Breeches are traditional in color, usually white, tan, or beige. At approved competitions, depending on sanctioning organization, a dark-colored coat usually is worn (although under the rules of the [[United States Equestrian Federation|USEF]] tweed or wash jackets are allowed in the summer and lighter colors are currently in fashion), with a light-colored (usually white) ratcatcher-style shirt and either a choker or [[stock tie]]. In hot summer weather, many riders wear a simple short-sleeved \"polo\" style shirt with helmet, boots and breeches, and even where coats are required, the judges may waive the coat rule in extremely hot weather. Gloves, usually black, are optional, as is the plaiting of the horse's mane and tail.\n\nAt [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] Grand Prix levels, dress is more strictly controlled. Riders must wear white or light-colored shirts, white ties or chokers, black or brown boots, white or light fawn breeches, and red or black jackets. Members of the military, police forces, and national studs, however, retain the right to wear their service uniforms instead of FEI-prescribed dress.<ref>{{cite book|title=FEI Jump Rules 24th Edition |year=2013 |publisher=FEI |page=58 |url=http://fei.org/sites/default/files/JumpRules_24thEd_2013_clean_updated_1.2.13.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504092020/http://fei.org/sites/default/files/JumpRules_24thEd_2013_clean_updated_1.2.13.pdf |archivedate=May 4, 2013 }}</ref>  In some circumstances, members of international teams may wear jackets in their country's respective colors or add national insignia.\n\n==Types of competition==\n[[Image:Hampton-classic1.jpg|thumb|Grand Prix Competition]]\n\n* Grand Prix: the highest level of show jumping. Run under [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI) rules, the horse jumps a course of 10 to 16 obstacles, with heights up to {{convert|1.6|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} and spreads of up to {{convert|2.0|m}}. Grand Prix-level show jumping competitions include the [[Olympics]], the [[World Equestrian Games]], and other series of internationally ranked events. Grand Prix show jumping is normally referred to collectively as five-star [[Concours de Saut International]] (CSI) rules.\n* Speed derby\n* [[Puissance]]: a high-jump competition in which the final wall may reach over seven feet tall. The current, (April 2013), world record is {{convert|2.47|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, held by Captain Alberto Larraguibel Morales riding Huaso, in 1949.\n* Six-bar: riders jump six fences set in a straight line. In most places, fences are placed at equal distances apart, the first fence is the lowest and each subsequent fence is higher than the one before. Horses either are penalized or eliminated from competition if they knock down a rail. After each round where more than one competitor goes \"clean,\" or is tied for the fewest faults, the six fences are raised in height for each subsequent round until there is a winner. Occasionally, if there are multiple jump-offs, the final fences may be raised to well over six feet.\n* Gambler's choice/accumulator: An event where exhibitors choose their own course, with each fence cleared worth a given number of points based on difficulty. The entry who accumulates the most points within a set time limit on course is the winner.\n* Calcutta: A jumping event where spectators bet on which horse will win by means of an auction where the highest bidder has the exclusive bet on a given horse. Although the exact mechanism varies by region and culture, as a rule, the spectator who bets on the winner collects all money bet and then splits the purse with the owner of the winning horse.\n* Maiden, novice, and limit: Jumping classes limited to horses with fewer than one, three, or six wins. Fences are usually lower and time limits more generous.\n* Match race or double slalom: two identical courses are set up in a split arena, and two horses jump over the courses in a timed competition.\n* Touch class: A class held much as a normal show jumping class, except that if the horse touches the jump it is considered four faults.\n* Faults converted: A class in which any faults are converted into seconds on the clock, usually at the rate of 1 second per fault (i.e., one rail = 4 seconds)\n\n==Types of show jumps==\n{{Main|Horse jumping obstacles}}\nShow jumping fences often are colorful, sometimes very elaborate and artistic in design, particularly at the highest levels of competition. Fences are designed to break away if stuck by the horse, both to simplify scoring, but also for safety, particularly to prevent falls by the horse. Types of jumps used include the following:\n[[Image:Surrey county show 20040531.jpg|thumb|An oxer \u2013 England, 2004]]\n[[Image:Roulett1.jpg|thumb|A Liverpool \u2013 California, USA, 2005]]\n\n* Vertical (or upright) \u2013 a jump that consists of poles or planks placed one directly above another with no spread, or width, to jump\n* [[Oxer]] \u2013 two verticals close together, to make the jump wider, also called a spread\n** Square oxer (sometimes known as Box Oxer): both top poles are of an equal height\n** Ascending oxer (usually called a Ramped Oxer): the furthest pole is higher than the first\n** Descending oxer (usually called an Offset Oxer): the furthest pole is lower than the closest\n** Swedish oxer: the poles slant in opposite directions, so that they appear to form an \"X\" shape when seen head on\n* Triple bar \u2013 is a spread fence using three elements of graduating heights\n* Cross rail \u2013 not commonly used in sanctioned horse shows, and sometimes called a \"cross-pole,\" two poles crossed with one end of each pole being on the ground and on jump standards so that the center is lower than the sides; used at small shows and for schooling purposes to help the horse jump in the center of the fence\n* Wall \u2013 this type of jump usually is made to resemble a brick wall, but the \"bricks\" are constructed of a lightweight material and fall easily when knocked\n* Hogsback \u2013 a type of spread fence with three rails where the tallest pole is in the center\n* Filler \u2013 this is not a type of fence, but is a solid part below the poles, such as flower boxes or a rolltop; it also may be a gate\n* [[Combination (jump)|Combination]] \u2013 usually two or three jumps in a row, with no more than two strides between each; two jumps in a row are called double combinations, and three jumps in a row are called triple combinations (if a horse refuses the second or third element in one of these combinations, they must jump the whole combination again, not just any obstacle missed)\n* Fan: the rails on one side of the fence are spread out by standards, making the fence take the shape of a fan when viewed from above\n* [[Water (obstacle)|Open water]]: a wide ditch of water\n* [[Water (obstacle)|Liverpool]]: a ditch or large tray of water under a vertical or oxer\n* Joker \u2013 a tricky fence comprising only a rustic (or unpainted) rail and two wings wherein the lack of filler makes it difficult for a horse to judge their proximity to the fence as well as the fence's height, making it a tricky obstacle usually found only in the upper divisions, and illegal in some competitions\n[[Image:Blenheim Horse Trials 3.jpg|thumb]]\n* brush jump - a jump that has brush or faux grass on the top of it. Normally, the horse is able to see over the top of it and most of the time the horse's belly will hit the grass on top. These jumps have a cut out in the middle and brush on the side. There may be a fence or log on the bottom of the jump. The jump could be anywhere from 2\u20135&nbsp;ft tall. The jump also may be wide, causing the horse to stretch out its legs and chest.\n\nAt international level competitions that are governed by FEI rules, fence heights begin at {{convert|1.50|m}}.<!--need to source to FEI rules here, sooner or later... -->  Other competition levels are given different names in different nations, but are based primarily on the height and spread of fences\n\nIn the United States, jumping levels range from 0\u20139 as follows:\n'''USEF Jumper Levels'''\n* Level 0.

Many [[list of horse breeds|breeds]] of horses have been successful show jumpers, and even some [[grade horse]]s of uncertain breeding have been champions. Most show jumpers are tall horses, over {{hands|16}}, usually of [[Warmblood]] or [[Thoroughbred]] breeding, though horses as small as {{hands|14.1}} have been on the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] teams of various nations and carried riders to Olympic and other international medals. There is no correlation between the size of a horse and its athletic ability, nor do tall horses necessarily have an advantage when jumping. Nonetheless, a taller horse may make a fence appear less daunting to the rider.<ref>Barakat, Christine. \"Why Size Matters.\"  ''Equus,'' October 2007, Issue 361, pp. 36\u201342</ref>\n\n[[Pony|Ponies]] also compete in show jumping competitions in many countries, usually in classes limited to youth riders, defined as those under the age of 16 or 18 years, depending on the sanctioning organization. Pony-sized horses may, on occasion, compete in open competition with adult riders. The most famous example was [[Stroller (horse)|Stroller]], who only stood {{hands|14.1}} but was nonetheless an Individual silver medal winner and part of the Great Britain show jumping team in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]], jumping one of the few clean rounds in the competition.

He and [[Jordan Peele]] were cast against each other, but both ended up being picked after demonstrating great comedic chemistry. Key played many characters on the show. One of his most famous characters is \"Coach Hines\", a high school sports coach who frequently disrupts and threatens students and faculty members. On the penultimate episode of ''Mad TV'', Hines revealed that he is the long-lost heir to the Heinz Ketchup company and only became a Catholic school coach to help delinquent teenagers like Yamanashi ([[Bobby Lee]]). During seasons 9 and 10, Key appeared as \"Dr. Funkenstein\" in blaxploitation parodies, with Peele playing the monster. Key also portrayed various guests on ''Real **********ing Talk'' like the strong African Rollo Johnson and blind victim Stevie Wonder Washington. He often goes \"backstage\" as Eugene Struthers, an ecstatic water-or-flower delivery man who accosts celebrities. There is also \"Jovan Muskatelle\", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap. He interrupts live news broadcasts by a reporter (always played by [[Ike Barinholtz]]), annoying him with rapid fire accounts of events that have happened frequently exclaiming \"It was crazy as hell!\" Celebrities that Key impersonated on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Roscoe Orman]] (as his character [[Gordon (Sesame Street)|Gordon]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''), [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Al Roker]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eddie Murphy]] (as his character James \"Thunder\" Early from the movie ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''), [[Sherman Hemsley]] (as his character George Jefferson on ''[[The Jeffersons]]''), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] (as [[Mohinder Suresh]]), [[Tyson Beckford]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] (originally played by Peele until Peele left the show at the end of season 13), [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Jack Haley]] (as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').

This orbit is commonly known as a \"[[geostationary transfer orbit]]\" or a \"geosynchronous transfer orbit\".

Born to a family of low status in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become a [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] commander of the Emperor [[Carus]]'s army. After the deaths of Carus and his son [[Numerian]] on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus's surviving son, [[Carinus]], but Diocletian defeated him in the [[Battle of the Margus]].\n\nDiocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He appointed fellow officer [[Maximian]] as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian reigned in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]], and [[Maximian]] reigned in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]]. Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing [[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] as [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], junior co-emperors, under himself and Maximian respectively. Under this '[[tetrarchy]]', or \"rule of four\", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the [[Sarmatia]]ns and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the [[Alamanni]] in 288, and usurpers in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favourable peace.\n\nDiocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in [[Nicomedia]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Sirmium]], and [[Trier|Trevorum]], closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome. Building on third-century trends towards [[Autocracy|absolutism]], he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.\n\nNot all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), his attempt to curb [[inflation]] via [[price controls]], was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|tetrarchic system collapsed]] after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of [[Maxentius]] and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] (303\u2013312), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official [[persecution of Christianity]], failed to eliminate Christianity in the empire; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Despite these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in [[Diocletian's Palace|his palace on the Dalmatian coast]], tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Salona - amphitheatre - panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|Panorama of amphitheatre in [[Salona]]]]\n\nDiocletian was born near [[Salona]] in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] ([[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in modern [[Croatia]]), some time around 244.<ref name=BIRTH/> His parents gave him the Greek name Diocles, or possibly Diocles Valerius.<ref>Aurelius Victor 39.1; Potter, 648.</ref> The modern historian [[Timothy Barnes]] takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate.

On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign ({{lang|lat|vicennalia}}), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (''[[decennalia]]''), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew impatient with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what [[Edward Gibbon]], following [[Lactantius]], calls \"licentious familiarity\".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', I, 153 and 712, note 92.</ref> The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303,<ref name=\"tkuqen\">Potter, 341.</ref> Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he did them in [[Ravenna]] on 1 January 304 instead.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24\u201325.</ref> There are suggestions in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' and Lactantius's account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome. Maximian, according to these accounts, swore to uphold Diocletian's plan in a ceremony in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]].<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 20.4; Southern, 152, 336.</ref>\n\nFrom Ravenna, Diocletian left for the Danube. There, possibly in Galerius's company, he took part in a campaign against the Carpi.<ref name=tkuqen/> He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November 304, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304\u20135 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumours alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, it appeared that he had finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it recovered after public declarations that Diocletian was still alive. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref>\n\nGalerius arrived in the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to reconstitute the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims that he had done the same to Maximian at Sirmium.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 18.1\u20137; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref> On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, {{convert|5|km|mi}} out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With tears in his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201327; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60; Odahl, 69\u201372; Potter, 341\u201342.</ref>\n\nMost in the crowd believed they knew what would follow; [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maxentius, the only adult sons of reigning emperors, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had travelled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and was present at the palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201326.</ref> In Lactantius's account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2\u20136; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.</ref> It was not to be: [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] were declared caesars. Maximinus appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.<ref>Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60\u201361; Odahl, 72\u201374; Southern, 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and death ===\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus342.png|thumb|left|Modern depiction of Diocletian in retirement]]\n\nDiocletian retired to his homeland, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. He moved into the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace]], a heavily fortified compound located by the small town of Spalatum on the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and near the large provincial administrative center of [[Salona]]. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], the second-largest city of modern [[Croatia]].\n\nMaximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.</ref> Their homes were distant from political life, but Diocletian and Maximian were close enough to remain in regular contact with each other.<ref>Southern, 152.</ref> Galerius assumed the consular ''fasces'' in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint [[Licinius]] to be Augustus in place of Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius's usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian's reply: \"If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.\"<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>\n\nHe lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 311.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318. Until recently, the date of 3 December 311 has been favoured; however, the absence of Diocletian on Maxentius's \"''AETERNA MEMORIA''\" coins would indicate that he was alive through to Maxentius's defeat in October 312.

In his policies, he enforced an Imperial system of values on diverse and often unreceptive provincial audiences.<ref>Potter, 298.</ref> In the Imperial propaganda from the period, recent history was perverted and minimized in the service of the theme of the tetrarchs as \"restorers\". Aurelian's achievements were ignored, the revolt of Carausius was backdated to the reign of Gallienus, and it was implied that the tetrarchs engineered Aurelian's defeat of the [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrenes]]; the period between Gallienus and Diocletian was effectively erased. The history of the empire before the tetrarchy was portrayed as a time of civil war, savage despotism, and imperial collapse.<ref name=oqujbw>Potter, 296\u201398.</ref> In those inscriptions that bear their names, Diocletian and his companions are referred to as \"restorers of the whole world\",<ref>''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 617, qtd. in Potter, 296.</ref> men who succeeded in \"defeating the nations of the barbarians, and confirming the tranquility of their world\".<ref>''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 641, qtd. in Potter, 296.</ref> Diocletian was written up as the \"founder of eternal peace\".<ref>''Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae'' 618, qtd. in Potter, 296.

The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus's ''[[primus inter pares]]'' were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves.

He destroyed the Augustan illusion of imperial government as a cooperative affair among emperor, army, and senate.<ref>Southern, 162\u201363.</ref> In its place he established an effectively autocratic structure, a shift later epitomized in the institution's name: it would be called a ''[[consistorium]]'', not a council.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 171\u201372; Southern, 162\u201363; Williams, 110.</ref>{{refn|The term ''consistorium'' was already in use for the room where council meetings took place.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 172, citing the ''Codex Justinianeus'' 9.47.12.</ref>|group=\"Note\"}} Diocletian regulated his court by distinguishing separate departments (''scrinia'') for different tasks.<ref>Southern, 162\u201363; Williams, 110.</ref> From this structure came the offices of different ''magistri'', like the ''[[magister officiorum]]'' (\"Master of Offices\"), and associated secretariats. These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards to the level of a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect \u2013 although a prefect like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general<ref>Williams, 107/108.</ref> \u2013 but the office retained much civil authority. The prefect kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian prefect was often second only to the emperor himself.<ref>Williams, 110.</ref>\n\nAltogether, Diocletian effected a large increase in the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.3, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.</ref> The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the [[civil service]] doubled from 15,000 to 30,000.<ref name=\"civil\">Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 19.</ref> The classicist [[Roger S. Bagnall]] estimated that there was one bureaucrat for every 5\u201310,000 people in Egypt based on 400 or 800 bureaucrats for 4 million inhabitants (no one knows the population of the province in 300 AD; Strabo 300 years earlier put it at 7.5 million, excluding Alexandria). (By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century [[Song dynasty]] China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50\u201365 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per [[Roman diocese|diocese]] depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13\u201315,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their ''comitatus'', with the praetorian prefects, or with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.<ref>Roger S.

Baltimore: JHU Press, 1979, {{ISBN|0-8018-2158-4}}, page 176</ref> \u2013 in Egypt, and on the frontier with Persia. Beyond that, much discussion is speculative and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources. Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement, and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims. The ''[[Strata Diocletiana]]'', built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of [[Bostra]], is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts \u2013 defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons \u2013 followed by further fortifications in the rear.<ref>Luttwak, 167; Campbell, \"The Army\" (CAH), 124\u201326; Southern, 154\u201355.

Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly.<ref>Southern, 158; Treadgold, 112\u201313.</ref> The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs.<ref name=lpnxzn>Southern, 159; Treadgold, 112\u201313.</ref> Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even given payment in kind in place of their salaries.<ref name=\"SSC159\">Southern, 159.</ref> Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt. Diocletian was led to devise a new system of taxation.<ref name=lpnxzn/>\n\n===Economic===\n\n====Taxation====\nIn the early empire (30 BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD 235) the Roman government paid for what it needed in gold and silver. The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235\u2013285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could never be sure of the value of money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (''capita'') and land (''iugera'') \u2013 with one iugerum equal to approximately 0.65 acres \u2013 and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make citywide totals of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20>Treadgold, 20.</ref> The ''iugum'' was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The ''caput'' was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a ''caput'', and sometimes at other values.<ref name=SSC159/> Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its ''capita'', and grain in proportion to its ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20/>{{refn|The army recruitment tax was called the ''praebitio tironum'', and conscripted a part of each landowner's tenant farmers (''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]''). When a ''capitulum'' extended across many farms, farmers provided the funds to compensate the neighbor who had supplied the recruit. Landowners of senatorial rank were able to commute the tax with a payment in gold (the ''aurum tironicum'').<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173. See also: Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 18.</ref>|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nMost taxes were due on each year on 1 September, and levied from individual landowners by ''[[Decurion (administrative)|decuriones]]'' (decurions). These decurions, analogous to city councilors, were responsible for paying from their own pocket what they failed to collect.<ref name=sfirim>Southern, 160; Treadgold, 20.</ref> Diocletian's reforms also increased the number of financial officials in the provinces: more ''rationales'' and ''magistri privatae'' are attested under Diocletian's reign than before. These officials represented the interests of the fisc, which collected taxes in gold, and the Imperial properties.<ref name=hcwmwc/> Fluctuations in the value of the currency made collection of taxes in kind the norm, although these could be converted into coin. Rates shifted to take inflation into account.<ref name=TBSS20/> In 296, Diocletian issued an edict reforming census procedures. This edict introduced a general five-year census for the whole empire, replacing prior censuses that had operated at different speeds throughout the empire. The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref>Potter, 333.</ref>\n\nItaly, which had long been exempt from taxes, was included in the tax system from 290/291 as a diocesis.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9, 288; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 28\u201329; Southern, 159.</ref> The city of Rome itself, however, remained exempt; the \"regions\" (i.e., provinces) South of Rome (generally called \"suburbicarian\", as opposed to the Northern, \"annonaria\" region) seem to have been relatively less taxed, in what probably was a sop offered to the great senatorial families and their landed properties.<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''l\"Empire Romain'', 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nDiocletian's edicts emphasized the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public.<ref>Williams, 125.</ref> The position of ''decurion'', member of the city council, had been an honor sought by wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth by paying for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made liable for any shortfall in the amount of tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.<ref name=sfirim/> By 300, civilians across the empire complained that there were more tax collectors than there were people to pay taxes.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=25}}\n\n====Currency and inflation====\n[[File:Edict on Maximum Prices Diocletian piece in Berlin.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (301), on display in [[Berlin]]]]\n[[File:Prices edict Greek.jpg|thumb|Part of the prices edict in Greek in its original area built into a medieval church, Geraki, Greece]]\n\nAurelian's attempt to reform the currency had failed; the denarius was dead.<ref name=SSC160>Southern, 160.</ref> Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces.<ref name=POTBAY392>Potter, 392.</ref> The new system consisted of five coins: the ''aureus''/''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the ''[[argenteus]]'', a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the ''[[follis]]'', sometimes referred to as the ''laureatus'' A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the ''radiatus'', a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the ''laureatus'' B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound.<ref>Potter, 392\u201393.</ref>{{refn|The ''[[denarius]]'' was dropped from the Imperial mints,<ref name=SSC160/> but the values of new coins continued to be measured in reference to it.<ref name=POTBAY392/>|group=\"Note\"}} Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).<ref name=CAS76>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176.</ref>\n\nBy 301, however, the system was in trouble, strained by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his ''Edict on Coinage'', an act re-tariffing all debts so that the ''[[nummus]]'', the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much.<ref>Potter, 334, 393; Southern, 160.</ref> In the edict, preserved in an inscription from the city of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]] (near [[Geyre]], Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards.<ref name=POTBAY33435>Potter, 334\u201335.</ref> It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency.<ref>Potter, 393.</ref> This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (''Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium'') was issued two to three months after the coinage edict,<ref name=SSC160/> somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301.<ref name=POTBAY33435/> The best-preserved Latin inscription surviving from the [[Greek East]],<ref>Potter, 336.</ref> the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone.<ref>Southern, 160, 339.</ref> In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177\u201378; Potter, 335; Southern, 161.</ref>\n\nIn the most basic terms, the edict was ignorant of the law of [[supply and demand]]: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region according to product availability, and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was \"an act of economic lunacy\".<ref>Potter, 335.</ref> The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays at the same time a moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics \u2013 perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\", 42 and 44</ref>\n\nThere is no consensus about how effectively the edict was enforced.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\",44</ref> Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178.</ref> The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains),<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177.</ref> widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps within a year of the edict's issue.<ref>Potter, 336; Southern, 161.</ref> Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic,<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.6\u20137, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178, and Southern, 161.</ref> and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.<ref>Potter, 336; Williams, 131\u201332.</ref>\n\n==== Social and professional mobility====\nPartly in response to economic pressures and in order to protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary.<ref>\"Late Antinquity\" by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 115.</ref> Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.<ref>Christol & Nony, 241.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe historian [[A.H.M. Jones]] observed that \"It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one years and then abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining years of his life in peaceful retirement.\"<ref>Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 40.</ref> Diocletian was one of the few emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily.<ref>Williams, 228\u201329.</ref> Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324.<ref>Williams, 196\u201398.</ref> Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented:<ref>Williams, 204.</ref> the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made them even more extravagant.<ref>Williams, 205\u20136.</ref>\n\nConstantine ignored those parts of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of preserving a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' became the empire's primary currency instead.<ref>Williams, 207\u20138.</ref> Diocletian's [[persecution of Christians]] was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s.<ref>Williams, 208.</ref> The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.<ref>Williams, 218\u201319.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his administrative and legal impact on history, the Emperor Diocletian is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in modern-day [[Croatia]]. The city itself grew around the heavily fortified [[Diocletian's Palace]] the emperor had built in anticipation of his retirement.\n\nThe ''[[Era of Martyrs]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''anno martyrum'' or AM), also known as the ''Diocletian era'' (Latin: ''anno Diocletiani''), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century ''anno Domini'' and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; [[Dionysius Exiguus]] replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.\n\n''[[Dukljan]]'', a major villain in [[Serbian mythology]] who is presented as the [[devil|adversary]] of [[God]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |title=\u041e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043be\u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u045a\u0438\u045b\u0430 |author=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2007-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172046/http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead |author-link=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 }}</ref> is considered to be a mythological reflection of the historical Diocletian.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| Car | | | | | | | | | | Dio |Car=''previous''<br>[[Carus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-283|Dio=[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|20px]]<br>Diocletian<br>Roman Emperor<br>284-305<br><small>\u221e [[Prisca]]}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| Can | | sis | | Gal |~| GVa | | Man |~|~|~| Eut |~|~|~| Afr |Can=[[Carinus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-284|GVa=[[Galeria Valeria]]|Gal=[[Galerius]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>305-311|sis=sister|Man=''next''<br>[[Maximian]]<br>co-emperor 285-286<br>Emperor of the West 286-305|Eut=[[Eutropia]]|Afr=[[Afranius Hannibalianus]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| | | | | Ma2 | | Val |~| Mus | | |!| | | Hel |~| CCh |~| FMT |Val=[[Valeria Maximilla]]|Ma2=[[Maximinus II]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>310-313|FMT=(?)

Born to a family of low status in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become a [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] commander of the Emperor [[Carus]]'s army. After the deaths of Carus and his son [[Numerian]] on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus's surviving son, [[Carinus]], but Diocletian defeated him in the [[Battle of the Margus]].\n\nDiocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He appointed fellow officer [[Maximian]] as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian reigned in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]], and [[Maximian]] reigned in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]]. Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing [[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] as [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], junior co-emperors, under himself and Maximian respectively. Under this '[[tetrarchy]]', or \"rule of four\", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the [[Sarmatia]]ns and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the [[Alamanni]] in 288, and usurpers in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favourable peace.\n\nDiocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in [[Nicomedia]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Sirmium]], and [[Trier|Trevorum]], closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome. Building on third-century trends towards [[Autocracy|absolutism]], he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.\n\nNot all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), his attempt to curb [[inflation]] via [[price controls]], was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|tetrarchic system collapsed]] after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of [[Maxentius]] and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] (303\u2013312), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official [[persecution of Christianity]], failed to eliminate Christianity in the empire; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Despite these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in [[Diocletian's Palace|his palace on the Dalmatian coast]], tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Salona - amphitheatre - panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|Panorama of amphitheatre in [[Salona]]]]\n\nDiocletian was born near [[Salona]] in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] ([[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in modern [[Croatia]]), some time around 244.<ref name=BIRTH/> His parents gave him the Greek name Diocles, or possibly Diocles Valerius.<ref>Aurelius Victor 39.1; Potter, 648.</ref> The modern historian [[Timothy Barnes]] takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate.

One individual, [[Peter Cubicularius]], was stripped, raised high, and scourged. Salt and vinegar were poured in his wounds, and he was [[Boiling to death|slowly boiled]] over an open flame.

On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign ({{lang|lat|vicennalia}}), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (''[[decennalia]]''), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew impatient with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what [[Edward Gibbon]], following [[Lactantius]], calls \"licentious familiarity\".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', I, 153 and 712, note 92.</ref> The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303,<ref name=\"tkuqen\">Potter, 341.</ref> Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he did them in [[Ravenna]] on 1 January 304 instead.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24\u201325.</ref> There are suggestions in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' and Lactantius's account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome. Maximian, according to these accounts, swore to uphold Diocletian's plan in a ceremony in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]].<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 20.4; Southern, 152, 336.</ref>\n\nFrom Ravenna, Diocletian left for the Danube. There, possibly in Galerius's company, he took part in a campaign against the Carpi.<ref name=tkuqen/> He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November 304, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304\u20135 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumours alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, it appeared that he had finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it recovered after public declarations that Diocletian was still alive. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref>\n\nGalerius arrived in the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to reconstitute the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims that he had done the same to Maximian at Sirmium.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 18.1\u20137; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref> On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, {{convert|5|km|mi}} out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With tears in his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201327; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60; Odahl, 69\u201372; Potter, 341\u201342.</ref>\n\nMost in the crowd believed they knew what would follow; [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maxentius, the only adult sons of reigning emperors, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had travelled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and was present at the palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201326.</ref> In Lactantius's account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2\u20136; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.</ref> It was not to be: [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] were declared caesars. Maximinus appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.<ref>Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60\u201361; Odahl, 72\u201374; Southern, 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and death ===\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus342.png|thumb|left|Modern depiction of Diocletian in retirement]]\n\nDiocletian retired to his homeland, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. He moved into the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace]], a heavily fortified compound located by the small town of Spalatum on the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and near the large provincial administrative center of [[Salona]]. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], the second-largest city of modern [[Croatia]].\n\nMaximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.</ref> Their homes were distant from political life, but Diocletian and Maximian were close enough to remain in regular contact with each other.<ref>Southern, 152.</ref> Galerius assumed the consular ''fasces'' in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint [[Licinius]] to be Augustus in place of Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius's usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian's reply: \"If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.\"<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>\n\nHe lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens.

Aurelian's achievements were ignored, the revolt of Carausius was backdated to the reign of Gallienus, and it was implied that the tetrarchs engineered Aurelian's defeat of the [[Palmyrene Empire|Palmyrenes]]; the period between Gallienus and Diocletian was effectively erased.

These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards to the level of a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect \u2013 although a prefect like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general<ref>Williams, 107/108.</ref> \u2013 but the office retained much civil authority. The prefect kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian prefect was often second only to the emperor himself.<ref>Williams, 110.</ref>\n\nAltogether, Diocletian effected a large increase in the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.3, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.</ref> The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the [[civil service]] doubled from 15,000 to 30,000.<ref name=\"civil\">Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 19.</ref> The classicist [[Roger S.

(By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century [[Song dynasty]] China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50\u201365 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per [[Roman diocese|diocese]] depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13\u201315,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their ''comitatus'', with the praetorian prefects, or with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.<ref>Roger S.

The [[Devil's Dykes]], for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most that can be said about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] along the [[Lake Constance]]-[[Basel]] and the Rhine\u2013[[Iller]]\u2013Danube line),<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 166</ref> on the Danube- where a new line of forts on the far side of the river, the ''Ripa Sarmatica'', was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses<ref>Edward Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire''.

The ''[[Strata Diocletiana]]'', built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of [[Bostra]], is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts \u2013 defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons \u2013 followed by further fortifications in the rear.<ref>Luttwak, 167; Campbell, \"The Army\" (CAH), 124\u201326; Southern, 154\u201355.

The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235\u2013285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could never be sure of the value of money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (''capita'') and land (''iugera'') \u2013 with one iugerum equal to approximately 0.65 acres \u2013 and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make citywide totals of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20>Treadgold, 20.</ref> The ''iugum'' was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The ''caput'' was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a ''caput'', and sometimes at other values.<ref name=SSC159/> Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its ''capita'', and grain in proportion to its ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20/>{{refn|The army recruitment tax was called the ''praebitio tironum'', and conscripted a part of each landowner's tenant farmers (''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]'').

The new censuses would keep up with changes in the values of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref>Potter, 333.</ref>\n\nItaly, which had long been exempt from taxes, was included in the tax system from 290/291 as a diocesis.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9, 288; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', 28\u201329; Southern, 159.</ref> The city of Rome itself, however, remained exempt; the \"regions\" (i.e., provinces) South of Rome (generally called \"suburbicarian\", as opposed to the Northern, \"annonaria\" region) seem to have been relatively less taxed, in what probably was a sop offered to the great senatorial families and their landed properties.<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''l\"Empire Romain'', 187\u2013188.</ref>\n\nDiocletian's edicts emphasized the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public.<ref>Williams, 125.</ref> The position of ''decurion'', member of the city council, had been an honor sought by wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth by paying for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made liable for any shortfall in the amount of tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.<ref name=sfirim/> By 300, civilians across the empire complained that there were more tax collectors than there were people to pay taxes.{{sfn|Brown|1989|p=25}}\n\n====Currency and inflation====\n[[File:Edict on Maximum Prices Diocletian piece in Berlin.jpg|thumb|A fragment of the ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (301), on display in [[Berlin]]]]\n[[File:Prices edict Greek.jpg|thumb|Part of the prices edict in Greek in its original area built into a medieval church, Geraki, Greece]]\n\nAurelian's attempt to reform the currency had failed; the denarius was dead.<ref name=SSC160>Southern, 160.</ref> Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces.<ref name=POTBAY392>Potter, 392.</ref> The new system consisted of five coins: the ''aureus''/''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the ''[[argenteus]]'', a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the ''[[follis]]'', sometimes referred to as the ''laureatus'' A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the ''radiatus'', a small copper coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the ''laureatus'' B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound.<ref>Potter, 392\u201393.</ref>{{refn|The ''[[denarius]]'' was dropped from the Imperial mints,<ref name=SSC160/> but the values of new coins continued to be measured in reference to it.<ref name=POTBAY392/>|group=\"Note\"}} Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).<ref name=CAS76>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176.</ref>\n\nBy 301, however, the system was in trouble, strained by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his ''Edict on Coinage'', an act re-tariffing all debts so that the ''[[nummus]]'', the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much.<ref>Potter, 334, 393; Southern, 160.</ref> In the edict, preserved in an inscription from the city of [[Aphrodisias]] in [[Caria]] (near [[Geyre]], Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards.<ref name=POTBAY33435>Potter, 334\u201335.</ref> It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency.<ref>Potter, 393.</ref> This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (''Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium'') was issued two to three months after the coinage edict,<ref name=SSC160/> somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301.<ref name=POTBAY33435/> The best-preserved Latin inscription surviving from the [[Greek East]],<ref>Potter, 336.</ref> the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone.<ref>Southern, 160, 339.</ref> In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177\u201378; Potter, 335; Southern, 161.</ref>\n\nIn the most basic terms, the edict was ignorant of the law of [[supply and demand]]: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region according to product availability, and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was \"an act of economic lunacy\".<ref>Potter, 335.</ref> The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays at the same time a moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics \u2013 perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\", 42 and 44</ref>\n\nThere is no consensus about how effectively the edict was enforced.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\",44</ref> Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178.</ref> The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains),<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177.</ref> widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps within a year of the edict's issue.<ref>Potter, 336; Southern, 161.</ref> Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic,<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.6\u20137, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178, and Southern, 161.</ref> and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.<ref>Potter, 336; Williams, 131\u201332.</ref>\n\n==== Social and professional mobility====\nPartly in response to economic pressures and in order to protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary.<ref>\"Late Antinquity\" by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 115.</ref> Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.<ref>Christol & Nony, 241.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe historian [[A.H.M. Jones]] observed that \"It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one years and then abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining years of his life in peaceful retirement.\"<ref>Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 40.</ref> Diocletian was one of the few emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily.<ref>Williams, 228\u201329.</ref> Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324.<ref>Williams, 196\u201398.</ref> Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented:<ref>Williams, 204.</ref> the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made them even more extravagant.<ref>Williams, 205\u20136.</ref>\n\nConstantine ignored those parts of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of preserving a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' became the empire's primary currency instead.<ref>Williams, 207\u20138.</ref> Diocletian's [[persecution of Christians]] was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s.<ref>Williams, 208.</ref> The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.<ref>Williams, 218\u201319.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his administrative and legal impact on history, the Emperor Diocletian is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in modern-day [[Croatia]]. The city itself grew around the heavily fortified [[Diocletian's Palace]] the emperor had built in anticipation of his retirement.\n\nThe ''[[Era of Martyrs]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''anno martyrum'' or AM), also known as the ''Diocletian era'' (Latin: ''anno Diocletiani''), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century ''anno Domini'' and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; [[Dionysius Exiguus]] replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.\n\n''[[Dukljan]]'', a major villain in [[Serbian mythology]] who is presented as the [[devil|adversary]] of [[God]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |title=\u041e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043be\u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u045a\u0438\u045b\u0430 |author=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2007-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172046/http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead |author-link=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 }}</ref> is considered to be a mythological reflection of the historical Diocletian.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| Car | | | | | | | | | | Dio |Car=''previous''<br>[[Carus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-283|Dio=[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|20px]]<br>Diocletian<br>Roman Emperor<br>284-305<br><small>\u221e [[Prisca]]}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| Can | | sis | | Gal |~| GVa | | Man |~|~|~| Eut |~|~|~| Afr |Can=[[Carinus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-284|GVa=[[Galeria Valeria]]|Gal=[[Galerius]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>305-311|sis=sister|Man=''next''<br>[[Maximian]]<br>co-emperor 285-286<br>Emperor of the West 286-305|Eut=[[Eutropia]]|Afr=[[Afranius Hannibalianus]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| | | | | Ma2 | | Val |~| Mus | | |!| | | Hel |~| CCh |~| FMT |Val=[[Valeria Maximilla]]|Ma2=[[Maximinus II]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>310-313|FMT=(?)
