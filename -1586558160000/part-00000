Based in [[Old Deer Park]], [[Richmond-upon-Thames]], London Welsh RFC played in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] in the [[2012\u201313 English Premiership (rugby union)|2012\u201313]] and [[2014\u201315 English Premiership (rugby union)|2014\u201315]] seasons, after gaining promotion from the [[RFU Championship]] in the 2012 and 2014 play-off final. The club returned to Old Deer Park in 2015 after three seasons at the [[Kassam Stadium]], [[Oxford]].\n\nThe club went into liquidation in December 2016 under Chairman Bleddyn Phillips, and was given a temporary licence to complete two fixtures in the Championship. On 24 January 2017 it was announced that London Welsh had been removed from the [[2016\u201317 RFU Championship|RFU Championship]] and their results expunged. The RFU stated that their place in the league was \"untenable\".<ref name=londonwelshliquidation2>{{cite web|title=London Welsh: RFU refuses permission for Exiles to stay in Championship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/38736486|website=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2017}}</ref>  The remnants of the defunct club were amalgamated into [[London Welsh Amateur|their amateur set up]].\n\n==Affiliated teams==\nDuring professionalism, London Welsh's first-XV squad were fully professional, and they were complemented with the London Welsh Amateurs, Druids and Occies. Following the changes at the club in the 2016/17 season the club operates the 1st XV and Druids 2nd XV that form the performance playing squad, the Occies 3rd XV and the Under 23s Griffins player pathway.\n\nLondon Welsh has one of the longest-standing women's sides \u2013 LWWRFC \u2013 which celebrated thirty years of women's rugby at the club in the 2015\u201316 season. While still being amateur, the club has succeeded both in XVs in the winter and 7s during the summer as well as players representing England at the regional level and on the Wales national touch team. There is also a mini and junior section.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nLondon Welsh was formed in 1885 by and for London's [[Wales|Welsh]] community, and has played senior-level rugby since then.<ref name=\"Jones3\">Jones (1985), pg 3.</ref> Its name in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], is ''Clwb Rygbi Cymry Llundain''.\n\n===Players who have won international and Lions caps===\nOver the years the club has contributed 177 players to the [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales national team]] and 43 players to the [[British and Irish Lions]]. Seven London Welsh players were selected for the [[1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1971 tour to New Zealand]] (a Lions record which remains unbroken to this day): captain John Dawes (now London Welsh president), JPR Williams, Gerald Davies, Mervyn Davies, John Taylor (now Managing Director<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.london-welsh.co.uk/club_contacts.asp|title=London Welsh \u2013 Club Contacts|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019193126/http://www.london-welsh.co.uk/club_contacts.asp|archivedate=19 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and ITV commentator), Mike Roberts and Geoff Evans.\n\n===1960s===\nLondon Welsh enjoyed great success in the late 1960s. [[John Dawes]] was appointed captain, and effectively also as coach, for the 1965-66 season. He initially significantly increased fitness levels, and then led the club in an open, running, quick-passing, attacking style of rugby, including an overlapping full-back, and relatively skilled forwards.

The team was also defeated in every single European Challenge Cup game, as well as every single Anglo-Welsh cup game.

Based in [[Old Deer Park]], [[Richmond-upon-Thames]], London Welsh RFC played in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] in the [[2012\u201313 English Premiership (rugby union)|2012\u201313]] and [[2014\u201315 English Premiership (rugby union)|2014\u201315]] seasons, after gaining promotion from the [[RFU Championship]] in the 2012 and 2014 play-off final. The club returned to Old Deer Park in 2015 after three seasons at the [[Kassam Stadium]], [[Oxford]].\n\nThe club went into liquidation in December 2016 under Chairman Bleddyn Phillips, and was given a temporary licence to complete two fixtures in the Championship. On 24 January 2017 it was announced that London Welsh had been removed from the [[2016\u201317 RFU Championship|RFU Championship]] and their results expunged. The RFU stated that their place in the league was \"untenable\".<ref name=londonwelshliquidation2>{{cite web|title=London Welsh: RFU refuses permission for Exiles to stay in Championship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/38736486|website=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2017}}</ref>  The remnants of the defunct club were amalgamated into [[London Welsh Amateur|their amateur set up]].\n\n==Affiliated teams==\nDuring professionalism, London Welsh's first-XV squad were fully professional, and they were complemented with the London Welsh Amateurs, Druids and Occies. Following the changes at the club in the 2016/17 season the club operates the 1st XV and Druids 2nd XV that form the performance playing squad, the Occies 3rd XV and the Under 23s Griffins player pathway.\n\nLondon Welsh has one of the longest-standing women's sides \u2013 LWWRFC \u2013 which celebrated thirty years of women's rugby at the club in the 2015\u201316 season. While still being amateur, the club has succeeded both in XVs in the winter and 7s during the summer as well as players representing England at the regional level and on the Wales national touch team. There is also a mini and junior section.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nLondon Welsh was formed in 1885 by and for London's [[Wales|Welsh]] community, and has played senior-level rugby since then.<ref name=\"Jones3\">Jones (1985), pg 3.</ref> Its name in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], is ''Clwb Rygbi Cymry Llundain''.\n\n===Players who have won international and Lions caps===\nOver the years the club has contributed 177 players to the [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales national team]] and 43 players to the [[British and Irish Lions]]. Seven London Welsh players were selected for the [[1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1971 tour to New Zealand]] (a Lions record which remains unbroken to this day): captain John Dawes (now London Welsh president), JPR Williams, Gerald Davies, Mervyn Davies, John Taylor (now Managing Director<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.london-welsh.co.uk/club_contacts.asp|title=London Welsh \u2013 Club Contacts|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019193126/http://www.london-welsh.co.uk/club_contacts.asp|archivedate=19 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and ITV commentator), Mike Roberts and Geoff Evans.\n\n===1960s===\nLondon Welsh enjoyed great success in the late 1960s. [[John Dawes]] was appointed captain, and effectively also as coach, for the 1965-66 season. He initially significantly increased fitness levels, and then led the club in an open, running, quick-passing, attacking style of rugby, including an overlapping full-back, and relatively skilled forwards.

The team was also defeated in every single European Challenge Cup game, as well as every single Anglo-Welsh cup game.

The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\n===Cloud formation===\nSnow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low-pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation.

Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low-pressure system or a series of [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed [[thundersnow]].\n\nA [[warm front]] can produce snow for a period, as warm, moist air overrides below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary.

The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the [[orographic lift|orographic]] influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores.

The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the [[Wegener\u2013Bergeron\u2013Findeisen process]]. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.<ref name=\"natgeojan07\">{{cite journal|author=M.

Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrain]] more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of [[gravity current]]. They occur in three major mechanisms:<ref name=\"McClung 2006\">McClung, David and Shaerer, Peter: The Avalanche Handbook, The Mountaineers: 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-89886-809-8}}</ref>\n* ''Slab avalanches'' occur in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.\n* ''[[Powder snow avalanche]]s'' result from a deposition of fresh dry powder and generate a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of {{convert|300|kph}}, and masses of {{convert|10000000|tonnes}}; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances.\n* ''Wet snow avalanches'' are a low-velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the surface of the pathway.<ref name=\"McClung 2006\"/> The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~{{convert|10|to|40|km/h|0}}), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.\n\n===Snowmelt===\n[[File:1997 Red River Flood Grand Forks.jpg|thumb|right|Snowmelt-induced flooding of the [[Red River of the North]] in [[1997 Red River flood|1997]]]]\nMany rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt.

The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming n\u00e9v\u00e9. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into glacial ice. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it overflows through a geological weakness or an escape route, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.  On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Science==\n{{Main|Snow science}}\nScientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the [[physics]] of [[chemical bonds]] and [[Cloud physics|clouds]]; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river [[hydraulics]] and ground [[hydrology]]. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by [[engineer]]s, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by [[agronomist]]s, who address the availability of snowmelt to [[agriculture]], and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is [[avalanche]]s, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.\n\nSnow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish [[ground truth]] and [[remote sensing]] techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |title       = All About Snow\u2014Snow Science\n |date        = 2016\n |website     = National Snow and Ice Data Center\n |publisher   = University of Colorado, Boulder\n |access-date = November 30, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020029/https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |archivedate = December 1, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Measurement and classification===\n{{See also|Classifications of snow}}\nIn the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees. Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table:<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n[[File:Taku glacier firn ice sampling.png|thumb|right|Snow pit on the surface of a glacier, profiling snow properties where the snow becomes increasingly dense with depth as it metamorphoses towards ice]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Frozen precipitation particles, related to snow crystals\n|-\n!

The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.<ref name=Classificationonground>\n{{Citation\n |last        = Fierz\n |first       = C.\n |last2       = Armstrong\n |first2      = R.L.\n |last3       = Durand\n |first3      = Y.\n |last4       = Etchevers\n |first4      = P.\n |last5       = Greene\n |first5      = E.\n |display-authors=5\n |author6=McClung, D.M.\n |author7=Nishimura, K.\n |author8=Satyawali, P.K.\n |author9=Sokratov, S.A.\n |title       = The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground\n |place       = Paris\n |publisher   = UNESCO\n |series      = IHP-VII Technical Documents in Hydrology\n |volume      = 83\n |year        = 2009\n |pages       = 80\n |url         = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |access-date = November 25, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160929205922/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |archivedate = September 29, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Satellite data===\n[[Remote sensing]] of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery.

The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\nSatellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40\u00b0. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.<ref name = Review>{{cite journal | author=Dietz, A. |author2=Kuenzer, C. |author3=Gessner, U. |author4= Dech, S.  | year=2012 |title=Remote Sensing of Snow \u2013 a Review of available methods |journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing |doi=10.1080/01431161.2011.640964|bibcode = 2012IJRS...33.4094D |volume=33 |issue=13 |pages=4094\u20134134}}</ref>\n\nThe most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible\u2013infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.<ref name = Review/>\n\n===Models===\n[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|thumb|Snowfall and snowmelt are parts of the Earth's water cycle.]]\nSnow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology\u2014elements of the Earth's [[water cycle]]\u2014which help describe [[global climate change]].<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n[[Climate model|Global climate change models]] (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its [[albedo]] (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/> The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' defines SWE as \"the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely\".<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\nGiven the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute ''Q<sub>m</sub>'', the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to ''Q<sub>m</sub>''.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Effects on human activity==\nSnow affects human activity in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{See also|Snowplow}}\nSnow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. They share a common tool for clearing snow, the [[snowplow]]. However, the application is different in each case\u2014whereas roadways employ anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks.\n\n====Highway====\n[[File:Cars covered in Snow on Lake Shore Drive Chicago Feb 2 2011 storm.JPG|thumb|Traffic stranded in a 2011 [[Chicago]] snowstorm.]]\n[[File:Snowy Higddhway 4012.jpg|thumb|Winter conditions on [[Ontario Highway 401]] in Toronto due to a [[snowsquall]].]]\nIn the late 20th century, an estimated $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, according to a 1994 report by Kuemmel.

Snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it.\n\n''Snow loads'' \u2013 The ''Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures'' gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads:<ref name = ASCE7/>\n* Ground snow loads\n* Exposure of the roof\n* Thermal properties of the roof\n* Shape of the roof\n* Drifting\n* Importance of the building\nIt gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby, measured values. The ''Eurocode 1'' uses similar methodologies, starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of Europe.<ref name=Eurocode1/>\n\n''Icings'' \u2013 Roofs must also be designed to avoid [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]], which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the [[eaves]]. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam.<ref name=\"Paul\" >Paul Fisette, \"Preventing Ice Dams\", ''Roofing, flashing & waterproofing''. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 54.</ref> Ice dams may result in [[Water damage|damaged]] building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams.

Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\n===Plant life===\nSnow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of [[conifer]]s intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n===Animal life===\n[[File:Fjellrev - Arctic fox (24490250823).jpg|thumb|right|[[Arctic fox]], a predator of smaller animals that live beneath the snow]]\nSnow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many [[invertebrate]]s thrive in snow, including [[spider]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[snow scorpionfly]]s and [[springtail]]s. Such [[arthropod]]s are typically active at temperatures down to {{convert|-5|C}}. Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures: freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce [[antifreeze]] agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions. Some organisms [[Fasting|fast]] during the winter, which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\nSmall [[vertebrates]] are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, [[alpine salamander]]s are active in snow at temperatures as low as {{convert|-8|C}}; they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than {{convert|250|g}}. [[Omnivore]]s are more likely to enter a torpor or be [[Hibernate|hibernators]], whereas [[herbivore]]s are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. [[Vole]]s store up to {{convert|3|kg}} of food and [[pika]]s up to {{convert|20|kg}}. Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth.

Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\n===Cloud formation===\nSnow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low-pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation.

The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the [[Wegener\u2013Bergeron\u2013Findeisen process]]. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.<ref name=\"natgeojan07\">{{cite journal|author=M.

Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they [[Entrainment (physical geography)|entrain]] more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of [[gravity current]]. They occur in three major mechanisms:<ref name=\"McClung 2006\">McClung, David and Shaerer, Peter: The Avalanche Handbook, The Mountaineers: 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-89886-809-8}}</ref>\n* ''Slab avalanches'' occur in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.\n* ''[[Powder snow avalanche]]s'' result from a deposition of fresh dry powder and generate a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of {{convert|300|kph}}, and masses of {{convert|10000000|tonnes}}; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances.\n* ''Wet snow avalanches'' are a low-velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the surface of the pathway.<ref name=\"McClung 2006\"/> The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~{{convert|10|to|40|km/h|0}}), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.\n\n===Snowmelt===\n[[File:1997 Red River Flood Grand Forks.jpg|thumb|right|Snowmelt-induced flooding of the [[Red River of the North]] in [[1997 Red River flood|1997]]]]\nMany rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt.

The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming n\u00e9v\u00e9. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into glacial ice. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it overflows through a geological weakness or an escape route, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.  On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Science==\n{{Main|Snow science}}\nScientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the [[physics]] of [[chemical bonds]] and [[Cloud physics|clouds]]; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river [[hydraulics]] and ground [[hydrology]]. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by [[engineer]]s, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by [[agronomist]]s, who address the availability of snowmelt to [[agriculture]], and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is [[avalanche]]s, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.\n\nSnow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish [[ground truth]] and [[remote sensing]] techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |title       = All About Snow\u2014Snow Science\n |date        = 2016\n |website     = National Snow and Ice Data Center\n |publisher   = University of Colorado, Boulder\n |access-date = November 30, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020029/https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science\n |archivedate = December 1, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Measurement and classification===\n{{See also|Classifications of snow}}\nIn the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees. Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table:<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n[[File:Taku glacier firn ice sampling.png|thumb|right|Snow pit on the surface of a glacier, profiling snow properties where the snow becomes increasingly dense with depth as it metamorphoses towards ice]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Frozen precipitation particles, related to snow crystals\n|-\n!

The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.<ref name=Classificationonground>\n{{Citation\n |last        = Fierz\n |first       = C.\n |last2       = Armstrong\n |first2      = R.L.\n |last3       = Durand\n |first3      = Y.\n |last4       = Etchevers\n |first4      = P.\n |last5       = Greene\n |first5      = E.\n |display-authors=5\n |author6=McClung, D.M.\n |author7=Nishimura, K.\n |author8=Satyawali, P.K.\n |author9=Sokratov, S.A.\n |title       = The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground\n |place       = Paris\n |publisher   = UNESCO\n |series      = IHP-VII Technical Documents in Hydrology\n |volume      = 83\n |year        = 2009\n |pages       = 80\n |url         = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |access-date = November 25, 2016\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160929205922/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001864/186462e.pdf\n |archivedate = September 29, 2016\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Satellite data===\n[[Remote sensing]] of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery. Multi-faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed. The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\nSatellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. However, in some areas there may be an increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40\u00b0. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.<ref name = Review>{{cite journal | author=Dietz, A. |author2=Kuenzer, C. |author3=Gessner, U. |author4= Dech, S.  | year=2012 |title=Remote Sensing of Snow \u2013 a Review of available methods |journal=International Journal of Remote Sensing |doi=10.1080/01431161.2011.640964|bibcode = 2012IJRS...33.4094D |volume=33 |issue=13 |pages=4094\u20134134}}</ref>\n\nThe most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible\u2013infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.<ref name = Review/>\n\n===Models===\n[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|thumb|Snowfall and snowmelt are parts of the Earth's water cycle.]]\nSnow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology\u2014elements of the Earth's [[water cycle]]\u2014which help describe [[global climate change]].<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n[[Climate model|Global climate change models]] (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its [[albedo]] (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/> The ''International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground'' defines SWE as \"the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely\".<ref name = Classificationonground/>\n\nGiven the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute ''Q<sub>m</sub>'', the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to ''Q<sub>m</sub>''.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n==Effects on human activity==\nSnow affects human activity in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{See also|Snowplow}}\nSnow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads.

Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the [[eaves]].

Common examples include [[cross-country skiing]], [[Alpine skiing]], [[snowboarding]], [[snowshoe]]ing, and [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]]. The design of the equipment used, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow, as with skis or snowboards and contends with the [[coefficient of friction]] of snow to allow sliding, often enhance by [[ski wax]]es.\n\nSkiing is by far the largest form of winter recreation. As of 1994, of the estimated 65\u201375 million skiers worldwide, there were approximately 55 million who engaged in [[Alpine skiing]], the rest engaged in [[cross-country skiing]]. Approximately 30 million skiers (of all kinds) were in Europe, 15 million in the US, and 14 million in Japan. As of 1996, there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas, operating 26,000 ski lifts and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year.

Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\n===Plant life===\nSnow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of [[conifer]]s intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.<ref name = Snowenclyclopedia/>\n\n===Animal life===\n[[File:Fjellrev - Arctic fox (24490250823).jpg|thumb|right|[[Arctic fox]], a predator of smaller animals that live beneath the snow]]\nSnow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many [[invertebrate]]s thrive in snow, including [[spider]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[snow scorpionfly]]s and [[springtail]]s. Such [[arthropod]]s are typically active at temperatures down to {{convert|-5|C}}. Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures: freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce [[antifreeze]] agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions. Some organisms [[Fasting|fast]] during the winter, which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism.<ref name = SnowEcology/>\n\nSmall [[vertebrates]] are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, [[alpine salamander]]s are active in snow at temperatures as low as {{convert|-8|C}}; they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than {{convert|250|g}}. [[Omnivore]]s are more likely to enter a torpor or be [[Hibernate|hibernators]], whereas [[herbivore]]s are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. [[Vole]]s store up to {{convert|3|kg}} of food and [[pika]]s up to {{convert|20|kg}}. Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another's warmth.

It follows the valley of Water of Minnoch <ref>[http://www.fishpal.com/Scotland/Galloway/AboutTheCree.asp Fishing on Rivers Cree and Water of Minnoch]</ref> and for most of its length it passes through the extensive forestry plantations which lie to the west of the Galloway hills.\n\n===Eastern boundary===\nThe A713 ([[Castle Douglas]] to [[Ayr]] road) forms the eastern boundary of these hills. As it heads south from Dalmellington it passes through the valley which separates the Galloway hills from the [[Carsphairn and Scaur Hills]] hills to the east. This valley is known as the Glenkens.<ref>[http://www.theglenkens.org.uk/ The Glenkens]</ref> There is an extensive hydro electric scheme (commissioned 1935/36) with several dams and power stations that runs down through the [[Galloway hydro-electric power scheme|Glenkens]]<ref>[http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2051995 International Water Power Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050809/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2051995 |date=14 June 2011 }}</ref> to end at Tongland Power Station <ref>[http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst8448.html Galloway Hydros Visitors Centre]</ref> near [[Kirkcudbright]]. \nThe A713 passes through Carsphairn village on the Water of Deuch and [[St John's Town of Dalry]] on [[Water of Ken]]. It also passes close to [[New Galloway]] at Kenbridge,<ref>[http://www.kenbridgehotel.co.uk/ Ken Bridge Hotel]</ref> at the northern end of Loch Ken. From New Galloway you can take the A712 through the hills to [[Newton Stewart]]. This road passes [[Clatteringshaws Loch|Clatteringshaws Reservoir]], the Queen's Way,<ref>[http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/New_Galloway Travel Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929050214/http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/New_Galloway |date=29 September 2009 }}</ref> Dunkitterick Cottage (the birthplace of [[Alexander Murray (linguist)|Alexander Murray]]), a deer range, a wild goat park and Murray's Monument.\n\n===Southern boundary===\n[[File:Grey Man of the Merrick.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grey Man of the Merrick.]]\nFor most users of these hills, \"the Galloway hills\" would mean the ranges which lie north of a line running eastwards along the north shores of [[Loch Trool]], [[River Dee, Galloway|Loch Dee]] and Clatteringshaws Reservoir. This for them would be the notional true heartland of the Galloway hills. The [[Southern Upland Way]] and the [[National Cycle Network]] Route Number Seven travel along this line. A slightly looser use of the phrase Galloway hills would certainly include the ranges which lie to the south of that line.\n\n===Outlying ranges to the south===\nAs you approach Clatteringshaws Reservoir on the A712 heading for Newton Stewart you have a hill called Cairnsmore of Dee or Black Craig of Dee (493 metres) to the south of you. This is not a particularly high hill but it offers excellent views from the top over Clatteringshaws into the heart of the Galloway hills. Likewise to the south as you pass Murray's Monument there is an outlying range of hills around [[Cairnsmore of Fleet]] (711 metres). The top of Cairnsmore of Fleet is over 2 kilometres in length running almost north-south and it has tops at either end. To the south of this again is a group of small coastal hills around Cairnharrow just to the west of [[Gatehouse of Fleet]]. Immediately beyond that is the [[A75 road|A75 Euroroute]] running close to the shore of the Solway Firth.\n\n==Hills named Cairnsmore==\nBesides the two Cairnsmore hills just mentioned there is a third \"Cairnsmore\" acting as a prominent sentinel around the borders of the Galloway hills. This is [[Cairnsmore of Carsphairn]] (797 metres) which lies some 5 kilometres to the north east of Carsphairn village and is the prominent hill to the east of you as you walk the Rhinns of Kells. It belongs in its own range, the Carsphairn hills.\n\n==Access roads==\n* Some two kilometres south of Dalmellington on the A713 you can pick up a forestry toll road which brings you down the west side of Loch Doon, passing the reconstructed Loch Doon Castle <ref>[http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst6458.html Gazetteer for Scotland]</ref> and bringing you out at Stinchar Bridge. You pass close to Loch Riecawr and Loch Bradan. The Barr to Loch Doon Cycle Route <ref>[http://www.ayrshirepaths.org.uk/barractivities.htm Ayrshire Paths]</ref> uses this forest road.\n* From Glentrool village there is a minor single track road that takes you eastward to Bruce's Stone on the northern side of Loch Trool, a distance of some 6 kilometres. The road stops here for vehicle traffic but the N7 National Cycle Network Route carries on from there right over to Clatteringshaws.\n* You can also take a car as far as Craigencallie (Ordnance Survey ref. NX503780) which lies about half way between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws. Access to the single track road which takes you there is just west of the Dam at Clatteringshaws reservoir on the A712.\n\n==Three ridges==\n\nAs mentioned above the heartland of the Galloway hills lies to the north of Loch Trool and many excellent walks into that particularly wild remote territory start from the extensive car park by Bruce's Stone. There are three ridges which run northwards from the Loch Trool/Loch Dee/Clatteringshaws area - The [[Range of the Awful Hand|Awful Hand]] on the west, The Rhinns of Kells to the east, and the Dungeon hills in between.\n\n===Awful Hand===\n[[File:Dungeon Hills and Awful Hand from the Saddle between Millfire and Corserine.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Dungeon Hills and Awful Hand from the Saddle between Millfire and Corserine in the Rhinns of Kells. 01 Dungeon Hill - 02 Merrick - 03 Little Spear of Merrick - 04 Kirriereoch - 05 Mullwharchar - 06 Tarfessock - 07 Shalloch on Minnoch - 08 Hoodens Hill.]]\nTaking the Awful Hand from north to south we have the following tops [[Shalloch on Minnoch]] (768 metres), [[Tarfessock]] (697 metres), [[Kirriereoch Hill|Kirriereoch]] (786), [[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]] (843 metres) and [[Benyellary]] (719 metres). Merrick is the highest hill in the south of Scotland though at less than three thousand feet it is not a [[Munro]]. These five hills have ridges running off them to the west making the \"Awful Hand\", Benyellary being the thumb. This hand is best seen from near Waterhead on Minnoch as you head south from Stinchar Bridge towards Glentrool village. The Awful Hand ridge is 9 kilometres in length as the crow flies; from the top of Shalloch on Minnoch to the top of Benyellary. This sounds like not very much but there are some stiff climbs along the route especially around Kirriereoch and the Merrick. Also you have some 3 kilometres walk in to the two terminal tops from any road.\n\n===Rhinns of Kells===\n[[File:Rhinns of Kells Range from Cairnsmore of Carsphairn Hills.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Rhinns of Kells Range from Cairnsmore of Carsphairn Hills 01 Meikle Millyea - 02 Milldown - 03 Millfire - 04 Corserine - 05 Craigrine - 06 Carlin's Cairn - 07 Cairnsgarroch - 08 Meaul - 09 Bow - 10 Coran of Portmark - 11 Black Craig.]]\nTaking the Rhinns of Kells from north to south we start on Black Craig (528 metres) on the east bank of Loch Doon, followed by Coran of Portmark (623 metres), [[Meaul]] (695 metres), [[Carlin's Cairn]] (807), [[Corserine]] (814 metres), Millfire (716 metres), [[Milldown]] (738 metres) [[Meikle Millyea]] (746 metres), Little Millyea (578 metres) and Darrou (479). Darrou lies about half way between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws. The Rhinns of Kells is 15.5 kilometres as the crow flies from Black Craig to Darrou and the ridge has a double curve on it making it somewhat longer than that. It tends to be a gently undulating ridge along its length making for relatively easy walking.\n\n===Dungeon hills===\n[[File:Lochs Enoch, Arron and Neldricken, the Dungeon Hills and the Rhinns of Kells from Merrick.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Lochs Enoch, Arron and Neldricken, the Dungeon hills and the Rhinns of Kells from Merrick. 01 Milldown - 02 Meikle Millyea - 03 Cairnsmore of Dee - 04 Dungeon Hill - 05 Loch Enoch - 06 Nick of the Dungeon - 07 Craig Neldricken - 08 Craignaw - 09 Clatteringshaws Reservoir - 10 Loch Arron - 11 Loch Neldricken - 12 Craiglee]]\nTaking the Dungeon hills from north to south we have Craigmawhannal (357 metres) just south of the south end of Loch Doon, followed by, Hoodens hill (568 metres), [[Mullwharchar]] (692 metres), Dungeon hill (610 metres). Craignairny (595 metres), [[Craignaw]] (645 metres), Snibe hill (533 metres) and Craiglee (531 metres). Craiglee is to an extent an outlier from the main ridge lying as it does at the eastern end of the Rig of the Jarkness which runs east to west. Craiglee is just north of Loch Dee. The Dungeons, as they are often called, are 11 kilometres from the top of Craigmawhannal to the top of Craiglee as the crow flies. None of these hills get to the same heights as some hills on the other two ridges. However, apart from Mullwharchar they are much more rocky and rugged and are therefore popular with the rock climber and those who like a bit of scrambling when they walk in the hills. \nA planning application was made in January 1978 to Kyle and Carrick District Council by the UKAEA to test drill on Mullwharchar for the purpose of dumping nuclear waste. On 24 October 1978, the Council rejected the application after considerable local protest.<ref>[http://www.scottishhills.com/html/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=4939 Scottish Hills Forums]</ref>\n\n==Between the ridges==\nThere is relatively low ground between the Dungeons ridge and the other two ridges on either side of it and this lower ground passes through the whole hill area from north to south forming two corridors through the hills.\n\nHowever, the surface of the highest loch in the corridor to the west of the Dungeons, Loch Enoch, is actually around 490 metres above sea level. With Loch Trool being about 70 metres above sea level you can see that this corridor rises significantly as it passes (over a distance of some 5 kilometres) between the hills on either side.\n\nThe surface of Dry Loch of the Dungeon the highest loch to the east of the Dungeons is around 330 metres above sea level and most of the Silver Flowe immediately to the south of it lies fairly level at about the 270 metres mark all the way back south to Loch Dee (around 225 metres above sea level). The explanation for this is that the Silver Flowe is a floating or blanket bog and is consequently flat in nature.\n\n===Lochs between the Awful Hand and the Dungeons===\n[[File:View over Lochs Arron, Neldricken and Valley to Minnigaff Hills.jpg|thumb|right|450px|View over Lochs Arron, Neldricken and Valley to Minnigaff Hills 01 Craignaw - 02 Craig Neldricken - 03 Loch Arron - 04 Loch Neldricken - 05 Craiglee - 06 Millfore - 07 Cairnsmore of Fleet - 08 White Hill - 09 Curleywee - 10 Bennanbrack - 11 Lamachan - 12 Glenhead Lochs - 13 Rig of the Jarkness - 14 Loch Valley - 15 Buchan Ridge.]]\n\nThere are two [[Burn (topography)|burns]] which feed into the eastern end of Loch Trool on its northern shore, the Buchan Burn (the more westerly) and the Gairland Burn.\n\nThese two burns are separated by a short ridge, (3 kilometres long), which runs north from Buchan Hill just north of Loch Trool to Craig Neldricken immediately south of Loch Enoch - the Buchan Ridge.\n\nIt is quite possible to use the Buchan Burn route to get to Loch Enoch and you will pass the Grey Man of the Merrick (see picture above), on your left as you near Loch Enoch (OS ref. NX427842). The more popular route however, because of the scenic interest, is to take the Gairland Burn and head north past [[Loch Valley]], [[Loch Neldricken]] and [[Loch Arron]] before you get to Loch Enoch. This is often called the \"Loch's Route onto The Merrick\" - though you still have a 350-metre climb up Redstone Rig from Loch Enoch to the Merrick.\n\nTaking the west side of Loch Neldricken you will pass a place called in the maps the \"Murder Hole\" which refers to an incident in [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett|Samuel Crockett's]] novel \"The Raiders\" - though it is claimed that the real murder hole is near Rowantree Bridge (OS Ref NX354907) on the Water of Minnoch where the bodies of waylaid, murdered travellers were dumped.<ref>Temperley, Alan (1979) Tales of Galloway p129 footnote.</ref>\n\nIf you go east of Loch Neldricken you can gain access to Loch Enoch by the Wolf Slock. Both of these latter named places figure prominently in the Crockett novel. The sharp granite sand on the beaches of Loch Enoch itself was at one time collected and sold for sharpening knives and scythes.<ref>McBain The Merrick and the Neighbouring Hills (1980 edition) p139</ref>\n\nIn McBain's book \"The Merrick and Neighbouring Hills\" there is a description of how McBain tried to find the depth of Loch Enoch by cutting a series of holes on its icy surface and dropping a weighted line into it - quite alone when he did so. He worked out a depth of 105 feet at what he reckoned was the deepest point.<ref>McBain pp146-154</ref> McBain was an intrepid hill walker/climber who was much devoted to these hills and his book exudes his love for the wild places. It is an excellent read for anyone interested in walking hills in general but especially these hills.\n\n===Silver Flowe===\n[[File:Silver Flowe from Dungeon Hill.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Silver Flowe from Dungeon Hill. Backhill of Bush is behind the trees on the left edge of the picture. The loch in the foreground is Long Loch of the Dungeon and the loch in the distance by the right edge of the picture is Loch Dee. Meikle Millyea is on the left edge leading down to Little Millyea and Darrou as the Rhinns of Kells ridge descends into the gap between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws.]]\n[[File:Ralph Furlow Monument.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Ralph Furlow Monument with Loch Dungeon and Meikle Millyea.]]\nThe Silver Flowe is a [[National Nature Reserves in Scotland|National Nature Reserve]] with a [[Blanket bog]] of international importance. It is part of the Merrick Kells Biosphere Reserve<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&code=UKM+10 UNESC-MAB Biospheres Reserves Directory]</ref> and is a Ramsar site <ref>[http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1391 List of Ramsar Sites in Scotland]</ref> for the quality of its peatlands and wetlands. The [[Ramsar Convention]], is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation of wetlands and their resources. The convention is the only global environmental treaty that deals with a particular ecosystem; it takes its name from the Iranian city of Ramsar and came into force in 1975. The reserve is owned by [[Forestry Commission|Forest Enterprise]] but is managed through a lease by [[Scottish Natural Heritage]].\n\n===Backhill of Bush===\nToday Backhill of Bush is open as a bothy, having been renovated after a period of closure due to vandalism. However until around 1950 it was still in use as the home of a shepherd (or \"Hird\" in local parlance) working a part of the land known as the Dungeon of Buchan and was reckoned to be the loneliest such outpost in Galloway with the Silver Flowe to the west and the Rhinns of Kells to the east.\n\nSoon after this the land was taken over by the Forestry Commission and the sheep grazings became dense forest, but not before the death of a 17-year-old shepherd called Ralph Furlow, an employee of the Department of Agriculture, whose job it was to cross the Rhinns of Kells to tend to the sheep still in the Dungeon area. On 27 January 1954 he was overwhelmed in a snow storm and his death is commemorated by a monument just below Millfire on its east side.<ref>McFadzean Dave (2004) Tales 'o the Back Buss pp. 65-67</ref>\n\n===Access into the heart of the Galloway hills from the east and west===\nThe route Ralph Furlow would have used to cross the Rhinns was that used by the former residents of Back Hill - going over the saddle between Corserine and Millfire (OS. Ref NX516863). In earlier times a funeral party taking a \"hird's\" wife's dead body over the Rhinns was caught in a snowstorm in this saddle and the body had to be left there for several days.<ref>McFadzean p24</ref>\n\nHeading west from Back Hill for the Loch Enoch area the route taken was up the Nick of the Dungeon, a steep boulder-strewn climb, after you had negotiated your way through the watery pools of the Silver Flowe. Months could pass between seeing anyone else from the outside world. The \"hirds\" and their families had therefore to be both resourceful and self-reliant to spend their working lives there, and it will always be one of the attractions for those who go into wild country like this that you are forced to take responsibility for yourself; the place asks questions of you that you are obliged to take seriously.\n\n==Habitation in the Galloway hills==\nThere are the remains of several other former buildings scattered around the Galloway hills area; notably at Glenhead (NX433800) close to the Southern Upland Way for example, and at Culsharg (NX416822) on the \"tourist route\" from Bruce's Stone to the Merrick. The latter can still be used as something of a shelter in bad weather, though it is far from MBA bothy standard. Buildings still in use are to be found around the periphery of the Galloway hills heartland but apart from forest tracks, there are neither public roads nor buildings in use in the heartland itself.\n\n==Minnigaff hills==\nThese hills (which offer excellent views into the heartland of the Galloway hills) lie just south of the east end of Loch Trool and they stretch to the shores of Clatteringshaws Reservoir. Their southern boundary is the A712 New Galloway to Newton Stewart road.\n\nThe battle which Bruce's Stone commemorates was actually fought (in 1307) at the south east end of Loch Trool where Muldonnoch (561 metres) falls steeply into it. South east of Muldonnoch is Lamachan Hill (717 metres), and from there you can head south west along a ridge to Large Hill (676 metres) or head east over Bennanbrack (685 metres) to Curleywee (674 metres) where you join a small ridge that runs north/south. North takes you one and a half kilometres over White Hill (606 metres) to Loch Dee. The southern ridge is some three and a half kilometres long gradually dropping in height over its length to Black Benwee (368 metres).\n\nSome two kilometres east of Loch Dee a ridge of hills runs from just south of Darrou in a south westerly direction and in fact these hills are really a continuation of the line of the Rhinns of Kells. From north to south the hills are Cairngarroch (557 metres) Cairnbaber (569 metres above the Buckdas of Cairnbaber), Millfore (656 metres) and Drigmorn Hill (545 metres).\n\nThere is also a small range of hills just to the west of Clatteringshaws Reservoir. On Darnaw (472 metres) the highest of these hills there is monument to those who died here in an air crash on 2 February 1937.<ref>[http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/dragonfly_nx5176.htm Air Crash Sites Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106035149/http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/dragonfly_nx5176.htm |date=6 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Air crash sites==\n[[File:Galloway Hills frozen waterfall.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A frozen waterfall in the Galloway Hills.]]\nBesides the air crash site just mentioned on Darnaw there are many more crash sites (some with monuments) in the Galloway hills area. There is a monument on Cairnsmore of Fleet which lists 9 aircraft which have crashed there. There is a monument on [[Craignaw]] to the pilots of an F-111 which crashed there on 19 December 1979. During World War II, Dumfries and several other places in south west Scotland were heavily involved in the training of pilots etc. for the war effort and many of the crash sites date from this era.<ref>[http://www.dumfriesaviationmuseum.com/ Dumfries Aviation Museum]</ref><ref>[http://www.walkscotland.plus.com/Galloway/pages/ngairycrsh/02.htm List of air crash sites in Galloway]</ref>\n\n==Galloway Forest Park==\nThe whole area of hills that we have been discussing on this page falls within [[Galloway Forest Park]], an area of {{convert|300|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} of mixed landscape with three visitors' centres and offering many recreational facilities. On 15 November 2009, the park became the first [[Dark-sky preserve|Dark Sky Park]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Galloway hills in Scottish history==\nLike the [[Outer Hebrides|Western Isles]] and the [[Northern Isles]], Galloway had a long history under the [[Lords of Galloway]] (from the early 12th century until 1234) of being largely independent of the Scottish crown. Going back beyond that there is thought to have been a kingdom of Galloway perhaps going back to the aftermath of the expulsion of the Vikings from Dublin in 902 and the subsequent loss of control by the former Northumbrian masters of Galloway.<ref>Oram, Richard (2000) The Lordship of Galloway p. 1</ref> \nGalloway was long regarded as a wild and lawless place - somewhat other from the mainstream of Scottish Culture, which was as much as anything to do with its remoteness and inaccessibility. The Galloway hills played an important part in this image especially as at various point in history it was a place of refuge for fugitives who did not fit into, or defied, the power structure of their times There is still a sense of otherness about the place.\n\n===\"Cradle of Independence\" - A king as a fugitive===\n[[File:Bruce's Stone, Loch Trool Muldonnoch and 1307 Battle Location from Eschoncan.jpg|thumb|right|360px|View from Eschoncan over part of the car park at Bruce's Stone Glentrool to the scene of the Battle of Glentrool (1307) at Steps of Trool (marked with a blue asterisk) on the far side of Loch Trool with Mulldonoch beyond. Bruce's Stone can be seen right of centre in the foreground (small red asterisk below it)]]\n[[File:Bruce's Stone.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Bruce's Stone Glentrool.]]\n[[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] was crowned [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scotland]] on 25 March 1306 little more than a month after he had been involved at Dumfries in the murder of [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]], otherwise known as the Red Comyn, (a serious rival for the kingship of Scotland, as his mother was Eleanor Balliol who was the eldest daughter of [[John I de Balliol]]) \n.<ref>[http://www.dumfriesmuseum.demon.co.uk/dumfstory04.html Dumfries Museum - Bruce and Comyn]</ref> Another branch of the Comyn family at his time was that of [[John Comyn, Earl of Buchan|John Comyn]] [[Earl of Buchan]]. His father Alexander had been Sheriff of Wigtown (1263\u20131266) and a Guardian of Scotland (1286\u201389), and they held land in the south west of Scotland before being granted the lands in [[Buchan]] - which explains why there are place names with Buchan in them in the Galloway hills area like Buchan Hill and Dungeon of Buchan.\n\nBruce's army lost to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s forces at the [[Battle of Methven]] in June 1306 and he became a fugitive hunted not only by the occupying forces of Edward but also by the Comyns and the [[House of Balliol|Balliols]]. He escaped to [[Rathlin Island]] off the Irish coast but by February 1307 he was back in Scotland, in the Galloway hills,  with a tiny handful of followers and totally encircled by his enemies - a king hunted like an animal. However, following a successful early raid on the English forces at Raploch Moss near Clatteringshaws, he had his first victory against the English forces at the battle of [[Battle of Glen Trool|Glen Trool]]. Though this was probably more of a minor skirmish in the guerrilla mode of [[William Wallace]], it was important from a propaganda point of view in the recruitment of men to Bruce's cause.\n\nIn 1929 on the 600th anniversary of Bruce's death, Bruce's Stone was placed high above the northern shore of Loch Trool from where legend has it that he had commanded the ambush which took place on the Steps of Trool on the other side of the loch. He lived for some 3 months as a fugitive in these hills before he was able to break out of his confinement and go on eventually to the much more significant victory at [[Bannockburn]] in 1314 which gave Scotland some relief in the first [[Wars of Scottish Independence|War of Independence]] and the near subjugation to the English Crown which had ensued after the death of [[Alexander II of Scotland|King Alexander III]] on 19 March 1286.\n\nRobert the Bruce's brother [[Edward Bruce|Edward]] who was later to become High King of Ireland had long since carried out a successful campaign against the Comyn/Balliol faction in the south west of Scotland before Bannockburn.\n\n===Covenanting fugitives===\nThrough most of the 17th century the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church in Scotland]] struggled against the will of the [[House of Stuart|Stewart Kings]] in their attempts to impose Anglican and even (with James II) Catholic practices in the [[Church of Scotland|Scottish Church]]. The Presbyterian Church claimed that every man was equal in the eyes of God, could read and understand the Bible for himself and therefore needed no hierarchical form of priesthood, especially one which was appointed under the patronage of the most powerful people in the land, to act between them and their God. The covenanters believed that the [[English Reformation|reformation]] settlement in England had simply replaced the power of the Pope over the church with the power of the king over it and they would not have their religious freedom laid down for them by the crown.\n\nIn some ways their principles were political harbingers on the path towards later principles of democratic forms of government and were seen at the time as dangerous sedition by kings who still believed in the [[Divine right of kings]]. The National Covenant was drawn up in 1638 and it is from this that the [[Covenanter]]s take their name - with reference beyond that to the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenants of the Bible]].The South West of Scotland was a particular hot bed of resistance to the will of the kings in religious matters and over time both sides in this conflict went to extreme ends to have their way.\n\n===Killing Times===\nThe full weight of the state was brought against the fanatical religious idealism of the Covenanters; most of whom were ordinary people. Over a protracted period of time they were hunted in the hills of Galloway much as Bruce had been and were prepared to risk summary and brutal execution for their beliefs if caught. Those suffering this fate were seen by their fellows as martyrs for the cause. Like the Bruce they were idealistic fugitives in the Galloway hills fighting for what they believed in and there were several battles between the covenanters and the crown forces in various parts of Scotland.\n\nIn their case however their struggles to survive in these hills and practice their beliefs there through conventicles <ref>[http://www.dumfriesmuseum.demon.co.uk/dumfstory07.html Dumfries Museums on Covenanting]</ref> are counted in years rather than months. Eighty two persons were summarily killed by the troops during [[the Killing Time]] (1684\u201385). Since these are only the ones which were witnessed and recorded the numbers could be much more. \"All over the more desolate parts the Covenanters were being massacred by the soldiers and their bodies left to rot on the heather where they fell. No records were kept of such killings; the victims were simply regarded as 'missing' for none of their relatives or friends knew how or where they had died. For many years after the killing times shepherds were continually finding on hills and moors the bleached skeletons of covenanters who had been killed in this way\".<ref>Robertson The Story of Galloway p.167</ref> The matter was not resolved until after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 when under [[William III of England|William of Orange]] presbyterianism was finally established as the faith of most Scots and the presbyterian Church of Scotland was accepted by the authorities as the established church although, though even he, a fellow Calvinist, found the more fanatical Presbyterians hard to handle.\n\nIn the 18th century the stonemason [[Robert Paterson (stonemason)|Robert Paterson]] devoted his life to going round the country restoring the monuments of the covenanting martyrs and Walter Scott used this real life character as the model for \"[[Old Mortality]]\".\nThe Galloway author S.R.Crockett wrote several covenanting novels set around the Galloway Hills, including ''The Men of the Moss Hags'', and ''Silver Sand''.\n\n===Smugglers and gypsies===\nThe 18th century was the heyday of [[smuggling]] along the Solway Coast<ref>Temperley p.271</ref> - sitting as it does only around 20 miles (30&nbsp;km) from the [[Isle of Man]], the pathway for most contraband goods. The Galloway hills offered a refuge for these far from idealistic lawless rogues and ruffians - somewhere to retreat to in times of trouble and as a safe route for the strings of up to 200 laden horses which carried their goods to Glasgow or Edinburgh. \"During the early 18th century Galloway was infested with gypsies,and it was no accident that Sir [[Walter Scott]] should have introduced Meg Merrilees and her tribe into his novel '[[Guy Mannering]]' which is set in the [[Stewartry]].\"<ref>Russell The Book of Galloway p. 185</ref>\nGypsy or \"Tinkler\" clans were heavily involved in the trafficking side of smuggling - getting the contraband to its market. The most notorious of these gypsy smugglers was Billy Marshall ([[King of the Gypsies]]) who is said to have fought at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690 at the age of 18 and died on 28 November 1792 \u2013 120 years old and having married 17 times.<ref>Temperley Tales of Galloway pp. 16-27</ref> He was also one of the leaders of the Levellers (not to be confused with the [[Levellers]] in England).

They lie within the bounds of [[Galloway Forest Park]], an area of some {{convert|300|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} of largely uninhabited wild land, managed by the [[Forestry Commission]]. The unusual place names reflect a mixture of the [[Old Norse]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] languages and hint at the range of influences which have acted on society  within the area over the centuries. \n[[File:Rhinns-of-Kells-from-Craignaw.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Looking north east over the Silver Flowe from [[Craignaw]] in the Dungeon hills with [[Corserine]] (just right of centre), and Carlin's Cairn (left of centre) on the Rhinns of Kells ridge - winter. The loch in the foreground is Long Loch of the Dungeon.]]\n[[File:Loch Trool from Buchan Hill.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Looking south west from Buchan Hill down Loch Trool.]]\n\n==Location==\nThe location of Galloway is described as follows, \"Galloway is contained by sea to the west ([[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]]) and south ([[Solway Firth]]), the \"Galloway Hills\" to the north, and the [[River Nith]] to the east\".<ref>[[Galloway]]</ref> So if we were to say \"The hills of Galloway\" we would be including all the hills within this area; but as the first sentence implies the \"Galloway Hills\" <ref>[http://leisure.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/paper-maps/paper-maps-ordnance-survey-great-britain/paper-maps-ordnance-survey-great-britain-os-landranger-map/dalmellington-and-new-galloway/pid-9780319229583 Ordnance Survey Map Sheet 77 Dalmellington and New Galloway]</ref> is usually taken to mean a collection of ranges which lie mainly south of [[Loch Doon]] and which are not constrained by political boundaries. The boundary between Dumfries and Galloway Region and [[Ayrshire]] runs west to east over [[Kirriereoch Hill|Kirriereoch hill]], drops south of [[Mullwharchar]] to the shores of [[Loch Enoch]], before heading northwards up the east shore of Loch Doon, and so runs more or less through what might well be considered the heart of the Galloway hills - around Loch Enoch.\n\n===Northern and western boundaries===\nThe northern limit of this hill area is around the small towns of [[Dalmellington]] and [[Straiton]], both in Ayrshire. The B741 runs on an east/west line between these two towns on its way to the town of [[Girvan]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]]. So the B741 could therefore be taken as the northern limit of the Galloway hills area.\nFrom Straiton a minor road (no name on the Ordnance Survey map) runs south by Stinchar Bridge <ref>[http://www.stincharvalley.co.uk/ The Stinchar Valley]</ref>   through the north west corner of these hills to meet another minor road which runs from [[Glentrool]] village northwards towards Girvan and [[Maybole]]. This latter road forms the western boundary of the Galloway hills. It follows the valley of Water of Minnoch <ref>[http://www.fishpal.com/Scotland/Galloway/AboutTheCree.asp Fishing on Rivers Cree and Water of Minnoch]</ref> and for most of its length it passes through the extensive forestry plantations which lie to the west of the Galloway hills.\n\n===Eastern boundary===\nThe A713 ([[Castle Douglas]] to [[Ayr]] road) forms the eastern boundary of these hills. As it heads south from Dalmellington it passes through the valley which separates the Galloway hills from the [[Carsphairn and Scaur Hills]] hills to the east. This valley is known as the Glenkens.<ref>[http://www.theglenkens.org.uk/ The Glenkens]</ref> There is an extensive hydro electric scheme (commissioned 1935/36) with several dams and power stations that runs down through the [[Galloway hydro-electric power scheme|Glenkens]]<ref>[http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2051995 International Water Power Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050809/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2051995 |date=14 June 2011 }}</ref> to end at Tongland Power Station <ref>[http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst8448.html Galloway Hydros Visitors Centre]</ref> near [[Kirkcudbright]]. \nThe A713 passes through Carsphairn village on the Water of Deuch and [[St John's Town of Dalry]] on [[Water of Ken]]. It also passes close to [[New Galloway]] at Kenbridge,<ref>[http://www.kenbridgehotel.co.uk/ Ken Bridge Hotel]</ref> at the northern end of Loch Ken. From New Galloway you can take the A712 through the hills to [[Newton Stewart]]. This road passes [[Clatteringshaws Loch|Clatteringshaws Reservoir]], the Queen's Way,<ref>[http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/New_Galloway Travel Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929050214/http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/New_Galloway |date=29 September 2009 }}</ref> Dunkitterick Cottage (the birthplace of [[Alexander Murray (linguist)|Alexander Murray]]), a deer range, a wild goat park and Murray's Monument.\n\n===Southern boundary===\n[[File:Grey Man of the Merrick.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grey Man of the Merrick.]]\nFor most users of these hills, \"the Galloway hills\" would mean the ranges which lie north of a line running eastwards along the north shores of [[Loch Trool]], [[River Dee, Galloway|Loch Dee]] and Clatteringshaws Reservoir. This for them would be the notional true heartland of the Galloway hills. The [[Southern Upland Way]] and the [[National Cycle Network]] Route Number Seven travel along this line. A slightly looser use of the phrase Galloway hills would certainly include the ranges which lie to the south of that line.\n\n===Outlying ranges to the south===\nAs you approach Clatteringshaws Reservoir on the A712 heading for Newton Stewart you have a hill called Cairnsmore of Dee or Black Craig of Dee (493 metres) to the south of you. This is not a particularly high hill but it offers excellent views from the top over Clatteringshaws into the heart of the Galloway hills. Likewise to the south as you pass Murray's Monument there is an outlying range of hills around [[Cairnsmore of Fleet]] (711 metres). The top of Cairnsmore of Fleet is over 2 kilometres in length running almost north-south and it has tops at either end. To the south of this again is a group of small coastal hills around Cairnharrow just to the west of [[Gatehouse of Fleet]]. Immediately beyond that is the [[A75 road|A75 Euroroute]] running close to the shore of the Solway Firth.\n\n==Hills named Cairnsmore==\nBesides the two Cairnsmore hills just mentioned there is a third \"Cairnsmore\" acting as a prominent sentinel around the borders of the Galloway hills. This is [[Cairnsmore of Carsphairn]] (797 metres) which lies some 5 kilometres to the north east of Carsphairn village and is the prominent hill to the east of you as you walk the Rhinns of Kells. It belongs in its own range, the Carsphairn hills.\n\n==Access roads==\n* Some two kilometres south of Dalmellington on the A713 you can pick up a forestry toll road which brings you down the west side of Loch Doon, passing the reconstructed Loch Doon Castle <ref>[http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst6458.html Gazetteer for Scotland]</ref> and bringing you out at Stinchar Bridge. You pass close to Loch Riecawr and Loch Bradan. The Barr to Loch Doon Cycle Route <ref>[http://www.ayrshirepaths.org.uk/barractivities.htm Ayrshire Paths]</ref> uses this forest road.\n* From Glentrool village there is a minor single track road that takes you eastward to Bruce's Stone on the northern side of Loch Trool, a distance of some 6 kilometres. The road stops here for vehicle traffic but the N7 National Cycle Network Route carries on from there right over to Clatteringshaws.\n* You can also take a car as far as Craigencallie (Ordnance Survey ref. NX503780) which lies about half way between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws. Access to the single track road which takes you there is just west of the Dam at Clatteringshaws reservoir on the A712.\n\n==Three ridges==\n\nAs mentioned above the heartland of the Galloway hills lies to the north of Loch Trool and many excellent walks into that particularly wild remote territory start from the extensive car park by Bruce's Stone. There are three ridges which run northwards from the Loch Trool/Loch Dee/Clatteringshaws area - The [[Range of the Awful Hand|Awful Hand]] on the west, The Rhinns of Kells to the east, and the Dungeon hills in between.\n\n===Awful Hand===\n[[File:Dungeon Hills and Awful Hand from the Saddle between Millfire and Corserine.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Dungeon Hills and Awful Hand from the Saddle between Millfire and Corserine in the Rhinns of Kells. 01 Dungeon Hill - 02 Merrick - 03 Little Spear of Merrick - 04 Kirriereoch - 05 Mullwharchar - 06 Tarfessock - 07 Shalloch on Minnoch - 08 Hoodens Hill.]]\nTaking the Awful Hand from north to south we have the following tops [[Shalloch on Minnoch]] (768 metres), Tarfessock (697 metres), [[Kirriereoch Hill|Kirriereoch]] (786), [[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]] (843 metres) and [[Benyellary]] (719 metres). Merrick is the highest hill in the south of Scotland though at less than three thousand feet it is not a [[Munro]]. These five hills have ridges running off them to the west making the \"Awful Hand\", Benyellary being the thumb. This hand is best seen from near Waterhead on Minnoch as you head south from Stinchar Bridge towards Glentrool village. The Awful Hand ridge is 9 kilometres in length as the crow flies; from the top of Shalloch on Minnoch to the top of Benyellary. This sounds like not very much but there are some stiff climbs along the route especially around Kirriereoch and the Merrick. Also you have some 3 kilometres walk in to the two terminal tops from any road.\n\n===Rhinns of Kells===\n[[File:Rhinns of Kells Range from Cairnsmore of Carsphairn Hills.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Rhinns of Kells Range from Cairnsmore of Carsphairn Hills 01 Meikle Millyea - 02 Milldown - 03 Millfire - 04 Corserine - 05 Craigrine - 06 Carlin's Cairn - 07 Cairnsgarroch - 08 Meaul - 09 Bow - 10 Coran of Portmark - 11 Black Craig.]]\nTaking the Rhinns of Kells from north to south we start on Black Craig (528 metres) on the east bank of Loch Doon, followed by Coran of Portmark (623 metres), Meaul (695 metres), Carlin's Cairn (807), [[Corserine]] (814 metres), Millfire (716 metres), Milldown (738 metres) Meikle Millyea (746 metres), Little Millyea (578 metres) and Darrou (479). Darrou lies about half way between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws. The Rhinns of Kells is 15.5 kilometres as the crow flies from Black Craig to Darrou and the ridge has a double curve on it making it somewhat longer than that. It tends to be a gently undulating ridge along its length making for relatively easy walking.\n\n===Dungeon hills===\n[[File:Lochs Enoch, Arron and Neldricken, the Dungeon Hills and the Rhinns of Kells from Merrick.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Lochs Enoch, Arron and Neldricken, the Dungeon hills and the Rhinns of Kells from Merrick. 01 Milldown - 02 Meikle Millyea - 03 Cairnsmore of Dee - 04 Dungeon Hill - 05 Loch Enoch - 06 Nick of the Dungeon - 07 Craig Neldricken - 08 Craignaw - 09 Clatteringshaws Reservoir - 10 Loch Arron - 11 Loch Neldricken - 12 Craiglee]]\nTaking the Dungeon hills from north to south we have Craigmawhannal (357 metres) just south of the south end of Loch Doon, followed by, Hoodens hill (568 metres), [[Mullwharchar]] (692 metres), Dungeon hill (610 metres). Craignairny (595 metres), [[Craignaw]] (645 metres), Snibe hill (533 metres) and Craiglee (531 metres). Craiglee is to an extent an outlier from the main ridge lying as it does at the eastern end of the Rig of the Jarkness which runs east to west. Craiglee is just north of Loch Dee. The Dungeons, as they are often called, are 11 kilometres from the top of Craigmawhannal to the top of Craiglee as the crow flies. None of these hills get to the same heights as some hills on the other two ridges. However, apart from Mullwharchar they are much more rocky and rugged and are therefore popular with the rock climber and those who like a bit of scrambling when they walk in the hills. \nA planning application was made in January 1978 to Kyle and Carrick District Council by the UKAEA to test drill on Mullwharchar for the purpose of dumping nuclear waste. On 24 October 1978, the Council rejected the application after considerable local protest.<ref>[http://www.scottishhills.com/html/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=4939 Scottish Hills Forums]</ref>\n\n==Between the ridges==\nThere is relatively low ground between the Dungeons ridge and the other two ridges on either side of it and this lower ground passes through the whole hill area from north to south forming two corridors through the hills.\n\nHowever, the surface of the highest loch in the corridor to the west of the Dungeons, Loch Enoch, is actually around 490 metres above sea level. With Loch Trool being about 70 metres above sea level you can see that this corridor rises significantly as it passes (over a distance of some 5 kilometres) between the hills on either side.\n\nThe surface of Dry Loch of the Dungeon the highest loch to the east of the Dungeons is around 330 metres above sea level and most of the Silver Flowe immediately to the south of it lies fairly level at about the 270 metres mark all the way back south to Loch Dee (around 225 metres above sea level). The explanation for this is that the Silver Flowe is a floating or blanket bog and is consequently flat in nature.\n\n===Lochs between the Awful Hand and the Dungeons===\n[[File:View over Lochs Arron, Neldricken and Valley to Minnigaff Hills.jpg|thumb|right|450px|View over Lochs Arron, Neldricken and Valley to Minnigaff Hills 01 Craignaw - 02 Craig Neldricken - 03 Loch Arron - 04 Loch Neldricken - 05 Craiglee - 06 Millfore - 07 Cairnsmore of Fleet - 08 White Hill - 09 Curleywee - 10 Bennanbrack - 11 Lamachan - 12 Glenhead Lochs - 13 Rig of the Jarkness - 14 Loch Valley - 15 Buchan Ridge.]]\n\nThere are two [[Burn (topography)|burns]] which feed into the eastern end of Loch Trool on its northern shore, the Buchan Burn (the more westerly) and the Gairland Burn.\n\nThese two burns are separated by a short ridge, (3 kilometres long), which runs north from Buchan Hill just north of Loch Trool to Craig Neldricken immediately south of Loch Enoch - the Buchan Ridge.\n\nIt is quite possible to use the Buchan Burn route to get to Loch Enoch and you will pass the Grey Man of the Merrick (see picture above), on your left as you near Loch Enoch (OS ref. NX427842). The more popular route however, because of the scenic interest, is to take the Gairland Burn and head north past [[Loch Valley]], [[Loch Neldricken]] and [[Loch Arron]] before you get to Loch Enoch. This is often called the \"Loch's Route onto The Merrick\" - though you still have a 350-metre climb up Redstone Rig from Loch Enoch to the Merrick.\n\nTaking the west side of Loch Neldricken you will pass a place called in the maps the \"Murder Hole\" which refers to an incident in [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett|Samuel Crockett's]] novel \"The Raiders\" - though it is claimed that the real murder hole is near Rowantree Bridge (OS Ref NX354907) on the Water of Minnoch where the bodies of waylaid, murdered travellers were dumped.<ref>Temperley, Alan (1979) Tales of Galloway p129 footnote.</ref>\n\nIf you go east of Loch Neldricken you can gain access to Loch Enoch by the Wolf Slock. Both of these latter named places figure prominently in the Crockett novel. The sharp granite sand on the beaches of Loch Enoch itself was at one time collected and sold for sharpening knives and scythes.<ref>McBain The Merrick and the Neighbouring Hills (1980 edition) p139</ref>\n\nIn McBain's book \"The Merrick and Neighbouring Hills\" there is a description of how McBain tried to find the depth of Loch Enoch by cutting a series of holes on its icy surface and dropping a weighted line into it - quite alone when he did so. He worked out a depth of 105 feet at what he reckoned was the deepest point.<ref>McBain pp146-154</ref> McBain was an intrepid hill walker/climber who was much devoted to these hills and his book exudes his love for the wild places. It is an excellent read for anyone interested in walking hills in general but especially these hills.\n\n===Silver Flowe===\n[[File:Silver Flowe from Dungeon Hill.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Silver Flowe from Dungeon Hill. Backhill of Bush is behind the trees on the left edge of the picture. The loch in the foreground is Long Loch of the Dungeon and the loch in the distance by the right edge of the picture is Loch Dee. Meikle Millyea is on the left edge leading down to Little Millyea and Darrou as the Rhinns of Kells ridge descends into the gap between Loch Dee and Clatteringshaws.]]\n[[File:Ralph Furlow Monument.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Ralph Furlow Monument with Loch Dungeon and Meikle Millyea.]]\nThe Silver Flowe is a [[National Nature Reserves in Scotland|National Nature Reserve]] with a [[Blanket bog]] of international importance. It is part of the Merrick Kells Biosphere Reserve<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&code=UKM+10 UNESC-MAB Biospheres Reserves Directory]</ref> and is a Ramsar site <ref>[http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1391 List of Ramsar Sites in Scotland]</ref> for the quality of its peatlands and wetlands. The [[Ramsar Convention]], is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation of wetlands and their resources. The convention is the only global environmental treaty that deals with a particular ecosystem; it takes its name from the Iranian city of Ramsar and came into force in 1975. The reserve is owned by [[Forestry Commission|Forest Enterprise]] but is managed through a lease by [[Scottish Natural Heritage]].\n\n===Backhill of Bush===\nToday Backhill of Bush is open as a bothy, having been renovated after a period of closure due to vandalism. However until around 1950 it was still in use as the home of a shepherd (or \"Hird\" in local parlance) working a part of the land known as the Dungeon of Buchan and was reckoned to be the loneliest such outpost in Galloway with the Silver Flowe to the west and the Rhinns of Kells to the east.\n\nSoon after this the land was taken over by the Forestry Commission and the sheep grazings became dense forest, but not before the death of a 17-year-old shepherd called Ralph Furlow, an employee of the Department of Agriculture, whose job it was to cross the Rhinns of Kells to tend to the sheep still in the Dungeon area. On 27 January 1954 he was overwhelmed in a snow storm and his death is commemorated by a monument just below Millfire on its east side.<ref>McFadzean Dave (2004) Tales 'o the Back Buss pp. 65-67</ref>\n\n===Access into the heart of the Galloway hills from the east and west===\nThe route Ralph Furlow would have used to cross the Rhinns was that used by the former residents of Back Hill - going over the saddle between Corserine and Millfire (OS. Ref NX516863). In earlier times a funeral party taking a \"hird's\" wife's dead body over the Rhinns was caught in a snowstorm in this saddle and the body had to be left there for several days.<ref>McFadzean p24</ref>\n\nHeading west from Back Hill for the Loch Enoch area the route taken was up the Nick of the Dungeon, a steep boulder-strewn climb, after you had negotiated your way through the watery pools of the Silver Flowe. Months could pass between seeing anyone else from the outside world. The \"hirds\" and their families had therefore to be both resourceful and self-reliant to spend their working lives there, and it will always be one of the attractions for those who go into wild country like this that you are forced to take responsibility for yourself; the place asks questions of you that you are obliged to take seriously.\n\n==Habitation in the Galloway hills==\nThere are the remains of several other former buildings scattered around the Galloway hills area; notably at Glenhead (NX433800) close to the Southern Upland Way for example, and at Culsharg (NX416822) on the \"tourist route\" from Bruce's Stone to the Merrick. The latter can still be used as something of a shelter in bad weather, though it is far from MBA bothy standard. Buildings still in use are to be found around the periphery of the Galloway hills heartland but apart from forest tracks, there are neither public roads nor buildings in use in the heartland itself.\n\n==Minnigaff hills==\nThese hills (which offer excellent views into the heartland of the Galloway hills) lie just south of the east end of Loch Trool and they stretch to the shores of Clatteringshaws Reservoir. Their southern boundary is the A712 New Galloway to Newton Stewart road.\n\nThe battle which Bruce's Stone commemorates was actually fought (in 1307) at the south east end of Loch Trool where Muldonnoch (561 metres) falls steeply into it. South east of Muldonnoch is Lamachan Hill (717 metres), and from there you can head south west along a ridge to Large Hill (676 metres) or head east over Bennanbrack (685 metres) to Curleywee (674 metres) where you join a small ridge that runs north/south. North takes you one and a half kilometres over White Hill (606 metres) to Loch Dee. The southern ridge is some three and a half kilometres long gradually dropping in height over its length to Black Benwee (368 metres).\n\nSome two kilometres east of Loch Dee a ridge of hills runs from just south of Darrou in a south westerly direction and in fact these hills are really a continuation of the line of the Rhinns of Kells. From north to south the hills are Cairngarroch (557 metres) Cairnbaber (569 metres above the Buckdas of Cairnbaber), Millfore (656 metres) and Drigmorn Hill (545 metres).\n\nThere is also a small range of hills just to the west of Clatteringshaws Reservoir. On Darnaw (472 metres) the highest of these hills there is monument to those who died here in an air crash on 2 February 1937.<ref>[http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/dragonfly_nx5176.htm Air Crash Sites Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106035149/http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/dragonfly_nx5176.htm |date=6 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Air crash sites==\n[[File:Galloway Hills frozen waterfall.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A frozen waterfall in the Galloway Hills.]]\nBesides the air crash site just mentioned on Darnaw there are many more crash sites (some with monuments) in the Galloway hills area. There is a monument on Cairnsmore of Fleet which lists 9 aircraft which have crashed there. There is a monument on [[Craignaw]] to the pilots of an F-111 which crashed there on 19 December 1979. During World War II, Dumfries and several other places in south west Scotland were heavily involved in the training of pilots etc. for the war effort and many of the crash sites date from this era.<ref>[http://www.dumfriesaviationmuseum.com/ Dumfries Aviation Museum]</ref><ref>[http://www.walkscotland.plus.com/Galloway/pages/ngairycrsh/02.htm List of air crash sites in Galloway]</ref>\n\n==Galloway Forest Park==\nThe whole area of hills that we have been discussing on this page falls within [[Galloway Forest Park]], an area of {{convert|300|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} of mixed landscape with three visitors' centres and offering many recreational facilities. On 15 November 2009, the park became the first [[Dark-sky preserve|Dark Sky Park]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Galloway hills in Scottish history==\nLike the [[Outer Hebrides|Western Isles]] and the [[Northern Isles]], Galloway had a long history under the [[Lords of Galloway]] (from the early 12th century until 1234) of being largely independent of the Scottish crown. Going back beyond that there is thought to have been a kingdom of Galloway perhaps going back to the aftermath of the expulsion of the Vikings from Dublin in 902 and the subsequent loss of control by the former Northumbrian masters of Galloway.<ref>Oram, Richard (2000) The Lordship of Galloway p. 1</ref> \nGalloway was long regarded as a wild and lawless place - somewhat other from the mainstream of Scottish Culture, which was as much as anything to do with its remoteness and inaccessibility. The Galloway hills played an important part in this image especially as at various point in history it was a place of refuge for fugitives who did not fit into, or defied, the power structure of their times There is still a sense of otherness about the place.\n\n===\"Cradle of Independence\" - A king as a fugitive===\n[[File:Bruce's Stone, Loch Trool Muldonnoch and 1307 Battle Location from Eschoncan.jpg|thumb|right|360px|View from Eschoncan over part of the car park at Bruce's Stone Glentrool to the scene of the Battle of Glentrool (1307) at Steps of Trool (marked with a blue asterisk) on the far side of Loch Trool with Mulldonoch beyond. Bruce's Stone can be seen right of centre in the foreground (small red asterisk below it)]]\n[[File:Bruce's Stone.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Bruce's Stone Glentrool.]]\n[[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] was crowned [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scotland]] on 25 March 1306 little more than a month after he had been involved at Dumfries in the murder of [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]], otherwise known as the Red Comyn, (a serious rival for the kingship of Scotland, as his mother was Eleanor Balliol who was the eldest daughter of [[John I de Balliol]]) \n.<ref>[http://www.dumfriesmuseum.demon.co.uk/dumfstory04.html Dumfries Museum - Bruce and Comyn]</ref> Another branch of the Comyn family at his time was that of [[John Comyn, Earl of Buchan|John Comyn]] [[Earl of Buchan]]. His father Alexander had been Sheriff of Wigtown (1263\u20131266) and a Guardian of Scotland (1286\u201389), and they held land in the south west of Scotland before being granted the lands in [[Buchan]] - which explains why there are place names with Buchan in them in the Galloway hills area like Buchan Hill and Dungeon of Buchan.\n\nBruce's army lost to [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s forces at the [[Battle of Methven]] in June 1306 and he became a fugitive hunted not only by the occupying forces of Edward but also by the Comyns and the [[House of Balliol|Balliols]]. He escaped to [[Rathlin Island]] off the Irish coast but by February 1307 he was back in Scotland, in the Galloway hills,  with a tiny handful of followers and totally encircled by his enemies - a king hunted like an animal. However, following a successful early raid on the English forces at Raploch Moss near Clatteringshaws, he had his first victory against the English forces at the battle of [[Battle of Glen Trool|Glen Trool]]. Though this was probably more of a minor skirmish in the guerrilla mode of [[William Wallace]], it was important from a propaganda point of view in the recruitment of men to Bruce's cause.\n\nIn 1929 on the 600th anniversary of Bruce's death, Bruce's Stone was placed high above the northern shore of Loch Trool from where legend has it that he had commanded the ambush which took place on the Steps of Trool on the other side of the loch. He lived for some 3 months as a fugitive in these hills before he was able to break out of his confinement and go on eventually to the much more significant victory at [[Bannockburn]] in 1314 which gave Scotland some relief in the first [[Wars of Scottish Independence|War of Independence]] and the near subjugation to the English Crown which had ensued after the death of [[Alexander II of Scotland|King Alexander III]] on 19 March 1286.\n\nRobert the Bruce's brother [[Edward Bruce|Edward]] who was later to become High King of Ireland had long since carried out a successful campaign against the Comyn/Balliol faction in the south west of Scotland before Bannockburn.\n\n===Covenanting fugitives===\nThrough most of the 17th century the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church in Scotland]] struggled against the will of the [[House of Stuart|Stewart Kings]] in their attempts to impose Anglican and even (with James II) Catholic practices in the [[Church of Scotland|Scottish Church]]. The Presbyterian Church claimed that every man was equal in the eyes of God, could read and understand the Bible for himself and therefore needed no hierarchical form of priesthood, especially one which was appointed under the patronage of the most powerful people in the land, to act between them and their God. The covenanters believed that the [[English Reformation|reformation]] settlement in England had simply replaced the power of the Pope over the church with the power of the king over it and they would not have their religious freedom laid down for them by the crown.\n\nIn some ways their principles were political harbingers on the path towards later principles of democratic forms of government and were seen at the time as dangerous sedition by kings who still believed in the [[Divine right of kings]]. The National Covenant was drawn up in 1638 and it is from this that the [[Covenanter]]s take their name - with reference beyond that to the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenants of the Bible]].The South West of Scotland was a particular hot bed of resistance to the will of the kings in religious matters and over time both sides in this conflict went to extreme ends to have their way.\n\n===Killing Times===\nThe full weight of the state was brought against the fanatical religious idealism of the Covenanters; most of whom were ordinary people. Over a protracted period of time they were hunted in the hills of Galloway much as Bruce had been and were prepared to risk summary and brutal execution for their beliefs if caught. Those suffering this fate were seen by their fellows as martyrs for the cause. Like the Bruce they were idealistic fugitives in the Galloway hills fighting for what they believed in and there were several battles between the covenanters and the crown forces in various parts of Scotland.\n\nIn their case however their struggles to survive in these hills and practice their beliefs there through conventicles <ref>[http://www.dumfriesmuseum.demon.co.uk/dumfstory07.html Dumfries Museums on Covenanting]</ref> are counted in years rather than months. Eighty two persons were summarily killed by the troops during [[the Killing Time]] (1684\u201385). Since these are only the ones which were witnessed and recorded the numbers could be much more. \"All over the more desolate parts the Covenanters were being massacred by the soldiers and their bodies left to rot on the heather where they fell. No records were kept of such killings; the victims were simply regarded as 'missing' for none of their relatives or friends knew how or where they had died. For many years after the killing times shepherds were continually finding on hills and moors the bleached skeletons of covenanters who had been killed in this way\".<ref>Robertson The Story of Galloway p.167</ref> The matter was not resolved until after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 when under [[William III of England|William of Orange]] presbyterianism was finally established as the faith of most Scots and the presbyterian Church of Scotland was accepted by the authorities as the established church although, though even he, a fellow Calvinist, found the more fanatical Presbyterians hard to handle.\n\nIn the 18th century the stonemason [[Robert Paterson (stonemason)|Robert Paterson]] devoted his life to going round the country restoring the monuments of the covenanting martyrs and Walter Scott used this real life character as the model for \"[[Old Mortality]]\".\nThe Galloway author S.R.Crockett wrote several covenanting novels set around the Galloway Hills, including ''The Men of the Moss Hags'', and ''Silver Sand''.\n\n===Smugglers and gypsies===\nThe 18th century was the heyday of [[smuggling]] along the Solway Coast<ref>Temperley p.271</ref> - sitting as it does only around 20 miles (30&nbsp;km) from the [[Isle of Man]], the pathway for most contraband goods. The Galloway hills offered a refuge for these far from idealistic lawless rogues and ruffians - somewhere to retreat to in times of trouble and as a safe route for the strings of up to 200 laden horses which carried their goods to Glasgow or Edinburgh. \"During the early 18th century Galloway was infested with gypsies,and it was no accident that Sir [[Walter Scott]] should have introduced Meg Merrilees and her tribe into his novel '[[Guy Mannering]]' which is set in the [[Stewartry]].\"<ref>Russell The Book of Galloway p. 185</ref>\nGypsy or \"Tinkler\" clans were heavily involved in the trafficking side of smuggling - getting the contraband to its market. The most notorious of these gypsy smugglers was Billy Marshall ([[King of the Gypsies]]) who is said to have fought at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690 at the age of 18 and died on 28 November 1792 \u2013 120 years old and having married 17 times.<ref>Temperley Tales of Galloway pp. 16-27</ref> He was also one of the leaders of the Levellers (not to be confused with the [[Levellers]] in England). The actions of the Galloway Levellers have been described as the \"most significant agrarian rebellion\" in 18th century Scotland.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Valerie|date=April 2010|title=Presbyterian Moral Economy: The Covenanting Tradition and Popular Protest in Lowland Scotland, 1707\u2013c. 1746|journal=Scottish Historical Review|volume=89|issue=227|page=59|jstor=27867608}}</ref> They knocked down dykes during the night as quickly as enclosing landlords built them during the day.<ref>Russell The Book of Galloway pp. 51-52</ref> The Galloway author S.R.Crockett uses the Levellers Rebellion as a sub-plot in his novel ''The Dark o' the Moon'''which is set in the Galloway Hills, especially around the Dungeon Range.  Crockett wrote several other stories of Galloway smugglers and gypsies <ref>http://www.gallowayraiders.co.uk</ref>\n\nAnother story from west Galloway which helped to give an extra edge to the picture of lawlessness in the area was the legend of the extensive cannibal family of [[Sawney Bean]].\n\nScotland's National Bard [[Robert Burns]] was an excise man in eastern Galloway at the time of his death in 1796.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Atkinson, Tom (1982)'''South West Scotland''' Luath Press Barr Ayrshire\n* Crockett S.R.
