The buildings were fit for audio-related work since they were previously used by [[SME Limited|SME]], the English [[tonearm]] designer who felt the downturn in tonearm sales due to the introduction of the new digital media CD. SRE housed a prototype shop and listening rooms, ranging from [[anechoic chamber|semi-anechoic]] to typical small living rooms. Also available was advanced equipment like a laser [[interferometer]] and [[PDP-11]]/35 computer.\n\nApproximately twenty staff support the research facility. Engineers of note who have worked there in R&D include Ray Greenwood, Dr. Steve Roe, Dr. John Dibb, Dr. Glyn Adams, Dr. Peter Fryer and Laurence Dickie.\n\nThe design of B&W loudspeaker cabinets has been done by industrial designer [[Kenneth Grange]] since 1975. [[Morten Villiers Warren]] became manager of design in the late 90's when designing the new 800 series of speakers.\n\nNoteworthy loudspeaker innovations by B&W:\n*The patented use of [[Kevlar]] fibres, impregnated with a stiffening resin, resulting in B&W's distinctive yellow [[speaker cone]]s started in 1974.  This [[composite material]] proved to provide controlled rigidity and internal [[damping]], minimising distortion, as Fryer determined by using laser interferometry on speaker cones.\n*Phase linear transmission was realised in the DM6 from 1976. In the DM6, the speakers are mounted in different vertical planes.\n*In 1977 the DM7 introduced a [[tweeter]] separate from the main speaker cabinet. This has been a feature of many B&W speaker designs since.\n*Dickie invented the 'Matrix' enclosure which reduces cabinet sound colouration. This bracing topology resembles a wine-case, providing multiple thin panel-braces, spaced throughout the enclosure, improving rigidity. This was in response to Celestion's SL6000 loudspeaker that was made with Aerolam cabinet walls. Dickie's response was to use the same concept but make it all the way through the cabinet rather than just the walls. Matrix has been used with great success by B&W ever since. \n*The 'Nautilus' speaker resulted from research commenced by Bowers into [[dipole speaker|'perfect dipoles']]. Before Bowers died, he handed this research to the young Dickie who discovered the principle of the exponential tapered tube. The Nautilus project was one of the most extensive research and development projects undertaken. Instead of open-backed drivers, it uses drivers loaded by reverse-tapered [[horn loudspeaker|horns]], or exponentially diminishing tubes, to absorb the rear radiation. The construction is based on [[fibre-reinforced plastic]] enclosures. The result of the distinct speaker shape was a near perfect response and near-zero enclosure colouration.\n*The 'Flowport' is an improvement that reduces friction in the air moving through the [[bass reflex]] vent. This is realised by covering the surface of the vent with dimples, just like a [[golf ball]].\n* The diamond tweeter was developed to create the optimal ratio of tweeter dome mass and material stiffness. The tweeter is grown into shape by [[Chemical vapor deposition of diamond|chemical vapour deposition]].\n\n==Products==\n\n===Speakers===\nB&W offers a full range of speakers and home audio systems including the Nautilus speakers and Panorama home theatre systems.\n\nThe Bowers & Wilkins [[Zeppelin (iPod speaker system)|Zeppelin iPod speaker system]] incorporates Apple's wireless AirPlay system<ref>[http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/Speakers/iPod-and-Computer-Speakers/Zeppelin-Air/airplay.html Zeppelin Airplay integration]</ref> and the range also features MM1 range to connect to either desktop pcs or laptops.\n\n===Headphones===\nBowers & Wilkins have a range of high quality headphones and earphones.<ref>[http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/Headphones B&W Headphones]</ref>\n\n===Car Audio===\nSince 2007 Bowers & Wilkins have been in partnership with [[Jaguar cars|Jaguar]] to develop in-car audio systems for cars in their range, including the [[Jaguar XJ|XJ]], [[Jaguar XK|XK]] and [[Jaguar XF|XF]].

It was started after [[World War II]] by Bowers and Roy Wilkins who had met while serving in the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] during the war.<ref>[http://www.bowersandwilkins.com/our%20history.html Bowers and Wilkins Ltd \u2013 Electronics Shop]</ref> The shop expanded to include televisions retail, a rentals business and a service department run by Peter Hayward. When the shop began supplying public address equipment to schools and churches in Sussex, Bowers became increasingly involved in the design and assembly of loudspeakers, eventually setting up a small production line in workshops behind the shop.\n\n===1960s===\nIn 1966, Bowers started a separate business \u2013 B&W Loudspeakers Ltd. and was no longer involved with the shop itself. The first production line was established in the workshops in the shop's backyard. The shop still exists to this day, and the remnants of the original production line can still be seen.  The shop is now owned by and managed by Roy's son Paul Wilkins, who together with Chris Hugill used to run the UK distribution arm of B&W, B&W Loudspeakers UK Ltd.  They also acted as the UK distribution of the aforementioned Aura range of electronics, and Nakamichi, regarded as the world's foremost manufacturer of compact cassette decks and associated electronics.\n\nThe 1967 P1 was the first commercial speaker from B&W. The cabinet and filter were B&W's own, but the drivers came from [[EMI]] and [[Celestion]]. The profits of the P1 allowed Bowers to purchase a Radiometer Oscillator and [[chart recorder|Pen Recorder]], allowing for calibration certificates for every speaker sold.\n\nIn 1968, Audioscript in the Netherlands became the first international [[Distribution (business)|distributor]] appointed. The DM1 (Domestic Monitor) and DM3 are introduced.\n\nDennis Ward (a former technical manager at [[EMI]]) became member of the board in 1969.\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970, the ionovac-tweeter equipped P2 speakers produced were licensed by [[Sony]], produced in Worthing to be distributed in Japan.<ref>http://www.ionovac.com/contributions.htm</ref>\n\nBowers decided to develop a loudspeaker wholly built in-house. The sizeable DM70 from 1970 combined [[Electrostatic loudspeaker|electrostatic]] mid- and high range on top of a traditional bass unit. The distinct shape of the loudspeaker won a British Industrial Design Award. Good press reviews made exports starting to rise.\n\nIn 1972 a new production facility was opened in Meadow Road, Worthing. Housing [[anechoic chamber]]s and extensive [[Bruel & Kjaer]] measurement equipment, the research team investigated phase linearity and [[speaker cone]] construction using laser [[interferometry]].\n\n1972 also saw the introduction of the DM2, a three unit system, comprising an 8&nbsp;inch bass/mid-range speaker rear loaded with an [[Acoustic transmission line|acoustic line]], a [[Celestion]] HF1300 tweeter and a super tweeter.\n\nB&W received the [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Award]] for Export in 1973, and built programme [[studio monitor|content monitors]] for the BBC.\n\nIn 1974, Grange was appointed as [[industrial designer]].\n\nThe 1976 DM6 loudspeaker introduced Kevlar cones and phase linear filter and enclosure design. The Steyning research facility is opened and a PDP11/35 computer is acquired.\n\nThe 1977 DM7 showed a tweeter separate from the main cabinet and a passive radiator.\n\nAfter a tenfold increase in export since 1973, the second Queen's Award for Export is awarded in 1978.\n\nThe 801 loudspeaker, taking three years of development, was introduced in 1979.\n\n===1980s===\n\nResearch into amplifiers and active filters leads to the Active One loudspeaker, branded under the name of ''John Bowers'' in 1984.\n\nThe 800 loudspeaker range was improved into matrix versions with a very rigid cabinet construction in 1987.\n\nIn December 1987 Bowers died. In the same year, John Dibb joined the company, later to become responsible for many speaker designs, notably several signature models.\n\nThe 1987 'Concept 90' CM1 loudspeaker was the first B&W speaker with a plastic matrix cabinet.\n\n===1990s===\n\nSilver Signature loudspeaker was launched to commemorate the company's 25th anniversary.\n\nIncreasing demand led to by opening an additional production site at Silverdale, Worthing, West Sussex in 1992.\n\nThe 1993 'Nautilus' speaker still remains the company's flagship product. In 1998, Nautilus technology was introduced in the somewhat more affordable Nautilus 800 series.\n\n===2000s===\n\nIn 2002 B&W moved its Worthing production, warehousing and head office to a new \u00a37&nbsp;million location on a former landfill site in Dale Road, Worthing. A second plant was built in Bradford.\n\nB&W took over its own production factory for cabinets Agerb\u00e6k, Denmark in 2003. In the same year, the Bradford location was left for new premises in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire. \nIn 2005, Bowers & Wilkins replaced its top-of-the-line N800 range with the new 800D range.  The most publicised change was the introduction of diamond dome tweeters on some models<ref>[http://hifinet.co.kr/index.php?/wiki/Bowers_and_Wilkins/ Bowers and Wilkins | Hifinet Wiki]</ref> 2005 also saw B&W receive the Queen's Award for Innovation for the tube-loaded drivers on the 800's.<ref>[http://www.queensawards.org.uk/business/Winners/2005_.html :: The Queen's Award for Enterprise ::<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403203552/http://www.queensawards.org.uk/business/Winners/2005_.html |date=3 April 2009 }}</ref> The EISA Award for European High End Audio Component of the Year is awarded to the 803D.  The PV1 receives the European Home Theatre Subwoofer of the year 2005\u20132006 award. The XT series introduced aluminium as a speaker cabinet material.\n\nIn 2007 the 'Zeppelin' [[iPod]] speaker system was introduced.\n\nIn 2008, the \"[[Jaguar XF#Sound system|Jaguar XF Audio System]]\" was introduced, a car audio setup with 14 speakers and a powered 440 Watt [[Electronic amplifier#Class B and AB|Class AB]] [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] amplifier.\n\nBowers & Wilkins' latest project is the Society of Sound.

It was started after [[World War II]] by Bowers and Roy Wilkins who had met while serving in the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] during the war.<ref>[http://www.bowersandwilkins.com/our%20history.html Bowers and Wilkins Ltd \u2013 Electronics Shop]</ref> The shop expanded to include televisions retail, a rentals business and a service department run by Peter Hayward. When the shop began supplying public address equipment to schools and churches in Sussex, Bowers became increasingly involved in the design and assembly of loudspeakers, eventually setting up a small production line in workshops behind the shop.\n\n===1960s===\nIn 1966, Bowers started a separate business \u2013 B&W Loudspeakers Ltd. and was no longer involved with the shop itself. The first production line was established in the workshops in the shop's backyard. The shop still exists to this day, and the remnants of the original production line can still be seen.  The shop is now owned by and managed by Roy's son Paul Wilkins, who together with Chris Hugill used to run the UK distribution arm of B&W, B&W Loudspeakers UK Ltd.  They also acted as the UK distribution of the aforementioned Aura range of electronics, and Nakamichi, regarded as the world's foremost manufacturer of compact cassette decks and associated electronics.\n\nThe 1967 P1 was the first commercial speaker from B&W. The cabinet and filter were B&W's own, but the drivers came from [[EMI]] and [[Celestion]]. The profits of the P1 allowed Bowers to purchase a Radiometer Oscillator and [[chart recorder|Pen Recorder]], allowing for calibration certificates for every speaker sold.\n\nIn 1968, Audioscript in the Netherlands became the first international [[Distribution (business)|distributor]] appointed. The DM1 (Domestic Monitor) and DM3 are introduced.\n\nDennis Ward (a former technical manager at [[EMI]]) became member of the board in 1969.\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1970, the ionovac-tweeter equipped P2 speakers produced were licensed by [[Sony]], produced in Worthing to be distributed in Japan.<ref>http://www.ionovac.com/contributions.htm</ref>\n\nBowers decided to develop a loudspeaker wholly built in-house. The sizeable DM70 from 1970 combined [[Electrostatic loudspeaker|electrostatic]] mid- and high range on top of a traditional bass unit. The distinct shape of the loudspeaker won a British Industrial Design Award. Good press reviews made exports starting to rise.\n\nIn 1972 a new production facility was opened in Meadow Road, Worthing. Housing [[anechoic chamber]]s and extensive [[Bruel & Kjaer]] measurement equipment, the research team investigated phase linearity and [[speaker cone]] construction using laser [[interferometry]].\n\n1972 also saw the introduction of the DM2, a three unit system, comprising an 8&nbsp;inch bass/mid-range speaker rear loaded with an [[Acoustic transmission line|acoustic line]], a [[Celestion]] HF1300 tweeter and a super tweeter.\n\nB&W received the [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Award]] for Export in 1973, and built programme [[studio monitor|content monitors]] for the BBC.\n\nIn 1974, Grange was appointed as [[industrial designer]].\n\nThe 1976 DM6 loudspeaker introduced Kevlar cones and phase linear filter and enclosure design. The Steyning research facility is opened and a PDP11/35 computer is acquired.\n\nThe 1977 DM7 showed a tweeter separate from the main cabinet and a passive radiator.\n\nAfter a tenfold increase in export since 1973, the second Queen's Award for Export is awarded in 1978.\n\nThe 801 loudspeaker, taking three years of development, was introduced in 1979.\n\n===1980s===\n\nResearch into amplifiers and active filters leads to the Active One loudspeaker, branded under the name of ''John Bowers'' in 1984.\n\nThe 800 loudspeaker range was improved into matrix versions with a very rigid cabinet construction in 1987.\n\nIn December 1987 Bowers died. In the same year, John Dibb joined the company, later to become responsible for many speaker designs, notably several signature models.\n\nThe 1987 'Concept 90' CM1 loudspeaker was the first B&W speaker with a plastic matrix cabinet.\n\n===1990s===\n\nSilver Signature loudspeaker was launched to commemorate the company's 25th anniversary.\n\nIncreasing demand led to by opening an additional production site at Silverdale, Worthing, West Sussex in 1992.\n\nThe 1993 'Nautilus' speaker still remains the company's flagship product. In 1998, Nautilus technology was introduced in the somewhat more affordable Nautilus 800 series.\n\n===2000s===\n\nIn 2002 B&W moved its Worthing production, warehousing and head office to a new \u00a37&nbsp;million location on a former landfill site in Dale Road, Worthing. A second plant was built in Bradford.\n\nB&W took over its own production factory for cabinets Agerb\u00e6k, Denmark in 2003. In the same year, the Bradford location was left for new premises in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire. \nIn 2005, Bowers & Wilkins replaced its top-of-the-line N800 range with the new 800D range.  The most publicised change was the introduction of diamond dome tweeters on some models<ref>[http://hifinet.co.kr/index.php?/wiki/Bowers_and_Wilkins/ Bowers and Wilkins | Hifinet Wiki]</ref> 2005 also saw B&W receive the Queen's Award for Innovation for the tube-loaded drivers on the 800's.<ref>[http://www.queensawards.org.uk/business/Winners/2005_.html :: The Queen's Award for Enterprise ::<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403203552/http://www.queensawards.org.uk/business/Winners/2005_.html |date=3 April 2009 }}</ref> The EISA Award for European High End Audio Component of the Year is awarded to the 803D.  The PV1 receives the European Home Theatre Subwoofer of the year 2005\u20132006 award. The XT series introduced aluminium as a speaker cabinet material.\n\nIn 2007 the 'Zeppelin' [[iPod]] speaker system was introduced.\n\nIn 2008, the \"[[Jaguar XF#Sound system|Jaguar XF Audio System]]\" was introduced, a car audio setup with 14 speakers and a powered 440 Watt [[Electronic amplifier#Class B and AB|Class AB]] [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] amplifier.\n\nBowers & Wilkins' latest project is the Society of Sound.

{"title_page": "Electrical wiring in North America", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}\n{{Electrical Wiring Sidebar}}\n'''Electrical wiring in North America''' follows regulations and standards for installation of building wiring which ultimately provides [[mains electricity]].\n\n==Terminology==\nAlthough much of the [[electrician]]'s field [[terminology]] matches that of the [[electrical code]]s, usages can vary:\n* '''[[Ground and neutral|Neutral]]''' wire is the return conductor of a circuit; in building wiring systems, the neutral wire is connected to earth ground at only one point. North American standards state that the neutral is neither switched nor fused except in very narrowly defined circumstances. The neutral is connected to the center tap of the power company [[transformer]] of a [[Split-phase electric power|split-phase]] system, or the center of the wye connection of a [[polyphase power]] system.\n:The United States electrical codes require that the neutral be connected to earth at the \u201cservice panel\u201d only and at no other point within the building wiring system. Formally, the neutral is called the \u201cgrounded conductor\u201d; as of the 2008 NEC, the terms \u201cneutral conductor\u201d and \u201cneutral point\u201d have been defined in the Code to conform to what had been common usage.<ref name=\"Art100\">{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]] |year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=100 | author =  }}</ref>\n* '''Hot''' is any conductor (wire or otherwise) connected with an electrical system that has [[electric potential]] relative to [[electrical ground]] or neutral.\n* '''Ground''' is a safety conductor with a low impedance path to earth. It is often called the \"ground wire,\" or safety ground. It is either bare or has green insulation.<ref name=\"Art100\" />\n* '''Leg''' as in \u201chot leg\u201d refers to one of multiple '''hot''' conductors in an electrical system. The most common residential and small commercial service in Canada and the U.S., single [[Split-phase electric power|split-phase]], 240 V, features a neutral and two hot legs, 240 V to each other, and 120 V each to the neutral. The most common three-phase system will have three \u201chot\u201d legs, 208 V to each other and 120 V each to the neutral. An older, but still widely used [[high-leg delta]] system uses three phases with 240 volts phase-to-phase for motor loads, and 120 volts for lighting loads by use of a center-tapped transformer; two of the phases are 120 volts to neutral.

The [[city of New York]], for example requires all installation work to be done by licensed contractors</ref> have more restrictive rules and require electrical installations to be done by [[professional licensing|licensed]] electricians. The work will be [[inspect]]ed by a designated authority at several stages before permission is obtained to energize the wiring from the local [[electric utility]]; the inspector may be an employee of the state or city, or an employee of an electrical supply utility.\n\nFor electrical wiring in Canada, the [[Canadian Electrical Code]] is a very similar standard published in [[Canada]] by the [[Canadian Standards Association]] since 1927.\n\n== Design and installation conventions ==\nFor residential wiring, some basic rules given in the NEC are:\n\n*Terminals for the neutral (grounded) conductor in general, and for receptacles, plugs, and connectors specifically, are required to be substantially white in color [NEC 200.9, NEC 200.10 (B)], and if the terminal itself is not visible, the hole leading to it must be marked with the word \"white\" or the letter \"W\". [[Edison base|Edison-base]] lamp sockets (called screw shell devices in the NEC) are required to have the neutral conductor attached to the outer screw shell [NEC 200.10(C)].<ref>{{Cite book|title=NFPA 70: National Electrical Code 2011|last=|first=|publisher=National Fire Protection Association|year=2010|isbn=978-087765914-3|location=|pages=70-47 to 70-48}}</ref> In actual practice, the neutral terminal is silver colored, the line and load terminals are brass or (rarely) painted black), and the grounding screw is usually colored green.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} A common mnemonic electricians use to remember which wire goes to which terminal is \"white to light\u2026black to brass\u2026green to green\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/library/electrical/electrical.pdf|title=OSHA OFFICE OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION: Electrical Discussion|website=www.osha.gov|page=14|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n*''[[Electrical wiring|Phase]]'' wire in a circuit may be any color other green, gray, or white (whether these are solid colors or stripes). The common colors are black, red, blue, brown, yellow, and orange (high leg delta) insulated wire, sometimes other colors.  Specific exceptions apply, such as a cable running to a switch and back (known as a traveler) where the white wire will be the hot wire feeding that switch.  Another is for a cable used to feed an outlet for 250 VAC appliances that do not need a neutral, there the white is hot. In both those instances the white wire should be identified as being hot, usually with black tape inside junction boxes.\n*The ''[[neutral wire|neutral]]'' wire is identified by gray or white insulated wire, perhaps using stripes or markings.\n*With [[lamp cord]] wire the ribbed wire is the neutral, and the smooth wire is the hot. NEC 2008 400.22(f) allows surface marking with ridged, grooves or white stripes on the surface of lamp cord.  With transparent cord the hot wire is copper colored, and the neutral is silver colored.\n*[[Ground conductor|''Grounding'' wire]] of circuit may be bare or identified insulated wire of green or green having yellow stripes. All metallic systems in a building are to be bonded to the building grounding system, such as water, natural gas, HVAC piping, and others.\n*Larger wires are generally furnished only in black; these black wires may be properly re-identified with suitable paint or tape.\n*All wiring in a circuit except for the leads that are part of a device or fixture must be the same gauge or larger.  Different size wires may be used in the same raceway so long as they are all insulated for the maximum voltage of any of these circuits.\n* The Code gives rules for calculating circuit loading and maximum [[ampacity]].\n*[[Ground-fault circuit interrupter]] (GFCI) protection is required on receptacles in wet locations and locations where there exists an easy path for fault current to travel to earth. This includes all receptacles intended to service kitchen counter surfaces), crawl spaces at or below grade level, basements, garages and accessory buildings, bathrooms, laundry areas, within 6 ft. of the outside edge of a sink bathtub or shower stall, as well as outdoors. There were previous exceptions for refrigerators because unattended disconnection could cause spoilage of food and for garbage disposals.  Instead, for refrigerators and other semi-permanent appliances in basements and wet areas, a one-outlet non-GFCI dedicated receptacle was generally used. As of the 2020 NEC this exception no longer exists and those devices in are required to have GFCI protection where otherwise required. Two-wire outlets having no grounding conductor may be protected by a GFCI or one upstream of the receptacle and must be labelled \"No Equipment Ground\" and \"GFCI Protected\". Most GFCI receptacles allow the connection and provide GFCI protection for down-stream connected receptacles.  Receptacles protected in this manner or with a GFCI circuit breaker should be labeled \"GFCI protected\".  (Outside North America these are referred to as  a \"[[Residual-current device]]\" or RCD.)\n*[[Arc-fault circuit interrupter|Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupter]] (AFCI) protection is required to protect nearly all finished areas of a home with the exception of bathrooms. This device, which can be a circuit breaker or the first outlet on a circuit, is designed to detect hazardous electrical arcing in the branch circuit wiring as well as in cords and plugs. An AFCI device is designed to trip quickly when it detects potentially dangerous arcing that could start a fire, but not trip with harmless arcing as part of the normal operation of devices such as motors.\n*Most circuits have the metallic components interconnected with a grounding wire connected to the third, round prong of a plug, and to metal boxes and appliance chassis.\n*[[Furnace]]s, electric [[water heating|water heaters]], [[heat pump]]s, central [[air conditioning]] units, electric [[Clothes dryer|dryers]], electric [[Kitchen stove|stoves]] or [[Cooktop|cooktops]], and built in [[Microwave oven|microwave ovens]] must be on dedicated circuits.\n*The code provides rules for sizing electrical boxes for the number of wires and wiring devices in the box.\n\nThe foregoing is just a brief overview and must not be used as a substitute for the actual National Electrical Code.\n\n==Comparison of US practices with other countries==\n{{Main|Mains electricity by country}}\nElectrical wiring practices developed in parallel in many countries  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>R. M. Black ''The History of Electric Wires and Cables'', Peter Pergrinus, London 1983 {{ISBN|0-86341-001-4}}</ref> As a result, national and regional variations developed and remain in effect. (see [[National Electrical Code]], [[electrical wiring]], [[electrical wiring in the United Kingdom]]).  Some of these are retained for technical reasons, since the safety of wiring systems depends not only on the wiring code but also on the technical standards for wiring devices, materials, and equipment.\n\n[[Ground and neutral|Grounding (earthing)]] of distribution circuits is a notable difference in practice between wiring systems of the United States and those of other regions. Since the early 1960s, wiring in new construction has required a separate grounding conductor used to bond (electrically connect) all normally non-current carrying parts of an electrical installation. Portable appliances with metal cases also have a bonding conductor in the flexible cable and plug connecting them to the distribution system. The circuit return conductor (''neutral'') is also connected to ground at the service entrance panel only; no other connections from neutral to ground are allowed, unlike regulations in some other parts of the world.\n\nLighting and power receptacle circuits in North American systems are typically radial from a distribution panel containing circuit breakers to protect each branch circuit.<ref>American Electrician's Handbook page 9-87</ref> The smallest branch circuit rating is 15 amperes, used for general purpose receptacles and lighting. Often, 20 ampere circuits are used for general purpose receptacles and lighting. In residential construction, branch circuits for higher ratings are usually dedicated to one appliance, for example, fixed cooking appliances, electric clothes dryers, and air conditioners. Lighting and general purpose receptacles are at 120 volts AC, with larger devices fed by [[split phase|three wire single-phase]] circuits at 240 volts. \n\nIn commercial construction, [[three-phase]] circuits are used. Generally, receptacles are fed by 120 V or 208 V (in place of 240 V in a house), and can include special current rated outlets for industrial equipment. Lighting is usually fed by 277 V (with exception for special-use lights that use 120 V). Equipment can be hard-wired into the building using either 120/208 V or 277/480 V.\n\nCountries such as Mexico may adopt the NFPA standard as their  national electrical code, with local amendments similar to those in United States jurisdictions. The [[Canadian Electrical Code]], while developed independently from the NFPA code, is similar in scope and intent to the US NEC, with only minor variations in technical requirement details; harmonization of the CEC and NEC codes is intended to facilitate [[North American Free Trade Agreement|free trade]] between the two countries.\n\n== Wiring methods ==\n[[File:Romex cable.agr.jpg|thumb|Non-metallic (NM) sheathed cable]]\nMost circuits in the modern North American home and light commercial construction are wired with [[electrical wiring#Modern wiring materials|non-metallic sheathed (NM) cable]] designated type.<ref>Terrell Croft and Wilford Summers (ed), ''American Electrican's Handbook, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, New York (1987) {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}} page 9-86</ref>   This type of cable is the least expensive for a given size and is appropriate for dry indoor applications.  The designation NM XX-Y indicates, respectively, the type of sheathing (in this case, non-metallic), the [[American Wire Gauge|size]] of the main conductors, and the total number of circuit conductors (exclusive of the grounding conductor).  For example, NM 14-2 cable contains three conductors (two plus one ground) at 14 gauge, a size typically used for circuits protected at 15 amperes.  Circuits with larger currents (such as for electric furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, or sub-mains to additional circuit panels) will have larger conductors.  Not all US jurisdictions permit use of non-metallic sheathed cable. The NEC does not permit use of NM cable in large, fire-resistant, or high-rise structures.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=334.10 | author =  }}</ref>\n\nIn type NM cable, conductor insulation is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a bare grounding conductor.

Therefore, it is almost never used by commercial electrical contractors. Most wiring is put in non-flexible conduit, usually [[Electrical_conduit#Electrical_metallic_tubing_.28EMT.29|EMT]] because of its cost and durability. [[Electrical_conduit#Galvanized_rigid_conduit_.28GRC.29|Rigid]] may be required for certain areas and additionally, vapor-lock fittings may be required in areas where a fire or explosion hazard is present (such as gas stations, chemical factories, grain silos, etc.) [[Electrical_conduit#PVC_conduit|PVC]] can be used where wire is run underground or where concrete will be poured. A duct bank is usually made of multiple PVC conduits encased in concrete. [[Electrical_conduit#Flexible_Metallic_Conduit_.28FMC.29|FMC or Flex]] is used where EMT or other non-flexible conduit is impractical or for short runs, known as \"whips\", to lights or other devices. For power circuits, the color-coding uses the same colors as residential construction, and adds the additional wires used for three-phase systems. Black, Red and Blue are used for hot wires and White is used as the neutral wire in a 120/208 V circuit. Brown, Orange and Yellow are used as hot wires and gray is used as the neutral wire in a 277/480 V. For grounding, regardless of the voltage, Green (or a bare wire) is used.\n\nSeveral other types of wiring systems are used for building wiring in the United States; these include corrugated metal [[armored cable]], [[Mineral-insulated copper-clad cable|mineral-insulated cable]], other types of [[power cable]], and various types of [[electrical conduit]]. In industrial applications cables may be laid in cable trays. Cable type TC is especially intended for use in tray systems. Special wiring  rules apply to wet or corrosive locations,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=110.11 | author =  }}</ref> and to locations which present an explosion hazard.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=500 | author =  }}</ref> Wiring materials for use in the United States must generally be made and tested to product standards set by [[NEMA]] and [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) and must bear approval marks such as those set by UL.\n\nApproved wiring types can vary by [[jurisdiction]].

North American standards state that the neutral is neither switched nor fused except in very narrowly defined circumstances. The neutral is connected to the center tap of the power company [[transformer]] of a [[Split-phase electric power|split-phase]] system, or the center of the wye connection of a [[polyphase power]] system.\n:The United States electrical codes require that the neutral be connected to earth at the \u201cservice panel\u201d only and at no other point within the building wiring system. Formally, the neutral is called the \u201cgrounded conductor\u201d; as of the 2008 NEC, the terms \u201cneutral conductor\u201d and \u201cneutral point\u201d have been defined in the Code to conform to what had been common usage.<ref name=\"Art100\">{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]] |year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=100 | author =  }}</ref>\n* '''Hot''' is any conductor (wire or otherwise) connected with an electrical system that has [[electric potential]] relative to [[electrical ground]] or neutral.\n* '''Ground''' is a safety conductor with a low impedance path to earth.

The most common three-phase system will have three \u201chot\u201d legs, 208 V to each other and 120 V each to the neutral. An older, but still widely used [[high-leg delta]] system uses three phases with 240 volts phase-to-phase for motor loads, and 120 volts for lighting loads by use of a center-tapped transformer; two of the phases are 120 volts to neutral. The third phase, the \u201chigh leg\u201d of the system (also referred to as the \"wild leg\"), has 208 V to neutral and is not usually used for single-phase connections, so is distinctively colored.

The work will be [[inspect]]ed by a designated authority at several stages before permission is obtained to energize the wiring from the local [[electric utility]]; the inspector may be an employee of the state or city, or an employee of an electrical supply utility.\n\nFor electrical wiring in Canada, the [[Canadian Electrical Code]] is a very similar standard published in [[Canada]] by the [[Canadian Standards Association]] since 1927.\n\n== Design and installation conventions ==\nFor residential wiring, some basic rules given in the NEC are:\n\n*Terminals for the neutral (grounded) conductor in general, and for receptacles, plugs, and connectors specifically, are required to be substantially white in color [NEC 200.9, NEC 200.10 (B)], and if the terminal itself is not visible, the hole leading to it must be marked with the word \"white\" or the letter \"W\". [[Edison base|Edison-base]] lamp sockets (called screw shell devices in the NEC) are required to have the neutral conductor attached to the outer screw shell [NEC 200.10(C)].<ref>{{Cite book|title=NFPA 70: National Electrical Code 2011|last=|first=|publisher=National Fire Protection Association|year=2010|isbn=978-087765914-3|location=|pages=70-47 to 70-48}}</ref> In actual practice, the neutral terminal is silver colored, the line and load terminals are brass or (rarely) painted black), and the grounding screw is usually colored green.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} A common mnemonic electricians use to remember which wire goes to which terminal is \"white to light\u2026black to brass\u2026green to green\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/library/electrical/electrical.pdf|title=OSHA OFFICE OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION: Electrical Discussion|website=www.osha.gov|page=14|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n*''[[Electrical wiring|Phase]]'' wire in a circuit may be any color other green, gray, or white (whether these are solid colors or stripes). The common colors are black, red, blue, brown, yellow, and orange (high leg delta) insulated wire, sometimes other colors.  Specific exceptions apply, such as a cable running to a switch and back (known as a traveler) where the white wire will be the hot wire feeding that switch.  Another is for a cable used to feed an outlet for 250 VAC appliances that do not need a neutral, there the white is hot. In both those instances the white wire should be identified as being hot, usually with black tape inside junction boxes.\n*The ''[[neutral wire|neutral]]'' wire is identified by gray or white insulated wire, perhaps using stripes or markings.\n*With [[lamp cord]] wire the ribbed wire is the neutral, and the smooth wire is the hot. NEC 2008 400.22(f) allows surface marking with ridged, grooves or white stripes on the surface of lamp cord.  With transparent cord the hot wire is copper colored, and the neutral is silver colored.\n*[[Ground conductor|''Grounding'' wire]] of circuit may be bare or identified insulated wire of green or green having yellow stripes. All metallic systems in a building are to be bonded to the building grounding system, such as water, natural gas, HVAC piping, and others.\n*Larger wires are generally furnished only in black; these black wires may be properly re-identified with suitable paint or tape.\n*All wiring in a circuit except for the leads that are part of a device or fixture must be the same gauge or larger.  Different size wires may be used in the same raceway so long as they are all insulated for the maximum voltage of any of these circuits.\n* The Code gives rules for calculating circuit loading and maximum [[ampacity]].\n*[[Ground-fault circuit interrupter]] (GFCI) protection is required on receptacles in wet locations and locations where there exists an easy path for fault current to travel to earth. This includes all receptacles intended to service kitchen counter surfaces), crawl spaces at or below grade level, basements, garages and accessory buildings, bathrooms, laundry areas, within 6 ft. of the outside edge of a sink bathtub or shower stall, as well as outdoors. There were previous exceptions for refrigerators because unattended disconnection could cause spoilage of food and for garbage disposals.  Instead, for refrigerators and other semi-permanent appliances in basements and wet areas, a one-outlet non-GFCI dedicated receptacle was generally used. As of the 2020 NEC this exception no longer exists and those devices in are required to have GFCI protection where otherwise required. Two-wire outlets having no grounding conductor may be protected by a GFCI or one upstream of the receptacle and must be labelled \"No Equipment Ground\" and \"GFCI Protected\". Most GFCI receptacles allow the connection and provide GFCI protection for down-stream connected receptacles.  Receptacles protected in this manner or with a GFCI circuit breaker should be labeled \"GFCI protected\".  (Outside North America these are referred to as  a \"[[Residual-current device]]\" or RCD.)\n*[[Arc-fault circuit interrupter|Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupter]] (AFCI) protection is required to protect nearly all finished areas of a home with the exception of bathrooms. This device, which can be a circuit breaker or the first outlet on a circuit, is designed to detect hazardous electrical arcing in the branch circuit wiring as well as in cords and plugs. An AFCI device is designed to trip quickly when it detects potentially dangerous arcing that could start a fire, but not trip with harmless arcing as part of the normal operation of devices such as motors.\n*Most circuits have the metallic components interconnected with a grounding wire connected to the third, round prong of a plug, and to metal boxes and appliance chassis.\n*[[Furnace]]s, electric [[water heater]]s, [[heat pump]]s, central [[air conditioning]] units, electric [[Clothes dryer|dryers]], electric [[Kitchen stove|stoves]] or [[Cooktop|cooktops]], and built in [[Microwave oven|microwave ovens]] must be on dedicated circuits.\n*The code provides rules for sizing electrical boxes for the number of wires and wiring devices in the box.\n\nThe foregoing is just a brief overview and must not be used as a substitute for the actual National Electrical Code.\n\n==Comparison of US practices with other countries==\n{{Main|Mains electricity by country}}\nElectrical wiring practices developed in parallel in many countries  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>R. M. Black ''The History of Electric Wires and Cables'', Peter Pergrinus, London 1983 {{ISBN|0-86341-001-4}}</ref> As a result, national and regional variations developed and remain in effect. (see [[National Electrical Code]], [[electrical wiring]], [[electrical wiring in the United Kingdom]]).  Some of these are retained for technical reasons, since the safety of wiring systems depends not only on the wiring code but also on the technical standards for wiring devices, materials, and equipment.\n\n[[Ground and neutral|Grounding (earthing)]] of distribution circuits is a notable difference in practice between wiring systems of the United States and those of other regions. Since the early 1960s, wiring in new construction has required a separate grounding conductor used to bond (electrically connect) all normally non-current carrying parts of an electrical installation. Portable appliances with metal cases also have a bonding conductor in the flexible cable and plug connecting them to the distribution system. The circuit return conductor (''neutral'') is also connected to ground at the service entrance panel only; no other connections from neutral to ground are allowed, unlike regulations in some other parts of the world.\n\nLighting and power receptacle circuits in North American systems are typically radial from a distribution panel containing circuit breakers to protect each branch circuit.<ref>American Electrician's Handbook page 9-87</ref> The smallest branch circuit rating is 15 amperes, used for general purpose receptacles and lighting. Often, 20 ampere circuits are used for general purpose receptacles and lighting. In residential construction, branch circuits for higher ratings are usually dedicated to one appliance, for example, fixed cooking appliances, electric clothes dryers, and air conditioners. Lighting and general purpose receptacles are at 120 volts AC, with larger devices fed by [[split phase|three wire single-phase]] circuits at 240 volts. \n\nIn commercial construction, [[three-phase]] circuits are used. Generally, receptacles are fed by 120 V or 208 V (in place of 240 V in a house), and can include special current rated outlets for industrial equipment. Lighting is usually fed by 277 V (with exception for special-use lights that use 120 V). Equipment can be hard-wired into the building using either 120/208 V or 277/480 V.\n\nCountries such as Mexico may adopt the NFPA standard as their  national electrical code, with local amendments similar to those in United States jurisdictions. The [[Canadian Electrical Code]], while developed independently from the NFPA code, is similar in scope and intent to the US NEC, with only minor variations in technical requirement details; harmonization of the CEC and NEC codes is intended to facilitate [[North American Free Trade Agreement|free trade]] between the two countries.\n\n== Wiring methods ==\n[[File:Romex cable.agr.jpg|thumb|Non-metallic (NM) sheathed cable]]\nMost circuits in the modern North American home and light commercial construction are wired with [[electrical wiring#Modern wiring materials|non-metallic sheathed (NM) cable]] designated type.<ref>Terrell Croft and Wilford Summers (ed), ''American Electrican's Handbook, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw Hill, New York (1987) {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}} page 9-86</ref>   This type of cable is the least expensive for a given size and is appropriate for dry indoor applications.  The designation NM XX-Y indicates, respectively, the type of sheathing (in this case, non-metallic), the [[American Wire Gauge|size]] of the main conductors, and the total number of circuit conductors (exclusive of the grounding conductor).  For example, NM 14-2 cable contains three conductors (two plus one ground) at 14 gauge, a size typically used for circuits protected at 15 amperes.  Circuits with larger currents (such as for electric furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, or sub-mains to additional circuit panels) will have larger conductors.  Not all US jurisdictions permit use of non-metallic sheathed cable. The NEC does not permit use of NM cable in large, fire-resistant, or high-rise structures.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=334.10 | author =  }}</ref>\n\nIn type NM cable, conductor insulation is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a bare grounding conductor. The [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) specifies that the black conductor represent the ''hot'' conductor, with significant voltage to earth ground; the white conductor represent the identified or [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] conductor, near ground potential;<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=200.7 | author = }}</ref> and the bare/green conductor, the safety grounding conductor not normally used to carry circuit current. Wires may be re-colored, so these rules are commonly excepted.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=200.6(A) | author = }}</ref> In 240-volt applications not requiring a neutral conductor, the white wire may be used as the second hot conductor, but must be recolored with tape or by some other method.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}  Four-wire flexible equipment connection cords have red as the fourth color; unlike older European practices, color-coding in flexible cords is the same as for fixed wiring.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nIn commercial and industrial, unenclosed NM cable is often prohibited in certain areas or altogether (depending on what the building is used for and local/state building codes). Therefore, it is almost never used by commercial electrical contractors. Most wiring is put in non-flexible conduit, usually [[Electrical_conduit#Electrical_metallic_tubing_.28EMT.29|EMT]] because of its cost and durability. [[Electrical_conduit#Galvanized_rigid_conduit_.28GRC.29|Rigid]] may be required for certain areas and additionally, vapor-lock fittings may be required in areas where a fire or explosion hazard is present (such as gas stations, chemical factories, grain silos, etc.) [[Electrical_conduit#PVC_conduit|PVC]] can be used where wire is run underground or where concrete will be poured. A duct bank is usually made of multiple PVC conduits encased in concrete. [[Electrical_conduit#Flexible_Metallic_Conduit_.28FMC.29|FMC or Flex]] is used where EMT or other non-flexible conduit is impractical or for short runs, known as \"whips\", to lights or other devices. For power circuits, the color-coding uses the same colors as residential construction, and adds the additional wires used for three-phase systems. Black, Red and Blue are used for hot wires and White is used as the neutral wire in a 120/208 V circuit. Brown, Orange and Yellow are used as hot wires and gray is used as the neutral wire in a 277/480 V. For grounding, regardless of the voltage, Green (or a bare wire) is used.\n\nSeveral other types of wiring systems are used for building wiring in the United States; these include corrugated metal [[armored cable]], [[Mineral-insulated copper-clad cable|mineral-insulated cable]], other types of [[power cable]], and various types of [[electrical conduit]]. In industrial applications cables may be laid in cable trays. Cable type TC is especially intended for use in tray systems. Special wiring  rules apply to wet or corrosive locations,<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=110.11 | author =  }}</ref> and to locations which present an explosion hazard.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = David Mumford| title = National Electric Code| publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]]|year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87765-791-0|page=500 | author =  }}</ref> Wiring materials for use in the United States must generally be made and tested to product standards set by [[NEMA]] and [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) and must bear approval marks such as those set by UL.\n\nApproved wiring types can vary by [[jurisdiction]].

{"title_page": "Emergency management", "text_new": "{{short description|Dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergencies}}\n[[File:North Carolina National Guard (48677621826).jpg|thumb|right|A mobile [[emergency operations center]], in this case operated by the [[North Carolina Air National Guard]]]]\n'''Emergency management''' is the organization and management of the resources and responsibilities for dealing with all [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] aspects of [[Emergency|emergencies]] (preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery). The aim is to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards, including [[disaster]]s.\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted, and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster. Thus, emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster, which is even harder to recover from. Emergency management is a related term but should not be equated to disaster management.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Emergency planning ideals==\nEmergency planning, a discipline of [[urban planning]] and [[urban design|design]], first aims to prevent emergencies from occurring, and failing that, should develop a good action plan to mitigate the results and effects of any emergencies. As time goes on, and more data become available, usually through the study of emergencies as they occur, a plan should evolve. The development of emergency plans is a cyclical process, common to many risk management disciplines, such as business continuity and security risk management, as set out below:\n* Recognition or identification of risks<ref>Zhou, Q., Huang, W., & Zhang, Y. (2011). Identifying critical success factors in emergency management using a fuzzy DEMATEL method.

There are very few emergency management specific standards, and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards.\n\nIn order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business, emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks. In the event that an emergency does occur, managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency, as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations after the incident. It is essential for an organization to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activated. An emergency plan must be regularly maintained, in a structured and methodical manner, to ensure it is up-to-date in the event of an emergency. Emergency managers generally follow a common process to anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover from an incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/emergency|title=Emergency Response Plan - Ready.gov|website=www.ready.gov}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety of workers ==\nCleanup during disaster recovery involves many [[occupational hazard]]s. Often these hazards are exacerbated by the conditions of the local environment as a result of the [[natural disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/cleanupHazard.html|title=Fact Sheet on Natural Disaster Recovery: Cleanup Hazard|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref> While individual workers should be aware of these potential hazards, employers are responsible for minimizing exposure to these hazards and protecting workers, when possible. This includes identification and thorough assessment of potential hazards, application of appropriate [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE), and the distribution of other relevant information in order to enable safe performance of the work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3698.pdf|title=OSHA Fact Sheet_Keeping Workers Safe During Disaster Cleanup and Recovery|last=|first=|date=2017-11-27|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Maintaining a safe and healthy environment for these workers ensures that the effectiveness of the disaster recovery is unaffected.\n\n=== Physical exposures ===\n'''Flood-associated injuries''': Flooding disasters often expose workers to trauma from sharp and blunt objects hidden under murky waters causing lacerations, as well as open and closed fractures. These injuries are further exacerbated with exposure to the often contaminated waters, leading to increased risk for infection.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bandino|first=Justin P.|last2=Hang|first2=Anna|last3=Norton|first3=Scott A.|title=The Infectious and Noninfectious Dermatological Consequences of Flooding: A Field Manual for the Responding Provider|journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology|volume=16|issue=5|pages=399\u2013424|doi=10.1007/s40257-015-0138-4|pmid=26159354|year=2015}}</ref> When working around water, there is always the risk of drowning.

After a natural disaster, certain chemicals can be more prominent in the environment. These hazardous materials can be released directly or indirectly. Chemical hazards directly released after a natural disaster often occur concurrent with the event so little to no mitigation actions can take place for mitigation. For example, airborne magnesium, chloride, phosphorus, and ammonia can be generated by droughts. Dioxins can be produced by forest fires, and silica can be emitted by forest fires. Indirect release of hazardous chemicals can be intentionally released or unintentionally released. An example of intentional release is insecticides used after a flood or chlorine treatment of water after a flood. Unintentional release is when a hazardous chemical is not intentionally released. The chemical released is often toxic and serves beneficial purpose when released to the environment. These chemicals can be controlled through engineering to minimize their release when a natural disaster strikes. An example of this is agrochemicals from inundated storehouses or manufacturing facilities poisoning the floodwaters or asbestos fibers released from a building collapse during a hurricane.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Stacy|last2=Balluz|first2=Lina|last3=Malilay|first3=Josephine|date=2004-04-25|title=Natural and technologic hazardous material releases during and after natural disasters: a review|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=publichealthresources|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=322|issue=1|pages=3\u201320|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00446-7|pmid=15081734|bibcode=2004ScTEn.322....3Y}}</ref> The flowchart to the right has been adopted from research performed by Stacy Young, et al., and can be found here.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\"/>\n\n'''Exposure limits'''\n[[File:Hazardous Chemical Release Flowchart.jpg|thumb|Classification of hazardous material releases associated with natural disasters]]\nBelow are TLV-TWA, PEL, and IDLH values for common chemicals workers are exposed to after a natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/annotated-pels/|title=OSHA Annotated PELs {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/pgintrod.html|title=CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards (NPG) Introduction|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Chemical'''\n|'''TLV-TWA (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''PEL (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''IDLH (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|-\n|'''Magnesium'''\n|10\n|15\n|750\n|-\n|'''Phosphorus'''\n|0.1\n|0.1\n|Not established\n|-\n|'''Ammonia'''\n|17\n|35\n|27\n|-\n|'''Silica(R)'''\n|.025\n|10\n|50\n|-\n|'''Chlorine dioxide'''\n|0.28\n|0.3\n|29\n|-\n|'''Asbestos'''\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|Not established\n|}\n\n'''Direct release'''\n* Magnesium\n* Phosphorus\n* Ammonia\n* Silica\n\n'''Intentional release'''\n* Insecticides\n* Chlorine dioxide\n\n'''Unintentional release'''\n* Crude oil components\n* Benzene, N-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, cumene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, toluene, xylenes, PCBs, agrochemicals\n* Asbestos\n\n'''Exposure routes'''\n\nWhen a toxicant is prominent in an environment after a natural disaster, it is important to determine the route of exposure to worker safety for the disaster management workers. The three components are source of exposure, pathway of the chemical, and receptor. Questions to ask when dealing with chemical source is the material itself, how it's used, how much is used, how often the chemical is used, temperature, vapor pressure, physical processes. The physical state of the chemical is important to identify. If working indoors, room ventilation, and volume of room needs to be noted to help mitigate health defects from the chemical. Lastly, to ensure worker safety, routes of entry for the chemical should be determined as well as relevant personal protective equipment needs to be worn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2012-09-07|isbn=9780309264686|language=en|doi=10.17226/13507|pmid = 24901193}}</ref>\n\n'''Respirators'''\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cIf you need to collect belongings or do basic clean up in your previously flooded home, you do not usually need to use a respirator (a mask worn to prevent breathing in harmful substances).\u201d A respirator should be worn when performing an operation in an enclosed environment such as a house that creates ample amounts of dust. These activities could include sweeping dust, using power saws and equipment, or cleaning up mold. If you encounter dust, the CDC says to \u201climit your contact with the dust as much as possible. Use wet mops or vacuums with HEPA filters instead of dry sweeping and lastly wear a respirator that protects against dust in the air. A respirator that is approved by the CDC/NIOSH is the [[N95 respirator]] and can be a good personal protective equipment to protect from dust and mold in the air from the associated natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/respiratory.html|title=Respiratory Protection for Residents Reentering Previously Flooded Areas{{!}}Health and Safety Concerns|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Biological exposures ===\n\n'''Mold exposures''': Exposure to [[mold]] is commonly seen after a natural disaster such as flooding, hurricane, tornado or tsunami. Mold growth can occur on both the exterior and interior of residential or commercial buildings. Warm and humid condition encourages mold growth; therefore, standing water and excess moisture after a natural disaster would provide an ideal environment for mold growth especially in tropical regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/mold/|title=Mold \u2013 Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=8 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref> While the exact number of mold species is unknown, some examples of commonly found indoor molds are [[Aspergillus]], [[Cladosporium]], [[Alternaria]] and [[Penicillium]]. Reaction to molds differ between individuals and can range from mild symptoms such as eye irritation, cough to severe life-threatening asthmatic or allergic reactions. People with history of [[chronic lung disease (disambiguation)|chronic lung disease]], asthma, allergy, other breathing problems or those that are [[immunocompromised]] could be more sensitive to molds and may develop [[fungal pneumonia]].\n\nThe most effective approach to control mold growth after a natural disaster is to control moisture level. Some ways to prevent mold growth after a natural disaster include opening all doors and windows, using fans to dry out the building, positioning fans to blow air out of the windows and cleaning up the building within the first 24\u201348 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/mold/ten-things-you-should-know-about-mold|title=Ten Things You Should Know about Mold \u2013 US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|website=US EPA|date=2014-10-22}}</ref> All wet items that cannot be properly cleaned and dried within the first 48 hours should be promptly removed and discarded from the building. If mold growth is found in the building, it is important to concurrently remove the molds and fix the underlying moisture problem. When removing molds, N-95 masks or respirators with a higher protection level should be used to prevent inhalation of molds into the respiratory system.<ref>https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/moldguide12.pdf</ref> Molds can be removed from hard surfaces by soap and water, a diluted bleach solution<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/psa/moldremoval.html|title=Mold Removal After a Disaster-PSAs for Disasters|website=www.cdc.gov|date=2019-02-28}}</ref> or commercial products.\n\n'''Human remains''': According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]], \"There is no direct risk of contagion or infectious disease from being near human remains for people who are not directly involved in recovery or other efforts that require handling dead bodies.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/handleremains.html|title=Handling Human Remains After a Disaster{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Most viruses and bacteria perish along with the human body after death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/ems/flood_cds/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Flooding and communicable diseases fact sheet|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Therefore, no excessive measures are necessary when handling human remains indirectly. However, for workers in direct contact with human remains, [[universal precautions]] should be exercised in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to blood-borne viruses and bacteria. Relevant [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] includes eye protection, face mask or shield, and gloves. The predominant health risk are gastrointestinal infections through [[Fecal\u2013oral route|fecal-oral]] contamination, so [[Hand washing|hand hygiene]] is paramount to prevention. Mental health support should also be available to workers who endure [[psychological stress]] during and after recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|title=American Psychological Association_Disasters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229124918/http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|archive-date=2009-12-29|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n'''Flood-associated skin infections''': Flood waters are often contaminated with bacteria and waste as well as chemicals on occasion. Prolonged, direct contact with these waters leads to an increased risk for skin infection, especially with open wounds in the skin or history of a previous skin condition, such as [[atopic dermatitis]] or [[psoriasis]]. These infections are exacerbated with a compromised immune system or an aging population.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most common bacterial skin infections are usually with [[Staphylococcus]] and [[Streptococcus]]. One of the most uncommon, but well-known bacterial infections is from [[Vibrio vulnificus]], which causes a rare, but often fatal infection called [[necrotizing fasciitis]].\n[[File:Necrotizing fasciitis left leg debridement.JPEG|thumb|Surgical debridement of left leg necrotizing fasciitis.]]\n\nOther salt-water Mycobacterium infections include the slow growing [[Mycobacterium marinum|M. marinum]] and fast growing [[Mycobacterium fortuitum|M. fortuitum]], [[Mycobacterium chelonae|M. chelonae]], and [[Mycobacterium abscessus|M. abscessus]]. Fresh-water bacterial infections include [[aeromonas hydrophila]], [[Burkholderia pseudomallei]] causing [[melioidosis]], [[leptospira interrogans]] causing [[leptospirosis]], and chromobacterium violaceum. Fungal infections may lead to [[chromoblastomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]], [[mucormycosis]], and [[dermatophytosis]]. Numerous other [[arthropod]], [[Protozoan infection|protozoal]], and [[Parasitic disease|parasitic]] infections have been described.<ref name=\":0\" /> A worker can reduce the risk of flood-associated skin infections by avoiding the water if an open wound is present, or at minimum, cover the open wound with a waterproof bandage. Should contact with flood water occur, the open wound should be washed thoroughly with soap and clean water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/vibriovulnificus.html|title=Vibrio vulnificus{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=2017-10-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychosocial exposures ===\nProviding disaster recovery assistance is both rewarding and stressful. According to the CDC, \"Sources of stress for emergency responders may include witnessing human suffering, risk of personal harm, intense workloads, life-and-death decisions, and separation from family.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/coping/responders.asp|title=Emergency Responders: Tips for taking care of yourself|date=2017-11-07|website=emergency.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> These stresses need to be prevented or effectively managed in order to optimize assistance without causing danger to oneself. Preparation as an emergency responder is key, in addition to establishing care for responsibilities at home. During the recovery efforts, it is critical to understand and recognize burnout and sources of stress. After the recovery, it is vital to take time away from the disaster scene and slowly re-integrate back to the normal work environment. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)]] provides stress prevention and management resources for disaster recovery responders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/disaster-preparedness|title=Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery|last=ann.lynsen|date=2014-06-20|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Volunteer responsibilities ===\nThe [[FEMA|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] advises those who desire to assist go through organized volunteer organizations and not to self-deploy to affected locations. The [[VOAD|National Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD)]] serves as the primary point of contact for volunteer organization coordination. All states have their own state VOAD organization. As a volunteer, since an employer does not have oversight, one must be vigilant and protect against possible physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial exposures. Furthermore, there must be defined roles with relevant training available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/resources/disaster-services/defining-volunteer-roles-preparation-disaster-response|title=Defining Volunteer Roles in Preparation for Disaster Response|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Proper tools and PPE may or may not be available, so safety and liability should always be considered.\n\n=== Employer responsibilities ===\nEvery employer is required to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for its employees. When an emergency situation occurs, employers are expected to protect workers from all harm resulting from any potential hazard, including physical, chemical, and biological exposure. In addition, an employer should provide pre-emergency training and build an emergency action plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/responsibilities.html|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: Employer Responsibilities and Worker Rights|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Emergency action plan (EAP) ====\nA written document about what actions employers and employees should take when responding to an emergency situation. According to OSHA regulations 1910.38,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9726&p_table=standards|title=Emergency action plans. \u2013 1910.38 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> an employer must have an emergency action plan whenever an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard in this part requires one. To develop an emergency action plan, an employer should start from workplace evaluation. Typically, most of the occupational emergency management can be divided into worksite evaluation, exposure monitoring, hazard control, work practices, and training.\n\n'''Worksite evaluation''' is about identifying the source and location of the potential hazards such as [[Falling (accident)|fall]], [[noise]], [[cold]], [[heat]], [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], infectious materials, and toxic chemicals that each of the workers may encounter during emergency situations.\n\n===== Exposure monitoring =====\nAfter identifying the source and location of the hazard(s), it is essential to monitor how employees may be exposed to these dangers. Employers should conduct task-specific exposure monitoring when they meet following requirements:\n* When the exposed substance has specific standard required by OSHA\n* When employers anticipate workers will be exposed to more hazards than the action level set by OSHA\n* When there is a worker complaint or concern about the exposure\n* When an employee questions the effectiveness of the existing hazard control methods\nTo effectively acquire the above information, an employer can ask workers how they perform the task or use direct reading instruments to identify the exposure level and exposure route.\n\n===== Hazard control =====\nEmployers can conduct hazard control by:\n* Elimination or substitution: Eliminating the hazard from the workplace.\n* [[Engineering controls]]\n* Work practice or administrative controls: Change the how the task was performed to reduce the probability of exposure.\n* [[Personal protective equipment]]\n\n===== Training =====\nEmployers should train their employees annually before an emergency action plan is implemented. [https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081027/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9726&p_text_version=FALSE#1910.38(f)(1) <nowiki>[29 CFR 1910.38(e)]</nowiki>] The purpose of training is to inform employees of their responsibilities and/or plan of action during emergency situations. The training program should include the types of emergencies that may occur, the appropriate response, evacuation procedure, warning/reporting procedure, and shutdown procedures. Training requirements are different depending on the size of workplace and workforce, processes used, materials handled, available resources and who will be in charge during an emergency.\n\nThe training program should address the following information:\n* Workers' roles and responsibilities.\n* Potential hazards and hazard-preventing actions.\n* Notification alarm system, and communications process<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=18960|title=08/07/1981 \u2013 Fire detection and employee alarm systems. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n* Communication means between family members in an emergency.\n* [[First aid kit (disambiguation)|First Aid Kit]]\n* Emergency response procedures.\n* Evacuation procedures.\n* A list of emergency equipment including its location and function.\n* Emergency shutdown procedures.\nAfter the emergency action plan is completed, employer and employees should review the plan carefully and post it in a public area that is accessible to everyone. In addition, another responsibility of the employer is to keep a record of any injury or illness of workers according to OSHA/State Plan Record-keeping regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=12783|title=Reporting fatalities, hospitalizations, amputations, and losses of an eye as a result of work-related incidents to OSHA. \u2013 1904.39 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Implementation ideals==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}\n\n===Pre-incident training and testing===\n[[File:Emergency Responders (8743399305).jpg|thumb|right|A team of emergency responders performs a training scenario involving [[anthrax]].]]\nEmergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs. Training plans should include internal people, contractors and civil protection partners, and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing.\n\nTesting of a plan's effectiveness should occur regularly. In instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space, joint emergency plans, formally agreed to by all parties, should be put into place.\n\nDrills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held, with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency, and people who will be affected. Drills are held to prepare for the hazards of [[Fire drill|fires]], [[Tornado drill|tornadoes]], [[lockdown]] for protection, [[earthquake]]s, etc.\n\n===Communicating and incident assessment===\nCommunication is one of the key issues during any emergency, pre-planning of communications is critical. Miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily.\n\nOnce an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken. Following assessment, the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan. The steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible. The critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized.\n\nThe communication policy must be well known and rehearsed, and all targeted audiences must be alert. All [[Emergency communication system|communication infrastructure]] must be as prepared as possible, with all information on groupings clearly identified.\n\n==Phases and personal activities==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nEmergency management consists of five phases: prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. [http://www.fema.gov/mission-areas Mission Areas | FEMA.gov]\n\n===Prevention===\n{{See also|Pandemic prevention}}\nIt focuses on preventing the human hazard, primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels, designed to provide permanent protection from disasters. Also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans, environmental planning and design standards. In January 2005, 167 Governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the [[World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction|Hyogo Framework]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nPreventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today. Prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery. Public Safety Canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach. In 2009, Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers endorsed a National Disaster Mitigation Strategy.\n\n===Mitigation strategy===\nDisaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs.\n\nPreventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters. In earthquake prone areas, these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an [[earthquake valve]] to instantly shut off the natural gas supply, [[seismic retrofit]]s of property, and the securing of items inside a building. The latter may include the mounting of furniture, [[refrigerator]]s, [[water heating|water heaters]] and breakables to the walls, and the addition of cabinet latches. In flood prone areas, houses can be built on poles/stilts. In areas prone to prolonged electricity [[power blackout|black-outs]] installation of a [[electrical generator|generator]] ensures continuation of electrical service. The construction of [[storm cellar]]s and [[fallout shelter]]s are further examples of personal mitigative actions.\n\nOn a national level, governments might implement large scale mitigation measures. After the monsoon floods of 2010, the Punjab government subsequently constructed 22 'disaster-resilient' model villages, comprising 1885 single-storey homes, together with schools and health centres.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/news-pakistans-punjab-builds-model-villages-to-withstand-disasters/?loclang=en_gb ''NEWS: Pakistan's Punjab builds model villages to withstand disasters''], [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 17 December 2013.</ref>\n\nOne of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the Red River Floodway. The building of the Floodway was a joint provincial/federal undertaking to protect the City of Winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the Red River Basin. It cost $62.7 million to build in the 1960s. Since then, the floodway has been used over 20 times. Its use during the 1997 Red River Flood alone saved an estimated $4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|title=Flood Mitigation Efforts in the Red River Basin|last=Simonovic|first=Slobodan|website=www.iclr.org|publisher=The Institute of Catastrophic Loss Reduction|access-date=20 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023195652/https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial/federal initiative.\n\n===Preparedness===\n[[File:Panther 8x8 action 15x10.jpg|thumb|An airport emergency preparedness exercise]]\nPreparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a [[disaster]] occurs. This equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster, to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an [[emergency]]. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/is10_unit3.doc |title=Animals in Disasters |publisher=Training.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714234229/http://www.training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/is10_unit3.doc |archive-date=2015-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This circular, overlapping model has been modified by other agencies, taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memphis.edu/ifti/pdfs/cait_phases_of_emergency_mngt.pdf|author=Baird, Malcolm E.|date=2010|title=The \"Phases\" of Emergency Management|publisher=Vanderbilt Center for Transportation Research|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>\n\nFEMA also operates a Building Science Branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/building-science|title=Building Science|work=fema.gov|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\nFEMA advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted.

In this guide, FEMA breaks down hazards into three categories: Natural, technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance. According to FEMA, \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur\" and \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them.\" To develop threat and hazard context descriptions, communities should take into account the time, place, and conditions in which threats or hazards might occur.\n\nNot all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established NGOs like the Red Cross. Emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet, with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness. On-line sales of items such as survival food, medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives, sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mypatriotsupply.com/ |title=My Patriot Supply : Homepage |publisher=Mypatriotsupply.com |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\nOne group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called [[Doomsday Preppers]]. This subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the FEMA or Red Cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough. Sometimes called [[survivalists]], Doomsday Preppers are often preparing for The End Of The World As We Know It, abbreviated as TEOTWAWKI. With a motto some have that \"The Future Belongs to those who Prepare,\" this Preparedness subset has its own set of Murphy's Rules,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://survivalcache.com/murphys-laws-of-teotwawki/ |title=Murphy's Laws of TEOTWAWKI |publisher=Survivalcache.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> including \"Rule Number 1: Food, you still don't have enough\" and \"Rule Number 26: People who thought the Government would save them, found out that it didn't.\"\n\nNot all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food, guns and shelters, though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]. The American Preppers Network<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanpreppersnetwork.com/|title=American Preppers Network \u2013 National family survival and preparedness organization|work=American Preppers Network|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add 'fun' to challenging times. These items include:\n* Books and magazines\n* Arts and crafts [[painting]]\n* Children's entertainment\n* Crayons and coloring books\n* Notebooks and writing supplies\n* Nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc.\n* Religious material\n* Sporting equipment, card games and board games\n* Posters and banners creating awareness\n\nEmergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members. For many people, pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well. It is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20140308/man-dies-trying-to-rescue-pets-from-fire |title=Man dies trying to rescue pets from fire |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> CDC's Disaster Supply Checklist for Pets includes:<ref name=\"emergency.cdc.gov\"/>\n* Food and water for at least 3 days for each pet; bowls, and a manual can opener.\n* Depending on the pet you may need a litter box, paper towels, plastic trash bags, grooming items, and/or household bleach.\n* Medications and medical records stored in a waterproof container.\n* First aid kit with a pet first aid book.\n* Sturdy leash, harness, and carrier to transport pet safely. A carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably, turn around, and lie down. Your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hours.\n* Pet toys and the pet's bed, if you can easily take it, to reduce stress.\n* Current photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated, and to prove that they are yours.\n* Information on feeding schedules, medical conditions, behavior problems, and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster care.\n\nEmergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training. Psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the Red Cross.<ref name=\"akamai1\"/> These mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them. CDC has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.samhsa.gov/MentalHealth/TraumaticEvent.aspx?from=carousel&position=1&date=3112011 |title=Coping with Traumatic Events, SAMHSA.gov |publisher=Media.samhsa.gov |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> After such an event, the CDC, through the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry, crying frequently, an increase in irritability, anger, and frequent arguing, wanting to be alone most of the time, feeling anxious or fearful, overwhelmed by sadness, confused, having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating, and difficulty making decisions, increased alcohol and/or substance use, increased physical (aches, pains) complaints such as headaches and trouble with \"nerves.\"\n\nSometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a [[Bug-out bag]]. While FEMA does not actually use the term \"Bug out bag,\" calling it instead some variation of a \"Go Kit,\" the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both FEMA and CDC, though on-line discussions of what items a \"bug out bag\" should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by FEMA or CDC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theprepperproject.com/bug-out-bag-checklist/ |title=Bug Out Bag Checklist |publisher=Theprepperproject.com |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> The theory behind a \"bug out bag\" is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of [[Emergency evacuation]]. Whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane, flood or dangerous chemical release, rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and FEMA suggests having a Family Emergency Plan for such occasions.<ref name=\"ready.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan |title=Make A Plan |publisher=Ready.gov |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Because family members may not be together when disaster strikes, this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other. Along with the contact information, FEMA suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |title=Escape From Fire! |publisher=Usfa.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211816/https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 }}</ref> Family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member's backpack or wallet. If family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location, such as at work or school, FEMA suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/> FEMA has a specific form, in English and in Spanish, to help people put together these emergency plans, though it lacks lines for email contact information.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/>\n\nLike children, people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs. While \"disability\" has a specific meaning for specific organizations such as collecting [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssdrc.com/disabilityquestions3-24.html |title=Who Will Qualify For Disability? \u2013 What Qualifying Is Based On |publisher=Ssdrc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> for the purposes of emergency preparedness, the Red Cross uses the term in a broader sense to include people with physical, medical, sensor or cognitive disabilities or the elderly and other special needs populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4240199_A4497.pdf |title=Preparing for Disaster for People with Disabilities and other Special Needs |publisher=Redcross.org |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Depending on the particular disability, specific emergency preparations might be required.

Ready.gov also notes that \"It is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity,\" cautioning that individual circuits should be shut off before the main circuit. Ready.gov further states that \"It is vital that all household members learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve\" and cautions that the possibility that rusty valves might require replacement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ready.gov/utility-shut-safety |title=Utility Shut-off & Safety |publisher=Ready.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315032954/http://www.ready.gov/utility-shut-safety |archive-date=2015-03-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Response===\n{{Main|Disaster response}}\n\nThe response phase of an emergency may commence with [[Search and Rescue]] but in all cases the focus will quickly turn to fulfilling the basic [[humanitarian]] [[basic needs|needs]] of the affected population. This assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations. Effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial, particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency (LEMA) capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself. The [[National Response Framework]] is a United States government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local, state, federal, and tribal levels. It provides guidance on Emergency Support Functions that may be integrated in whole or parts to aid in the response and recovery process.\n\nOn a personal level the response can take the shape either of a ''[[shelter in place]]'' or an ''[[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]''. [[File:Evacuation sign.jpg|thumb|Evacuation sign]]In a shelter-in-place scenario, a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support. In an ''evacuation'', a family leaves the area by [[automobile]] or other mode of [[transportation]], taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry, possibly including a tent for shelter. If mechanical transportation is not available, evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding, a [[tarpaulin]] and a bedroll of blankets.\n\n[[Donation]]s are often sought during this period, especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity. Due to efficiencies of scale, [[money]] is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided. Money is also the most flexible, and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted. Some donors prefer to send [[gifts in kind]], however these items can end up creating issues, rather than helping. One innovation by [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers is to use a donation registry, where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests, which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site.\n\nMedical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects. Survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include [[lacerations]], [[burn]]s, [[near drowning]], or [[crush syndrome]].\n\n===Recovery===\nThe recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided. The immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible. During reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the property.\n\nThe most extreme home confinement scenarios include war, [[famine]] and severe [[epidemic]]s and may last a year or more. Then recovery will take place inside the home. Planners for these events usually buy [[bulk purchasing|bulk]] foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment, and eat the food as part of normal life. A simple balanced diet can be constructed from [[vitamin]] pills, [[whole-meal]] wheat, beans, [[dried milk]], corn, and [[cooking oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/ |title=Federal Emergency Management Agency |publisher=FEMA.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> Vegetables, fruits, spices and meats, both prepared and fresh-gardened, are included when possible.\n\n==As a profession==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nProfessional emergency managers can focus on government and community preparedness, or private business preparedness. Training is provided by local, state, federal and private organizations and ranges from public information and media relations to high-level incident command and tactical skills.\n\nIn the past, the field of emergency management has been populated mostly by people with a military or first responder background. Currently, the field has become more diverse, with many managers coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields. Educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field. There are over 180 schools in the US with emergency management-related programs, but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Jaffin\n |first=Bob\n |date=September 17, 2008\n |url=http://www.emergencymgmt.com/training/Emergency-Management-Training-How.html\n |title=Emergency Management Training: How to Find the Right Program\n |publisher=Emergency Management Magazine\n |accessdate=2008-11-15\n}}</ref>\n\nProfessional certifications such as Certified Emergency Manager (CEM)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/certification/generalinfo/intro.htm |title=Certification-General CEM certification Info |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> and Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP)<ref name=\"drii.org\">Disaster Recovery Institute International. https://drii.org/</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Best Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Certifications |publisher=Tom's IT Pro |url=http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/business-continuity-disaster-recovery-certifications,2-766-4.html}}</ref> are becoming more common as professional standards are raised throughout the field, particularly in the United States. There are also professional organizations for emergency managers, such as the National Emergency Management Association and the International Association of Emergency Managers.\n\n===Principles===\nIn 2007, Dr. Wayne Blanchard of FEMA's Emergency Management Higher Education Project, at the direction of Dr. Cortez Lawrence, Superintendent of FEMA's Emergency Management Institute, convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management. This was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified. The group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management. Below is a summary:\n\n# Comprehensive \u2013 consider and take into account all hazards, all phases, all stakeholders and all impacts relevant to disasters.\n# Progressive \u2013 anticipate future disasters and take preventive and preparatory measures to build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities.\n# Risk-driven \u2013 use sound risk management principles (hazard identification, risk analysis, and impact analysis) in assigning priorities and resources.\n# Integrated \u2013 ensure [[unity of effort]] among all levels of government and all elements of a community.\n# Collaborative \u2013 create and sustain broad and sincere relationships among individuals and organizations to encourage trust, advocate a team atmosphere, build consensus, and facilitate communication.\n# Coordinated \u2013 synchronize the activities of all relevant stakeholders to achieve a common purpose.\n# Flexible \u2013 use creative and innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges.\n# Professional \u2013 value a science and knowledge-based approach; based on education, training, experience, ethical practice, public stewardship and continuous improvement.\n\nA fuller description of these principles can be found at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/emgt/PrinciplesofEmergencyManagement.pdf |title=Principles of Emergency Management Supplement |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Tools===\nIn recent years the continuity feature of emergency management has resulted in a new concept, [[emergency management information system]]s (EMIS). For continuity and inter-operability between emergency management stakeholders, EMIS supports an infrastructure that integrates emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement for all four phases of emergencies. In the healthcare field, hospitals utilize the [[Hospital Incident Command System]] (HICS), which provides structure and organization in a clearly defined chain of command.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Within other professions==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\n[[File:Rockefeller University Disaster Plan.jpg|thumb|A disaster plan book at [[Rockefeller University]] in a biochemistry research laboratory.]]\nPractitioners in emergency management come from an increasing variety of backgrounds. Professionals from [[memory institution]]s (e.g., museums, historical societies, etc.) are dedicated to preserving cultural heritage\u2014objects and records. This has been an increasingly major component within this field as a result of the heightened awareness following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|hurricanes in 2005]], and the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|collapse of the Cologne Archives]].\n\nTo increase the potential successful recovery of valuable records, a well-established and thoroughly tested plan must be developed. This plan should emphasize simplicity in order to aid in response and recovery: employees should perform similar tasks in the response and recovery phase that they perform under normal conditions. It should also include mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution.<ref>Buchanan, Sally. \"Emergency preparedness.\" from Paul Banks and Roberta Pilette.

Called Population Explorer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populationexplorer.com/ |title=FEWS Network&nbsp;\u2014 USAID |publisher=Population Explorer |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> the tool uses land scan population data, developed by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], to distribute population at a resolution 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for all countries in the world.

Population Explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions, including estimating populations impacted by floods in Central America and the Pacific Ocean tsunami event in 2009.\n\nIn 2007, a checklist for veterinarians was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, it had two sets of questions for a professional to ask themselves before assisting with an emergency:\n\n'''Absolute requirements for participation:'''\n* Have I chosen to participate?\n* Have I taken ICS training?\n* Have I taken other required background courses?\n* Have I made arrangements with my practice to deploy?\n* Have I made arrangements with my family?\n\n'''Incident participation:'''\n* Have I been invited to participate?\n* Are my skill sets a match for the mission?\n* Can I access just-in-time training to refresh skills or acquire needed new skills?\n* Is this a self-support mission?\n* Do I have supplies needed for three to five days of self-support?\n\nWhile written for veterinarians, this checklist is applicable for any professional to consider before assisting with an emergency.<ref>The Veterinary profession's duty of care in response to disasters and food animal emergencies.

TIEMS is a Global Forum for Education, Training, Certification and Policy in Emergency and Disaster Management. TIEMS' goal is to develop and bring modern emergency management tools, and techniques into practice, through the exchange of information, methodology innovations and new technologies.\n\nTIEMS provides a platform for stakeholders to meet, network and learn about new technical and operational methodologies. TIEMS focuses on cultural differences to be understood and included in the society's events, education and research programs. This is achieved by establishing local chapters worldwide.

The country is divided into 25 safety regions ([[w:nl:veiligheidsregio|veiligheidsregio]]). In a safety region, there are four components: the regional fire department, the regional department for medical care (ambulances and psycho-sociological care etc.), the regional dispatch and a section for risk- and crisis management. The regional dispatch operates for police, fire department and the regional medical care. The dispatch has all these three services combined into one dispatch for the best multi-coordinated response to an incident or an emergency. And also facilitates in information management, emergency communication and care of citizens. These services are the main structure for a response to an emergency. It can happen that, for a specific emergency, the co-operation with another service is needed, for instance the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]], [[water board]](s) or [[Rijkswaterstaat]]. The veiligheidsregio can integrate these other services into their structure by adding them to specific conferences on operational or administrative level.\n\nAll regions operate according to the [[Coordinated Regional Incident Management (Netherlands)|Coordinated Regional Incident Management]] system.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nFollowing the 2000 [[UK fuel protests|fuel protests]] and severe flooding that same year, as well as the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot-and-mouth]] crisis in 2001, the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). The CCA defined some organisations as Category 1 and 2 Responders, setting responsibilities regarding emergency preparedness and response. It is managed by the [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat]] through Regional Resilience Forums and local authorities.\n\nDisaster Management training is generally conducted at the local level, and consolidated through professional courses that can be taken at the [[Emergency Planning College]]. Diplomas, undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications can be gained at universities throughout the country. The Institute of Emergency Management is a charity, established in 1996, providing consulting services for the government, media and commercial sectors.

This type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies, which require the development of hazard/threat specific plans, such as the development of specific H1N1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans.\n\nIn the United States, all disasters are initially local, with local authorities, with usually a police, fire, or EMS agency, taking charge. Many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated [[office of emergency management]] (OEM), along with personnel and equipment. If the event becomes overwhelming to the local government, state emergency management (the primary government structure of the United States) becomes the controlling emergency management agency. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), is the lead federal agency for emergency management. The United States and its territories are broken down into ten regions for FEMA's emergency management purposes. FEMA supports, but does not override, state authority.\n\nThe [[Citizen Corps]] is an organization of volunteer service programs, administered locally and coordinated nationally by DHS, which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education, training, and outreach. Most [[disaster response]] is carried out by volunteer organizations. In the US, the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] is chartered by Congress to coordinate disaster response services. It is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees. Religious organizations, with their ability to provide volunteers quickly, are usually integral during the response process.

As time goes on, and more data become available, usually through the study of emergencies as they occur, a plan should evolve. The development of emergency plans is a cyclical process, common to many risk management disciplines, such as business continuity and security risk management, as set out below:\n* Recognition or identification of risks<ref>Zhou, Q., Huang, W., & Zhang, Y.

There are very few emergency management specific standards, and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards.\n\nIn order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business, emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks. In the event that an emergency does occur, managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency, as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations after the incident. It is essential for an organization to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activated. An emergency plan must be regularly maintained, in a structured and methodical manner, to ensure it is up-to-date in the event of an emergency. Emergency managers generally follow a common process to anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover from an incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/emergency|title=Emergency Response Plan - Ready.gov|website=www.ready.gov}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety of workers ==\nCleanup during disaster recovery involves many [[occupational hazard]]s.

After a natural disaster, certain chemicals can be more prominent in the environment. These hazardous materials can be released directly or indirectly. Chemical hazards directly released after a natural disaster often occur concurrent with the event so little to no mitigation actions can take place for mitigation. For example, airborne magnesium, chloride, phosphorus, and ammonia can be generated by droughts. Dioxins can be produced by forest fires, and silica can be emitted by forest fires. Indirect release of hazardous chemicals can be intentionally released or unintentionally released. An example of intentional release is insecticides used after a flood or chlorine treatment of water after a flood. Unintentional release is when a hazardous chemical is not intentionally released. The chemical released is often toxic and serves beneficial purpose when released to the environment. These chemicals can be controlled through engineering to minimize their release when a natural disaster strikes. An example of this is agrochemicals from inundated storehouses or manufacturing facilities poisoning the floodwaters or asbestos fibers released from a building collapse during a hurricane.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Stacy|last2=Balluz|first2=Lina|last3=Malilay|first3=Josephine|date=2004-04-25|title=Natural and technologic hazardous material releases during and after natural disasters: a review|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=publichealthresources|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=322|issue=1|pages=3\u201320|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00446-7|pmid=15081734|bibcode=2004ScTEn.322....3Y}}</ref> The flowchart to the right has been adopted from research performed by Stacy Young, et al., and can be found here.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\"/>\n\n'''Exposure limits'''\n[[File:Hazardous Chemical Release Flowchart.jpg|thumb|Classification of hazardous material releases associated with natural disasters]]\nBelow are TLV-TWA, PEL, and IDLH values for common chemicals workers are exposed to after a natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/annotated-pels/|title=OSHA Annotated PELs {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/pgintrod.html|title=CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards (NPG) Introduction|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Chemical'''\n|'''TLV-TWA (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''PEL (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''IDLH (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|-\n|'''Magnesium'''\n|10\n|15\n|750\n|-\n|'''Phosphorus'''\n|0.1\n|0.1\n|Not established\n|-\n|'''Ammonia'''\n|17\n|35\n|27\n|-\n|'''Silica(R)'''\n|.025\n|10\n|50\n|-\n|'''Chlorine dioxide'''\n|0.28\n|0.3\n|29\n|-\n|'''Asbestos'''\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|Not established\n|}\n\n'''Direct release'''\n* Magnesium\n* Phosphorus\n* Ammonia\n* Silica\n\n'''Intentional release'''\n* Insecticides\n* Chlorine dioxide\n\n'''Unintentional release'''\n* Crude oil components\n* Benzene, N-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, cumene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, toluene, xylenes, PCBs, agrochemicals\n* Asbestos\n\n'''Exposure routes'''\n\nWhen a toxicant is prominent in an environment after a natural disaster, it is important to determine the route of exposure to worker safety for the disaster management workers. The three components are source of exposure, pathway of the chemical, and receptor. Questions to ask when dealing with chemical source is the material itself, how it's used, how much is used, how often the chemical is used, temperature, vapor pressure, physical processes. The physical state of the chemical is important to identify. If working indoors, room ventilation, and volume of room needs to be noted to help mitigate health defects from the chemical. Lastly, to ensure worker safety, routes of entry for the chemical should be determined as well as relevant personal protective equipment needs to be worn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2012-09-07|isbn=9780309264686|language=en|doi=10.17226/13507|pmid = 24901193}}</ref>\n\n'''Respirators'''\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cIf you need to collect belongings or do basic clean up in your previously flooded home, you do not usually need to use a respirator (a mask worn to prevent breathing in harmful substances).\u201d A respirator should be worn when performing an operation in an enclosed environment such as a house that creates ample amounts of dust. These activities could include sweeping dust, using power saws and equipment, or cleaning up mold. If you encounter dust, the CDC says to \u201climit your contact with the dust as much as possible. Use wet mops or vacuums with HEPA filters instead of dry sweeping and lastly wear a respirator that protects against dust in the air. A respirator that is approved by the CDC/NIOSH is the [[N95 respirator]] and can be a good personal protective equipment to protect from dust and mold in the air from the associated natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/respiratory.html|title=Respiratory Protection for Residents Reentering Previously Flooded Areas{{!}}Health and Safety Concerns|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Biological exposures ===\n\n'''Mold exposures''': Exposure to [[mold]] is commonly seen after a natural disaster such as flooding, hurricane, tornado or tsunami.

Warm and humid condition encourages mold growth; therefore, standing water and excess moisture after a natural disaster would provide an ideal environment for mold growth especially in tropical regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/mold/|title=Mold \u2013 Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=8 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref> While the exact number of mold species is unknown, some examples of commonly found indoor molds are [[Aspergillus]], [[Cladosporium]], [[Alternaria]] and [[Penicillium]]. Reaction to molds differ between individuals and can range from mild symptoms such as eye irritation, cough to severe life-threatening asthmatic or allergic reactions. People with history of [[chronic lung disease (disambiguation)|chronic lung disease]], asthma, allergy, other breathing problems or those that are [[immunocompromised]] could be more sensitive to molds and may develop [[fungal pneumonia]].\n\nThe most effective approach to control mold growth after a natural disaster is to control moisture level. Some ways to prevent mold growth after a natural disaster include opening all doors and windows, using fans to dry out the building, positioning fans to blow air out of the windows and cleaning up the building within the first 24\u201348 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/mold/ten-things-you-should-know-about-mold|title=Ten Things You Should Know about Mold \u2013 US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|website=US EPA|date=2014-10-22}}</ref> All wet items that cannot be properly cleaned and dried within the first 48 hours should be promptly removed and discarded from the building. If mold growth is found in the building, it is important to concurrently remove the molds and fix the underlying moisture problem. When removing molds, N-95 masks or respirators with a higher protection level should be used to prevent inhalation of molds into the respiratory system.<ref>https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/moldguide12.pdf</ref> Molds can be removed from hard surfaces by soap and water, a diluted bleach solution<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/psa/moldremoval.html|title=Mold Removal After a Disaster-PSAs for Disasters|website=www.cdc.gov|date=2019-02-28}}</ref> or commercial products.\n\n'''Human remains''': According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]], \"There is no direct risk of contagion or infectious disease from being near human remains for people who are not directly involved in recovery or other efforts that require handling dead bodies.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/handleremains.html|title=Handling Human Remains After a Disaster{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Most viruses and bacteria perish along with the human body after death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/ems/flood_cds/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Flooding and communicable diseases fact sheet|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Therefore, no excessive measures are necessary when handling human remains indirectly. However, for workers in direct contact with human remains, [[universal precautions]] should be exercised in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to blood-borne viruses and bacteria. Relevant [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] includes eye protection, face mask or shield, and gloves. The predominant health risk are gastrointestinal infections through [[Fecal\u2013oral route|fecal-oral]] contamination, so [[Hand washing|hand hygiene]] is paramount to prevention. Mental health support should also be available to workers who endure [[psychological stress]] during and after recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|title=American Psychological Association_Disasters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229124918/http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|archive-date=2009-12-29|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n'''Flood-associated skin infections''': Flood waters are often contaminated with bacteria and waste as well as chemicals on occasion. Prolonged, direct contact with these waters leads to an increased risk for skin infection, especially with open wounds in the skin or history of a previous skin condition, such as [[atopic dermatitis]] or [[psoriasis]]. These infections are exacerbated with a compromised immune system or an aging population.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most common bacterial skin infections are usually with [[Staphylococcus]] and [[Streptococcus]]. One of the most uncommon, but well-known bacterial infections is from [[Vibrio vulnificus]], which causes a rare, but often fatal infection called [[necrotizing fasciitis]].\n[[File:Necrotizing fasciitis left leg debridement.JPEG|thumb|Surgical debridement of left leg necrotizing fasciitis.]]\n\nOther salt-water Mycobacterium infections include the slow growing [[Mycobacterium marinum|M. marinum]] and fast growing [[Mycobacterium fortuitum|M. fortuitum]], [[Mycobacterium chelonae|M. chelonae]], and [[Mycobacterium abscessus|M. abscessus]]. Fresh-water bacterial infections include [[aeromonas hydrophila]], [[Burkholderia pseudomallei]] causing [[melioidosis]], [[leptospira interrogans]] causing [[leptospirosis]], and chromobacterium violaceum. Fungal infections may lead to [[chromoblastomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]], [[mucormycosis]], and [[dermatophytosis]]. Numerous other [[arthropod]], [[Protozoan infection|protozoal]], and [[Parasitic disease|parasitic]] infections have been described.<ref name=\":0\" /> A worker can reduce the risk of flood-associated skin infections by avoiding the water if an open wound is present, or at minimum, cover the open wound with a waterproof bandage. Should contact with flood water occur, the open wound should be washed thoroughly with soap and clean water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/vibriovulnificus.html|title=Vibrio vulnificus{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=2017-10-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychosocial exposures ===\nProviding disaster recovery assistance is both rewarding and stressful. According to the CDC, \"Sources of stress for emergency responders may include witnessing human suffering, risk of personal harm, intense workloads, life-and-death decisions, and separation from family.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/coping/responders.asp|title=Emergency Responders: Tips for taking care of yourself|date=2017-11-07|website=emergency.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> These stresses need to be prevented or effectively managed in order to optimize assistance without causing danger to oneself. Preparation as an emergency responder is key, in addition to establishing care for responsibilities at home. During the recovery efforts, it is critical to understand and recognize burnout and sources of stress. After the recovery, it is vital to take time away from the disaster scene and slowly re-integrate back to the normal work environment. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)]] provides stress prevention and management resources for disaster recovery responders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/disaster-preparedness|title=Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery|last=ann.lynsen|date=2014-06-20|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Volunteer responsibilities ===\nThe [[FEMA|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] advises those who desire to assist go through organized volunteer organizations and not to self-deploy to affected locations. The [[VOAD|National Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD)]] serves as the primary point of contact for volunteer organization coordination. All states have their own state VOAD organization. As a volunteer, since an employer does not have oversight, one must be vigilant and protect against possible physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial exposures. Furthermore, there must be defined roles with relevant training available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/resources/disaster-services/defining-volunteer-roles-preparation-disaster-response|title=Defining Volunteer Roles in Preparation for Disaster Response|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Proper tools and PPE may or may not be available, so safety and liability should always be considered.\n\n=== Employer responsibilities ===\nEvery employer is required to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for its employees. When an emergency situation occurs, employers are expected to protect workers from all harm resulting from any potential hazard, including physical, chemical, and biological exposure. In addition, an employer should provide pre-emergency training and build an emergency action plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/responsibilities.html|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: Employer Responsibilities and Worker Rights|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Emergency action plan (EAP) ====\nA written document about what actions employers and employees should take when responding to an emergency situation. According to OSHA regulations 1910.38,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9726&p_table=standards|title=Emergency action plans. \u2013 1910.38 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> an employer must have an emergency action plan whenever an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard in this part requires one. To develop an emergency action plan, an employer should start from workplace evaluation. Typically, most of the occupational emergency management can be divided into worksite evaluation, exposure monitoring, hazard control, work practices, and training.\n\n'''Worksite evaluation''' is about identifying the source and location of the potential hazards such as [[Falling (accident)|fall]], [[noise]], [[cold]], [[heat]], [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], infectious materials, and toxic chemicals that each of the workers may encounter during emergency situations.\n\n===== Exposure monitoring =====\nAfter identifying the source and location of the hazard(s), it is essential to monitor how employees may be exposed to these dangers. Employers should conduct task-specific exposure monitoring when they meet following requirements:\n* When the exposed substance has specific standard required by OSHA\n* When employers anticipate workers will be exposed to more hazards than the action level set by OSHA\n* When there is a worker complaint or concern about the exposure\n* When an employee questions the effectiveness of the existing hazard control methods\nTo effectively acquire the above information, an employer can ask workers how they perform the task or use direct reading instruments to identify the exposure level and exposure route.\n\n===== Hazard control =====\nEmployers can conduct hazard control by:\n* Elimination or substitution: Eliminating the hazard from the workplace.\n* [[Engineering controls]]\n* Work practice or administrative controls: Change the how the task was performed to reduce the probability of exposure.\n* [[Personal protective equipment]]\n\n===== Training =====\nEmployers should train their employees annually before an emergency action plan is implemented. [https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081027/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9726&p_text_version=FALSE#1910.38(f)(1) <nowiki>[29 CFR 1910.38(e)]</nowiki>] The purpose of training is to inform employees of their responsibilities and/or plan of action during emergency situations. The training program should include the types of emergencies that may occur, the appropriate response, evacuation procedure, warning/reporting procedure, and shutdown procedures. Training requirements are different depending on the size of workplace and workforce, processes used, materials handled, available resources and who will be in charge during an emergency.\n\nThe training program should address the following information:\n* Workers' roles and responsibilities.\n* Potential hazards and hazard-preventing actions.\n* Notification alarm system, and communications process<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=18960|title=08/07/1981 \u2013 Fire detection and employee alarm systems. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n* Communication means between family members in an emergency.\n* [[First aid kit (disambiguation)|First Aid Kit]]\n* Emergency response procedures.\n* Evacuation procedures.\n* A list of emergency equipment including its location and function.\n* Emergency shutdown procedures.\nAfter the emergency action plan is completed, employer and employees should review the plan carefully and post it in a public area that is accessible to everyone. In addition, another responsibility of the employer is to keep a record of any injury or illness of workers according to OSHA/State Plan Record-keeping regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=12783|title=Reporting fatalities, hospitalizations, amputations, and losses of an eye as a result of work-related incidents to OSHA. \u2013 1904.39 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Implementation ideals==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}\n\n===Pre-incident training and testing===\n[[File:Emergency Responders (8743399305).jpg|thumb|right|A team of emergency responders performs a training scenario involving [[anthrax]].]]\nEmergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs. Training plans should include internal people, contractors and civil protection partners, and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing.\n\nTesting of a plan's effectiveness should occur regularly. In instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space, joint emergency plans, formally agreed to by all parties, should be put into place.\n\nDrills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held, with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency, and people who will be affected. Drills are held to prepare for the hazards of [[Fire drill|fires]], [[Tornado drill|tornadoes]], [[lockdown]] for protection, [[earthquake]]s, etc.\n\n===Communicating and incident assessment===\nCommunication is one of the key issues during any emergency, pre-planning of communications is critical. Miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily.\n\nOnce an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken. Following assessment, the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan. The steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible. The critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized.\n\nThe communication policy must be well known and rehearsed, and all targeted audiences must be alert. All [[Emergency communication system|communication infrastructure]] must be as prepared as possible, with all information on groupings clearly identified.\n\n==Phases and personal activities==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nEmergency management consists of five phases: prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. [http://www.fema.gov/mission-areas Mission Areas | FEMA.gov]\n\n===Prevention===\n{{See also|Pandemic prevention}}\nIt focuses on preventing the human hazard, primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels, designed to provide permanent protection from disasters. Also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans, environmental planning and design standards. In January 2005, 167 Governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the [[World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction|Hyogo Framework]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nPreventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today. Prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery. Public Safety Canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach. In 2009, Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers endorsed a National Disaster Mitigation Strategy.\n\n===Mitigation strategy===\nDisaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs.\n\nPreventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters. In earthquake prone areas, these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an [[earthquake valve]] to instantly shut off the natural gas supply, [[seismic retrofit]]s of property, and the securing of items inside a building. The latter may include the mounting of furniture, [[refrigerator]]s, [[water heater]]s and breakables to the walls, and the addition of cabinet latches. In flood prone areas, houses can be built on poles/stilts. In areas prone to prolonged electricity [[power blackout|black-outs]] installation of a [[electrical generator|generator]] ensures continuation of electrical service. The construction of [[storm cellar]]s and [[fallout shelter]]s are further examples of personal mitigative actions.\n\nOn a national level, governments might implement large scale mitigation measures. After the monsoon floods of 2010, the Punjab government subsequently constructed 22 'disaster-resilient' model villages, comprising 1885 single-storey homes, together with schools and health centres.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/news-pakistans-punjab-builds-model-villages-to-withstand-disasters/?loclang=en_gb ''NEWS: Pakistan's Punjab builds model villages to withstand disasters''], [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 17 December 2013.</ref>\n\nOne of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the Red River Floodway. The building of the Floodway was a joint provincial/federal undertaking to protect the City of Winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the Red River Basin. It cost $62.7 million to build in the 1960s. Since then, the floodway has been used over 20 times. Its use during the 1997 Red River Flood alone saved an estimated $4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|title=Flood Mitigation Efforts in the Red River Basin|last=Simonovic|first=Slobodan|website=www.iclr.org|publisher=The Institute of Catastrophic Loss Reduction|access-date=20 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023195652/https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial/federal initiative.\n\n===Preparedness===\n[[File:Panther 8x8 action 15x10.jpg|thumb|An airport emergency preparedness exercise]]\nPreparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a [[disaster]] occurs. This equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster, to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an [[emergency]]. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/is10_unit3.doc |title=Animals in Disasters |publisher=Training.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714234229/http://www.training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/is10_unit3.doc |archive-date=2015-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This circular, overlapping model has been modified by other agencies, taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memphis.edu/ifti/pdfs/cait_phases_of_emergency_mngt.pdf|author=Baird, Malcolm E.|date=2010|title=The \"Phases\" of Emergency Management|publisher=Vanderbilt Center for Transportation Research|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>\n\nFEMA also operates a Building Science Branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/building-science|title=Building Science|work=fema.gov|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\nFEMA advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted.

Some organizations blend these various levels. For example, the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] has a webpage on disaster training<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/disaster-training|title=Disaster Training|work=redcross.org|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> as well as offering training on basic preparedness such as [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and [[First Aid]].

Nonetheless, there is basic guidance for preparedness that is common despite an area's specific dangers. FEMA recommends that everyone have a three-day survival kit for their household.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/areyouready/basic_preparedness.pdf |title=Basic Preparedness |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Because individual household sizes and specific needs might vary, FEMA's recommendations are not item specific, but the list includes:\n* Three-day supply of non-perishable food.\n* Three-day supply of water \u2013 one gallon of water per person, per day.\n* Portable, battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries.\n* Flashlight and extra batteries.\n* First aid kit and manual.\n* [[Sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] items (e.g. [[toilet paper]], [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene products]]).\n* Matches and waterproof container.\n* Whistle.\n* Extra clothing.\n* Kitchen accessories and cooking utensils, including a can opener.\n* Photocopies of credit and identification cards.\n* Cash and coins.\n* Special needs items, such as prescription medications, eyeglasses, contact lens solutions, and hearing aid batteries.\n* Items for infants, such as formula, diapers, bottles, and pacifiers.\n* Other items to meet unique family needs.\n\nAlong similar lines, but not exactly the same, CDC has its own list for a proper disaster supply kit.<ref name=\"emergency.cdc.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/preparedness/kit/disasters/ |title=CDC Emergency preparedness and You &#124; Gather Emergency Supplies &#124; Disaster Supplies Kit |publisher=Emergency.cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317033851/http://emergency.cdc.gov/preparedness/kit/disasters/ |archive-date=2015-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Water\u2014one gallon per person, per day\n* Food\u2014nonperishable, easy-to-prepare items\n* Flashlight\n* Battery powered or hand crank radio (NOAA Weather Radio, if possible)\n* Extra batteries\n* First aid kit\n* Medications (7-day supply), other medical supplies, and medical paperwork (e.g., medication list and pertinent medical information)\n* Multipurpose tool (e.g., Swiss army knife)\n* Sanitation and personal hygiene items\n* Copies of personal documents (e.g., proof of address, deed/lease to home, passports, birth certificates, and insurance policies)\n* Cell phone with chargers\n* Family and emergency contact information\n* Extra cash\n* Emergency blanket\n* Map(s) of the area\n* Extra set of car keys and house keys\n* Manual can opener\n\nChildren are a special population when considering Emergency preparedness and many resources are directly focused on supporting them. SAMHSA has list of tips for talking to children during infectious disease outbreaks, to include being a good listener, encouraging children to ask questions and modeling self-care by setting routines, eating healthy meals, getting enough sleep and taking deep breaths to handle stress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/SMA14-4886/SMA14-4886.pdf |title=Talking With Children |publisher=Store.samhsa.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322063301/http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA14-4886/SMA14-4886.pdf |archive-date=2015-03-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> FEMA has similar advice, noting that \"Disasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure\" whether a child has experienced it first hand, had it happen to a friend or simply saw it on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/coping-disaster#4 |title=Coping with Disaster |publisher=FEMA.gov |date=2015-01-31 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> In the same publication, FEMA further notes, \"Preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen, and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster. Preparation helps; when people feel prepared, they cope better and so do children.\"\n\nTo help people assess what threats might be in order to augment their emergency supplies or improve their disaster response skills, FEMA has published a booklet called the \"Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Guide.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/8ca0a9e54dc8b037a55b402b2a269e94/CPG201_htirag_2nd_edition.pdf |title=Threat and Hazrd Identification and Risk Assessment Guide |date=August 2013 |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> (THIRA) This guide, which outlines the THIRA process, emphasizes \"whole community involvement,\" not just governmental agencies, in preparedness efforts. In this guide, FEMA breaks down hazards into three categories: Natural, technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance. According to FEMA, \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur\" and \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them.\" To develop threat and hazard context descriptions, communities should take into account the time, place, and conditions in which threats or hazards might occur.\n\nNot all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established NGOs like the Red Cross. Emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet, with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness. On-line sales of items such as survival food, medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives, sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mypatriotsupply.com/ |title=My Patriot Supply : Homepage |publisher=Mypatriotsupply.com |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\nOne group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called [[Doomsday Preppers]]. This subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the FEMA or Red Cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough. Sometimes called [[survivalists]], Doomsday Preppers are often preparing for The End Of The World As We Know It, abbreviated as TEOTWAWKI. With a motto some have that \"The Future Belongs to those who Prepare,\" this Preparedness subset has its own set of Murphy's Rules,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://survivalcache.com/murphys-laws-of-teotwawki/ |title=Murphy's Laws of TEOTWAWKI |publisher=Survivalcache.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> including \"Rule Number 1: Food, you still don't have enough\" and \"Rule Number 26: People who thought the Government would save them, found out that it didn't.\"\n\nNot all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food, guns and shelters, though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]. The American Preppers Network<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanpreppersnetwork.com/|title=American Preppers Network \u2013 National family survival and preparedness organization|work=American Preppers Network|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add 'fun' to challenging times. These items include:\n* Books and magazines\n* Arts and crafts [[painting]]\n* Children's entertainment\n* Crayons and coloring books\n* Notebooks and writing supplies\n* Nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc.\n* Religious material\n* Sporting equipment, card games and board games\n* Posters and banners creating awareness\n\nEmergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members. For many people, pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well. It is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20140308/man-dies-trying-to-rescue-pets-from-fire |title=Man dies trying to rescue pets from fire |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> CDC's Disaster Supply Checklist for Pets includes:<ref name=\"emergency.cdc.gov\"/>\n* Food and water for at least 3 days for each pet; bowls, and a manual can opener.\n* Depending on the pet you may need a litter box, paper towels, plastic trash bags, grooming items, and/or household bleach.\n* Medications and medical records stored in a waterproof container.\n* First aid kit with a pet first aid book.\n* Sturdy leash, harness, and carrier to transport pet safely. A carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably, turn around, and lie down. Your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hours.\n* Pet toys and the pet's bed, if you can easily take it, to reduce stress.\n* Current photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated, and to prove that they are yours.\n* Information on feeding schedules, medical conditions, behavior problems, and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster care.\n\nEmergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training. Psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the Red Cross.<ref name=\"akamai1\"/> These mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them. CDC has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.samhsa.gov/MentalHealth/TraumaticEvent.aspx?from=carousel&position=1&date=3112011 |title=Coping with Traumatic Events, SAMHSA.gov |publisher=Media.samhsa.gov |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> After such an event, the CDC, through the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry, crying frequently, an increase in irritability, anger, and frequent arguing, wanting to be alone most of the time, feeling anxious or fearful, overwhelmed by sadness, confused, having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating, and difficulty making decisions, increased alcohol and/or substance use, increased physical (aches, pains) complaints such as headaches and trouble with \"nerves.\"\n\nSometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a [[Bug-out bag]]. While FEMA does not actually use the term \"Bug out bag,\" calling it instead some variation of a \"Go Kit,\" the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both FEMA and CDC, though on-line discussions of what items a \"bug out bag\" should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by FEMA or CDC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theprepperproject.com/bug-out-bag-checklist/ |title=Bug Out Bag Checklist |publisher=Theprepperproject.com |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> The theory behind a \"bug out bag\" is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of [[Emergency evacuation]]. Whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane, flood or dangerous chemical release, rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and FEMA suggests having a Family Emergency Plan for such occasions.<ref name=\"ready.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan |title=Make A Plan |publisher=Ready.gov |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Because family members may not be together when disaster strikes, this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other. Along with the contact information, FEMA suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |title=Escape From Fire! |publisher=Usfa.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211816/https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 }}</ref> Family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member's backpack or wallet. If family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location, such as at work or school, FEMA suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/> FEMA has a specific form, in English and in Spanish, to help people put together these emergency plans, though it lacks lines for email contact information.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/>\n\nLike children, people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs. While \"disability\" has a specific meaning for specific organizations such as collecting [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssdrc.com/disabilityquestions3-24.html |title=Who Will Qualify For Disability? \u2013 What Qualifying Is Based On |publisher=Ssdrc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> for the purposes of emergency preparedness, the Red Cross uses the term in a broader sense to include people with physical, medical, sensor or cognitive disabilities or the elderly and other special needs populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4240199_A4497.pdf |title=Preparing for Disaster for People with Disabilities and other Special Needs |publisher=Redcross.org |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Depending on the particular disability, specific emergency preparations might be required.

Effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial, particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency (LEMA) capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself. The [[National Response Framework]] is a United States government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local, state, federal, and tribal levels. It provides guidance on Emergency Support Functions that may be integrated in whole or parts to aid in the response and recovery process.\n\nOn a personal level the response can take the shape either of a ''[[shelter in place]]'' or an ''[[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]''. [[File:Evacuation sign.jpg|thumb|Evacuation sign]]In a shelter-in-place scenario, a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support. In an ''evacuation'', a family leaves the area by [[automobile]] or other mode of [[transportation]], taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry, possibly including a tent for shelter. If mechanical transportation is not available, evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding, a [[tarpaulin]] and a bedroll of blankets.\n\n[[Donation]]s are often sought during this period, especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity. Due to efficiencies of scale, [[money]] is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided. Money is also the most flexible, and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted. Some donors prefer to send [[gifts in kind]], however these items can end up creating issues, rather than helping. One innovation by [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers is to use a donation registry, where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests, which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site.\n\nMedical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects. Survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include [[lacerations]], [[burn]]s, [[near drowning]], or [[crush syndrome]].\n\n===Recovery===\nThe recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided. The immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible. During reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the property.\n\nThe most extreme home confinement scenarios include war, [[famine]] and severe [[epidemic]]s and may last a year or more. Then recovery will take place inside the home. Planners for these events usually buy [[bulk purchasing|bulk]] foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment, and eat the food as part of normal life. A simple balanced diet can be constructed from [[vitamin]] pills, [[whole-meal]] wheat, beans, [[dried milk]], corn, and [[cooking oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/ |title=Federal Emergency Management Agency |publisher=FEMA.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> Vegetables, fruits, spices and meats, both prepared and fresh-gardened, are included when possible.\n\n==As a profession==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nProfessional emergency managers can focus on government and community preparedness, or private business preparedness. Training is provided by local, state, federal and private organizations and ranges from public information and media relations to high-level incident command and tactical skills.\n\nIn the past, the field of emergency management has been populated mostly by people with a military or first responder background. Currently, the field has become more diverse, with many managers coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields. Educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field. There are over 180 schools in the US with emergency management-related programs, but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Jaffin\n |first=Bob\n |date=September 17, 2008\n |url=http://www.emergencymgmt.com/training/Emergency-Management-Training-How.html\n |title=Emergency Management Training: How to Find the Right Program\n |publisher=Emergency Management Magazine\n |accessdate=2008-11-15\n}}</ref>\n\nProfessional certifications such as Certified Emergency Manager (CEM)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/certification/generalinfo/intro.htm |title=Certification-General CEM certification Info |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> and Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP)<ref name=\"drii.org\">Disaster Recovery Institute International. https://drii.org/</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Best Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Certifications |publisher=Tom's IT Pro |url=http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/business-continuity-disaster-recovery-certifications,2-766-4.html}}</ref> are becoming more common as professional standards are raised throughout the field, particularly in the United States. There are also professional organizations for emergency managers, such as the National Emergency Management Association and the International Association of Emergency Managers.\n\n===Principles===\nIn 2007, Dr. Wayne Blanchard of FEMA's Emergency Management Higher Education Project, at the direction of Dr. Cortez Lawrence, Superintendent of FEMA's Emergency Management Institute, convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management. This was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified. The group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management. Below is a summary:\n\n# Comprehensive \u2013 consider and take into account all hazards, all phases, all stakeholders and all impacts relevant to disasters.\n# Progressive \u2013 anticipate future disasters and take preventive and preparatory measures to build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities.\n# Risk-driven \u2013 use sound risk management principles (hazard identification, risk analysis, and impact analysis) in assigning priorities and resources.\n# Integrated \u2013 ensure [[unity of effort]] among all levels of government and all elements of a community.\n# Collaborative \u2013 create and sustain broad and sincere relationships among individuals and organizations to encourage trust, advocate a team atmosphere, build consensus, and facilitate communication.\n# Coordinated \u2013 synchronize the activities of all relevant stakeholders to achieve a common purpose.\n# Flexible \u2013 use creative and innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges.\n# Professional \u2013 value a science and knowledge-based approach; based on education, training, experience, ethical practice, public stewardship and continuous improvement.\n\nA fuller description of these principles can be found at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/emgt/PrinciplesofEmergencyManagement.pdf |title=Principles of Emergency Management Supplement |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Tools===\nIn recent years the continuity feature of emergency management has resulted in a new concept, [[emergency management information system]]s (EMIS). For continuity and inter-operability between emergency management stakeholders, EMIS supports an infrastructure that integrates emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement for all four phases of emergencies. In the healthcare field, hospitals utilize the [[Hospital Incident Command System]] (HICS), which provides structure and organization in a clearly defined chain of command.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Within other professions==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\n[[File:Rockefeller University Disaster Plan.jpg|thumb|A disaster plan book at [[Rockefeller University]] in a biochemistry research laboratory.]]\nPractitioners in emergency management come from an increasing variety of backgrounds. Professionals from [[memory institution]]s (e.g., museums, historical societies, etc.) are dedicated to preserving cultural heritage\u2014objects and records. This has been an increasingly major component within this field as a result of the heightened awareness following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|hurricanes in 2005]], and the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|collapse of the Cologne Archives]].\n\nTo increase the potential successful recovery of valuable records, a well-established and thoroughly tested plan must be developed. This plan should emphasize simplicity in order to aid in response and recovery: employees should perform similar tasks in the response and recovery phase that they perform under normal conditions. It should also include mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution.<ref>Buchanan, Sally. \"Emergency preparedness.\" from Paul Banks and Roberta Pilette.

Called Population Explorer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populationexplorer.com/ |title=FEWS Network&nbsp;\u2014 USAID |publisher=Population Explorer |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> the tool uses land scan population data, developed by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], to distribute population at a resolution 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for all countries in the world. Used by USAID's [[Famine Early Warning System Network|FEWS NET]] Project to estimate populations vulnerable to, or impacted by, food insecurity. Population Explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions, including estimating populations impacted by floods in Central America and the Pacific Ocean tsunami event in 2009.\n\nIn 2007, a checklist for veterinarians was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, it had two sets of questions for a professional to ask themselves before assisting with an emergency:\n\n'''Absolute requirements for participation:'''\n* Have I chosen to participate?\n* Have I taken ICS training?\n* Have I taken other required background courses?\n* Have I made arrangements with my practice to deploy?\n* Have I made arrangements with my family?\n\n'''Incident participation:'''\n* Have I been invited to participate?\n* Are my skill sets a match for the mission?\n* Can I access just-in-time training to refresh skills or acquire needed new skills?\n* Is this a self-support mission?\n* Do I have supplies needed for three to five days of self-support?\n\nWhile written for veterinarians, this checklist is applicable for any professional to consider before assisting with an emergency.<ref>The Veterinary profession's duty of care in response to disasters and food animal emergencies.

TIEMS is a Global Forum for Education, Training, Certification and Policy in Emergency and Disaster Management. TIEMS' goal is to develop and bring modern emergency management tools, and techniques into practice, through the exchange of information, methodology innovations and new technologies.\n\nTIEMS provides a platform for stakeholders to meet, network and learn about new technical and operational methodologies. TIEMS focuses on cultural differences to be understood and included in the society's events, education and research programs. This is achieved by establishing local chapters worldwide. Today, TIEMS has chapters in Benelux, Romania, Finland, Italy, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Iraq, India, Korea, Japan and China.\n\n===International Association of Emergency Managers===\nThe [[International Association of Emergency Managers]] (IAEM) is a non-profit educational organization aimed at promoting the goals of saving lives and property protection during emergencies. The mission of IAEM is to serve its members by providing information, networking and professional opportunities, and to advance the emergency management profession.\n\nIt has seven councils around the world: Asia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/Regions/IAEMAsia/IAEMAsia.htm |title=IAEMAsia |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/Region13.htm |title=Region 13 |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> Europa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/regions/iaemeuropa/ |title=IAEM Europa |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> International,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/internationalregion/intregion.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018125748/http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/Regions/InternationalRegion/intregion.htm |archivedate=2005-10-18 }}</ref> Oceania,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/IAEMOceania/IAEMOceania.htm |title=IAEM Oceania |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> Student<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/about/membership/regions/studentregion/studentregion.htm |title=Welcome to IAEM.COM- International Association of Emergency Managers |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> and USA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/Councils/IAEM-USA.htm |title=Iaem-Usa |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe Air Force Emergency Management Association, affiliated by membership with the IAEM, provides emergency management information and networking for [[U.S. Air Force Emergency Management]] personnel.\n\n===International Recovery Platform===\nThe [[International Recovery Platform]] (IRP) is a joint initiative of international organizations, national and local governments, and non-governmental organizations engaged in disaster recovery, and seeking to transform disasters into opportunities for sustainable development.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.preventionweb.net/organizations/2780 |website=PreventionWeb |title=International Recovery Platform (IRP)}}</ref>\n\nIRP was established following the Second UN World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan, in 2005 to support the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) by addressing the gaps and constraints experienced in the context of post-disaster recovery. After a decade of functioning as an international source of knowledge on good recovery practice, IRP is now focused on a more specialized role, highlighted in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 as an \u201cinternational mechanism for sharing experience and lessons associated with build back better\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 \u2013 2030 |url=https://www.unisdr.org/files/43291_sendaiframeworkfordrren.pdf |website=UNDRR |publisher=UNDRR |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |title=About IRP |url=https://www.recoveryplatform.org/about_irp/ |website=International Recovery Platform |publisher=International Recovery Platform |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement===\nThe [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) works closely with National Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in responding to emergencies, many times playing a pivotal role.

Heatwaves have killed more Australians than any other type of natural disaster in the 20th century. Australia's emergency management processes embrace the concept of the prepared community. The principal government agency in achieving this is [[Emergency Management Australia]].\n\n===Canada===\n[[Public Safety Canada]] is Canada's national emergency management agency. Each province is required to have both legislation for dealing with emergencies, and provincial emergency management agencies, typically called \"Emergency Measures Organizations\" (EMO). Public Safety Canada co-ordinates and supports the efforts of federal organizations as well as other levels of government, first responders, community groups, the private sector, and other nations. The Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Act defines the powers, duties and functions of PS are outlined. Other acts are specific to individual fields such as corrections, law enforcement, and national security.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]] the Federal Government controls the German ''Katastrophenschutz'' (disaster relief), the [[Technisches Hilfswerk]] (''Federal Agency for Technical Relief'', THW), and the ''Zivilschutz'' ([[Civil defense|civil protection]]) programs coordinated by the ''Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance''. Local [[German fire department|fire department]] units, the German Armed Forces ([[Bundeswehr]]), the [[German Federal Police]] and the 16 state police forces (L\u00e4nderpolizei) are also deployed during disaster relief operations.\n\nThere are several private organizations in Germany that also deal with emergency relief.

It is a working group composed of various government, non-government, civil sector and private sector organizations of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. Headed by the Secretary of National Defense (under the Office of Civil Defense, the NDRRMCs implementing organization), it coordinates all the executive branches of government, presidents of the leagues of local government units throughout the country, the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], [[Philippine National Police]], [[Bureau of Fire Protection]] (which is an agency under the [[Department of Interior and Local Government]], and the public and private medical services in responding to natural and manmade disasters, as well as planning, coordination, and training of these responsible units. Non-governmental organizations such as the [[Philippine Red Cross]] also provide manpower and material support for NDRRMC.\n\nRegional, provincial, city, municipal, and barangay emergency management are handled by Local Disaster Risk Reduction Management Councils (LDRRMCs), which are the functional arm of the local government unit (LGU). Each LDRRMC is headed by a Chief DRRM Officer, and each Office is tasked to organize their own emergency teams and command-and-control centers when activated at times of local emergencies (identified on the regional, provincial, city, municipal, and/or barangay level).\n\n===Russia===\nIn [[Russia]], the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] (EMERCOM) is engaged in [[fire fighting]], [[civil defense]], and [[search and rescue]] after both natural and human-made disasters.\n\n===Somalia===\nIn [[Somalia]], the [[Federal Government of Somalia|Federal Government]] announced in May 2013 that the [[Somali Council of Ministers|Cabinet]] had approved draft legislation on a new [[Somali Disaster Management Agency]] (SDMA), which had originally been proposed by the Ministry of Interior. According to the Prime Minister's Media Office, the SDMA will lead and coordinate the government's response to various natural disasters.

The country is divided into 25 safety regions ([[w:nl:veiligheidsregio|veiligheidsregio]]). In a safety region, there are four components: the regional fire department, the regional department for medical care (ambulances and psycho-sociological care etc.), the regional dispatch and a section for risk- and crisis management. The regional dispatch operates for police, fire department and the regional medical care. The dispatch has all these three services combined into one dispatch for the best multi-coordinated response to an incident or an emergency. And also facilitates in information management, emergency communication and care of citizens. These services are the main structure for a response to an emergency. It can happen that, for a specific emergency, the co-operation with another service is needed, for instance the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]], [[water board]](s) or [[Rijkswaterstaat]]. The veiligheidsregio can integrate these other services into their structure by adding them to specific conferences on operational or administrative level.\n\nAll regions operate according to the [[Coordinated Regional Incident Management (Netherlands)|Coordinated Regional Incident Management]] system.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nFollowing the 2000 [[UK fuel protests|fuel protests]] and severe flooding that same year, as well as the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot-and-mouth]] crisis in 2001, the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). The CCA defined some organisations as Category 1 and 2 Responders, setting responsibilities regarding emergency preparedness and response. It is managed by the [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat]] through Regional Resilience Forums and local authorities.\n\nDisaster Management training is generally conducted at the local level, and consolidated through professional courses that can be taken at the [[Emergency Planning College]]. Diplomas, undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications can be gained at universities throughout the country. The Institute of Emergency Management is a charity, established in 1996, providing consulting services for the government, media and commercial sectors. There are a number of professional societies for Emergency Planners including the Emergency Planning Society<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-eps.org/ |title=Welcome \u2013 The Emergency Planning Society |publisher=The-eps.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> and the Institute of Civil Protection and Emergency Management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icpem.net/ |title=Institute of Civil Protection & Emergency Management &#124; Welcome |publisher=ICPEM |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>\n\nOne of the largest emergency exercises in the UK was carried out on 20 May 2007 near [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]: a simulated plane crash-landing at [[Belfast International Airport]]. Staff from five hospitals and three airports participated in the drill, and almost 150 international observers assessed its effectiveness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6673793.stm |title=UK &#124; Northern Ireland &#124; Mock plane crash tests NI crews |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nDisaster management in the United States has utilized the functional All-Hazards approach for over 20 years, in which managers develop processes (such as communication & warning or sheltering) rather than developing single-hazard or threat focused plans (e.g., a tornado plan). Processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats, with the manager looking for gaps, overlaps, and conflicts between processes.\n\nGiven these notions, emergency managers must identify, contemplate, and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McElreath|first1=David|last2=Doss|first2=Daniel|last3=Jensen|first3=Carl|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|last5=Nations|first5=Robert|last6=Van Slyke|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Nations|first7=Julie|title=Foundations of Emergency Management|date=2014|publisher=Kendall-Hunt Publishing Company|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-1465234889|page=25|edition=1st}}<!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--></ref> Because of geographical differences throughout the nation, a variety of different threats affect communities among the states. Thus, although similarities may exist, no two emergency plans will be completely identical. Additionally, each locale has different resources and capacities (e.g., budgets, personnel, equipment, etc.) for dealing with emergencies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Glover|first2=William|last3=Goz|first3=Rebecca|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|title=The Foundations of Communication in Criminal Justice Systems|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1482236576|page=301}}<!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--></ref> Each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Glover|first2=William|last3=Goza|first3=Rebecca|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|title=The Foundations of Communication in Criminal Justice Systems|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1482236576|page=301|edition=1}}<!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--></ref>\n\nThis creates a plan more resilient to unique events because all common processes are defined, and it encourages planning done by the stakeholders who are closer to the individual processes, such as a traffic management plan written by a public works director. This type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies, which require the development of hazard/threat specific plans, such as the development of specific H1N1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans.\n\nIn the United States, all disasters are initially local, with local authorities, with usually a police, fire, or EMS agency, taking charge. Many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated [[office of emergency management]] (OEM), along with personnel and equipment. If the event becomes overwhelming to the local government, state emergency management (the primary government structure of the United States) becomes the controlling emergency management agency. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), is the lead federal agency for emergency management. The United States and its territories are broken down into ten regions for FEMA's emergency management purposes. FEMA supports, but does not override, state authority.\n\nThe [[Citizen Corps]] is an organization of volunteer service programs, administered locally and coordinated nationally by DHS, which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education, training, and outreach. Most [[disaster response]] is carried out by volunteer organizations. In the US, the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] is chartered by Congress to coordinate disaster response services. It is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees. Religious organizations, with their ability to provide volunteers quickly, are usually integral during the response process. The largest being the [[Salvation Army]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disaster.salvationarmyusa.org/ |title=The Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services |publisher=Disaster.salvationarmyusa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> with a primary focus on chaplaincy and rebuilding, and [[Southern Baptists]] who focus on food preparation and distribution,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.namb.net/activity-report/ |title=2012 Activity Report |publisher=Namb.net |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113135407/http://www.namb.net/activity-report/ |archivedate=2015-01-13 }}</ref> as well as cleaning up after floods and fires, chaplaincy, mobile shower units, chainsaw crews and more.

Unaffiliated volunteers show up at most large disasters. To prevent abuse by criminals, and for the safety of the volunteers, procedures have been implemented within most response agencies to manage and effectively use these 'SUVs' ([[Spontaneous Unaffiliated Volunteers]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citizencorps.gov/downloads/pdf/ManagingSpontaneousVolunteers.pdf |title=Citizen Corps &#124; Ready.gov |publisher=Citizencorps.gov |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223174827/https://www.citizencorps.gov/downloads/pdf/ManagingSpontaneousVolunteers.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe US Congress established the [[Center for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance]] (COE) as the principal agency to promote disaster preparedness in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe National Tribal Emergency Management Council (NEMC) is a non-profit educational organization developed for Tribal organizations to share information and best practices, as well as to discuss issues regarding public health and safety, emergency management and homeland security, affecting those under Indian sovereignty. NTMC is organized into Regions, based on the FEMA 10 region system. NTMC was founded by the {{vanchor|Northwest Tribal Emergency Management Council}} (NWTEMC), a consortium of 29 tribal nations and villages in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and Alaska.\n\nIf a disaster or emergency is declared to be terror related or an \"Incident of National Significance,\" the Secretary of Homeland Security will initiate the [[National Response Framework]] (NRF). The NRF allows the integration of federal resources with local, county, state, or tribal entities, with management of those resources to be handled at the lowest possible level, utilizing the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS).\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] offer [https://www.emergency.cdc.gov/hazards-specific.asp information] for specific types of emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters and severe weather, chemical and radiation accidents, etc. The [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/ Emergency Preparedness and Response Program] of the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] develops resources to address responder safety and health during responder and recovery operations.\n\n====FEMA's Emergency Management Institute====\n{{see also|Emergency Management Institute}}\n[[File:FEMA - 7740 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 03-10-2003 in Maryland.jpg|right|thumb|[[Emergency Management Institute]]'s Main Campus in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]]]]\nThe Emergency Management Institute (EMI) serves as the national focal point for the development and delivery of emergency management [[training]] to enhance the capabilities of [[state government|state]], territorial, [[local government|local]], and tribal government officials; volunteer organizations; FEMA's disaster workforce; other Federal agencies; and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of disasters and [[emergency|emergencies]] on the American public.

There is an outer reality which is bread and wine and an inner which is the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental manner. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence.\n\nHost desecration has been associated with groups identified as inimical to Christianity. It is a common belief that desecration of the host is part of [[Satanism|Satanic practice]], especially the [[Black Mass]]. LaVeyan Satanists do not typically perform Black Mass as a regular ritual, though \"Le Messe Noir\" from [[Anton LaVey]]'s work [[The Satanic Rituals]] does include some elements.\n\nSince the publication of a document called Memoriale Domini in 1969,<ref name=\"ewtn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWMEMOR.HTM|title=Memoriale Domini|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> the Apostolic See of the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an \"ancient custom\".<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world.

(This practice was still performed commonly and consistently, even as recently as the early 1970s in America, and is still received orally in many churches and countries presently. Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the Memoriale Domini indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm.) Kneeling to receive communion is still the norm among Anglicans and Lutherans as act of reverence.\n\n==Medieval accusations against Jews==\n[[Image:Host desecration.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Jews depicted torturing the host, on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] tapestry.]]\n{{Antisemitism}}\nAccusations of host desecration (German ''Hostiensch\u00e4ndung'') leveled against [[Jews]] were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.<ref name=\"je\"/> The libel of \"[[Jewish deicide]]\": that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man, was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by stabbing or burning them.\n\nIt has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity.<ref>Langmuir (1990), p.289</ref> Although the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] did not imply that, by consuming the host, Christians were eating flesh and drinking blood in the normal sense, the language used to describe the dogma would have been interpreted as completely alien to [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish law]]. For Jews, such a belief system would contradict their strict dietary laws, which forbid the consumption of blood; even when consuming [[kosher animals]].\n\nJews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious than desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nThe penalties for Jews accused of defiling sacred hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, \"confessed\" to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in [[Beelitz]] in 1243,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofje00unse|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge|author=|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Behrman's Jewish book house|date= 1934|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> in [[Prague]] in 1389,<ref>\"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/jud_blib2.htm Blood libel accusations against Jews]\", Religious Tolerance Organisation, retrieved 7 May 2007.</ref> and in many German cities, according to Ocker's writings in the ''Harvard Theological Review''.<ref>Ocker (April 1998)</ref> According to William Nichol, over 100 instances of Jews pleading guilty to the desecration of sacred hosts have been recorded.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first recorded accusation was made in 1243 at [[Beelitz]], south of Potsdam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desecration of Host |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/host-desecration-of |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the [[:fr:Clo\u00eetre et \u00e9glise des Billettes|Church of the Rue des Billettes]] and in a local confraternity.

Even more, in this sacrament the Lutheran Christian receives the very body and blood of Christ precisely for the strengthening of the union of faith. The \"real presence\" of Christ in the Holy Sacrament is the means by which the union of faith, effected by God's Word and the sacrament of baptism, is strengthened and maintained.

There is an outer reality which is bread and wine and an inner which is the Body and Blood of Christ in a sacramental manner. Whatever the doctrine selected, among Anglicans the consecrated bread and hosts are reserved and treated with great reverence.\n\nHost desecration has been associated with groups identified as inimical to Christianity. It is a common belief that desecration of the host is part of [[Satanism|Satanic practice]], especially the [[Black Mass]]. LaVeyan Satanists do not typically perform Black Mass as a regular ritual, though \"Le Messe Noir\" from [[Anton LaVey]]'s work [[The Satanic Rituals]] does include some elements.\n\nSince the publication of a document called Memoriale Domini in 1969,<ref name=\"ewtn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWMEMOR.HTM|title=Memoriale Domini|author=|date=|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=7 May 2007}}</ref> the Apostolic See of the Catholic Church has allowed certain countries to allow communicants to receive the Host in the hand, rather than directly onto the tongue, reviving an \"ancient custom\".<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> Communion in the hand is now widespread in many parts of the world. The practice means that access to consecrated Hosts is easier than in the past, since the person receiving it in the hand may pretend to place it in their mouth for consumption. However, recent statements and practices of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]<ref name=\"light of the world\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|title=In \u2018Light of the World\u2019, by Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict says: \"I am not opposed in principle to Communion in the hand; I have both administered and received Communion in this way myself...The idea behind my current practice of having people kneel to receive Communion on the tongue was to send a signal and to underscore the Real Presence with an exclamation point.\"|website=ignatius.com|access-date=2012-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525055319/http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspx|archive-date=2012-05-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>  have caused a recent shift in Catholic practice (notably at Papal Masses and amongst more traditional-minded Catholics) of receiving on the tongue while kneeling, which is also an ancient practice. (This practice was still performed commonly and consistently, even as recently as the early 1970s in America, and is still received orally in many churches and countries presently. Receiving on the tongue is still the official norm of the Catholic Church, while receiving in the hand [via the Memoriale Domini indult] is, in English-speaking countries, the practical norm.) Kneeling to receive communion is still the norm among Anglicans and Lutherans as act of reverence.\n\n==Medieval accusations against Jews==\n[[Image:Host desecration.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Jews depicted torturing the host, on a [[Belgium|Belgian]] tapestry.]]\n{{Antisemitism}}\nAccusations of host desecration (German ''Hostiensch\u00e4ndung'') leveled against [[Jews]] were a common pretext for massacres and expulsions throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.<ref name=\"je\"/> The libel of \"[[Jewish deicide]]\": that the Jewish people were responsible for the killing of Jesus, whom Christians regard as God become man, was a generally accepted Christian belief. It was spuriously claimed that Jews stole hosts (objects to which they attached no significance, religious or otherwise), and further spuriously claimed that they abused these hosts to re-enact the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] by stabbing or burning them.\n\nIt has been asserted by modern scholars, such as the Catholic priest Gavin Langmuir, that these accusations against Jews represented profound doubt about the truth of Christianity.<ref>Langmuir (1990), p.289</ref> Although the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] did not imply that, by consuming the host, Christians were eating flesh and drinking blood in the normal sense, the language used to describe the dogma would have been interpreted as completely alien to [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish law]]. For Jews, such a belief system would contradict their strict dietary laws, which forbid the consumption of blood; even when consuming [[kosher animals]].\n\nJews in the Middle Ages were frequently victims of similar accusations, considered more serious than desecration of other revered items, such as relics or images of Jesus and the saints. The accusations were often supported only by the testimony of the accuser, who may potentially bear a prejudice against the accused Jew or the Jewish people. Despite this, some alleged perpetrators were tried and found guilty, on little evidence or through torture.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nThe penalties for Jews accused of defiling sacred hosts were severe. Many Jews, after accusations and torture, \"confessed\" to abusing hosts, and the accused Jews were condemned and burned, sometimes with all the other Jews in the community, as happened in [[Beelitz]] in 1243,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofje00unse|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish knowledge|author=|accessdate=22 March 2016|publisher=Behrman's Jewish book house|date= 1934|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> in [[Prague]] in 1389,<ref>\"[http://www.religioustolerance.org/jud_blib2.htm Blood libel accusations against Jews]\", Religious Tolerance Organisation, retrieved 7 May 2007.</ref> and in many German cities, according to Ocker's writings in the ''Harvard Theological Review''.<ref>Ocker (April 1998)</ref> According to William Nichol, over 100 instances of Jews pleading guilty to the desecration of sacred hosts have been recorded.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first recorded accusation was made in 1243 at [[Beelitz]], south of Potsdam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desecration of Host |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/host-desecration-of |website=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=10/01/2020}}</ref> Tradition records that as a consequence the Jews of Beelitz were burned on a hill before the Mill Gate, which was subsequently, and until 1945, called the Judenberg, although there is no contemporary evidence for the burnings in documents of the 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Another famous case that took place in 1290, in Paris, was commemorated in the [[:fr:Clo\u00eetre et \u00e9glise des Billettes|Church of the Rue des Billettes]] and in a local confraternity. The case of 1337, at [[Deggendorf]], celebrated locally as part of the ''\"Deggendorfer Gnad\"'' until 1992, led to a series of massacres across the region. In 1370 in Brussels the charge of host desecration, linked to an actual recovered relic of desecrated hosts currently found in the [[Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula|Cathedral of St. Gudula]] and long celebrated in a special feast, and to artistic depictions also found in the Cathedral, led to the burning of six Jews (other times given twenty) and, reportedly, the expulsion of the town's Jewish population (see [[Brussels massacre]]). In 1510, at [[:de:Knoblauch (Ketzin)|Knoblauch]] in [[Havelland]] 38 Jews were executed and more expelled from [[Brandenburg]].\n\nAn alleged host desecration in 1410, at [[Segovia]], was said to have brought about an earthquake; as a result, leading Jews in the city were executed and the local synagogue was seized and re-dedicated as the convent and Church of Corpus Christi.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Markman |first=Sidney David |authorlink= |year=2003 |title=Jewish Remnants in Spain: Wanderings in a Lost World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62SGDeU0CzcC&pg=PA50 |location=Mesa, AZ |publisher=Scribe Publishers |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0972723706 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar accusations, resulting in extensive persecution of Jews, were brought forward in 1294, at [[Laa an der Thaya|Laa]], Austria; 1298, at [[R\u00f6ttingen]], near [[W\u00fcrzburg]], and at Korneuburg, near [[Vienna]]; 1299, at [[Ratisbon]]; 1306, at [[St. P\u00f6lten]]; 1330, at [[G\u00fcstrow]]; 1338, at [[Pulkau]]; 1388, at [[Prague]]; 1401, at [[Glogau]]; 1420, at Ems; 1453, at [[Breslau]]; 1478, at [[Passau]]; 1492, at [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], in [[Mecklenburg]]; 1514, at Mittelberg, in [[Alsace]]; 1556, at [[Sochaczew]], in Poland. The last Jew burned for stealing a host died in 1631, according to [[Jacques Basnage]], quoting from Manasseh b. Israel. In some cases host desecration legends emerged without actual accusations, as was the case of the host desecration legend of Poznan (Posen).<ref>{{cite book|author=Magda Teter |title=Sinners on Trial: Jews and Sacrilege after the Reformation|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-674-05297-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Uccelo host burning.jpg|thumb|287px|The second panel of [[Paolo Uccello]]'s ''Miracle of the Profaned Host'' (c.1467-1469) from the Urbino Confraternity of Corpus Domini predella.

However, sporadic instances of host desecration libel occurred even in the 18th and 19th century. In 1761 in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], several Jews from [[Alsace]] were executed on a charge of sacred host desecration. The last recorded accusation was brought up in [[Berlad]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Loeb |first=Isidore |title=La situation des isra\u00e9lites en Turquie, en Serbie et en Roumanie |publisher=J.

Recent research indicates that hosts were truly violated, v. a. in connection with war crimes, which was particularly the case when it came to exposing the religious cult of the enemy as an idolatry whose altars and churches were demonstrably devastated. Since the host has a very special ideological meaning within a \"culture of the gift\", the opponent should be dishonored in this way not only materially, but also ideally.<ref>Konstantin Moritz Langmaier: Hass als historisches Ph\u00e4nomen: Gr\u00e4ueltaten und Kirchensch\u00e4ndungen im Alten Z\u00fcrichkrieg am Beispiel einer Luzerner Quelle von 1444,.

and serial seducer Xie Yifan ([[Jang Dong-gun]]) is introduced to his uncle's granddaughter, Du Fenyu ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), when his maternal grandmother, Du Ruixue ([[Lisa Lu]]), arrives at his apartment one day. Fenyu, a young widow who has just arrived from Northeast China (aka [[Manchuria]]) where the Japanese are making incursions, is staying at the country home of Madam Du, her grand-aunt.\n\nAt a glitzy fund-raiser for refugees thrown by Hudong Bank chairwoman Mo Jieyu ([[Cecilia Cheung]]) at Yifan's nightclub, Jieyu, an old friend of Yifan who has never succumbed to his advances, asks him to rob Beibei (Candy Wang), the 16-year-old fianc\u00e9e of tycoon Jin Zhihuan (Zhang Han), of her virginity. Jieyu wants revenge on Jin, for publicly dumping her in favor of a schoolgirl. Yifan turns down Jieyu's request, partly because he has another quarry in his sights\u2014the quiet and retiring Fenyu. Sensing an opportunity for some sport, Jieyu makes Yifan a wager: if he can seduce Fenyu without falling in love, she will finally agree to sleep with him; if he fails, he will sign over a valuable piece of land to her. Yifan accepts the challenge, but finds the virtuous Fenyu apparently immune to his charms.\n\nMeanwhile, Jieyu employs a different strategy to get her revenge on Jin, encouraging an attraction between Beibei and her young drawing teacher, college student Dai Wenzhou ([[Shawn Dou]]). Despite Jieyu's strenuous efforts, the relationship is never consummated; but when she finds out about it, Beibei's mother, Mrs. Zhu (Rong Rong), forbids her daughter to see Wenzhou anymore. With time running out, Jieyu suggests to Mrs. Zhu that Beibei should spend some quiet time at Madam Du's estate\u2014and secretly arranges for Yifan to be there, to \"comfort\" Beibei. Mission finally accomplished, Yifan refocuses on seducing Fenyu, but finds himself in deeper emotional waters than he has ever experienced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Dangerous Liaisons|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/dangerous-liaisons|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=2012-11-19|date=17 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Zhang Ziyi]] as Du Fenyu (Tourvel)\n*[[Jang Dong-gun]] as Xie Yifan (Valmont)\n*[[Cecilia Cheung]] as Mo Jieyu (Merteuil)\n*[[Shawn Dou]] as Dai Wenzhou (Danceny)\n*[[Lisa Lu]] as Madam Du Ruixue (Rosemond)\n*Rong Rong as Mrs. Zhu (Madame de Volonges)\n*Candy Wang as Beibei, Mrs. Zhu's daughter (Cecile) \n*Ye Xiangming as Wu Shaopu, the demonstrator\n*Xiao Shuli as Gui Zhen\n*Zhang Yun as Wen, Mrs. Zhu's maid\n*Wu Fang as Hong, Jieyu's maid\n*Chen Guodong as Gen\n*Zhang Han as Jin Zhihuan\n*Xue Wei as young lady\n*Hao Yifei as teacher\n*Zong Xiaojun as police captain\n*Yang Fan as policeman\n*Gang Xiaoxi as dance girl\n*Zhang Zichen as Cai Lu, Yifan's driver\n*Piao Yanni as make-up woman\n*Yan Hongyu as photographer\n*Jiang Yiyi as manicure maid\n*Dong Hailong as reporter\n*Son Seong-jae as saxophonist\n*Leng Haiming as art director\n*Yang Chen as MC\n*Xiang Dong as lawyer\n*Yin Yanbin as Japanese officer\n*Jean Favie \"Ji En\" as the French tailor\n*Li Shiping as young street beggar\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20130527174830/http://danger2012.kr/\n*{{kmdb film|13124|Dangerous Liaisons}}\n*{{IMDb title|2071441|Dangerous Liaisons}}\n*{{hancinema film|Dangerous_Liaisons|Dangerous Liaisons}}\n\n[[Category:Chinese films]]\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:Chinese romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Mandarin-language films]]\n[[Category:Erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]\n[[Category:Films set in Shanghai]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1931]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hur Jin-ho]]\n[[Category:Les Liaisons dangereuses]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Geling Yan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n|name           = Dangerous Liaisons \n|image          = Dangerousliaisons.jpg\n|director       = [[Hur Jin-ho]] \n|producer       = Chen Weiming \n|screenplay     = [[Geling Yan|Yan Geling]] \n|based on       = {{based on|''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]''|[[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]}}\n|starring       = [[Zhang Ziyi]]<br />[[Jang Dong-gun]]<br />[[Cecilia Cheung]] \n|music          = Jo Seong-woo \n|cinematography = Kim Byeong-seo\n|editing        = [[Nam Na-yeong]]\n|distributor    = Zonbo Media<ref>{{cite web|last=Chu|first=Karen|title=China's Zonbo and Singapore's Homerun Announce $77 Million, Five-Picture Slate|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chinas-zonbo-singapores-homerun-announce-195542|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2012-11-19|date=7 June 2011}}</ref>\n|released       = {{film date|2012|5|24|[[2012 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] - [[Directors' Fortnight]]|2012|09|27|China|2012|10|11|South Korea}}\n|runtime        = 110 minutes\n|country        = China\n|language       = Mandarin\n|budget         = {{yuan|150 million}} <br> {{SK won|40 billion}} <br> {{USD|24.2 million}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Ho|first=Stewart|title=Jang Dong Gun Charms Zhang Zhiyi and Cecilia Cheung With His Bad Boy Ways in New Movie Stills|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=14321|work=enewsWorld|accessdate=2012-11-19|date=7 September 2012}}</ref>\n|gross          =\n}}\n'''''Dangerous Liaisons''''' ({{zh|t=\u5371\u96aa\u95dc\u4fc2}}) is a 2012 Chinese film by [[Hur Jin-ho]] loosely based on the novel with [[Les Liaisons dangereuses|the same title]] by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]].

and serial seducer Xie Yifan ([[Jang Dong-gun]]) is introduced to his uncle's granddaughter, Du Fenyu ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), when his maternal grandmother, Du Ruixue ([[Lisa Lu]]), arrives at his apartment one day. Fenyu, a young widow who has just arrived from Northeast China (aka [[Manchuria]]) where the Japanese are making incursions, is staying at the country home of Madam Du, her grand-aunt.\n\nAt a glitzy fund-raiser for refugees thrown by Hudong Bank chairwoman Mo Jieyu ([[Cecilia Cheung]]) at Yifan's nightclub, Jieyu, an old friend of Yifan who has never succumbed to his advances, asks him to rob Beibei (Candy Wang), the 16-year-old fiancee of tycoon Jin Zhihuan (Zhang Han), of her virginity. Jieyu wants revenge on Jin, for publicly dumping her in favor of a schoolgirl. Yifan turns down Jieyu's request, partly because he has another quarry in his sights\u2014the quiet and retiring Fenyu. Sensing an opportunity for some sport, Jieyu makes Yifan a wager: if he can seduce Fenyu without falling in love, she will finally agree to sleep with him; if he fails, he will sign over a valuable piece of land to her. Yifan accepts the challenge, but finds the virtuous Fenyu apparently immune to his charms.\n\nMeanwhile, Jieyu employs a different strategy to get her revenge on Jin, encouraging an attraction between Beibei and her young drawing teacher, college student Dai Wenzhou ([[Shawn Dou]]). Despite Jieyu's strenuous efforts, the relationship is never consummated; but when she finds out about it, Beibei's mother, Mrs. Zhu (Rong Rong), forbids her daughter to see Wenzhou anymore. With time running out, Jieyu suggests to Mrs. Zhu that Beibei should spend some quiet time at Madam Du's estate\u2014and secretly arranges for Yifan to be there, to \"comfort\" Beibei. Mission finally accomplished, Yifan refocuses on seducing Fenyu, but finds himself in deeper emotional waters than he has ever experienced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Dangerous Liaisons|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/dangerous-liaisons|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=2012-11-19|date=17 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Zhang Ziyi]] as Du Fenyu (Tourvel)\n*[[Jang Dong-gun]] as Xie Yifan (Valmont)\n*[[Cecilia Cheung]] as Mo Jieyu (Merteuil)\n*[[Shawn Dou]] as Dai Wenzhou (Danceny)\n*[[Lisa Lu]] as Madam Du Ruixue (Rosemond)\n*Rong Rong as Mrs. Zhu (Madame de Volonges)\n*Candy Wang as Beibei, Mrs. Zhu's daughter (Cecile) \n*Ye Xiangming as Wu Shaopu, the demonstrator\n*Xiao Shuli as Gui Zhen\n*Zhang Yun as Wen, Mrs. Zhu's maid\n*Wu Fang as Hong, Jieyu's maid\n*Chen Guodong as Gen\n*Zhang Han as Jin Zhihuan\n*Xue Wei as young lady\n*Hao Yifei as teacher\n*Zong Xiaojun as police captain\n*Yang Fan as policeman\n*Gang Xiaoxi as dance girl\n*Zhang Zichen as Cai Lu, Yifan's driver\n*Piao Yanni as make-up woman\n*Yan Hongyu as photographer\n*Jiang Yiyi as manicure maid\n*Dong Hailong as reporter\n*Son Seong-jae as saxophonist\n*Leng Haiming as art director\n*Yang Chen as MC\n*Xiang Dong as lawyer\n*Yin Yanbin as Japanese officer\n*Jean Favie \"Ji En\" as the French tailor\n*Li Shiping as young street beggar\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20130527174830/http://danger2012.kr/\n*{{kmdb film|13124|Dangerous Liaisons}}\n*{{IMDb title|2071441|Dangerous Liaisons}}\n*{{hancinema film|Dangerous_Liaisons|Dangerous Liaisons}}\n\n[[Category:Chinese films]]\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:Chinese romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Mandarin-language films]]\n[[Category:Erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]\n[[Category:Films set in Shanghai]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1931]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hur Jin-ho]]\n[[Category:Les Liaisons dangereuses]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Geling Yan]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: fiancee \u2192 fianc\u00e9e", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Liaisons_(2012_film)"}
