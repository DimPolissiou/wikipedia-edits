His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression. \n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} Johann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

Here he also met [[ Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.

This familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=95\u201398}} Here he also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a composer, [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=96}} \n\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}}. These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by the composer [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]].

Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=161}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf |Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} \n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}} \n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

The young [[Carl Czerny]], who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.

In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201327}}\n\nHis business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201315}}\n\n===1802\u20131812: The 'heroic' period ===\n====Deafness====\n[[File:Beethoven Hornemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1803, painted by [[Christian Horneman]]]]Beethoven told the English pianist [[Charles Neate]] (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=160}} During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of [[tinnitus]].{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=223\u201324}} As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 108}} The cause was probably [[otosclerosis]], perhaps accompanied by degeneration of the [[auditory nerve]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 5}}{{refn|The cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness has also variously been attributed to , amongst other possibilities, [[lead poisoning]] from Beethoven\u2019s preferred wines{{sfn|Stevens|2013|pp=2854-2858}}, and [[Paget's disease of bone]] {{sfn|Oiseth|2015|pp=139\u201347}}|group=n}} \n\nOn the advice of his doctor, he moved to the small Austrian town of [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition.

There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]).

The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= section 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed.

One consequence of this was that Schlesinger was to secure Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets;  part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany, France and England which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.{{sfn|Conway|2012|pp=185-187}} The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30 [[Ducat#Spread of the ducat|ducat]]s per sonata, (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata in E major, Op. 109]], dedicated to Maximiliane, Antonie Brentano's daughter).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=27-28}}.\n\nThe start of 1821 saw Beethoven once again in poor health, suffering from [[rheumatism]] and [[jaundice]]. Despite this he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata in A flat major Op. 110]] was published in December), and on the Mass.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 776-777, 781-782}} In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 362 -363}} Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven's financial prospects.

In the event one of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent the composer a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works and enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances.

It was Beethoven's last public concert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 318}}\n\nBeethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Golitsin, despite failing health. The first of these, the [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|quartet in E\u266d major, Op. 127]] was premiered by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] in March 1825. While writing the next,  the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|quartet in A minor, Op. 132]], in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness.

In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet. Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}} \n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} He also began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again.

From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=section 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements...

Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth.

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression. \n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} Johann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

In addition, some minor works not listed with opus numbers or in the WoO list have [[Catalogues_of_Beethoven_compositions#Hess_catalogue|Hess catalogue]] numbers.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=210}}|group=n}} Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=65\u201370}} His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], WoO 47, sometimes known as \"{{lang|de|[[Kurf\u00fcrst]]}}\" (\"Elector\") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708\u20131784), were published in 1783.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=69}} In the same year the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the ''Magazin der Musik'' \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.

He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and paying towards his visit to Vienna of 1792. {{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=50}}\n\nHe was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, where he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[ Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a friend and financial supporter during Beethoven's Bonn period.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= section 2}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 51\u201352}} Waldstein was to commission in 1791 Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet ''Musik zu einem Ritterballett'' (WoO 1).{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p= 121\u2013122}} \n\n[[File:Count von Waldstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Count Waldstein: portrait by  [[Anton\u00edn Machek]], c. 1800]]In the period 1785\u201390 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to ongoing problems in the Beethoven family.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=36\u201337}} His mother died in 1787, shortly after Beethoven\u2019s first visit to Vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met with Mozart.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 2}} In 1789 Beethoven's father was forcibly retired from the service of the Court (as a consequence of his alcoholism) and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to him for support of the family.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=95}} He contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=51}}) and by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra. This familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=95\u201398}} Here he also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a composer, [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=96}} \n\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}}. These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by the composer [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]]. It is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the older master.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}} Waldstein wrote to him before his departure: \u201cYou are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes [\u2026] With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart\u2019s spirit from Haydn\u2019s hands.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 2}}\n\n===1792\u20131802: Vienna - the early years ===\n[[File:Beethoven Riedel 1801.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Beethoven as a young man, c. 1800, by Carl Traugott Riedel (1769\u20131832)]]Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}}  Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 43}}\n\nHe did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=161}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf |Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} \n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky,{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 59}} and were a financial success; Beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 56}} In 1799 Beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of Baron Raimund Wetzlar (a former patron of Mozart) against the virtuoso [[Joseph W\u00f6lfl]]; and in the following year he similarly triumphed against [[Daniel Steibelt]] at the salon of [[Count Moritz von Fries]].{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=79}} Beethoven's eighth [[piano sonata]] the \"[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]\"  (Op. 13), published in 1799 is described by the musicologist [[Barry  Cooper (musicologist)|Barry Cooper]] as \"surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 82}} \n\nBeethoven composed his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first six string quartets (Op. 18)]] between 1798 and 1800 (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz). They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}} \n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik. During this time, he fell in love with the younger daughter [[Josephine Brunsvik|Josephine]]. Amongst his other students, from 1801 to 1805, he tutored [[Ferdinand Ries]], who went on to become a composer and later wrote about their encounters. The young [[Carl Czerny]], who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this. He later dedicated his [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 14]], now commonly known as the ''Moonlight Sonata'', to her.{{sfn|Steblin|2009}}\n\nIn the spring of 1801 he completed ''[[The Creatures of Prometheus]]'', a [[ballet]]. The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802, and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 98\u2013103}} In the spring of 1802 he completed the [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second Symphony]], intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the [[Theater an der Wien]], where he had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201327}}\n\nHis business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201315}}\n\n===1802\u20131812: The 'heroic' period ===\n====Deafness====\n[[File:Beethoven Hornemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1803, painted by [[Christian Horneman]]]]Beethoven told the English pianist [[Charles Neate]] (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=160}} During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of [[tinnitus]].{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=223\u201324}} As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 108}} The cause was probably [[otosclerosis]], perhaps accompanied by degeneration of the [[auditory nerve]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 5}}{{refn|The cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness has also variously been attributed to , amongst other possibilities, [[lead poisoning]] from Beethoven\u2019s preferred wines{{sfn|Stevens|2013|pp=2854-2858}}, and [[Paget's disease of bone]] {{sfn|Oiseth|2015|pp=139\u201347}}|group=n}} \n\nOn the advice of his doctor, he moved to the small Austrian town of [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote the document now known as the \u201c[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\u201d, a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art. The letter was never actually sent and was discovered in the composer\u2019s papers after his death.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp= 169-172}} The letters to Wegeler and Amenda were not so despairing; in them Beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to Wegeler, to \u201cseize Fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 5}} In 1806, Beethoven noted on of his musical sketches \"Let your deafness no longer be a secret \u2013 even in art.\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=162}}.\n\nBeethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concerts\u2014a important source of income at this phase of his life\u2014increasingly difficult.

From now on I intend to take a new way.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 131}} An early major work employing this new style was the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in E flat Op. 55, known as the ''Eroica'', written in 1803-4. The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of [[Napoleon]] may have been suggested to Beethoven by [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Count Bernadotte]] in 1798.{{sfn|GroveOnline|locatio=section 4}} Beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon [[1804 French constitutional referendum|declaring himself Emperor in 1804]], he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|location=section 6}} The ''Eroica'' was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolf, including some of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass_in_C_major_(Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]].

The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= section 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed.

One consequence of this was that Schlesinger was to secure Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets;  part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany, France and England which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.{{sfn|Conway|2012|pp=185-187}} The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30 [[Ducat#Spread of the ducat|ducat]]s per sonata, (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata in E major, Op. 109]], dedicated to Maximiliane, Antonie Brentano's daughter).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=27-28}}.\n\nThe start of 1821 saw Beethoven once again in poor health, suffering from [[rheumatism]] and [[jaundice]].

In the event one of the few who took up this offer was [[Louis XVIII]] of France, who also sent the composer a heavy gold medallion.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=812-829}} The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven's working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited may other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and [[Carl Friedrich Peters]]. (In the end it was obtained by [[Schott Music|Schotts]]).{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=186}}\n\nBeethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works and enquired about premiering the ''Missa'' and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin.

In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved to be very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet. Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher [[Artaria]], for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the [[Grosse Fugue]], Op. 133).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 974-975}} Beethoven's favourite was the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|quartet in C{{music|#}} minor Op. 131]], which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}} \n\nBeethoven's relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven's letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven's wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of [[Gneixendorf]] with Beethoven and his other uncle Johann. Whilst in Gneixendorf Beethoven completed a further quartet,  ([[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Op. 135 in F major]]) which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement Beethoven wrote in the manuscript \"Muss es sein?\" (\"Must it be?\");  the reponse, over the faster main theme of the movement, is \"Es muss sein!\" (\"It must be!\"). The whole movement is headed \"Der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (\"The Difficult Decision\").{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=977}} Following this in November Beethoven completed his last composition, the new finale for the op. 130 quartet.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710 }} He also began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann made Karl his heir, in preference to Johann's wife.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p= 1014}}\n\n=== Death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[ File:Beethoven on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|right|Beethoven on his deathbed; sketch by [[Josef Danhauser]]]]On his return to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including [[jaundice]] and [[dropsy]], with swollen limbs and  breathing difficulties. Operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from his abdomen.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=1017=1024}} \n\nKarl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December, but left at the beginning of January to join  the army at [[Jihlava|Iglau]] and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards \"My dear father [...] I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.\" Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making Karl his sole heir.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=377}} Later in January Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As news spread of the severity of Beethoven's condition, many friends, both old and new, came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] and his pupil [[Ferdinand Hiller]]. Many tributes were also sent, including \u00a3100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of wine from Schotts.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=378-379}}{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=\u00a710}} During this period he was almost completely bedridden despite occasional brave efforts to rouse himself. On March 24, he said to Schindler and the others present \"Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est\" (\"Applaud, friends, the comedy is over.\") Later that day, when the wine from Schott arrived, he whispered \"Pity - too late.\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=380-381}}\n\nHe died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend [[Anselm H\u00fcttenbrenner]] and a \"Frau van Beethoven\" (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. Many visitors came to the death-bed; locks of the dead man's hair were retained by H\u00fcttenbrenner and Hiller, amongst others.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=381-382}}{{sfn|Conway|2012|p=44}} An [[autopsy]] revealed significant [[liver]] damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2011}}{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2012}}{{refn|There is dispute about the cause of his death: [[alcoholic cirrhosis]], [[syphilis]], [[infectious hepatitis]], [[lead poisoning]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[Whipple's disease]] have all been proposed.{{sfn|Mai|2006}} Surviving locks of his hair have been subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1863 [[exhumation]].{{sfn|Meredith|2005 |pp=2\u20133}} Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally [[poison]]ed by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.{{sfn|Eisinger|2008}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2007}}|group=n}}\n\nBeethoven's funeral procession on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 20,000 people. [[Franz Schubert]] and the violinist [[Joseph Mayseder]] were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet [[Franz Grillparzer]] was read. He was buried in a dedicated grave in the [[W\u00e4hring]] cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]] where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp. 1053-1056}}.\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n=== The \"three periods\" ===\nBeethoven's career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the \"middle\" period from 1802 to 1812, and the \"late\" period thereafter. This distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year after his death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand the development of Beethoven's work.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 11}}\n\n===Bonn===\nBeethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=section 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements... Less impressive, in these years, is the instrumental music in the sonata style. ... Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\n===The first period===\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===The middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842.

ITV plc owns the ITV franchises in [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], Southern Scotland ([[Dumfries and Galloway]] and the [[Scottish Borders]]), the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. ITV plc also operates a number of digital channels and websites under the ITV brand. The company threatened to take legal action over the use of the name 'ITV' because it is the name of the Independent Television network, which [[Scottish Television|STV Central]] and [[Grampian Television|STV North]] are both part of. One of the problems facing the group is that ITV is the senior partner when it comes to its two TV stations, since London-based ITV effectively controls most of the scheduling and is also responsible for selling STV's advertising airtime.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn September 2009, ITV plc announced it was to launch legal proceedings against STV for a claimed unpaid debt of \u00a338 million from network programming contributions, following STV's practice of dropping a number of network programmes on the STV franchise. At the same time, STV claimed it was also following procedures against ITV plc, for up to \u00a340 million owed to STV under its advertising sales agreements.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = ITV takes legal action over STV's network programme payments\n  | publisher = The Guardian\n  | date = 22 September 2009\n  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/22/itv-stv-network-programme-budget-contributions\n  | accessdate = 10 January 2016\n| first=Leigh\n| last=Holmwood}}</ref>\n\n==Television==\n\n===STV===\n{{main|STV (TV channel)}}\nSTV Group plc owns two Scottish ITV licences: [[Scottish Television]], which covers Central Scotland, and [[Grampian Television]], covering Northern Scotland.  On 2 March 2006, it was announced that Scottish Television would revert to using its former brand name of \"STV\", which it previously used from the start of colour broadcasting in 1969 until 30 August 1985, and which the station was still informally known as in parts of Scotland. Scottish Television became known as ''STV Central''. At the same time, Grampian Television would also become known as ''STV North'', with the one main identity of ''STV'' serving the two licences. The rebrand took place on 30 May 2006.\n\n====Other channels====\nThe former SMG plc ran its own digital channel, [[S2 (TV channel)|S2]], throughout the Scottish and Grampian ITV regions.

The company said the proposed name change was to highlight its renewed focus on television, encompassing the [[Scottish Television|STV Central]] and [[Grampian Television|STV North]] franchises, as well as the company's TV production business.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = SMG reborn as STV Group\n  | publisher = The Guardian\n  | date = 24 June 2008\n  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/24/mediabusiness.television\n  | accessdate = 10 January 2016\n| first=Caitlin\n| last=Fitzsimmons}}</ref>\n\nThis name change was approved at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] in September 2008, along with a new deal resulting in Pearl & Dean handling advertising for [[Showcase Cinemas]], which meant that the Pearl & Dean titles would appear in just under half of UK cinema sites.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7631338.stm |title=Scottish media group changes name |publisher=BBC News |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> The new ''STV Group'' branding was introduced on 1 October 2008.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = Goodbye SMG...

As a result of this, STV Group largely reverted to its Scottish Television plc days, but with the addition of the former Grampian Television and Ginger Productions businesses (the latter retained from the Ginger Media acquisition).\n\n===Merger proposals===\nIn September 2006, STV Group (then SMG) officially rejected a merger offer from Northern Irish ITV franchise holder [[UTV Media|UTV]]. The merger approach would have given SMG shareholders a 52% stake in the combined company. The Scottish group said its board had examined a revised merger proposal from UTV, but did not believe it reflected the value of the company.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = SMG turns down UTV merger bid\n  | work = The Guardian\n  | date = 29 August 2006\n  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/aug/29/smg.radio\n  | accessdate = 10 January 2016\n| first=Julia\n| last=Day}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 [[ITV plc]] considered making an offer for STV Group, according to ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]''. The newspaper quoted an ITV source as saying John Cresswell, acting chief executive at the broadcaster, was most interested in the group's television franchises, but that any deal would have been for the whole group. SMG warned that its 2006 profit would be materially behind expectations, sending its shares down more than a quarter in value to a 15-year low.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = ITV mulls bid for media firm SMG\n  | publisher = The Scotsman\n  | date = 29 October 2006\n  | url = http://business.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1600952006\n  | accessdate = 7 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101124527/http://business.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1600952006 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 1 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 January 2007, SMG and UTV agreed details of a merger, including a revised share split between the two.

ITV plc owns the ITV franchises in [[England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], Southern Scotland ([[Dumfries and Galloway]] and the [[Scottish Borders]]), the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. ITV plc also operates a number of digital channels and websites under the ITV brand. The company threatened to take legal action over the use of the name 'ITV' because it is the name of the Independent Television network, which [[Scottish Television|STV Central]] and [[Grampian Television|STV North]] are both part of. One of the problems facing the group is that ITV is the senior partner when it comes to its two TV stations, since London-based ITV effectively controls most of the scheduling and is also responsible for selling STV's advertising airtime.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn September 2009, ITV plc announced it was to launch legal proceedings against STV for a claimed unpaid debt of \u00a338 million from network programming contributions, following STV's practice of dropping a number of network programmes on the STV franchise. At the same time, STV claimed it was also following procedures against ITV plc, for up to \u00a340 million owed to STV under its advertising sales agreements.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = ITV takes legal action over STV's network programme payments\n  | publisher = The Guardian\n  | date = 22 September 2009\n  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/22/itv-stv-network-programme-budget-contributions\n  | accessdate = 10 January 2016\n| first=Leigh\n| last=Holmwood}}</ref>\n\n==Television==\n\n===STV===\n{{main|STV (TV channel)}}\nSTV Group plc owns two Scottish ITV licences: [[Scottish Television]], which covers Central Scotland, and [[Grampian Television]], covering Northern Scotland.  On 2 March 2006, it was announced that Scottish Television would revert to using its former brand name of \"STV\", which it previously used from the start of colour broadcasting in 1969 until 30 August 1985, and which the station was still informally known as in parts of Scotland. Scottish Television became known as ''STV Central''. At the same time, Grampian Television would also become known as ''STV North'', with the one main identity of ''STV'' serving the two licences. The rebrand took place on 30 May 2006.\n\n====Other channels====\nThe former SMG plc ran its own digital channel, [[S2 (TV channel)|S2]], throughout the Scottish and Grampian ITV regions. S2, which aired on the Digital Terrestrial platform, was launched on 30 April 1999 and was replaced by [[ITV2]] just over two years later \u2013 as part of a deal with [[ITV Digital]] \u2013 on 27 July 2001.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = S2 dropped for ITV2\n  | publisher = Digital Spy\n  | date = 27 July 2001\n  | url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/a3459/s2-dropped-for-itv2.html\n  | accessdate = 31 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Sky Scottish]] was a satellite television channel operating on the analogue Sky TV service between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1998.

In 1817 he became a Benedictine, and from that time continued his studies at the schools of that order, where he was known by his Latin name {{lang|la|Stephanus Anianus}}. He lectured at [[Benedictine]] schools up to 1839, then for 40 years at the Budapest University of Sciences department of physics-mechanics. Few guessed at that time that his activities would play an important part in bringing up a new generation of physicists. He became the dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1848, and by 1863 he was rector of the University. From 1858 he was a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and from 1873 was an honorary member. After his retirement, he continued working and spent his last years in complete seclusion at the priory in [[Gy\u0151r]], where he died.\n\n==Scientific work==\n[[File:Jedlik motor.jpg|thumb|right|Jedlik's \"lightning-magnetic self-rotor\", 1827 (the world's first [[electric motor]])]]\n[[File:Cs\u00f6ves_vill\u00e1mfesz\u00edt\u0151.png|thumb|Jedlik's tubular voltage generator, which is probably the earliest [[impulse generator]]]]\nIn 1827, Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic rotating devices which he called ''lightning-magnetic self-rotors'', and in 1828 he demonstrated the first device which contained the three main components of practical [[direct current]] [[DC electric motor|motors]]: the [[stator]], [[Armature (electrical engineering)|rotor]], and [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book\n|title=Electricity and magnetism, translated from the French of Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Guillemin\n|place=London\n|publisher=MacMillan\n|year=1891\n|editor-last=Thompson\n|editor-first=Silvanus P.}}</ref><ref name=\"Nature\">{{cite journal\n|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n|title=Anianus Jedlik\n|first=Augustus |last=Heller\n|publisher=Norman Lockyer\n|date=April 1896\n|volume=53\n|issue=1379\n|page=516\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWojdmTmch0C&pg=PA516\n|accessdate=August 23, 2010\n|bibcode = 1896Natur..53..516H |doi = 10.1038/053516a0 }}</ref><ref name=\"mpoweruk.com\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mpoweruk.com/timeline.htm\n|title=Technology and Applications Timeline\n|accessdate=August 23, 2010\n|date=May 28, 2010\n|publisher=Electropaedia\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.fh-zwickau.de/mbk/kfz_ee/praesentationen/Elma-Gndl-Generator%20-%20Druckversion.pdf\n |accessdate  = August 23, 2010\n |date        = March 22, 2009\n |title       = Elektrische Maschinen in Kraftfahrzeugen\n |trans-title = Electrical machinery in motor vehicles\n |last        = Thein\n |first       = M.\n |publisher   = Falkutat der Kraftfahrzeugen\n |location    = Zwickau\n |language    = German\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130914192636/http://www.fh-zwickau.de/mbk/kfz_ee/praesentationen/Elma-Gndl-Generator%20-%20Druckversion.pdf\n |archivedate = September 14, 2013\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |url         = http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_I/Philosophie/Wissenschaftsgeschichte/Termine/E-Maschinen-Lexikon/Chronologie.htm\n |title       = Elektrisiermaschinen im 18. und 19.

In 1845, Jedlik was the first university professor in the Kingdom of Hungary who began teaching his students in Hungarian instead of [[Latin]]. His cousin [[Gergely Czuczor]], a Hungarian linguist, asked him to create a Hungarian technical vocabulary in physics, the first of its kind, by which he became one of its founders.\n\nIn the 1850s he conducted optical and wave-mechanical experiments, and at the beginning of the 1860s, he constructed an excellent optical grate.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nHe was ahead of his contemporaries in his scientific work, but he did not speak about his most important invention, his prototype [[dynamo]], until 1856; it was not until 1861 that he mentioned it in writing in a list of inventory of the university. Although that document might serve as evidence of Jedlik's being the first dynamo, the invention of the dynamo is linked to [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Siemens]]'s name because Jedlik's invention did not rise to notice at that time.\n\nIn 1863 he discovered the possibility of voltage multiplication and in 1868 demonstrated it with a \"tubular voltage generator\", which was successfully displayed at the [[Vienna World Exposition]] in 1873.<ref>{{cite journal\n |url         = http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html\n |title       = Innovators and Innovations\n |last        = Sipka\n |first       = L\u00e1szl\u00f3\n |date        = Summer 2001\n |accessdate  = August 23, 2010\n |issue       = 162\n |volume      = XLII\n |journal     = [[Hungarian Quarterly]]\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095831/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no162/020.html\n |archivedate = June 15, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> It was an early form of the [[impulse generator]]s now applied in nuclear research.<ref>{{cite book |title      = The Spirit of Hungary: A Panorama of Hungarian History and Culture\n |chapter    = 42.

In 1817 he became a Benedictine, and from that time continued his studies at the schools of that order, where he was known by his Latin name {{lang|la|Stephanus Anianus}}. He lectured at [[Benedictine]] schools up to 1839, then for 40 years at the Budapest University of Sciences department of physics-mechanics. Few guessed at that time that his activities would play an important part in bringing up a new generation of physicists. He became the dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1848, and by 1863 he was rector of the University. From 1858 he was a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and from 1873 was an honorary member.

Named after Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], the ship was laid down at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]] in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. ''Bismarck'' and her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.\n\nIn the course of the warship's eight-month career under its sole commanding officer, [[Ernst Lindemann|Captain Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck'' conducted only one offensive operation, lasting 8 days in May 1941, codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. The ship, along with the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} initially engaged ''Prinz Eugen'', probably by mistake, while {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} engaged ''Bismarck''. In the ensuing battle ''Hood'' was destroyed by the combined fire of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', which then damaged ''Prince of Wales'' and forced her retreat. ''Bismarck'' suffered sufficient damage from three hits to force an end to the raiding mission.\n\nThe destruction of ''Hood'' spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for [[occupied France]] to effect repairs, ''Bismarck'' was attacked by 16 [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[biplane]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her final battle]] the following morning, the already-crippled ''Bismarck'' was severely damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers,  was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by her crew, and sank with heavy loss of life.

As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering [[propeller (ship)|propeller]] revolutions, the crew learned that ''Bismarck'' could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s main battery guns were first test-fired in late November.

Severe weather hampered efforts to remove the wreck, and ''Bismarck'' was not able to reach Kiel until March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=210}} The delay greatly frustrated Lindemann, who remarked that \"[''Bismarck''] had been tied down at Hamburg for five weeks&nbsp;... the precious time at sea lost as a result cannot be made up, and a significant delay in the final war deployment of the ship thus is unavoidable.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=39}} While waiting to reach Kiel, ''Bismarck'' hosted Captain Anders Forshell, the Swedish naval attach\u00e9 to Berlin. He returned to Sweden with a detailed description of the ship, which was subsequently leaked to Britain by pro-British elements in the [[Swedish Navy]]. The information provided the [[Royal Navy]] with its first full description of the vessel, although it lacked important facts, including top speed, radius of action, and displacement.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-41, Schlachtschiff \"Bismarck\".jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' on trials; the rangefinders had not yet been installed]]\n\nOn 6 March, ''Bismarck'' received the order to steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters and a pair of [[Armed merchantman|armed merchant vessels]], along with an [[icebreaker]]. At 08:45 on 8 March, ''Bismarck'' briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of [[dazzle paint]] to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=40}} On 17 March, the old battleship {{SMS|Schlesien||2}}, now used as an icebreaker, escorted ''Bismarck'' through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=41}}\n\nThe Naval High Command (''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' or OKM), commanded by Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], intended to continue the practice of using heavy ships as surface raiders against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] merchant traffic in the Atlantic Ocean. The two ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships were based in [[Brest, France]], at the time, having just completed [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]], a major raid into the Atlantic. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sister ship ''Tirpitz'' rapidly approached completion. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were to sortie from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and rendezvous with the two ''Scharnhorst''-class ships in the Atlantic; the operation was initially scheduled for around 25 April 1941, when a new moon period would make conditions more favourable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\nWork on ''Tirpitz'' was completed later than anticipated, and she was not commissioned until 25 February; the ship was not ready for combat until late in the year. To further complicate the situation, {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} was torpedoed in Brest and damaged further by bombs when in [[drydock]]. {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} required a boiler overhaul following Operation Berlin; the workers discovered during the overhaul that the boilers were in worse condition than expected. She would also be unavailable for the planned sortie.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=211}} Attacks by British bombers on supply depots in Kiel delayed repairs to the heavy cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}.

This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, ''Bismarck'' departed Gotenhafen and made for the [[Danish straits]]. She was joined at 11:25 by ''Prinz Eugen'', which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} The two ships were escorted by three [[destroyer]]s\u2014{{ship|German destroyer|Z10 Hans Lody||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}}, and {{ship|German destroyer|Z23||2}}\u2014and a [[flotilla]] of [[minesweeper]]s.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=76}} The [[Luftwaffe]] provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=64}}\n\nAn hour later, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish [[cruiser]] {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}}; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the [[Kattegat]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} ''Gotland'' transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: \"Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10\u201312 aircraft passed [[Marstrand]], course 205\u00b0/20'.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} The OKM was not concerned about the security risk posed by ''Gotland'', though both L\u00fctjens and Lindemann believed operational secrecy had been lost.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attach\u00e9 to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the [[Admiralty]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=66\u201367}} The code-breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had [[encryption|decrypted]] reports that ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had taken on prize crews and requested additional [[navigational chart]]s from headquarters. A pair of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s was ordered to search the Norwegian coast for the flotilla.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=68}}\n\nGerman aerial reconnaissance confirmed that one [[aircraft carrier]], three battleships, and four cruisers remained at anchor in the main British naval base at [[Scapa Flow]], which confirmed to L\u00fctjens that the British were unaware of his operation. On the evening of 20 May, ''Bismarck'' and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board ''Prinz Eugen'' picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=114}} At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft, which quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached [[Bergen]] and anchored at [[Grimstadfjord]], where the ships' crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard \"outboard grey\" worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=83}}\n\n[[File:Bismarck reconnaissance.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial reconnaissance photo showing ''Bismarck'' anchored (on the right) in Norway]]\n\nWhen ''Bismarck'' was in Norway, a pair of Bf 109 fighters circled overhead to protect her from British air attacks, but Flying Officer Michael Suckling managed to fly his Spitfire directly over the German flotilla at a height of {{convert|8000|m|abbr=on}} and take photos of ''Bismarck'' and her escorts.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=84}} Upon receipt of the information, Admiral [[John Tovey]] ordered the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, the newly commissioned battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, and six destroyers to reinforce the pair of cruisers patrolling the [[Denmark Strait]]. The rest of the [[Home Fleet]] was placed on high alert in Scapa Flow. Eighteen bombers were dispatched to attack the Germans, but weather over the [[fjord]] had worsened and they were unable to find the German warships.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=120}}\n\n''Bismarck'' did not replenish her fuel stores in Norway, as her operational orders did not require her to do so. She had left port {{convert|200|t|LT|abbr=on}} short of a full load, and had since expended another {{convert|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} on the voyage from Gotenhafen.

At 19:22, [[hydrophone]] and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser {{HMS|Suffolk|55|6}} at a range of approximately {{convert|12500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=216}} ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by ''Suffolk'' and learned that their location had been reported.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nL\u00fctjens gave permission for ''Prinz Eugen'' to engage ''Suffolk'', but the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held  fire.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=127}} ''Suffolk'' quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} joined ''Suffolk'', but approached the German raiders too closely. L\u00fctjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; ''Bismarck'' fired five salvoes, three of which straddled ''Norfolk'' and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38&nbsp;cm guns' firing disabled ''Bismarck''{{'}}s FuMO 23 radar set; this prompted L\u00fctjens to order ''Prinz Eugen'' to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nAt around 22:00, L\u00fctjens ordered ''Bismarck'' to make a 180-degree turn in an effort to surprise the two heavy cruisers shadowing him. Although ''Bismarck'' was visually obscured in a rain squall, ''Suffolk''{{'}}s radar quickly detected the manoeuvre, allowing the cruiser to evade.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=132}} The cruisers remained on station through the night, continually relaying the location and bearing of the German ships.

Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20\u00b0 turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on ''Hood''. About a minute after opening fire, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a hit with a high-explosive {{convert|20.3|cm|abbr=on}} shell; the explosion detonated [[unrotated projectile]] ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=220}} After firing three four-gun salvoes, Schneider had found the range to ''Hood''; he immediately ordered rapid-fire salvoes from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s eight 38&nbsp;cm guns.

The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the [[torpedo bulkhead]], completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room.{{sfn|Jurens et. al.}} The third shell passed through one of the boats carried aboard the ship and then went through the floatplane catapult without exploding.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nAt 06:13, Leach gave the order to retreat; only five{{sfn|Roskill|pp=406}} of his ship's ten {{convert|14|in|abbr=on}} guns were still firing and his ship had sustained significant damage. ''Prince of Wales'' made a 160\u00b0 turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing ''Prince of Wales'' and destroying her,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=164\u2013165}} L\u00fctjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy,{{sfn|Kennedy|p=79}} firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' to head for the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=165\u2013166}} In the engagement, ''Bismarck'' had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=223}} The forecastle hit allowed {{convert|1000|to|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water to flood into the ship, which contaminated fuel oil stored in the bow. L\u00fctjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=224}} The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a steam line in the turbo-generator room, but this was not serious, as ''Bismarck'' had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree [[List (watercraft)|list]] to port and a 3-degree [[wikt:trim#Noun|trim]] by the bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=226}}\n\n==== Chase ====\n[[File:Map Rheinuebung.svg|thumb|Map showing the course of ''Bismarck'' and the ships that pursued her]]\nAfter the engagement, L\u00fctjens reported, \"Battlecruiser, probably ''Hood'', sunk. Another battleship, ''King George V'' or ''Renown'', turned away damaged. Two heavy cruisers maintain contact.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=167}} At 08:01, he transmitted a damage report and his intentions to OKM, which were to detach ''Prinz Eugen'' for commerce raiding and to make for [[Saint-Nazaire]] for repairs.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=168}} Shortly after 10:00, L\u00fctjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to fall behind ''Bismarck'' to determine the severity of the oil leakage from the bow hit. After confirming \"broad streams of oil on both sides of [''Bismarck''{{'}}s] wake\",{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=173}} ''Prinz Eugen'' returned to the forward position.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=173}} About an hour later, a British [[Short Sunderland]] [[flying boat]] reported the oil slick to ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'', which had been joined by the damaged ''Prince of Wales''. Rear Admiral [[Frederic Wake-Walker]], the commander of the two cruisers, ordered ''Prince of Wales'' to remain behind his ships.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] ordered all warships in the area to join the pursuit of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''. Tovey's Home Fleet was steaming to intercept the German raiders, but on the morning of 24 May was still over {{convert|350|nmi|abbr=on}} away. The Admiralty ordered the light cruisers {{HMS|Manchester|15|2}}, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|2}}, and {{HMS|Arethusa|26|2}} to patrol the Denmark Strait in the event that L\u00fctjens attempted to retrace his route. The battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}, which had been escorting {{RMS|Britannic|1929|6}} and was due for a refit in the [[Boston Navy Yard]], joined Tovey. Two old {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|1}}s were ordered into the hunt:  {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}}, from Halifax, and {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}}, which was escorting Convoy HX 127.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=174\u2013175}} In all, six battleships and battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers were committed to the chase.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} By around 17:00, the crew aboard ''Prince of Wales'' restored nine of her ten main guns to working order, which permitted Wake-Walker to place her in the front of his formation to attack ''Bismarck'' if the opportunity arose.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=175}}\n\nWith the weather worsening, L\u00fctjens attempted to detach ''Prinz Eugen'' at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. ''Prinz Eugen'' was therefore recalled temporarily.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=192\u2013193}} The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. ''Bismarck'' turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing ''Suffolk'' to turn away at high speed. ''Prince of Wales'' fired twelve salvos at ''Bismarck'', which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted ''Prinz Eugen'' to slip away. After ''Bismarck'' resumed her previous heading, Wake-Walker's three ships took up station on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=227}}\n\nAlthough ''Bismarck'' had been damaged in the engagement and forced to reduce speed, she was still capable of reaching {{convert|27|to|28|kn}}, the maximum speed of Tovey's {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}. Unless ''Bismarck'' could be slowed, the British would be unable to prevent her from reaching Saint-Nazaire. Shortly before 16:00 on 25 May, Tovey detached the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} and four light cruisers to shape a course that would position her to launch her [[torpedo bomber]]s.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=194\u2013195}} At 22:00, ''Victorious'' launched the strike, which comprised six [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters and nine [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[825 Naval Air Squadron]], led by Lt Cdr [[Eugene Esmonde]]. The inexperienced aviators nearly attacked ''Norfolk'' and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter [[USCGC Modoc (WPG-46)|USCGC ''Modoc'']] on their approach; the confusion alerted ''Bismarck''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}}\n\n''Bismarck'' also used her main and secondary batteries to fire at maximum depression to create giant splashes in the paths of the incoming torpedo bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=189}} None of the attacking aircraft were shot down. ''Bismarck'' evaded eight of the torpedoes launched at her, but the ninth{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}} struck amidships on the main armoured belt, throwing one man into a bulkhead and killing him and injuring five others.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=229\u2013230}} The explosion also caused minor damage to electrical equipment. The ship suffered more serious damage from manoeuvres to evade the torpedoes: rapid shifts in speed and course loosened collision mats, which increased the flooding from the forward shell hole and eventually forced abandonment of the port number 2 boiler room. This loss of a second boiler, combined with fuel losses and increasing bow trim, forced the ship to slow to {{convert|16|kn}}. Divers repaired the collision mats in the bow, after which speed increased to {{convert|20|kn}}, the speed that the command staff determined was the most economical for the voyage to occupied France.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=230}}\n\nShortly after the Swordfish departed from the scene, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' engaged in a brief artillery duel. Neither scored a hit.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=192\u2013193}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s damage control teams resumed work after the short engagement. The sea water that had flooded the number 2 port side boiler threatened to enter the number 4 turbo-generator feedwater system, which would have permitted saltwater to reach the turbines. The saltwater would have damaged the turbine blades and thus greatly reduced the ship's speed. By morning on 25 May, the danger had passed. The ship slowed to {{convert|12|kn}} to allow divers to pump fuel from the forward compartments to the rear tanks; two hoses were successfully connected and a few hundred tons of fuel were transferred.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=226}}\n\nAs the chase entered open waters, Wake-Walker's ships were compelled to zig-zag to avoid German U-boats that might be in the area. This required the ships to steam for ten minutes to port, then ten minutes to starboard, to keep the ships on the same base course. For the last few minutes of the turn to port, ''Bismarck'' was out of range of ''Suffolk''{{'}}s radar.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=229\u2013230}} At 03:00 on 25 May, L\u00fctjens ordered an increase to maximum speed, which at this point was {{convert|28|kn}}. He then ordered the ship to circle away to the west and then north. This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; ''Bismarck'' successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind her pursuers. ''Suffolk''{{'}}s captain assumed that ''Bismarck'' had broken off to the west and attempted to find her by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=230\u2013231}}\n\nThe Royal Navy search became frantic, as many of the British ships were low on fuel. ''Victorious'' and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker's ships continued to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. [[Force H]], with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and steaming up from [[Gibraltar]], was still at least a day away.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=232\u2013233}} Unaware that he had shaken off Wake-Walker, L\u00fctjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board ''King George V'', leading Tovey to believe that ''Bismarck'' was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, ''Bismarck'' had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=231}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|left|The aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} with a flight of Swordfish overhead]]\n\nBritish code-breakers were able to decrypt some of the German signals, including an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for ''Bismarck'' making for Brest, decrypted by [[Jane Fawcett]] on 25 May 1941.{{sfn|Schudel}} The [[French Resistance]] provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could now turn his forces toward France to converge in areas through which ''Bismarck'' would have to pass.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=232}} A squadron of Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]]s based in [[Northern Ireland]] joined the search, covering areas where ''Bismarck'' might head in the attempt to reach occupied France. At 10:30 on 26 May, a Catalina piloted by Ensign [[Leonard B. Smith]] of the US Navy located her, some {{convert|690|nmi|abbr=on}} northwest of Brest.{{efn|Smith was one of nine American officers assigned to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] as special observers.{{sfn|Miller|p=162}}}} At her current speed, she would have been close enough to reach the protection of U-boats and the Luftwaffe in less than a day. Most British forces were not close enough to stop her.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=233}}\n\nThe only possibility for the Royal Navy was ''Ark Royal'' with Force H, under the command of Admiral [[James Somerville]].{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=234}} ''Victorious'', ''Prince of Wales'', ''Suffolk'' and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} were forced to break off the search due to fuel shortage; the only heavy ships remaining apart from Force H were ''King George V'' and ''Rodney'', but they were too distant.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=233}} ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s Swordfish were already searching nearby when the Catalina found her. Several torpedo bombers also located the battleship, about {{convert|60|nmi|abbr=on}} away from ''Ark Royal''. Somerville ordered an attack as soon as the Swordfish returned and were rearmed with torpedoes. He detached the cruiser {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}} to shadow ''Bismarck'', though ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s aviators were not informed of this.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=235}} As a result, the Swordfish, which were armed with torpedoes equipped with new magnetic [[detonator]]s, accidentally attacked ''Sheffield''. The magnetic detonators failed to work properly and ''Sheffield'' emerged unscathed.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=236\u2013237}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal swordfish.jpg|thumb|A Swordfish returns to ''Ark Royal'' after making the torpedo attack against ''Bismarck'']]\n\nUpon returning to ''Ark Royal'', the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=258\u2013259}} As the Swordfish approached, ''Bismarck'' fired her main battery at ''Sheffield'', straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on ''Sheffield'', killing three men and wounding several others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=259}} ''Sheffield'' quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; ''Bismarck'' began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=259\u2013261}} One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=234}}\n\nThe second torpedo struck ''Bismarck'' in her stern on the port side, near the port rudder shaft. The coupling on the port rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12\u00b0 turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by L\u00fctjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=234\u2013236}}{{sfn|Kennedy|p=211}} At 21:15, L\u00fctjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=237}}\n\n==== Sinking ====\n{{main|Last battle of the battleship Bismarck}}\n\nWith the port rudder jammed, ''Bismarck'' was now steaming in a large circle, unable to escape from Tovey's forces. Though fuel shortages had reduced the number of ships available to the British, the battleships ''King George V'' and ''Rodney'' were still available, along with the heavy cruisers ''Dorsetshire'' and ''Norfolk''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=271\u2013272}} L\u00fctjens signalled headquarters at 21:40 on the 26th: \"Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=182}} The mood of the crew became increasingly depressed, especially as messages from the naval command reached the ship. Intended to boost morale, the messages only highlighted the desperate situation in which the crew found itself.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=256\u2013257}} As darkness fell, ''Bismarck'' briefly fired on ''Sheffield'', though the cruiser quickly fled. ''Sheffield'' lost contact in the low visibility and Captain [[Philip Vian]]'s group of five destroyers was ordered to keep contact with ''Bismarck'' through the night.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=279}}\n\nThe ships encountered ''Bismarck'' at 22:38; the battleship quickly engaged them with her main battery. After firing three salvos, she straddled the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]] destroyer {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}}. The destroyer continued to close the range until a near miss at around {{convert|12000|m|abbr=on}} forced her to turn away. Throughout the night and into the morning, Vian's destroyers harried ''Bismarck'', illuminating her with [[star shell]]s and firing dozens of torpedoes, none of which hit. Between 05:00 and 06:00, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew attempted to launch one of the Arado 196 float planes to carry away the ship's war diary, footage of the engagement with ''Hood'', and other important documents. The third shell hit from ''Prince of Wales'' had damaged the steam line on the aircraft catapult, rendering it inoperative. As it was not possible to launch the aircraft it had become a fire hazard, and was pushed overboard.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n[[File:Rodney firing on Bismarck.png|thumb|upright=1.3|''Rodney'' firing on ''Bismarck'', which can be seen burning in the distance]]\n\nAfter daybreak on 27 May, ''King George V'' led the attack. ''Rodney'' followed off her port quarter; Tovey intended to steam directly at ''Bismarck'' until he was about {{convert|8|nmi|abbr=on}} away. At that point, he would turn south to put his ships parallel to his target.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=286\u2013287}} At 08:43, lookouts on ''King George V'' spotted her, some {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}} away. Four minutes later, ''Rodney''{{'}}s two forward turrets, comprising six {{convert|16|in|0|abbr=on}} guns, opened fire, then ''King George V''{{'}}s {{convert|14|in|0|abbr=on}} guns began firing. ''Bismarck'' returned fire at 08:50 with her forward guns; with her second salvo, she straddled ''Rodney''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=288\u2013289}} Thereafter, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s ability to aim her guns deteriorated as the ship, unable to steer, moved erratically in the heavy seas and deprived Schneider of a predictable course for range calculations.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=268}}\n\nAs the range fell, the ships' secondary batteries joined the battle. ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' closed and began firing with their {{convert|8|in|0|abbr=on}} guns. At 09:02, a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' struck ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward [[superstructure]], killing hundreds of men and severely damaging the two forward turrets. According to survivors, this salvo probably killed both Lindemann and L\u00fctjens and the rest of the bridge staff,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=290\u2013291}} although other survivors stated that they saw Lindemann on the deck as the ship sank.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}} The main fire control director was also destroyed by this hit, which probably also killed Schneider. A second shell from this salvo struck the forward main battery, which was disabled, though it would manage to fire one last salvo at 09:27.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=269}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=239}} Lieutenant von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg, in the rear control station, took over firing control for the rear turrets. He managed to fire three salvos before a shell destroyed the gun director, disabling his equipment. He gave the order for the guns to fire independently, but by 09:31, all four main battery turrets had been put out of action.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells exploded 20 feet off ''Rodney''{{' }}s bow and damaged her starboard torpedo tube\u2014the closest ''Bismarck'' came to a direct hit on her opponents.{{sfn|Kennedy|p=246}}\n\nBy 10:00, Tovey's two battleships had fired over 700 main battery shells, many at very close range; ''Bismarck'' had been reduced to a shambles, aflame from stem to stern. She was slowly settling by the stern from uncontrolled flooding with a 20 degree list to port.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=292\u2013294}} ''Rodney'' closed to {{convert|2700|m|yd|abbr=on}}, [[point-blank range]] for guns of that size, and continued to fire.

After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=295}}\n\nThe four British ships fired more than 2,800 shells at ''Bismarck'', and scored more than 400 hits, but were unable to sink ''Bismarck'' by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' to sink ''Bismarck'' with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port.{{sfn|McGowen|p=56}} ''Dorsetshire'' fired a pair of torpedoes into ''Bismarck''{{'}}s starboard side, one of which hit. ''Dorsetshire'' then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=281}} It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater.{{sfn|Jurens et. al.}} Around 10:35, ''Bismarck'' capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=246}} Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at the stem of the ship as she sank.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}}\n\nJunack, who had abandoned ship by the time it capsized, observed no underwater damage to the ship's starboard side.{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} Von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg reported the same but assumed that the port side, which was then under water, had been more significantly damaged.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}} Around 400 men were now in the water;{{sfn|Gaack & Carr|pp=80\u201381}} ''Dorsetshire'' and the destroyer {{HMS|Maori|F24|2}} moved in and lowered ropes to pull the survivors aboard. At 11:40, ''Dorsetshire''{{'}}s captain ordered the rescue effort abandoned after lookouts spotted what they thought was a U-boat. ''Dorsetshire'' had rescued 85 men and ''Maori'' had picked up 25 by the time they left the scene.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=297}} A U-boat later reached the survivors and found three men, and a German trawler rescued another two. One of the men picked up by the British died of his wounds the following day. Out of a crew of over 2,200 men, only 114 survived.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=246}}\n\nIn 1959, [[C. S.

For dramatic effect the film showed ''Bismarck'' sinking a British destroyer and shooting down two aircraft, neither of which happened.{{sfn|Niemi|p=99}} That same year, [[Johnny Horton]] released the song \"[[Sink the Bismark]]\".{{sfn|Polmar & Cavas|p=251}}\n\n== Wreckage ==\n\n=== Discovery by Robert Ballard ===\n[[File:Bismarck illustration.png|thumb|upright|Painting by [[Ken Marschall]] depicting [[Argo (ROV)|''Argo'']] exploring the wreck]]\nThe wreck of ''Bismarck'' was discovered on 8 June 1989 by Dr. [[Robert Ballard]], the [[oceanographer]] responsible for finding {{RMS|Titanic}}. ''Bismarck'' was found to be resting on its keel at a depth of approximately {{convert|4791|m|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=221}} about {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding [[abyssal plain]], triggering a {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} [[landslide]]. ''Bismarck'' slid down the mountain, coming to a stop two-thirds down. Ballard kept the wreck's exact location a secret to prevent other divers from taking artefacts<!--this is the correct spelling; \"artefact\" is the British English spelling of the word. Please do not change it.--> from the ship, a practice he considered a form of [[grave robbing]].{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=216, 221}}\n\nBallard's survey found no underwater penetrations of the ship's fully armoured [[Citadel#Naval term|citadel]]. Eight holes were found in the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=194}} Six holes are [[amidships]], three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=214}} Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and it is likely that the shell penetrated the deck armour only.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=191}} Huge dents showed that many of the 14&nbsp;inch shells fired by ''King George V'' bounced off the German belt armour.{{sfn|Jackson|p=85}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin noted that the British battleships were shooting at very close range; the flat trajectory of the shells made it difficult to hit the relatively narrow target represented by the belt armour above the waterline, as shells that fell short would either ricochet up into the superstructure or explode on striking the water.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1994}}\n\nBallard noted that he found no evidence of the internal implosions that occur when a hull that is not fully flooded sinks. The surrounding water, which has much greater pressure than the air in the hull, would crush the ship. Instead, Ballard points out that the hull is in relatively good condition; he states simply that \"''Bismarck'' did not implode.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=214\u2013215}} This suggests that ''Bismarck''{{'}}s compartments were flooded when the ship sank, supporting the scuttling theory.{{sfn|Jackson|p=88}} Ballard added \"we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact\". They concluded that the direct cause of sinking was scuttling: sabotage of engine-room valves by her crew, as claimed by German survivors.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\nThe whole stern had broken away; as it was not near the main wreckage and has not yet been found, it can be assumed this did not occur on impact with the sea floor. The missing section came away roughly where the torpedo had hit, raising questions of possible structural failure.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=177\u2013178}} The stern area had also received several hits, increasing the torpedo damage. This, coupled with the fact the ship sank \"stern first\" and had no structural support to hold it in place, suggests the stern detached at the surface. In 1942 ''Prinz Eugen'' was also torpedoed in the stern, which collapsed. This prompted a strengthening of the stern structures on all German capital ships.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\n=== Subsequent expeditions ===\nIn June 2001, Deep Ocean Expeditions, partnered with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], conducted another investigation of the wreck. The researchers used Russian-built [[Submersible|mini-submarines]]. William N. Lange, a Woods Hole expert, stated, \"You see a large number of shell holes in the superstructure and deck, but not that many along the side, and none below the waterline.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long gashes in the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nAn Anglo-American expedition in July 2001 was funded by a British TV channel. The team used the volcano\u2014the only one in that area\u2014to locate the wreck. Using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] to film the hull, the team concluded that the ship had sunk due to combat damage. Expedition leader [[David Mearns]] claimed significant gashes had been found in the hull: \"My feeling is that those holes were probably lengthened by the slide, but initiated by torpedoes\".{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nThe 2002 documentary ''[[Expedition: Bismarck]]'', directed by [[James Cameron]] and filmed in May\u2013June 2002 using smaller and more agile [[Mir (submersible)|Mir submersibles]], reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were that there was not enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nDespite their sometimes differing viewpoints, these experts generally agree that ''Bismarck'' would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that ''Bismarck'' could still have floated for at least a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving  on the destroyer {{HMS|Tartar|F43|6}} at the time). Kennedy stated, \"That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}} When asked whether ''Bismarck'' would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied \"Sure. But it might have taken half a day.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} In Mearns' subsequent book ''Hood and Bismarck'', he conceded that scuttling \"may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} Ballard later concluded that \"As far as I was concerned, the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Archaeological Oceanography''|p=111}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Unsinkable Sam]] \u2013 cat which is said to have survived the sinking of ''Bismarck''\n\n== Footnotes

Named after Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], the ship was laid down at the [[Blohm & Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]] in July 1936 and launched in February 1939. Work was completed in August 1940, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. ''Bismarck'' and her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} were the largest battleships ever built by Germany, and two of the largest built by any European power.\n\nIn the course of the warship's eight-month career under its sole commanding officer, [[Ernst Lindemann|Captain Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck'' conducted only one offensive operation, lasting 8 days in May 1941, codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. The ship, along with the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia, and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} initially engaged ''Prinz Eugen'', probably by mistake, while {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} engaged ''Bismarck''. In the ensuing battle ''Hood'' was destroyed by the combined fire of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', which then damaged ''Prince of Wales'' and forced her retreat. ''Bismarck'' suffered sufficient damage from three hits to force an end to the raiding mission.\n\nThe destruction of ''Hood'' spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for [[occupied France]] to effect repairs, ''Bismarck'' was attacked by 16 obsolescent [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[biplane]] [[torpedo bomber]]s from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}; one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her final battle]] the following morning, the already-crippled ''Bismarck'' was severely damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers,  was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by her crew, and sank with heavy loss of life. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by [[Robert Ballard]], and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Bismarck'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on|lk=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Bb bismarck.png|thumb|left|3D rendering of ''Bismarck'' based on its configuration during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]]\n\n''Bismarck'' displaced {{convert|41,700|t|LT|abbr=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{convert|50,300|t|LT|abbr=on}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The battleship was Germany's largest warship,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=203}} and displaced more than any other European battleship, with the exception of {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}, commissioned after the end of the war.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|pp=16, 224}} ''Bismarck'' was powered by three [[Blohm+Voss|Blohm & Voss]] geared [[steam turbine]]s and twelve oil-fired Wagner [[Superheated steam|superheated]] [[Water-tube boiler|boilers]], which developed a total of {{convert|{{convert|150170|PS|shp|0|disp=number}}|shp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.01|kn|lk=in}} on speed trials. The ship had a cruising range of {{convert|8,870|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|19|kn}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} ''Bismarck'' was equipped with three [[Seetakt|FuMO 23]] search [[radar]] sets, mounted on the forward and stern [[rangefinder]]s and foretop.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} The crew was divided into twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions were assigned to the ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|batteries]] and five and six manning [[anti-aircraft gun]]s. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The [[radio operator]]s, signalmen, and [[quartermaster]]s were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were the [[engine room]] personnel.

As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering [[propeller (ship)|propeller]] revolutions, the crew learned that ''Bismarck'' could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power in opposite directions, they generated only a slight turning ability.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s main battery guns were first test-fired in late November.

He returned to Sweden with a detailed description of the ship, which was subsequently leaked to Britain by pro-British elements in the [[Swedish Navy]]. The information provided the [[Royal Navy]] with its first full description of the vessel, although it lacked important facts, including top speed, radius of action, and displacement.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-41, Schlachtschiff \"Bismarck\".jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' on trials; the rangefinders had not yet been installed]]\n\nOn 6 March, ''Bismarck'' received the order to steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters and a pair of [[Armed merchantman|armed merchant vessels]], along with an [[icebreaker]]. At 08:45 on 8 March, ''Bismarck'' briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed within an hour. The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of [[dazzle paint]] to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=40}} On 17 March, the old battleship {{SMS|Schlesien||2}}, now used as an icebreaker, escorted ''Bismarck'' through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=41}}\n\nThe Naval High Command (''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' or OKM), commanded by Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], intended to continue the practice of using heavy ships as surface raiders against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] merchant traffic in the Atlantic Ocean.

''Bismarck''{{'}}s sister ship ''Tirpitz'' rapidly approached completion. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were to sortie from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and rendezvous with the two ''Scharnhorst''-class ships in the Atlantic; the operation was initially scheduled for around 25 April 1941, when a new moon period would make conditions more favourable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=210\u2013211}}\n\nWork on ''Tirpitz'' was completed later than anticipated, and she was not commissioned until 25 February; the ship was not ready for combat until late in the year. To further complicate the situation, {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} was torpedoed in Brest and damaged further by bombs when in [[drydock]]. {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} required a boiler overhaul following Operation Berlin; the workers discovered during the overhaul that the boilers were in worse condition than expected. She would also be unavailable for the planned sortie.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=211}} Attacks by British bombers on supply depots in Kiel delayed repairs to the heavy cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}.

This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, ''Bismarck'' departed Gotenhafen and made for the [[Danish straits]]. She was joined at 11:25 by ''Prinz Eugen'', which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} The two ships were escorted by three [[destroyer]]s\u2014{{ship|German destroyer|Z10 Hans Lody||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt||2}}, and {{ship|German destroyer|Z23||2}}\u2014and a [[flotilla]] of [[minesweeper]]s.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=76}} The [[Luftwaffe]] provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=64}}\n\nAn hour later, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish [[cruiser]] {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}}; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the [[Kattegat]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} ''Gotland'' transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: \"Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10\u201312 aircraft passed [[Marstrand]], course 205\u00b0/20'.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=214}} The OKM was not concerned about the security risk posed by ''Gotland'', though both L\u00fctjens and Lindemann believed operational secrecy had been lost.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=65}} The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attach\u00e9 to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the [[Admiralty]].{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=66\u201367}} The code-breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had [[encryption|decrypted]] reports that ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had taken on prize crews and requested additional [[navigational chart]]s from headquarters. A pair of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s was ordered to search the Norwegian coast for the flotilla.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=68}}\n\nGerman aerial reconnaissance confirmed that one [[aircraft carrier]], three battleships, and four cruisers remained at anchor in the main British naval base at [[Scapa Flow]], which confirmed to L\u00fctjens that the British were unaware of his operation. On the evening of 20 May, ''Bismarck'' and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board ''Prinz Eugen'' picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=114}} At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft, which quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached [[Bergen]] and anchored at [[Grimstadfjord]], where the ships' crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard \"outboard grey\" worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=83}}\n\n[[File:Bismarck reconnaissance.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial reconnaissance photo showing ''Bismarck'' anchored (on the right) in Norway]]\n\nWhen ''Bismarck'' was in Norway, a pair of Bf 109 fighters circled overhead to protect her from British air attacks, but Flying Officer Michael Suckling managed to fly his Spitfire directly over the German flotilla at a height of {{convert|8000|m|abbr=on}} and take photos of ''Bismarck'' and her escorts.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=84}} Upon receipt of the information, Admiral [[John Tovey]] ordered the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, the newly commissioned battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, and six destroyers to reinforce the pair of cruisers patrolling the [[Denmark Strait]].

At 19:22, [[hydrophone]] and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser {{HMS|Suffolk|55|6}} at a range of approximately {{convert|12500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=216}} ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by ''Suffolk'' and learned that their location had been reported.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\nL\u00fctjens gave permission for ''Prinz Eugen'' to engage ''Suffolk'', but the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held  fire.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=127}} ''Suffolk'' quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} joined ''Suffolk'', but approached the German raiders too closely. L\u00fctjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; ''Bismarck'' fired five salvoes, three of which straddled ''Norfolk'' and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38&nbsp;cm guns' firing disabled ''Bismarck''{{'}}s FuMO 23 radar set; this prompted L\u00fctjens to order ''Prinz Eugen'' to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nAt around 22:00, L\u00fctjens ordered ''Bismarck'' to make a 180-degree turn in an effort to surprise the two heavy cruisers shadowing him.

Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20\u00b0 turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on ''Hood''. About a minute after opening fire, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a hit with a high-explosive {{convert|20.3|cm|abbr=on}} shell; the explosion detonated [[unrotated projectile]] ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=220}} After firing three four-gun salvoes, Schneider had found the range to ''Hood''; he immediately ordered rapid-fire salvoes from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s eight 38&nbsp;cm guns.

Rear Admiral [[Frederic Wake-Walker]], the commander of the two cruisers, ordered ''Prince of Wales'' to remain behind his ships.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] ordered all warships in the area to join the pursuit of ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''. Tovey's Home Fleet was steaming to intercept the German raiders, but on the morning of 24 May was still over {{convert|350|nmi|abbr=on}} away. The Admiralty ordered the light cruisers {{HMS|Manchester|15|2}}, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|2}}, and {{HMS|Arethusa|26|2}} to patrol the Denmark Strait in the event that L\u00fctjens attempted to retrace his route. The battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}, which had been escorting {{RMS|Britannic|1929|6}} and was due for a refit in the [[Boston Navy Yard]], joined Tovey. Two old {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|1}}s were ordered into the hunt:  {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}}, from Halifax, and {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}}, which was escorting Convoy HX 127.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=174\u2013175}} In all, six battleships and battlecruisers, two aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, and twenty-one destroyers were committed to the chase.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} By around 17:00, the crew aboard ''Prince of Wales'' restored nine of her ten main guns to working order, which permitted Wake-Walker to place her in the front of his formation to attack ''Bismarck'' if the opportunity arose.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=175}}\n\nWith the weather worsening, L\u00fctjens attempted to detach ''Prinz Eugen'' at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. ''Prinz Eugen'' was therefore recalled temporarily.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=192\u2013193}} The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. ''Bismarck'' turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing ''Suffolk'' to turn away at high speed. ''Prince of Wales'' fired twelve salvos at ''Bismarck'', which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted ''Prinz Eugen'' to slip away. After ''Bismarck'' resumed her previous heading, Wake-Walker's three ships took up station on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=227}}\n\nAlthough ''Bismarck'' had been damaged in the engagement and forced to reduce speed, she was still capable of reaching {{convert|27|to|28|kn}}, the maximum speed of Tovey's {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}. Unless ''Bismarck'' could be slowed, the British would be unable to prevent her from reaching Saint-Nazaire. Shortly before 16:00 on 25 May, Tovey detached the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} and four light cruisers to shape a course that would position her to launch her [[torpedo bomber]]s.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=194\u2013195}} At 22:00, ''Victorious'' launched the strike, which comprised six [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighters and nine [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers of [[825 Naval Air Squadron]], led by Lt Cdr [[Eugene Esmonde]]. The inexperienced aviators nearly attacked ''Norfolk'' and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter [[USCGC Modoc (WPG-46)|USCGC ''Modoc'']] on their approach; the confusion alerted ''Bismarck''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}}\n\n''Bismarck'' also used her main and secondary batteries to fire at maximum depression to create giant splashes in the paths of the incoming torpedo bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=189}} None of the attacking aircraft were shot down. ''Bismarck'' evaded eight of the torpedoes launched at her, but the ninth{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=229}} struck amidships on the main armoured belt, throwing one man into a bulkhead and killing him and injuring five others.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=229\u2013230}} The explosion also caused minor damage to electrical equipment. The ship suffered more serious damage from manoeuvres to evade the torpedoes: rapid shifts in speed and course loosened collision mats, which increased the flooding from the forward shell hole and eventually forced abandonment of the port number 2 boiler room. This loss of a second boiler, combined with fuel losses and increasing bow trim, forced the ship to slow to {{convert|16|kn}}. Divers repaired the collision mats in the bow, after which speed increased to {{convert|20|kn}}, the speed that the command staff determined was the most economical for the voyage to occupied France.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=230}}\n\nShortly after the Swordfish departed from the scene, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prince of Wales'' engaged in a brief artillery duel. Neither scored a hit.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=192\u2013193}} ''Bismarck''{{'}}s damage control teams resumed work after the short engagement. The sea water that had flooded the number 2 port side boiler threatened to enter the number 4 turbo-generator feedwater system, which would have permitted saltwater to reach the turbines. The saltwater would have damaged the turbine blades and thus greatly reduced the ship's speed. By morning on 25 May, the danger had passed. The ship slowed to {{convert|12|kn}} to allow divers to pump fuel from the forward compartments to the rear tanks; two hoses were successfully connected and a few hundred tons of fuel were transferred.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=226}}\n\nAs the chase entered open waters, Wake-Walker's ships were compelled to zig-zag to avoid German U-boats that might be in the area. This required the ships to steam for ten minutes to port, then ten minutes to starboard, to keep the ships on the same base course. For the last few minutes of the turn to port, ''Bismarck'' was out of range of ''Suffolk''{{'}}s radar.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=229\u2013230}} At 03:00 on 25 May, L\u00fctjens ordered an increase to maximum speed, which at this point was {{convert|28|kn}}. He then ordered the ship to circle away to the west and then north. This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; ''Bismarck'' successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind her pursuers. ''Suffolk''{{'}}s captain assumed that ''Bismarck'' had broken off to the west and attempted to find her by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=230\u2013231}}\n\nThe Royal Navy search became frantic, as many of the British ships were low on fuel. ''Victorious'' and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker's ships continued to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. [[Force H]], with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and steaming up from [[Gibraltar]], was still at least a day away.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=232\u2013233}} Unaware that he had shaken off Wake-Walker, L\u00fctjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board ''King George V'', leading Tovey to believe that ''Bismarck'' was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, ''Bismarck'' had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=231}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|left|The aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} with a flight of Swordfish overhead]]\n\nBritish code-breakers were able to decrypt some of the German signals, including an order to the Luftwaffe to provide support for ''Bismarck'' making for Brest, decrypted by [[Jane Fawcett]] on 25 May 1941.{{sfn|Schudel}} The [[French Resistance]] provided the British with confirmation that Luftwaffe units were relocating there. Tovey could now turn his forces toward France to converge in areas through which ''Bismarck'' would have to pass.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=232}} A squadron of Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]]s based in [[Northern Ireland]] joined the search, covering areas where ''Bismarck'' might head in the attempt to reach occupied France. At 10:30 on 26 May, a Catalina piloted by Ensign [[Leonard B. Smith]] of the US Navy located her, some {{convert|690|nmi|abbr=on}} northwest of Brest.{{efn|Smith was one of nine American officers assigned to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] as special observers.{{sfn|Miller|p=162}}}} At her current speed, she would have been close enough to reach the protection of U-boats and the Luftwaffe in less than a day. Most British forces were not close enough to stop her.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=233}}\n\nThe only possibility for the Royal Navy was ''Ark Royal'' with Force H, under the command of Admiral [[James Somerville]].{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=234}} ''Victorious'', ''Prince of Wales'', ''Suffolk'' and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} were forced to break off the search due to fuel shortage; the only heavy ships remaining apart from Force H were ''King George V'' and ''Rodney'', but they were too distant.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=233}} ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s Swordfish were already searching nearby when the Catalina found her. Several torpedo bombers also located the battleship, about {{convert|60|nmi|abbr=on}} away from ''Ark Royal''. Somerville ordered an attack as soon as the Swordfish returned and were rearmed with torpedoes. He detached the cruiser {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|2}} to shadow ''Bismarck'', though ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s aviators were not informed of this.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=235}} As a result, the Swordfish, which were armed with torpedoes equipped with new magnetic [[detonator]]s, accidentally attacked ''Sheffield''. The magnetic detonators failed to work properly and ''Sheffield'' emerged unscathed.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=236\u2013237}}\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal swordfish.jpg|thumb|A Swordfish returns to ''Ark Royal'' after making the torpedo attack against ''Bismarck'']]\n\nUpon returning to ''Ark Royal'', the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=258\u2013259}} As the Swordfish approached, ''Bismarck'' fired her main battery at ''Sheffield'', straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on ''Sheffield'', killing three men and wounding several others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=259}} ''Sheffield'' quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; ''Bismarck'' began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=259\u2013261}} One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=234}}\n\nThe second torpedo struck ''Bismarck'' in her stern on the port side, near the port rudder shaft. The coupling on the port rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12\u00b0 turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by L\u00fctjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=234\u2013236}}{{sfn|Kennedy|p=211}} At 21:15, L\u00fctjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=237}}\n\n==== Sinking ====\n{{main|Last battle of the battleship Bismarck}}\n\nWith the port rudder jammed, ''Bismarck'' was now steaming in a large circle, unable to escape from Tovey's forces. Though fuel shortages had reduced the number of ships available to the British, the battleships ''King George V'' and ''Rodney'' were still available, along with the heavy cruisers ''Dorsetshire'' and ''Norfolk''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=271\u2013272}} L\u00fctjens signalled headquarters at 21:40 on the 26th: \"Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=182}} The mood of the crew became increasingly depressed, especially as messages from the naval command reached the ship. Intended to boost morale, the messages only highlighted the desperate situation in which the crew found itself.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=256\u2013257}} As darkness fell, ''Bismarck'' briefly fired on ''Sheffield'', though the cruiser quickly fled. ''Sheffield'' lost contact in the low visibility and Captain [[Philip Vian]]'s group of five destroyers was ordered to keep contact with ''Bismarck'' through the night.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=279}}\n\nThe ships encountered ''Bismarck'' at 22:38; the battleship quickly engaged them with her main battery. After firing three salvos, she straddled the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]] destroyer {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}}. The destroyer continued to close the range until a near miss at around {{convert|12000|m|abbr=on}} forced her to turn away. Throughout the night and into the morning, Vian's destroyers harried ''Bismarck'', illuminating her with [[star shell]]s and firing dozens of torpedoes, none of which hit. Between 05:00 and 06:00, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s crew attempted to launch one of the Arado 196 float planes to carry away the ship's war diary, footage of the engagement with ''Hood'', and other important documents. The third shell hit from ''Prince of Wales'' had damaged the steam line on the aircraft catapult, rendering it inoperative. As it was not possible to launch the aircraft it had become a fire hazard, and was pushed overboard.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n[[File:Rodney firing on Bismarck.png|thumb|upright=1.3|''Rodney'' firing on ''Bismarck'', which can be seen burning in the distance]]\n\nAfter daybreak on 27 May, ''King George V'' led the attack. ''Rodney'' followed off her port quarter; Tovey intended to steam directly at ''Bismarck'' until he was about {{convert|8|nmi|abbr=on}} away. At that point, he would turn south to put his ships parallel to his target.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=286\u2013287}} At 08:43, lookouts on ''King George V'' spotted her, some {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}} away. Four minutes later, ''Rodney''{{'}}s two forward turrets, comprising six {{convert|16|in|0|abbr=on}} guns, opened fire, then ''King George V''{{'}}s {{convert|14|in|0|abbr=on}} guns began firing. ''Bismarck'' returned fire at 08:50 with her forward guns; with her second salvo, she straddled ''Rodney''.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=288\u2013289}} Thereafter, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s ability to aim her guns deteriorated as the ship, unable to steer, moved erratically in the heavy seas and deprived Schneider of a predictable course for range calculations.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=268}}\n\nAs the range fell, the ships' secondary batteries joined the battle. ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' closed and began firing with their {{convert|8|in|0|abbr=on}} guns. At 09:02, a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' struck ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward [[superstructure]], killing hundreds of men and severely damaging the two forward turrets. According to survivors, this salvo probably killed both Lindemann and L\u00fctjens and the rest of the bridge staff,{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=290\u2013291}} although other survivors stated that they saw Lindemann on the deck as the ship sank.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=282}} The main fire control director was also destroyed by this hit, which probably also killed Schneider. A second shell from this salvo struck the forward main battery, which was disabled, though it would manage to fire one last salvo at 09:27.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=269}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=239}} Lieutenant von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg, in the rear control station, took over firing control for the rear turrets. He managed to fire three salvos before a shell destroyed the gun director, disabling his equipment. He gave the order for the guns to fire independently, but by 09:31, all four main battery turrets had been put out of action.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells exploded 20 feet off ''Rodney''{{' }}s bow and damaged her starboard torpedo tube\u2014the closest ''Bismarck'' came to a direct hit on her opponents.{{sfn|Kennedy|p=246}}\n\nBy 10:00, Tovey's two battleships had fired over 700 main battery shells, many at very close range; ''Bismarck'' had been reduced to a shambles, aflame from stem to stern.

After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=295}}\n\nThe four British ships fired more than 2,800 shells at ''Bismarck'', and scored more than 400 hits, but were unable to sink ''Bismarck'' by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' to sink ''Bismarck'' with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port.{{sfn|McGowen|p=56}} ''Dorsetshire'' fired a pair of torpedoes into ''Bismarck''{{'}}s starboard side, one of which hit.

''Dorsetshire'' had rescued 85 men and ''Maori'' had picked up 25 by the time they left the scene.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=297}} A U-boat later reached the survivors and found three men, and a German trawler rescued another two. One of the men picked up by the British died of his wounds the following day. Out of a crew of over 2,200 men, only 114 survived.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1985|p=246}}\n\nIn 1959, [[C. S. Forester]] published his novel ''[[Last Nine Days of the Bismarck]].'' The book was adapted for the movie ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]],'' released the following year. For dramatic effect the film showed ''Bismarck'' sinking a British destroyer and shooting down two aircraft, neither of which happened.{{sfn|Niemi|p=99}} That same year, [[Johnny Horton]] released the song \"[[Sink the Bismark]]\".{{sfn|Polmar & Cavas|p=251}}\n\n== Wreckage ==\n\n=== Discovery by Robert Ballard ===\n[[File:Bismarck illustration.png|thumb|upright|Painting by [[Ken Marschall]] depicting [[Argo (ROV)|''Argo'']] exploring the wreck]]\nThe wreck of ''Bismarck'' was discovered on 8 June 1989 by Dr. [[Robert Ballard]], the [[oceanographer]] responsible for finding {{RMS|Titanic}}. ''Bismarck'' was found to be resting on its keel at a depth of approximately {{convert|4791|m|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=221}} about {{convert|650|km|abbr=on}} west of Brest. The ship struck an extinct underwater volcano, which rose some {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding [[abyssal plain]], triggering a {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} [[landslide]]. ''Bismarck'' slid down the mountain, coming to a stop two-thirds down. Ballard kept the wreck's exact location a secret to prevent other divers from taking artefacts<!--this is the correct spelling; \"artefact\" is the British English spelling of the word. Please do not change it.--> from the ship, a practice he considered a form of [[grave robbing]].{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=216, 221}}\n\nBallard's survey found no underwater penetrations of the ship's fully armoured [[Citadel#Naval term|citadel]]. Eight holes were found in the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=194}} Six holes are [[amidships]], three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=214}} Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and it is likely that the shell penetrated the deck armour only.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=191}} Huge dents showed that many of the 14&nbsp;inch shells fired by ''King George V'' bounced off the German belt armour.{{sfn|Jackson|p=85}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin noted that the British battleships were shooting at very close range; the flat trajectory of the shells made it difficult to hit the relatively narrow target represented by the belt armour above the waterline, as shells that fell short would either ricochet up into the superstructure or explode on striking the water.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin 1994}}\n\nBallard noted that he found no evidence of the internal implosions that occur when a hull that is not fully flooded sinks. The surrounding water, which has much greater pressure than the air in the hull, would crush the ship. Instead, Ballard points out that the hull is in relatively good condition; he states simply that \"''Bismarck'' did not implode.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=214\u2013215}} This suggests that ''Bismarck''{{'}}s compartments were flooded when the ship sank, supporting the scuttling theory.{{sfn|Jackson|p=88}} Ballard added \"we found a hull that appears whole and relatively undamaged by the descent and impact\". They concluded that the direct cause of sinking was scuttling: sabotage of engine-room valves by her crew, as claimed by German survivors.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\nThe whole stern had broken away; as it was not near the main wreckage and has not yet been found, it can be assumed this did not occur on impact with the sea floor. The missing section came away roughly where the torpedo had hit, raising questions of possible structural failure.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|pp=177\u2013178}} The stern area had also received several hits, increasing the torpedo damage. This, coupled with the fact the ship sank \"stern first\" and had no structural support to hold it in place, suggests the stern detached at the surface. In 1942 ''Prinz Eugen'' was also torpedoed in the stern, which collapsed. This prompted a strengthening of the stern structures on all German capital ships.{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}}\n\n=== Subsequent expeditions ===\nIn June 2001, Deep Ocean Expeditions, partnered with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], conducted another investigation of the wreck. The researchers used Russian-built [[Submersible|mini-submarines]]. William N. Lange, a Woods Hole expert, stated, \"You see a large number of shell holes in the superstructure and deck, but not that many along the side, and none below the waterline.\"{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}} The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long gashes in the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nAn Anglo-American expedition in July 2001 was funded by a British TV channel. The team used the volcano\u2014the only one in that area\u2014to locate the wreck. Using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] to film the hull, the team concluded that the ship had sunk due to combat damage. Expedition leader [[David Mearns]] claimed significant gashes had been found in the hull: \"My feeling is that those holes were probably lengthened by the slide, but initiated by torpedoes\".{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nThe 2002 documentary ''[[Expedition: Bismarck]]'', directed by [[James Cameron]] and filmed in May\u2013June 2002 using smaller and more agile [[Mir (submersible)|Mir submersibles]], reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were that there was not enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.{{sfn|''New York Times'', \"Visiting Bismarck\"}}\n\nDespite their sometimes differing viewpoints, these experts generally agree that ''Bismarck'' would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that ''Bismarck'' could still have floated for at least a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving  on the destroyer {{HMS|Tartar|F43|6}} at the time). Kennedy stated, \"That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later.\"{{sfn|Ballard, ''Bismarck''|p=215}} When asked whether ''Bismarck'' would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied \"Sure.

It has a population of 10,008 according to the 2016 census.<ref name=\"sapmap2016\"/> It is the biggest town in the county and about one third of the county's population lives there. Longford lies at the meeting of Ireland's N4 and N5 National Primary Route roads, which means that traffic traveling between [[Dublin]] and [[County Mayo]], or North County Roscommon passes around the town. The [[Train station|station]] in  [[Longford railway station|Longford]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line|Dublin-Sligo line]] is important for commuters.\n\n==History==\nThe town is built on the banks of the [[River Camlin]] ({{Irish derived place name|Camlinn|crooked pool}}), which is a tributary of the [[River Shannon]]. The name Longford is an Anglicization of the Irish ''[[Longphort]]'', from ''long'' (meaning \"ship\") and ''port'' (meaning \"port\" or \"dock\"). This name was applied to many Irish settlements of Viking origin and eventually came to mean fort or camp in the Irish language, and so ''Longfort'' the modern Irish spelling, is the name of this town, which was one of the only Gaelic Irish market towns to arise without first being founded by Vikings or Normans.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe area came under the sway of the local clan which controlled the south and middle of the County of Longford (historically called ''[[Anghaile]]'' or {{Not a typo|Annaly}}) and hence, the town is sometimes called ''Longfort U\u00ed Fhearghail'' (fort/stronghold of O'Farrell).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[priory]] was founded there in 1400.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Places of interest==\nThe [[Corlea Trackway]] Visitor Centre is located near to Longford, in [[Keenagh]]. The Centre houses an [[Iron Age]] bog road which was built in 148 BC across the boglands in proximity to the [[River Shannon]]. The oak road is the largest of its kind to have been uncovered in Europe and was excavated over the years by Professor Barry Raftery of [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|University College Dublin]]. Inside the building, an 18-metre stretch of preserved road is on permanent display in a specially designed hall with humidifiers to prevent the ancient wood from cracking in the heat. [[Bord na Mona]] and the Heritage Service have carried out conservation work on the surrounding bog to ensure that it remains wet and that the buried road is preserved. There are other historical artifacts and some exhibits at the centre.\n[[File:Longford Railway Station - geograph.ie - 919117.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Longford Railway Station]]\n[[St. Mel's Cathedral]] in the town features several stained glass windows by Harry Clarke studios. These include one of his earliest works ''The consecration of St. Mel as Bishop of Longford'' which was exhibited at the RDS Annual Art Industries Exhibition in 1910, where it received second prize. It was also exhibited at The Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland fourth exhibition in the same year. The Cathedral was extensively damaged in a fire on Christmas Day 2009.<ref>{{cite news | title=RT\u00c9 News: Longford Cathedral gutted in fire | url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1225/longford.html | accessdate=25 December 2009 | date=25 December 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115080553/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1225/longford.html | archive-date=15 January 2010 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> St. Mel's Cathedral remained closed for exactly five years following the fire while it was the centre of one of the largest restoration projects undertaken in Europe. It reopened for services at midnight mass on Christmas Eve 2014 and has since become a significant tourist attraction. The two most intricated stained-glass windows in the transepts of the Cathedral have been faithfully restored \u2013 these depict St Anne and the Resurrection.\n\nLongford town boasts a state-of-the-art 212-seat theatre called Backstage Theatre just outside of the town, and a four-screen multiplex cinema, with restaurants. The mix and quality of housing is extensive and the Rural Renewal Hi Scheme (1999\u20132006) has ensured that a steady supply of residential development has come about. Longford town has a decentralized government department which employs approximately 300 people and a further 130 are employed at the Irish Prison Service's headquarters in the Lisamuck area of the town. The Prison Service HQ boasts a sculpture by renowned artist Remco de Fou which, apart from the Spire in Dublin is the largest piece of sculpture in Ireland. [[Connolly Barracks]] once employed approximately 180 soldiers, many of whom were involved in UN peace-keeping duties, until the barracks closed in January 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/longford-co-council-to-sell-off-connolly-barracks-1.2598814|title=Longford County Council to sell of Connolly Barracks|date=6 April 2016|accessdate=7 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409070403/http://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/longford-co-council-to-sell-off-connolly-barracks-1.2598814|archive-date=9 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe town serves as the cathedral town of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise]].

It is the major services centre for the county as well as the location of the Department of Social Welfare and the Irish Prison Service. The town is also a local commercial centre, with many retail outlets including multiples such as [[Tesco Ireland|Tesco]], [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] and [[Homestore and more]], German [[discount retailer]]s, [[Aldi]] and [[Lidl]] and Irish retail outlets such as [[Dunnes Stores]] and [[Primark|Penneys]].\n\nUp until 2007, construction was a major local employer, mainly due to government tax breaks for property development provided under the Rural Renewal scheme. However the downturn in the construction industry, the withdrawal of Rural Renewal, and extensive local oversupply of property has caused large job losses in the construction industry and a significant increase in unemployment in the region.\n\n==Education==\nLongford town has a number of primary schools (for ages 4\u201312) and three secondary schools (for ages 12\u201319): two single-sex schools, [[St. Mel's College]], (a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] boys' school) and [[Scoil Mhuire]] (a Catholic girls' school run by the [[Sisters of Mercy]]), as well as a mixed school, ([[Templemichael|Templemichael College]], formerly known as Longford [[Vocational School]]). Primary schools in Longford include a [[Gaelscoil]] and St. Joseph's. An extensive adult education centre exists in Longford.\n\nSt. Mel's College<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stmelscollege.ie/ |title=stmelscollege.ie |access-date=1 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202010156/http://www.stmelscollege.ie/ |archive-date=2 December 2005 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> is the oldest and best-known of these schools, being founded approximately 150 years ago by the [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnois]] as a diocesan seminary to train students for the priesthood. While the school only briefly functioned as a seminary, it served for many years as a boarding school, while also admitting day students. The boarding school was discontinued after 2000 and the school is now only a day school, with the largest student enrolment in county Longford. The College, known locally as ''Mel's'', is best known for its strict rules of conduct and its success on a national level with [[Gaelic football]], athletics, soccer, basketball and [[Rugby union|Rugby]].\n\n==Transport==\n<!-- Deleted file removed [[File:LStation.JPG|thumb|left|Longford Railway Station]] -->\n\n===Road===\nLongford is at the point of divergence of the [[N5 road (Ireland)|N5 road]] to [[Castlebar]]/[[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ireland West Airport Knock]] and the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4 road]] which continues onwards to [[Sligo]].\n\nN5 road used to go through the town & there was a little [[traffic congestion]] except at peak times and this is mainly due to the traffic system of the town which has a number of one-way streets and traffic signals before N5 Longford bypass which was opened on 2 July 2012.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.tii.ie/news/press-releases/n5-longford-bypass-opens-/|website=Transport Infrastructure Ireland|title=N5 Longford Bypass \u2013 Opens Friday, August 3rd|access-date=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116183850/http://tii.ie/news/press-releases/n5-longford-bypass-opens-/|archive-date=16 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe N4 Sligo road has a bypass around the town, which consists of single carriageway with hard shoulders and four roundabouts. It was opened on 2 June 1995 and constitutes part of the planned Longford Ring Road which will encircle the town when completed.\n\n===Railway===\nLongford is about {{convert|91|km|mi}} from [[Sligo]] and {{convert|122|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Dublin]]. It lies on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line|Dublin-Sligo line]] of the [[rail transport in Ireland|Irish railway network]], and is served by Sligo-Dublin intercity services. Despite its distance from Dublin, the town also has a regular, well-utilised commuter service to Dublin.  Journeys to [[Dublin Connolly]] by rail generally take about an hour and three-quarters. [[Longford railway station]] opened on 8 November 1855.<ref>{{cite web | title=Longford station | work=Railscot \u2013 Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=5 September 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926042407/http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | archive-date=26 September 2007 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Canals===\nThe [[Royal Canal]] reopened in October 2010 after years of being derelict and overgrown. Navigation is now possible from Spencer Dock, in Dublin, to [[River Shannon|the Shannon]], in Clondra.\n<!-- Deleted file removed [[File:Ab1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Abbeyshrule Airport]] -->\n\n===Bus===\nThere are a large number of bus services to [[Dublin]] and other towns both outside and inside the county provided by both the state ([[Bus \u00c9ireann]]) and private bus companies (Kane's, Donnelly's and Farrelly's.) Third level colleges are well served by the private companies during the academic year.\n\nDonnelly's Pioneer Bus Service, a longstanding local bus company based in [[Granard]], operate a route from Longford to [[Granard]] via [[Ballinalee]].

[[Abbeyshrule Aerodrome]] receives a regular influx of small general aviation aircraft, including the [[Cessna 182]] and [[Cessna 150|150]]. The airport also boasts two flight training centres; one for general aviation fixed wing aircraft training (''Aeroclub 2000'') and one for microlight aircraft flight training (''Ultraflight''). The airport is also the home of the [[Extra 200]] aerobatic aircraft ''EI-SAM'' of acclaimed Irish international competition aerobatics pilot David Bruton.\n\n==Sport==\nThe town has a wide range of sports clubs and facilities including the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], rugby and tennis clubs, a League of Ireland soccer club, two indoor swimming pools, an extensive gym and an 18-hole golf course. A new swimming pool was opened in Longford in 2007.\n\n===Gaelic football and hurling===\nThe sport with most support in County Longford is [[Gaelic football]]. The headquarters of [[Longford GAA|the Longford Gaelic Athletic Association]] is located in Pearse Park in Longford Town, with a ground capacity of around 11,000. The Longford Gaelic football team has been relatively unsuccessful at national level, in large part reflecting the county's small population size \u2013 although it succeeded in winning a Leinster title at Senior level in 1968 and a National League title in 1966. The minor (under-18) Longford county team won the Leinster title in 2002, and recently in 2010, and their teams at under-21 level have reached several Leinster finals over the last few years (including 2006). The major boys' secondary school in Longford town, [[St. Mel's College]], also has a long tradition in secondary schools' football (known as Colleges A), winning 29 Leinster and 4 All-Ireland titles (in the Hogan Cup). At one stage, St. Mel's College had won more Leinster titles than all of the other Leinster colleges put together. The main local GAA Club in Longford is [[Longford Slashers]], based in Longford town, who have won more Senior County Championships(16) than any other team in the county with their most recent success coming in 2013.\n\n[[County Longford]] boasted arguably the best Gaelic football team which did not win the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] in 1968. The team was narrowly beaten by Kerry in the all-Ireland Semi final. The recently deceased T.D. John Wilson and G.A.A. all-Ireland medalist (with County Cavan) starred with St. Mel's College Gaelic football team. St. Mel's also boasted a [[cricket]] team which wore all black rig. St. Mel's holds the peculiar distinction: in the 1966/67 season it held two teams scoreless in Gaelic football. This feat has never been equalled by any other Gaelic football team in history.\n\nLongford Hurling Team struggle to compete with the bigger counties as they only have three hurling teams in the county, Slashers, Wolfe Tones and Clonguish. The county team won the National League Division 3 title in 2002, In 2005 & 2006 they won the Leinster Shield. They won the Lory Meagher Cup, for the first time, in Croke Park on 3 July 2010 and won on a score line of Longford 1 \u2013 20 to Donegal 1 \u2013 12.\n\n===Soccer===\nLongford town itself has a strong tradition in soccer, the game being introduced in the late 19th century. The town was a military base garrison when Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom. [[Longford Town FC|Longford Town football club]] was founded in 1924 and was elected to the [[League of Ireland]] in 1984. The first Longford town football club team to play in the League of Ireland featured Jimmy Savage, Zac Hackett and Liam Madden. In the 1950s and 60s, Longford boasted such players as [[Willie Browne]] (UCD and Bohemian FC) who won 3 full international Republic of Ireland caps and captained Bohemian FC for 3 consecutive seasons, he made 177 appearances for Bohs in all competitions scoring 20 goals, Lal Donlon (Longford town and Arsenal), Mel 'Garrincha' Mulligan, John 'Hooky' O'Connor and the legendary Billy Clarke. Billy Clarke is arguably Longford's most famous football player to date. The Longford Town football club ground is at [[City Calling Stadium]], in the townland of Mullolagher, to the west of the town, on the [[Strokestown]] Road. Previously, the club was based in the north of Abbeycarton town. The Longford Town football club has had notable success in recent years, twice winning the [[FAI Cup]], in 2003 and 2004, and competing in the [[UEFA Cup]] as a result against Bulgarian, [[Liechtenstein]] and Welsh opposition, though without success.\n\n===Other sports===\nFor golfers, Longford has an extensive parkland course. Also within a 50&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) radius of the county, one can play quality championship courses such as the [[Nick Faldo]]-designed Lough Rynn, [[Glassan]] and the Slieve Russell.\n\nLongford is represented in basketball by two clubs. Torpedo's were formed in 1973 and have competed in the Meath, Cavan, Mid-lands and National leagues. The club have been very successful over the years and recently represented Longford in the Flanders Basketball Tournament in Ghent, Belgium. They now play in the Shannon Side League in Men's and North East League in Ladies'. Ladies and Men's teams play home games in Edgeworthstown. They hold an annual tournament at the end September start of October each season with 16 teams from all over Ireland and the UK entering. The second club which was a break away unit of the Torpedo's are Longford Falcons. The club has had numerous Leinster and national titles won at the junior level. The club is based at the Mall Sports Complex, in the east of the town.\n\nLongford town also hosts [[Rugby Union|rugby]] club, [[Longford RFC]] whose grounds are located at Demesne, in the north of the town, and who participate in the [[Leinster League]].\n\nLongford has an extensive sports complex/amenity, known locally as The Mall. The complex contains a swimming pool, gym, both indoor and outdoor football and basketball grounds and there is also new outdoor gym equipment all around the mall. The Mall itself is a popular walking spot in the town, a lap of which is approximately 2&nbsp;km.\n\n==People==\n\n*[[Frank E.

of [[County Longford]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It has a population of 10,008 according to the 2016 census.<ref name=\"sapmap2016\"/> It is the biggest town in the county and about one third of the county's population lives there. Longford lies at the meeting of Ireland's N4 and N5 National Primary Route roads, which means that traffic traveling between [[Dublin]] and [[County Mayo]], or North County Roscommon passes around the town. The [[Train station|station]] in  [[Longford railway station|Longford]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line|Dublin-Sligo line]] is important for commuters.\n\n==History==\nThe town is built on the banks of the [[River Camlin]] ({{Irish derived place name|Camlinn|crooked pool}}), which is a tributary of the [[River Shannon]]. The name Longford is an Anglicization of the Irish ''[[Longphort]]'', from ''long'' (meaning \"ship\") and ''port'' (meaning \"port\" or \"dock\"). This name was applied to many Irish settlements of Viking origin and eventually came to mean fort or camp in the Irish language, and so ''Longfort'' the modern Irish spelling, is the name of this town, which was one of the only Gaelic Irish market towns to arise without first being founded by Vikings or Normans.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe area came under the sway of the local clan which controlled the south and middle of the County of Longford (historically called ''[[Anghaile]]'' or {{Not a typo|Annaly}}) and hence, the town is sometimes called ''Longfort U\u00ed Fhearghail'' (fort/stronghold of O'Farrell).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[priory]] was founded there in 1400.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Places of interest==\nThe [[Corlea Trackway]] Visitor Centre is located near to Longford, in [[Keenagh]]. The Centre houses an [[Iron Age]] bog road which was built in 148 BC across the boglands in proximity to the [[River Shannon]]. The oak road is the largest of its kind to have been uncovered in Europe and was excavated over the years by Professor Barry Raftery of [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|University College Dublin]]. Inside the building, an 18-metre stretch of preserved road is on permanent display in a specially designed hall with humidifiers to prevent the ancient wood from cracking in the heat. [[Bord na Mona]] and the Heritage Service have carried out conservation work on the surrounding bog to ensure that it remains wet and that the buried road is preserved. There are other historical artifacts and some exhibits at the centre.\n[[File:Longford Railway Station - geograph.ie - 919117.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Longford Railway Station]]\n[[St. Mel's Cathedral]] in the town features several stained glass windows by Harry Clarke studios. These include one of his earliest works ''The consecration of St. Mel as Bishop of Longford'' which was exhibited at the RDS Annual Art Industries Exhibition in 1910, where it received second prize.

It reopened for services at midnight mass on Christmas Eve 2014 and has since become a significant tourist attraction. The two most intricated stained-glass windows in the transepts of the Cathedral have been faithfully restored \u2013 these depict St Anne and the Resurrection.\n\nLongford town boasts a state-of-the-art 212-seat theatre called Backstage Theatre just outside of the town, and a four-screen multiplex cinema, with restaurants. The mix and quality of housing is extensive and the Rural Renewal Hi Scheme (1999\u20132006) has ensured that a steady supply of residential development has come about. Longford town has a decentralized government department which employs approximately 300 people and a further 130 are employed at the Irish Prison Service's headquarters in the Lisamuck area of the town. The Prison Service HQ boasts a sculpture by renowned artist Remco de Fou which, apart from the Spire in Dublin is the largest piece of sculpture in Ireland.

It is the major services centre for the county as well as the location of the Department of Social Welfare and the Irish Prison Service. The town is also a local commercial centre, with many retail outlets including multiples such as [[Tesco Ireland|Tesco]], [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] and [[Homestore and more]], German [[discount retailer]]s, [[Aldi]] and [[Lidl]] and Irish retail outlets such as [[Dunnes Stores]] and [[Primark|Penneys]].\n\nUp until 2007, construction was a major local employer, mainly due to government tax breaks for property development provided under the Rural Renewal scheme. However the downturn in the construction industry, the withdrawal of Rural Renewal, and extensive local oversupply of property has caused large job losses in the construction industry and a significant increase in unemployment in the region.\n\n==Education==\nLongford town has a number of primary schools (for ages 4\u201312) and three secondary schools (for ages 12\u201319): two single-sex schools, [[St. Mel's College]], (a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] boys' school) and [[Scoil Mhuire]] (a Catholic girls' school run by the [[Sisters of Mercy]]), as well as a mixed school, ([[Templemichael|Templemichael College]], formerly known as Longford [[Vocational School]]). Primary schools in Longford include a [[Gaelscoil]] and St. Joseph's. An extensive adult education centre exists in Longford.\n\nSt. Mel's College<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stmelscollege.ie/ |title=stmelscollege.ie |access-date=1 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202010156/http://www.stmelscollege.ie/ |archive-date=2 December 2005 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> is the oldest and best-known of these schools, being founded approximately 150 years ago by the [[Roman Catholic Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnois]] as a diocesan seminary to train students for the priesthood. While the school only briefly functioned as a seminary, it served for many years as a boarding school, while also admitting day students. The boarding school was discontinued after 2000 and the school is now only a day school, with the largest student enrolment in county Longford. The College, known locally as ''Mel's'', is best known for its strict rules of conduct and its success on a national level with [[Gaelic football]], athletics, soccer, basketball and [[Rugby union|Rugby]].\n\n==Transport==\n<!-- Deleted file removed [[File:LStation.JPG|thumb|left|Longford Railway Station]] -->\n\n===Road===\nLongford is at the point of divergence of the [[N5 road (Ireland)|N5 road]] to [[Castlebar]]/[[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]]/[[Ireland West Airport Knock]] and the [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4 road]] which continues onwards to [[Sligo]].\n\nN5 road used to go through the town & there was a little [[traffic congestion]] except at peak times and this is mainly due to the traffic system of the town which has a number of one-way streets and traffic signals before N5 Longford bypass which was opened on 3 August 2012.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.tii.ie/news/press-releases/n5-longford-bypass-opens-/|website=Transport Infrastructure Ireland|title=N5 Longford Bypass \u2013 Opens Friday, August 3rd|access-date=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116183850/http://tii.ie/news/press-releases/n5-longford-bypass-opens-/|archive-date=16 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe N4 Sligo road has a bypass around the town, which consists of single carriageway with hard shoulders and four roundabouts.

It lies on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line|Dublin-Sligo line]] of the [[rail transport in Ireland|Irish railway network]], and is served by Sligo-Dublin intercity services. Despite its distance from Dublin, the town also has a regular, well-utilised commuter service to Dublin.  Journeys to [[Dublin Connolly]] by rail generally take about an hour and three-quarters.

[[Abbeyshrule Aerodrome]] receives a regular influx of small general aviation aircraft, including the [[Cessna 182]] and [[Cessna 150|150]]. The airport also boasts two flight training centres; one for general aviation fixed wing aircraft training (''Aeroclub 2000'') and one for microlight aircraft flight training (''Ultraflight''). The airport is also the home of the [[Extra 200]] aerobatic aircraft ''EI-SAM'' of acclaimed Irish international competition aerobatics pilot David Bruton.\n\n==Sport==\nThe town has a wide range of sports clubs and facilities including the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], rugby and tennis clubs, a League of Ireland soccer club, two indoor swimming pools, an extensive gym and an 18-hole golf course. A new swimming pool was opened in Longford in 2007.\n\n===Gaelic football and hurling===\nThe sport with most support in County Longford is [[Gaelic football]]. The headquarters of [[Longford GAA|the Longford Gaelic Athletic Association]] is located in Pearse Park in Longford Town, with a ground capacity of around 11,000. The Longford Gaelic football team has been relatively unsuccessful at national level, in large part reflecting the county's small population size \u2013 although it succeeded in winning a Leinster title at Senior level in 1968 and a National League title in 1966. The minor (under-18) Longford county team won the Leinster title in 2002, and recently in 2010, and their teams at under-21 level have reached several Leinster finals over the last few years (including 2006). The major boys' secondary school in Longford town, [[St. Mel's College]], also has a long tradition in secondary schools' football (known as Colleges A), winning 29 Leinster and 4 All-Ireland titles (in the Hogan Cup). At one stage, St. Mel's College had won more Leinster titles than all of the other Leinster colleges put together. The main local GAA Club in Longford is [[Longford Slashers]], based in Longford town, who have won more Senior County Championships(16) than any other team in the county with their most recent success coming in 2013.\n\n[[County Longford]] boasted arguably the best Gaelic football team which did not win the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] in 1968. The team was narrowly beaten by Kerry in the all-Ireland Semi final. The recently deceased T.D. John Wilson and G.A.A. all-Ireland medalist (with County Cavan) starred with St. Mel's College Gaelic football team. St. Mel's also boasted a [[cricket]] team which wore all black rig. St. Mel's holds the peculiar distinction: in the 1966/67 season it held two teams scoreless in Gaelic football. This feat has never been equalled by any other Gaelic football team in history.\n\nLongford Hurling Team struggle to compete with the bigger counties as they only have three hurling teams in the county, Slashers, Wolfe Tones and Clonguish. The county team won the National League Division 3 title in 2002, In 2005 & 2006 they won the Leinster Shield. They won the Lory Meagher Cup, for the first time, in Croke Park on 3 July 2010 and won on a score line of Longford 1 \u2013 20 to Donegal 1 \u2013 12.\n\n===Soccer===\nLongford town itself has a strong tradition in soccer, the game being introduced in the late 19th century. The town was a military base garrison when Ireland was a part of the United Kingdom. [[Longford Town FC|Longford Town football club]] was founded in 1924 and was elected to the [[League of Ireland]] in 1984. The first Longford town football club team to play in the League of Ireland featured Jimmy Savage, Zac Hackett and Liam Madden. In the 1950s and 60s, Longford boasted such players as [[Willie Browne]] (UCD and Bohemian FC) who won 3 full international Republic of Ireland caps and captained Bohemian FC for 3 consecutive seasons, he made 177 appearances for Bohs in all competitions scoring 20 goals, Lal Donlon (Longford town and Arsenal), Mel 'Garrincha' Mulligan, John 'Hooky' O'Connor and the legendary Billy Clarke. Billy Clarke is arguably Longford's most famous football player to date. The Longford Town football club ground is at [[City Calling Stadium]], in the townland of Mullolagher, to the west of the town, on the [[Strokestown]] Road. Previously, the club was based in the north of Abbeycarton town. The Longford Town football club has had notable success in recent years, twice winning the [[FAI Cup]], in 2003 and 2004, and competing in the [[UEFA Cup]] as a result against Bulgarian, [[Liechtenstein]] and Welsh opposition, though without success.\n\n===Other sports===\nFor golfers, Longford has an extensive parkland course. Also within a 50&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) radius of the county, one can play quality championship courses such as the [[Nick Faldo]]-designed Lough Rynn, [[Glassan]] and the Slieve Russell.\n\nLongford is represented in basketball by two clubs. Torpedo's were formed in 1973 and have competed in the Meath, Cavan, Mid-lands and National leagues. The club have been very successful over the years and recently represented Longford in the Flanders Basketball Tournament in Ghent, Belgium. They now play in the Shannon Side League in Men's and North East League in Ladies'. Ladies and Men's teams play home games in Edgeworthstown. They hold an annual tournament at the end September start of October each season with 16 teams from all over Ireland and the UK entering. The second club which was a break away unit of the Torpedo's are Longford Falcons. The club has had numerous Leinster and national titles won at the junior level. The club is based at the Mall Sports Complex, in the east of the town.\n\nLongford town also hosts [[Rugby Union|rugby]] club, [[Longford RFC]] whose grounds are located at Demesne, in the north of the town, and who participate in the [[Leinster League]].\n\nLongford has an extensive sports complex/amenity, known locally as The Mall. The complex contains a swimming pool, gym, both indoor and outdoor football and basketball grounds and there is also new outdoor gym equipment all around the mall. The Mall itself is a popular walking spot in the town, a lap of which is approximately 2&nbsp;km.\n\n==People==\n\n*[[Frank E.

Audioscrobbler began as a [[computer science]] project of Richard Jones when he attended the [[University of Southampton School of Electronics and Computer Science]] in the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Website offers new view of music |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2888431.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=27 March 2003 |accessdate=25 February 2008 }}</ref> with the term ''scrobbling'' defined as the finding, processing, and distribution of information involving people, music, and other data.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Jones developed the first [[plugins]], and then opened an [[Application programming interface|API]] to the community, after which many music players on different [[operating system]] platforms were supported. Audioscrobbler was limited to keeping track of which songs its users played on a registered computer, which allowed for charting and collaborative filtering.\n\nLast.fm was founded in 2002 by Felix Miller, Martin Stiksel, [[Michael Breidenbruecker]] and Thomas Willomitzer, all of them from [[Germany]] or [[Austria]], as an internet radio station and music community site, using similar music profiles to generate dynamic playlists. The site name takes advantage of a [[domain hack]] using [[.fm]], the [[top level domain]] of [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], popular with [[FM radio]] related sites. The \"love\" and \"ban\" buttons allowed users to gradually customise their profiles. Last.fm won the [[Europrix]] 2002 and was nominated for the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europrix.org/europrix/winners/award/Index.htm |title=EUROPRIX Student Award Winners 2002 |accessdate=3 September 2006 |publisher=EUROPRIX |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718083939/http://www.europrix.org/europrix/winners/award/Index.htm |archivedate=18 July 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Audioscrobbler and Last.fm teams began to work closely together, both teams moving into the same offices in [[Whitechapel]], [[London]], and by 2003 Last.fm was fully integrated with Audioscrobbler profiles. Input could come through an Audioscrobbler plugin or a Last.fm station. The sites also shared many community forums, although a few were unique to each site. The old Audioscrobbler site at the audioscrobbler.com [[domain name]] was wholly merged into the new Last.fm site on 9 August 2005. Audioscrobbler.net was launched as a separate development-oriented site on 5 September 2005. However, at the very bottom of each of the Last.fm pages there was an Audioscrobbler \"[[slogan]]\", which changes each time the page is refreshed. Based on well-known sayings or advertisements, these originally appeared at the top of the Audioscrobbler website pages and were all created and contributed by the original site members.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n[[File:Last.fm icon.png|thumb|140px|The Last.fm icon]]\nAn update to the site was made on 14 July 2006, which included a new [[Application software|software application]] for playing Last.fm radio streams and for logging of tracks played with other media players. Other changes included the improvement of the friends system and updating it to require a [[two-way communication|two-way]] friendship, the addition of the Last.fm \"Dashboard\" where users can see on one page relevant information for their profile, expanded options for purchasing music from [[Online shop|online retailers]] and a new [[Graphic design|visual design]] for the web site (including an optional black [[colour scheme]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The site began expanding its language base on 15 July 2006,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} with a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version.

This automatic track logging is called '''scrobbling'''.\n\nLast.fm automatically generates a profile page for every user which includes basic information such as their user name, avatar, date of registration and total number of tracks played. There is also a [[Shoutbox]] for public messages. Profile pages are visible to all, together with a list of top artists and tracks, and the 10 most recently played tracks (can be expanded). Each user's profile has a 'Taste-o-Meter' which gives a rating of how compatible your music taste is.\n\n====Recommendations====\nLast.fm features a personal recommendations page that is only visible to the user concerned and lists suggested new music and events, all tailored to the user's own preferences. Recommendations are calculated using a [[collaborative filtering]] [[algorithm]] so users can browse and hear previews of a list of artists not listed on their own profile but which appear on those of others with similar musical tastes.\n\n==Artist pages==\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Ihackedlastfm.png|thumb|A screenshot of an artist page which was fabricated by manipulation of ID3 tags; a demonstration of a shortcoming of the system.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 24 September 2007}}]] -->\n\nOnce an artist has had a track or tracks \"scrobbled\" by at least one user, Last.fm automatically generates a main artist page. This page shows details of the total number of plays, the total number of listeners, the most popular weekly and overall tracks, the top weekly listeners, a list of similar artists, most popular tags and a shoutbox for messages. There are also links to events, additional album and individual track pages and similar artists radio. Official music videos and other videos imported from [[YouTube]] may also be viewed on the relevant artist and track pages.\n\nUsers may add relevant biographical details and other information to any artist's main page in the form of a wiki. Edits are regularly moderated to prevent [[vandalism]]. A photograph of the artist may also be added. If more than one is submitted, the most popular is chosen by public vote. User submitted content is licensed for use under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution Share-Alike License and [[GNU Free Documentation License]].\n\nLast.fm currently cannot disambiguate artists with the same name; a single artist profile is shared between valid artists with the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/help/faq/?category=Artist+Pages#448 |title=Last.fm \u2013 The Social Music Revolution |publisher=Last.fm |date= |accessdate=15 October 2008}}</ref> Also Last.fm and its users currently do not differentiate between the Composer and the Artist of music which serves for confusion in classical music genres.\n\n==Charts==\nOne particular feature of Last.fm is the semi-automatic weekly generation and archiving of detailed personal music charts and statistics which are created as part of its profile building. Users have several different charts available, including Top Artists, Top Tracks, and Top Albums. Each of these charts is based on the actual number of people listening to the track, album or artist recorded either through an Audioscrobbler plugin or the Last.fm radio stream.\n\nAdditionally, charts are available for the top tracks by each artist in the Last.fm system as well as the top tracks for individual albums (when the tagging information of the audio file is available). Artist profiles also keep track of a [[short list]] of Top Fans, which is calculated by a formula meant to portray the importance of an artist in a fan's own profile, balancing out users who play hundreds of tracks overall versus those who play only a few.\n\nAs the information generated is largely compiled from the [[ID3]] data from audio files \"scrobbled\" from user's own computers, and which may be incorrect or misspelled, there are many errors in the listings. Tracks with ambiguous punctuation are especially prone to separate listings, which can dilute the apparent popularity of a track. Artists or bands with the same name are not always differentiated. The system attempts to translate some different artist tags to a single artist profile, and has recently attempted to harmonise track names.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Global charts===\nLast.fm generates weekly \"global\" charts of the top 400 artists and tracks listened to by all Last.fm users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/charts/track|title=Find and Browse Music on Last.fm \u2014 Last.fm|access-date=27 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427222625/http://www.last.fm/charts/track|archive-date=27 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe result is notably different from traditional commercial [[music chart]]s provided by the [[UK Top 40]], [[Billboard magazine]], [[Soundscan]] and others, which are based on radio plays or sales. Last.fm charts are less volatile and a new album's release may be reflected in play data for many months or years after it drops out of commercial charts. For example, [[The Beatles]] have consistently been a top 5 band at Last.fm, reflecting the continued popularity of the band's music irrespective of current album sales. Significant events, such as the release of a highly anticipated album or the death of an artist can have a large impact on the charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/charts/artist?charttype=weekly&subtype=artist&range=1245585600-1246190400|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804111005/http://www.last.fm/charts/artist?charttype=weekly&subtype=artist&range=1245585600-1246190400|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-08-04|title=Find and Browse Music on Last.fm \u2014 Last.fm}}</ref>\n\nThe Global Tag Chart shows the 100 most popular tags that have been used to describe artists, albums, and tracks. This is based on the total number of times the tag has been applied by Last.fm users since the tagging system was first introduced and does not necessarily reflect the number of users currently listening to any of the related \"global tag radio\" stations.\n\n==Radio stations==\nLast.fm offers customised virtual \"radio stations\" consisting of uninterrupted audio streams of individual tracks selected from the music files in the music library.\n\nStations can be based on the user's [[Personal Profile|personal profile]], the user's \"musical neighbours\", or the user's \"friends\". Tags also have radio stations if enough music has the same tag. Radio stations can also be created [[on the fly]], and each artist page allows selection of a \"similar artists\" or \"artist fan\" radio station. As of May 2009, Last.fm introduced Visual Radio, an improved version of last.fm radio. This brought features such as an artist slideshow and combo stations, which allows for listening to stations consisting of common similar artists of up to either 3 artists or 3 tags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/05/06/lastfm-visual-radio |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Last.fm Visual Radio |publisher=Last.fm |date=6 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nUnder the terms of the station's \"radio\" license, listeners may not select specific tracks (except as previews), or choose the order in which they are played, although any of the tracks played may be skipped or banned completely. The appropriate royalties are paid to the copyright holders of all streamed audio tracks according to the law in the UK. The radio stream uses an [[MP3]] stream encoded at 128 kbit/s 44.1&nbsp;kHz, which may be played using the in-page [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] player or the downloaded Last.fm client, but other community-supported players are available as well as a proxy which allows using a media player of choice.\n\nOn 24 March 2009, Last.fm announced that Last.fm Radio will require a subscription of \u20ac3.00 per month for users living outside the US, the UK, and Germany.<ref name=\"announcement1\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Last.fm Radio Announcement |publisher=Blog.last.fm |date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> This change was to take effect on 30 March,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement#c007524 |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Last.fm Radio Announcement |publisher=Blog.last.fm |date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> but was postponed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/30/radio-announcement-revisited |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Radio Announcement Revisited |publisher=Blog.last.fm |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> until 22 April.

However, it is necessary to download and install the Last.fm client if a user also wishes information about played tracks from their own digital music collection to be included in their personal music profile.\n\nPrior to August 2005, Last.fm generated an open [[Streaming media|stream]] that could be played in the user's music player of choice, with a [[Web application|browser-based]] player [[Control panel (computer)|control panel]]. This proved difficult to support and has been officially discontinued. The Last.fm client is currently the only officially supported music player for playing customized Last.fm radio streams on desktop computers. The current version combines the functions of the music player with the plugin that transmits all track data to the Last.fm server, and effectively replaces the separate Last.fm Player and the standalone track submission plugins. It is also [[free software]] licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and available for [[Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems.\n\nThe player allows the user to enter the name of any artist or tag which then gives a choice of a number of similar artist stations, or similar global tag stations. Alternatively, Recommendation radio or any of the user's personal radio stations may be played without the necessity to visit the website.\n\nThe player displays the name of the station and track currently playing, the song artist, title and track length as well as album details, the artist's photo and biographical details, [[album cover]] art when available, lists of similar artists and the most popular tags and top fans. There are several buttons, allowing the user to ''love'', ''skip'', or ''ban'' a song. The ''love'' button adds the song to the user's ''loved tracks'' list; the ''ban'' button ensures that the song will not be played again. Both features affect the user's profile. The ''skip'' button does not. Other buttons allow the user to tag or recommend the currently playing track. Other features offered by the application are: minor editing of the user's profile including removing recently played artists and songs from the loved, banned, or previously played track lists; lists of friends and neighbours, lists of tags and a list of previously played radio stations. Users can also open their full Last.fm profile page directly from the player.\n\nThe client also enables the user to install player plugins, these integrate with various standalone [[media player (application software)|media player]]s to allow the submission of tracks played in those programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/group/Audioscrobbler+Beta/forum/30705/_/95809 |title=Last.fm forum: Read this to get started (old beta!) |accessdate=3 September 2006 |last=J\u00e4levik |first=Erik |date=3 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn the latest version of the Last.fm Player application, the user can select to use an external player. When this is done, the Last.fm Player provides the user with a local URL, through which the Last.fm music stream is proxied. Users can then open the URL in their preferred media player.\n\nA new version of the desktop client, which had been in beta since early 2012, was released on 15 January 2013. This version disabled the radio function for free users. To access that feature, a paid subscription is necessary.\n\nLast.fm has also developed client software for mobile phones running the iPhone OS, BlackBerry OS and the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] OS. Last.fm has only released these apps in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany claiming for four years that they are negotiating licenses for making the streaming available in other countries..\n\nLast.fm remained out of service for more than 22 hours on 10 June 2014. It was amongst the worst outages company has faced. The company however, remained in contact with visitors using a status page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issitedownrightnow.com/status/last.fm|title=Is Last.fm Down Right Now? - Last.fm not working|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Scrobbling==\nIn addition to Last.fm automatically tracking music played via Last.fm's radio, users can also contribute (scrobble) listening data to their Last.fm profile from other streaming sites or by tracking music played locally on their own personal devices. Scrobbling is possible with music stored and played locally via software on devices such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and standalone (hardware) media players. Indeed, these were the only methods of scrobbling listening data both before and after the existence of the Last.fm radio service. Certain sites and media players have the ability to upload (scrobble) listening data built-in, for others users must [[download]] and install a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for their music player, which will automatically submit the artist and title of the [[song]] after either [[half]] the song or the first four minutes have played, whichever comes first. When the track is shorter than 30 seconds (31 seconds in [[iTunes]]) or the track lacks [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] ([[ID3]], [[CDDB]], etc.), the track is not submitted. To accommodate dial-up users, [[web cache|caching]] of the data and submitting it in bulk is also possible.\n\n=== List of supported media players and streaming sites ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Kingdom]] in 2002. Using a music [[recommender system]] called \"Audioscrobbler\", Last.fm builds a detailed profile of each user's musical taste by recording details of the [[Music download|track]]s the user listens to, either from [[Internet radio]] stations, or the user's computer or [[#Supported audio players (hardware)|many portable music devices]]. This information is transferred (\"scrobbled\") to Last.fm's database either via the music player itself (including, among others [[Spotify]], [[Deezer]], [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], and [[MusicBee]]) or via a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] installed into the user's [[Audio player (software)|music player]]. The data is then displayed on the user's profile page and compiled to create reference pages for individual artists.\n\nOn 30 May 2007, it was acquired by [[CBS Interactive]] for [[Pound sterling|UK\u00a3]]140 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]280 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9021918|title=CBS ups social networking ante with Last.fm acquisition|accessdate=26 May 2008|date=30 May 2007|website=Computerworld|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116063155/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9021918|archivedate=16 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe site formerly offered a radio streaming service, which was discontinued on 28 April 2014.<ref name=\"2014change\"/> The ability to access the large catalogue of music stored on the site was later removed entirely, replaced by links to YouTube and Spotify where available.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://getsatisfaction.com/lastfm/topics/artists-and-labels-how-to-make-the-most-of-last-fm|title=Artists and Labels: How to make the most of Last.fm {{!}} Last.fm Support Community|website=getsatisfaction.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Audioscrobbler and Last.fm (2002\u20132006)===\n[[File:Felix Miller.jpg|thumb|left|Felix Miller, one of the Last.fm founders]]\n\nThe current Last.fm website was developed from two separate sources: ''Last.fm'' and ''Audioscrobbler'', which were merged in 2005. Audioscrobbler began as a [[computer science]] project of Richard Jones when he attended the [[University of Southampton School of Electronics and Computer Science]] in the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Website offers new view of music |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2888431.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=27 March 2003 |accessdate=25 February 2008 }}</ref> with the term ''scrobbling'' defined as the finding, processing, and distribution of information involving people, music, and other data.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Jones developed the first [[plugins]], and then opened an [[Application programming interface|API]] to the community, after which many music players on different [[operating system]] platforms were supported. Audioscrobbler was limited to keeping track of which songs its users played on a registered computer, which allowed for charting and collaborative filtering.\n\nLast.fm was founded in 2002 by Felix Miller, Martin Stiksel, [[Michael Breidenbruecker]] and Thomas Willomitzer, all of them from [[Germany]] or [[Austria]], as an internet radio station and music community site, using similar music profiles to generate dynamic playlists. The site name takes advantage of a [[domain hack]] using [[.fm]], the [[top level domain]] of [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], popular with [[FM radio]] related sites. The \"love\" and \"ban\" buttons allowed users to gradually customise their profiles. Last.fm won the [[Europrix]] 2002 and was nominated for the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europrix.org/europrix/winners/award/Index.htm |title=EUROPRIX Student Award Winners 2002 |accessdate=3 September 2006 |publisher=EUROPRIX |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718083939/http://www.europrix.org/europrix/winners/award/Index.htm |archivedate=18 July 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Audioscrobbler and Last.fm teams began to work closely together, both teams moving into the same offices in [[Whitechapel]], [[London]], and by 2003 Last.fm was fully integrated with Audioscrobbler profiles. Input could come through an Audioscrobbler plugin or a Last.fm station. The sites also shared many community forums, although a few were unique to each site. The old Audioscrobbler site at the audioscrobbler.com [[domain name]] was wholly merged into the new Last.fm site on 9 August 2005. Audioscrobbler.net was launched as a separate development-oriented site on 5 September 2005. However, at the very bottom of each of the Last.fm pages there was an Audioscrobbler \"[[slogan]]\", which changes each time the page is refreshed. Based on well-known sayings or advertisements, these originally appeared at the top of the Audioscrobbler website pages and were all created and contributed by the original site members.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n[[File:Last.fm icon.png|thumb|140px|The Last.fm icon]]\nAn update to the site was made on 14 July 2006, which included a new [[Application software|software application]] for playing Last.fm radio streams and for logging of tracks played with other media players. Other changes included the improvement of the friends system and updating it to require a [[two-way communication|two-way]] friendship, the addition of the Last.fm \"Dashboard\" where users can see on one page relevant information for their profile, expanded options for purchasing music from [[Online shop|online retailers]] and a new [[Graphic design|visual design]] for the web site (including an optional black [[colour scheme]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The site began expanding its language base on 15 July 2006,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} with a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version.

Registered Users are also able to send and receive private messages.\n\n====Profile====\nA Last.fm user can build a musical profile using any or all of several methods: by listening to their personal music collection on a music player application on a computer or an iPod with an [[#Audioscrobbler plugin|Audioscrobbler plugin]], or by listening to the Last.fm [[internet radio]] service, either with the [[#Last.fm client|Last.fm client]], or with the embedded player. All songs played are added to a [[Data logging|log]] from which personal top artist/track [[bar chart]]s and musical recommendations are [[Calculation|calculated]]. This automatic track logging is called '''scrobbling'''.\n\nLast.fm automatically generates a profile page for every user which includes basic information such as their user name, avatar, date of registration and total number of tracks played. There is also a [[Shoutbox]] for public messages. Profile pages are visible to all, together with a list of top artists and tracks, and the 10 most recently played tracks (can be expanded). Each user's profile has a 'Taste-o-Meter' which gives a rating of how compatible your music taste is.\n\n====Recommendations====\nLast.fm features a personal recommendations page that is only visible to the user concerned and lists suggested new music and events, all tailored to the user's own preferences. Recommendations are calculated using a [[collaborative filtering]] [[algorithm]] so users can browse and hear previews of a list of artists not listed on their own profile but which appear on those of others with similar musical tastes.\n\n==Artist pages==\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Ihackedlastfm.png|thumb|A screenshot of an artist page which was fabricated by manipulation of ID3 tags; a demonstration of a shortcoming of the system.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 24 September 2007}}]] -->\n\nOnce an artist has had a track or tracks \"scrobbled\" by at least one user, Last.fm automatically generates a main artist page. This page shows details of the total number of plays, the total number of listeners, the most popular weekly and overall tracks, the top weekly listeners, a list of similar artists, most popular tags and a shoutbox for messages. There are also links to events, additional album and individual track pages and similar artists radio. Official music videos and other videos imported from [[YouTube]] may also be viewed on the relevant artist and track pages.\n\nUsers may add relevant biographical details and other information to any artist's main page in the form of a wiki. Edits are regularly moderated to prevent [[vandalism]]. A photograph of the artist may also be added. If more than one is submitted, the most popular is chosen by public vote. User submitted content is licensed for use under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution Share-Alike License and [[GNU Free Documentation License]].\n\nLast.fm currently cannot disambiguate artists with the same name; a single artist profile is shared between valid artists with the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/help/faq/?category=Artist+Pages#448 |title=Last.fm \u2013 The Social Music Revolution |publisher=Last.fm |date= |accessdate=15 October 2008}}</ref> Also Last.fm and its users currently do not differentiate between the Composer and the Artist of music which serves for confusion in classical music genres.\n\n==Charts==\nOne particular feature of Last.fm is the semi-automatic weekly generation and archiving of detailed personal music charts and statistics which are created as part of its profile building. Users have several different charts available, including Top Artists, Top Tracks, and Top Albums. Each of these charts is based on the actual number of people listening to the track, album or artist recorded either through an Audioscrobbler plugin or the Last.fm radio stream.\n\nAdditionally, charts are available for the top tracks by each artist in the Last.fm system as well as the top tracks for individual albums (when the tagging information of the audio file is available). Artist profiles also keep track of a [[short list]] of Top Fans, which is calculated by a formula meant to portray the importance of an artist in a fan's own profile, balancing out users who play hundreds of tracks overall versus those who play only a few.\n\nAs the information generated is largely compiled from the [[ID3]] data from audio files \"scrobbled\" from user's own computers, and which may be incorrect or misspelled, there are many errors in the listings. Tracks with ambiguous punctuation are especially prone to separate listings, which can dilute the apparent popularity of a track. Artists or bands with the same name are not always differentiated. The system attempts to translate some different artist tags to a single artist profile, and has recently attempted to harmonise track names.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n===Global charts===\nLast.fm generates weekly \"global\" charts of the top 400 artists and tracks listened to by all Last.fm users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/charts/track|title=Find and Browse Music on Last.fm \u2014 Last.fm|access-date=27 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427222625/http://www.last.fm/charts/track|archive-date=27 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe result is notably different from traditional commercial [[music chart]]s provided by the [[UK Top 40]], [[Billboard magazine]], [[Soundscan]] and others, which are based on radio plays or sales. Last.fm charts are less volatile and a new album's release may be reflected in play data for many months or years after it drops out of commercial charts. For example, [[The Beatles]] have consistently been a top 5 band at Last.fm, reflecting the continued popularity of the band's music irrespective of current album sales. Significant events, such as the release of a highly anticipated album or the death of an artist can have a large impact on the charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/charts/artist?charttype=weekly&subtype=artist&range=1245585600-1246190400|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804111005/http://www.last.fm/charts/artist?charttype=weekly&subtype=artist&range=1245585600-1246190400|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-08-04|title=Find and Browse Music on Last.fm \u2014 Last.fm}}</ref>\n\nThe Global Tag Chart shows the 100 most popular tags that have been used to describe artists, albums, and tracks. This is based on the total number of times the tag has been applied by Last.fm users since the tagging system was first introduced and does not necessarily reflect the number of users currently listening to any of the related \"global tag radio\" stations.\n\n==Radio stations==\nLast.fm offers customised virtual \"radio stations\" consisting of uninterrupted audio streams of individual tracks selected from the music files in the music library.\n\nStations can be based on the user's [[Personal Profile|personal profile]], the user's \"musical neighbours\", or the user's \"friends\". Tags also have radio stations if enough music has the same tag. Radio stations can also be created [[on the fly]], and each artist page allows selection of a \"similar artists\" or \"artist fan\" radio station. As of May 2009, Last.fm introduced Visual Radio, an improved version of last.fm radio. This brought features such as an artist slideshow and combo stations, which allows for listening to stations consisting of common similar artists of up to either 3 artists or 3 tags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/05/06/lastfm-visual-radio |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Last.fm Visual Radio |publisher=Last.fm |date=6 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nUnder the terms of the station's \"radio\" license, listeners may not select specific tracks (except as previews), or choose the order in which they are played, although any of the tracks played may be skipped or banned completely. The appropriate royalties are paid to the copyright holders of all streamed audio tracks according to the law in the UK. The radio stream uses an [[MP3]] stream encoded at 128 kbit/s 44.1&nbsp;kHz, which may be played using the in-page [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] player or the downloaded Last.fm client, but other community-supported players are available as well as a proxy which allows using a media player of choice.\n\nOn 24 March 2009, Last.fm announced that Last.fm Radio will require a subscription of \u20ac3.00 per month for users living outside the US, the UK, and Germany.<ref name=\"announcement1\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Last.fm Radio Announcement |publisher=Blog.last.fm |date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> This change was to take effect on 30 March,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement#c007524 |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Last.fm Radio Announcement |publisher=Blog.last.fm |date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> but was postponed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/30/radio-announcement-revisited |title=Last.fm \u2013 the Blog \u00b7 Radio Announcement Revisited |publisher=Blog.last.fm |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> until 22 April.

However, it is necessary to download and install the Last.fm client if a user also wishes information about played tracks from their own digital music collection to be included in their personal music profile.\n\nPrior to August 2005, Last.fm generated an open [[Streaming media|stream]] that could be played in the user's music player of choice, with a [[Web application|browser-based]] player [[Control panel (computer)|control panel]]. This proved difficult to support and has been officially discontinued. The Last.fm client is currently the only officially supported music player for playing customized Last.fm radio streams on desktop computers. The current version combines the functions of the music player with the plugin that transmits all track data to the Last.fm server, and effectively replaces the separate Last.fm Player and the standalone track submission plugins. It is also [[free software]] licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and available for [[Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems.\n\nThe player allows the user to enter the name of any artist or tag which then gives a choice of a number of similar artist stations, or similar global tag stations. Alternatively, Recommendation radio or any of the user's personal radio stations may be played without the necessity to visit the website.\n\nThe player displays the name of the station and track currently playing, the song artist, title and track length as well as album details, the artist's photo and biographical details, [[album cover]] art when available, lists of similar artists and the most popular tags and top fans. There are several buttons, allowing the user to ''love'', ''skip'', or ''ban'' a song. The ''love'' button adds the song to the user's ''loved tracks'' list; the ''ban'' button ensures that the song will not be played again. Both features affect the user's profile. The ''skip'' button does not. Other buttons allow the user to tag or recommend the currently playing track. Other features offered by the application are: minor editing of the user's profile including removing recently played artists and songs from the loved, banned, or previously played track lists; lists of friends and neighbours, lists of tags and a list of previously played radio stations. Users can also open their full Last.fm profile page directly from the player.\n\nThe client also enables the user to install player plugins, these integrate with various standalone [[media player (application software)|media player]]s to allow the submission of tracks played in those programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/group/Audioscrobbler+Beta/forum/30705/_/95809 |title=Last.fm forum: Read this to get started (old beta!) |accessdate=3 September 2006 |last=J\u00e4levik |first=Erik |date=3 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn the latest version of the Last.fm Player application, the user can select to use an external player. When this is done, the Last.fm Player provides the user with a local URL, through which the Last.fm music stream is proxied. Users can then open the URL in their preferred media player.\n\nA new version of the desktop client, which had been in beta since early 2012, was released on 15 January 2013. This version disabled the radio function for free users. To access that feature, a paid subscription is necessary.\n\nLast.fm has also developed client software for mobile phones running the iPhone OS, BlackBerry OS and the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] OS. Last.fm has only released these apps in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany claiming for four years that they are negotiating licenses for making the streaming available in other countries..\n\nLast.fm remained out of service for more than 22 hours on 10 June 2014. It was amongst the worst outages company has faced. The company however, remained in contact with visitors using a status page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issitedownrightnow.com/status/last.fm|title=Is Last.fm Down Right Now? - Last.fm not working|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Scrobbling==\nIn addition to Last.fm automatically tracking music played via Last.fm's radio, users can also contribute (scrobble) listening data to their Last.fm profile from other streaming sites or by tracking music played locally on their own personal devices. Scrobbling is possible with music stored and played locally via software on devices such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets, and standalone (hardware) media players. Indeed, these were the only methods of scrobbling listening data both before and after the existence of the Last.fm radio service. Certain sites and media players have the ability to upload (scrobble) listening data built-in, for others users must [[download]] and install a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for their music player, which will automatically submit the artist and title of the [[song]] after either [[half]] the song or the first four minutes have played, whichever comes first. When the track is shorter than 30 seconds (31 seconds in [[iTunes]]) or the track lacks [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] ([[ID3]], [[CDDB]], etc.), the track is not submitted. To accommodate dial-up users, [[web cache|caching]] of the data and submitting it in bulk is also possible.\n\n=== List of supported media players and streaming sites ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Track plays are counted using iTunes's system of registering a play if the last 5 seconds of a track are listened to, as opposed to Last.fm's conventional method which scrobbles a play once 50% of a track has elapsed. When the iPod syncs with iTunes, play count data is transferred, which is then extracted by the Last.fm software. iScrobble is a realtime Scrobbler that doesn't require a jailbreak and supports non-realtime and realtime background Scrobbling direct from iDevices. iScrob is a realtime backgrounding Scrobbler that doesn't require a jailbreak.\n*[[Rhythmbox]]'s plugin supports iPod scrobbling\n*Smartphones running Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system using the Last.fm app which is a free download from the Google Play Store.\n*Microsoft [[Zune]] via Zuse\n*Smartphones using [[Windows Phone]] OS.\n*[[Nokia N900]] (mafw-lastfm plugin for [[Maemo]] 5 devices like the Nokia N900)\n*Mobbler for Symbian smartphones.
