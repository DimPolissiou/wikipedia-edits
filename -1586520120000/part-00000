{"title_page": "Standing asanas", "text_new": "[[File:Ganga Mahabalipuram2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The rock relief \"[[Descent of the Ganges (Mahabalipuram)|Descent of the Ganges]]\" at [[Mahabalipuram]] appears to show a person standing in [[Vrikshasana]] (tree pose) at top left.<ref name=\"Krucoff 2007\">{{cite web |last1=Krucoff |first1=Carol |title=Find Your Roots in Tree Pose |url=https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/find-your-roots |publisher=[[Yoga Journal]] |date=28 August 2007}}</ref> 7th century]]\nThe '''standing asanas''' are the yoga poses or [[asana]]s with one or both feet on the ground, and the body more or less upright. They are among the most distinctive features of modern [[yoga as exercise]]. Until the 20th century there were very few of these, the best example being [[Vrikshasana]], Tree Pose. From the time of [[Krishnamacharya]] in [[Mysore]], many standing poses have been created. Two major sources of these asanas have been identified: the exercise sequence [[Surya Namaskar]] (the salute to the sun); and the [[gymnastics]] widely practised in India at the time, based on the prevailing [[physical culture]].\n\nThe origin of standing asanas has been controversial since [[Mark Singleton (yoga scholar)|Mark Singleton]] argued in 2010 that some forms of modern yoga represent a radical reworking of [[hatha yoga]], in particular by adding standing asanas and transitions ([[vinyasa]]s) between them, and by suppressing most non-postural aspects of [[yoga]], rather than a smooth continuation of ancient traditions. These changes enabled yoga to be practised as a flowing sequence of movements rather than as static poses, and in turn this allowed sessions to focus on [[aerobic exercise]].\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Prajnaparamita]] seated in [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] for [[meditation]], Java. 13th century]]\n\n[[Yoga]] is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Its [[Yoga (philosophy)|spiritual and philosophical goal]] was to unite the human spirit with the [[\u012b\u015bvara|Divine]]; its practices were mainly meditative.<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams, Monier]], \"Yoga\", ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.</ref> The branch of yoga that makes use of physical postures in addition to other practices such as meditation and purifications is [[hatha yoga]]; it flourished from the 11th century. The term \"Yoga\" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga, [[yoga as exercise]], consisting largely of the postures called [[asana]]s. The earliest asanas were cross-legged [[meditation seat]]s; other postures were gradually added.{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|pp=770-772}}\n\n==In hatha yoga==\n{{further|Hatha yoga}}\n\nAmong the few standing poses definitely practised in [[hatha yoga]] before the 20th century is [[Vrikshasana]], tree pose. It is described in the 17th century hatha yoga text ''[[Ghera\u1e47\u1e0da Sa\u1e43hit\u0101]]'' 2.36. It may be far older than that; a 7th-century stone carving in [[Mahabalipuram]] appears to contain a figure standing on one leg, perhaps indicating that a pose similar to Vrikshasana was in use at that time. It is said that [[sadhu]]s disciplined themselves by choosing to meditate in the pose.<ref name=\"Krucoff 2007\"/>\n\n[[File:Indian-dancer-nataraja.png|thumb|upright|Natarajasana in [[Bharatanatyam]] classical Indian dance]]\n\nSome other standing poses have been suspected of having medieval origins, without reliable evidence. One difficulty is naming; the existence of a medieval pose with the name of a current standing pose is not proof that the two are the same, as the names given to poses may change, and the same name may be used for different poses. For example, the name [[Garudasana]], Eagle Pose, is used for a sitting pose in the late 17th-century [[Gheranda Samhita]], verse 2.37.<ref>Rai Bahadur Srisa Chandra Vasu (translator) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140124005530/http://brihaspati.net/downloads/Gheranda_Samhita_S_C_Vasu.pdf Gheranda Samhita]</ref> The name Garudasana is given to a pose close to Vrikshasana in the 19th century ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]''; the modern standing pose named Garudasana is not seen until the 20th century.{{sfn|Sjoman|1999|pp=75 and plate 7, pose 39}}{{sfn|Iyengar|1991|pp=97-98}}\n\nAnother issue is the use that is made of a pose; the existence of a pose in medieval times is not proof that it was used in hatha yoga. For example, [[Natarajasana]], the pose of Dancing [[Shiva]], is depicted in 13th - 18th century [[Bharatnatyam]] dance statues of the Eastern [[Gopuram]], [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram]], implying, according to Ananda Bhavanani, that the pose was used in medieval hatha yoga and that there was a cultural interchange between yoga and dance.<ref name=\"Bhavanani 2001\">{{cite web |last1=Bhavanani |first1=Ananda Balayogi |last2=Bhavanani |first2=Devasena |title=Bharatanatyam and Yoga |url=http://www.dhdi.free.fr/recherches/horizonsinterculturels/articles/bharatanatyamyoga.htm |date=2001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023215608/http://www.dhdi.free.fr/recherches/horizonsinterculturels/articles/bharatanatyamyoga.htm |archivedate=23 October 2006}}</ref> However, [[Elliott Goldberg]] observes that Natarajasana is not found in any medieval hatha yoga text, nor is it mentioned by any pre-20th century traveller to India, nor is it found in artistic depictions of yoga such as the ''Sritattvanidhi'' or the Mahamandir near Jodhpur. Goldberg argues that the pose was among the many introduced into modern yoga by [[Krishnamacharya]] in the early 20th century, and taken up by his pupils such as [[B. K. S. Iyengar]], who made the pose a signature of modern yoga.<ref>{{cite book | last=Goldberg | first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Goldberg | title=The Path of Modern Yoga : the history of an embodied spiritual practice | publisher=Inner Traditions | publication-place=Rochester, Vermont | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-62055-567-5 | oclc=926062252 | pages=223, 395\u2013398}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Utkatasana in Sritattvanidhi by Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar.png|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Utkatasana]] shown as a low [[squatting pose]] in the 19th century ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]'' in [[Mysore Palace]]; the modern pose is a standing squat.]]\n\nAnother case is [[Utkatasana]], sometimes called chair pose, though its name, ''Utkata'', means \"fierce\". In modern yoga, it is indeed a challenging squatting pose with the thighs approaching the horizontal,<ref name=\"YB\">{{cite web |title=Chair {{!}} Utkatasana |url=http://www.yogabasics.com/asana/chair/ |publisher=Yoga Basics |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref> whereas in the 19th century ''Sritattvanidhi'' it is illustrated as a low squatting pose with the buttocks resting against the heels; the ''Gheranda Samhita'' II.27 is similar, but the heels are raised.{{sfn|Sjoman|1999|pp=83, plate 17}}\n\n==In yoga as exercise==\n{{further|Yoga as exercise|List of asanas}}\n\nStanding asanas such as [[Adho Mukha Svanasana]] (Downward Dog), [[Virabhadrasana]] (Warrior Pose) and [[Trikonasana]] (Triangle Pose) are a conspicuous feature of the yoga practised around the modern world. Nearly all the standing poses now practised were unknown in [[hatha yoga]] until the 20th century. Many are described in [[B. K. S. Iyengar]]'s 1966 ''[[Light on Yoga]]''.{{sfn|Iyengar|1991|pp=61\u201384}} Some, such as [[Tadasana]], appear in the 1896 ''Vyayama Dipika'', a manual of [[gymnastics]], as part of the \"very old\" sequence of ''danda'' (Sanskrit for \"staff\" or \"stick\") exercises.

They are among the most distinctive features of modern [[yoga as exercise]]. Until the 20th century there were very few of these, the best example being [[Vrikshasana]], Tree Pose. From the time of [[Krishnamacharya]] in [[Mysore]], many standing poses have been created. Two major sources of these asanas have been identified: the exercise sequence [[Surya Namaskar]] (the salute to the sun); and the [[gymnastics]] widely practised in India at the time, based on the prevailing [[physical culture]].\n\nThe origin of standing asanas has been controversial since [[Mark Singleton (yoga scholar)|Mark Singleton]] argued in 2010 that some forms of modern yoga represent a radical reworking of [[hatha yoga]], in particular by adding standing asanas and transitions ([[vinyasa]]s) between them, and by suppressing most non-postural aspects of [[yoga]], rather than a smooth continuation of ancient traditions. These changes enabled yoga to be practised as a flowing sequence of movements rather than as static poses, and in turn this allowed sessions to focus on [[aerobic exercise]].\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Prajnaparamita]] seated in [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] for [[meditation]], Java. 13th century]]\n\n[[Yoga]] is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Its [[Yoga (philosophy)|spiritual and philosophical goal]] was to unite the human spirit with the [[\u012b\u015bvara|Divine]]; its practices were mainly meditative.<ref>[[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams, Monier]], \"Yoga\", ''A Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.</ref> The branch of yoga that makes use of physical postures in addition to other practices such as meditation and purifications is [[hatha yoga]]; it flourished from the 11th century. The term \"Yoga\" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga, [[yoga as exercise]], consisting largely of the postures called [[asana]]s. The earliest asanas were cross-legged [[meditation seat]]s; other postures were gradually added.{{sfn|Mallinson|2011|pp=770-772}}\n\n==In hatha yoga==\n{{further|Hatha yoga}}\n\nAmong the few standing poses definitely practised in [[hatha yoga]] before the 20th century is [[Vrikshasana]], tree pose. It is described in the 17th century hatha yoga text ''[[Ghera\u1e47\u1e0da Sa\u1e43hit\u0101]]'' 2.36. It may be far older than that; a 7th-century stone carving in [[Mahabalipuram]] appears to contain a figure standing on one leg, perhaps indicating that a pose similar to Vrikshasana was in use at that time. It is said that [[sadhu]]s disciplined themselves by choosing to meditate in the pose.<ref name=\"Krucoff 2007\"/>\n\n[[File:Indian-dancer-nataraja.png|thumb|upright|Natarajasana in [[Bharatanatyam]] classical Indian dance]]\n\nSome other standing poses have been suspected of having medieval origins, without reliable evidence. One difficulty is naming; the existence of a medieval pose with the name of a current standing pose is not proof that the two are the same, as the names given to poses may change, and the same name may be used for different poses. For example, the name [[Garudasana]], Eagle Pose, is used for a sitting pose in the late 17th-century [[Gheranda Samhita]], verse 2.37.<ref>Rai Bahadur Srisa Chandra Vasu (translator) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140124005530/http://brihaspati.net/downloads/Gheranda_Samhita_S_C_Vasu.pdf Gheranda Samhita]</ref> The name Garudasana is given to a pose close to Vrikshasana in the 19th century ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]''; the modern standing pose named Garudasana is not seen until the 20th century.{{sfn|Sjoman|1999|pp=75 and plate 7, pose 39}}{{sfn|Iyengar|1991|pp=97-98}}\n\nAnother issue is the use that is made of a pose; the existence of a pose in medieval times is not proof that it was used in hatha yoga. For example, [[Natarajasana]], the pose of Dancing [[Shiva]], is depicted in 13th - 18th century [[Bharatnatyam]] dance statues of the Eastern [[Gopuram]], [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram]], implying, according to Ananda Bhavanani, that the pose was used in medieval hatha yoga and that there was a cultural interchange between yoga and dance.<ref name=\"Bhavanani 2001\">{{cite web |last1=Bhavanani |first1=Ananda Balayogi |last2=Bhavanani |first2=Devasena |title=Bharatanatyam and Yoga |url=http://www.dhdi.free.fr/recherches/horizonsinterculturels/articles/bharatanatyamyoga.htm |date=2001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023215608/http://www.dhdi.free.fr/recherches/horizonsinterculturels/articles/bharatanatyamyoga.htm |archivedate=23 October 2006}}</ref> However, [[Elliott Goldberg]] observes that Natarajasana is not found in any medieval hatha yoga text, nor is it mentioned by any pre-20th century traveller to India, nor is it found in artistic depictions of yoga such as the ''Sritattvanidhi'' or the Mahamandir near Jodhpur. Goldberg argues that the pose was among the many introduced into modern yoga by [[Krishnamacharya]] in the early 20th century, and taken up by his pupils such as [[B. K. S. Iyengar]], who made the pose a signature of modern yoga.<ref>{{cite book | last=Goldberg | first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Goldberg | title=The Path of Modern Yoga : the history of an embodied spiritual practice | publisher=Inner Traditions | publication-place=Rochester, Vermont | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-62055-567-5 | oclc=926062252 | pages=223, 395\u2013398}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Utkatasana in Sritattvanidhi by Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar.png|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Utkatasana]] shown as a low [[squatting pose]] in the 19th century ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]'' in [[Mysore Palace]]; the modern pose is a standing squat.]]\n\nAnother case is [[Utkatasana]], sometimes called chair pose, though its name, ''Utkata'', means \"fierce\". In modern yoga, it is indeed a challenging squatting pose with the thighs approaching the horizontal,<ref name=\"YB\">{{cite web |title=Chair {{!}} Utkatasana |url=http://www.yogabasics.com/asana/chair/ |publisher=Yoga Basics |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref> whereas in the 19th century ''Sritattvanidhi'' it is illustrated as a low squatting pose with the buttocks resting against the heels; the ''Gheranda Samhita'' II.27 is similar, but the heels are raised.{{sfn|Sjoman|1999|pp=83, plate 17}}\n\n==In yoga as exercise==\n{{further|Yoga as exercise|List of asanas}}\n\nStanding asanas such as [[Adho Mukha Svanasana]] (Downward Dog), [[Virabhadrasana]] (Warrior Pose) and [[Trikonasana]] (Triangle Pose) are a conspicuous feature of the yoga practised around the modern world.

The town forms a continuous urban area with Bradford.  It has a population of approximately 28,162.<ref name=\"ONS\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n===Toponymy===\n\nThe [[toponymy|place-name]] 'Shipley' derives from two words - the [[Old English]] ''sc\u012bp'' ('sheep', a [[Northumbrian dialect]] form, contrasting with the [[Anglian dialects#Dialects|Anglian dialect]] form ''sc\u0113p'' which underlies modern English ''sheep'')<ref name=\"CamDict\" /> and ''l\u0113ah'' meaning either \"a forest, wood, glade, clearing\" or, later, \"a pasture, meadow\".<ref name=\"Nott\" />  It has therefore been variously defined as \"forest clearing used for sheep\"{{sfn|Burrows|p=1}} or \"sheep field\".<ref name=\"T&A1\" />\n\n===Early history===\n\nShipley appears to have first been settled in the late [[Bronze Age]]{{sfn|Burrows|p=1}} and is mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, in the form ''Scipelei(a)''.<ref name=\"CamDict\" />\n\nIts early history relies on the records of a succession of [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]], not all of whom were in permanent residence. The rolls of the [[manor court]] have been missing since the 18th&nbsp;century,{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}} leaving the records incomplete. In the 12th&nbsp;century, 'Adam, son of Peter', an early Lord of the Manor, granted [[grazing]] and [[iron ore]] mining rights to the monks of [[Rievaulx Abbey]].{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}}  Through the [[Middle Ages]] the Lords were the 'Earls of Ormande' (sic), possibly the Irish [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earls of Ormond]], followed by the [[William Gascoigne|Gascoigne family]]. In 1495, Rosamund Gascoigne, a daughter of one of the William Gascoignes who held the title, married Robert Rawson, thought to be related to the Rawson family of [[Bradford]], after whom one of the city's markets is named. Their son, William, married a cousin, Agnes Gascoigne, and through the marriage the Rawson family inherited the manor in 1570.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|pp=5\u20137}}\n\nThe Rawsons lived at Over Hall known as the Manor House, on the site of the current [[town hall]].  The manor estates extended to Northcliff.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=12}} The family had interests in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and moved there in the early 18th&nbsp;century, retaining their Shipley estates until the last male heir died in 1745.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=8}}\n\nBy the 19th&nbsp;century the Rawson estates and those of the Fields, another prominent land-owning family, had become the property of the [[Earl of Rosse]]{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=37}} who had extensive holdings in [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]].  His legacy has endured in the name of a public house on the main Bradford to Keighley road, and Rossefield School in Heaton. Of the lower orders at this time not much is known, but there was relief housing offered at the town's expense near Crowghyll.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=10}}\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n\n[[File:Canal side, Shipley - geograph.org.uk - 347005.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mill buildings alongside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Shipley|Canal-side mills, Shipley]]\n\nShipley was shaped largely by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and, in particular, the growth of the [[textile industry]]. Textile manufacture dates from pre-industrial times.  As the place name indicates, Shipley had a history as sheep grazing land, so wool was plentiful, and the River Aire was a ready source of water for powering water mills and cleaning processes.  There was a [[fulling]] mill in Shipley by 1500 and two more by 1559.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=13}}  Another mill was built by the Dixon family on the banks of the Aire in 1635.  New Mill on the far side of Hirst Wood was built in the 1740s and by the late 18th&nbsp;century between 9,000 and 10,000 pieces of broadcloth were being fulled annually at Shipley's mills.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=15}}  Much work was undertaken in workers' cottages which had 'loomshops' for spinning yarn.  Home workshops were once a common sight along the River Aire and often had external flights of steps. Examples can be seen in the cottages at Jane Hills along the canal in [[Saltaire]].{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=14}}\n\nThe industrial era ended [[cottage industry]]. Providence Mill, one of the first steam-driven mills was built for Denby Bros. in 1796.{{sfn|Burrows|p=2}}  Other spinning mills followed, including Ashley Mill, Prospect Mill, Red Beck Mill on Heaton Beck (c. 1815), Well Croft Mill (c. 1840s) and Whiting Mill on Briggate.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nThe smaller mills gave way to larger premises which could combine all the processes of [[worsted]] production on one site. The first was Joseph Hargreaves' Airedale Mills (demolished 1970s), [[Salts Mill]] (built 1853 and now a gallery and restaurant complex), an enlarged Well Croft Mill (demolished 1950s) and Victoria Mills near the canal...{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=23}}  Hargreaves employed 1,250, Salt initially 2,500 and by 1876 total employment in the mills was 6,900.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=23}}\n\nThe growth in textile production stimulated the growth of associated supply industries. Other local employers included [[loom]] makers, Lee and Crabtree, WP Butterfield's galvanised containers and J. Parkinson and Sons machine tool makers.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=7}}\n\nThe other major effect of industrialisation was the vast expansion in housing stock.  [[Titus Salt]]'s [[Saltaire]] is an example of a [[model village]], and Hargreaves had cottages built for his workers around the town centre and his mill.  He built 92 [[back-to-back houses]] along Market Street and Central Avenue in an area which came to be called ''Hargreaves Square'' or ''The Square''.  The houses were built by filling in the old courtyards.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=32}}  The population of the township grew from 1,214 in 1822{{sfn|The Edinburgh Gazetteer|1822|p=572}} to just over 3,000 in 1851 to 10,000 by 1869.{{sfn|Watson|1989|p=4}}\n\nIt was then the landowning families\u2014the Rosses, the Crompton-Stansfields and the Wainmans\u2014took advantage of the demand for housing by selling their less productive land on Low Moor and High Moor.  Houses for the better off were built in Sunny Bank and Hall Royd in the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=35}}  Kirkgate was lined with villas from the 1860s, some of which still stand.  Middle-class houses were built in the Nab Wood and Moorhead districts.  In 1870 a tranche of land in Moorhead was sold by the Countess of Rosse to build five streets of terraces.  The public house on Saltaire Roundabout that bears her name dates from that time.{{sfn|Watson|1989|pages=4\u20135}}\n\n===Post-war redevelopment===\n[[File:Shipley Market Place.jpg|thumb|right|Shipley Market Place]]\n\nThe decline of the textile industry saw the demolition of many mills, only Salts Mill and Victoria Mills remain and have been converted to other uses.\n\nOf more concern in the immediate [[post-war]] period was the deteriorating housing stock. In the 1950s, the back-to-backs of Hargreaves' Square were condemned as slums and the site redeveloped. The redevelopment removed several historic buildings \u2013 Shipley Old Hall (1593), at the junction of Kirkgate and Manor Lane{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=15}} and of which a few fragments of roof drainage and a roof truss survive in Crowghyll Park,{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}} Shipley Hall (1734), which stood at the junction of Market Street and Otley Road became the headquarters of Windhill [[Cooperative society|Cooperative Society]]{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=15}} and possibly Hudson Fold House (1629).{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=38}}  Of the major [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] town centre buildings, only the Old Bradford Bank (now Barclays) and Sun Hotel remain.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=37}}\nThe slums were replaced with low-rise modern retail outlets, a central square serves as an outdoor market and an underground indoor market is situated beneath a tall, [[brutalist]] market hall tower which is a visible landmark for many miles around. Until recently the tower had a 'man' striking a bell to mark the hours.{{sfn|Burrows|p=15}}\n\nA second phase of clearance in 1978 saw the construction of Asda, a library, swimming pool and health centre. Croft House (1729), a stone built farmhouse which was converted to a school and then subsequently used as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] headquarters was a casualty of this development. By 1970 2,900 slum houses had been demolished.{{sfn|Firth|1996|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nThe Otley and Leeds Roads were widened in the early 1970s, at the expense of the Fox and Hounds Hotel after which Shipley's main road junction, Fox Corner, was named.{{sfn|Burrows|p=2}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nShipley is located at an important crossing of the [[River Aire]], where the route from [[Otley]] to [[Bradford]] crosses the route from [[Skipton]] to [[Leeds]]. It is sheltered by the millstone crags of [[Wrose]] and [[Windhill, West Yorkshire|Windhill]] to the east, and to the north by [[Baildon]] and [[Guiseley|Hawksworth]] Moors.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=6}}\n\nEarly development in Shipley was centred on the [[intersection (road)|crossroads]], locally known today as [[Fox Corner]] after the former Fox and Hounds [[public house|pub]] that stood there.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Sheeran|1984}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} Here, as today, the route from [[Otley]] to [[Bradford]] crossed the route from [[Skipton]] to [[Leeds]] at an important crossing of the [[River Aire]].{{sfn|Sheeran|1984}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} The present Kirkgate and Manor Lane (then known as Sower Lane) were probably no more than tracks.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}} \n\nIn [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], Shipley consisted of the settlement around the crossroads, and the [[enclosure|unenclosed]] fields at Shipley Fields and the Hirst which were collectively farmed. Beyond these lay the Low Moor, which ran from the Crowghyll to the former Saltaire roundabout (now a junction on the Bradford to Keighley road), in the approximate area of modern day Wycliffe,{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=6}} and the [[Barren vegetation|wasteland]] of High Moor (from Saltaire roundabout, through Moorhead, as far as New Brighton and Noon Nick).{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=6}} These areas were steep, rocky land, unsuitable for farming.{{sfn|Watson|1989|p=1}} By 1600 at the latest, the open fields had been enclosed and given way to individual farms.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=11}} The town was bounded to the north by the [[River Aire]], to the east by [[Bradford Beck]], with [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]] and [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]] lying beyond its western and southern boundaries.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}}\n\nOutlying districts, such as Windhill, were not part of Shipley until the 19th&nbsp;century. [[Saltaire]] became part of Shipley after its foundation in the 1860s, while Windhill, which had previously been part of [[Idle]], became part of the Shipley Urban District in 1894.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=37}}\n\n==Governance==\n{{further|Shipley (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nShipley was historically a [[Township (England)|township]] and [[chapelry]] in the large ancient parish of Bradford.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/197 Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales, 1870\u201372, at Vision of Britain website]</ref>  Shipley Local Board was formed in 1853.  Originally the board met at the Sun Hotel near the market.  In 1880, it moved to the old Manor House, until it was demolished in 1915.  Shipley became a separate [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in 1866.  In 1894, Shipley Urban District Council was constituted with 15 councillors,{{sfn|Firth|1996|pp=19\u2013100}} and Shipley incorporated the Windhill district, formerly part of Idle.  An attempt was made to gain borough status in 1898, but failed.{{sfn|Burrows|p=11}}  Shipley Town Hall was built in 1932, as part of a scheme to relieve high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]] and was opened by the [[Earl of Harewood]].{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=15}}  It became the seat of Shipley's administration for the next four decades.\n\nFor many years, Shipley opposed joining Bradford for local government purposes whenever it was proposed.  A large protest march marked the third attempt in 1937.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=47}}  In 1974 after local government reorganisation, merger into Bradford seemed inevitable, and no resistance was offered.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=101}} \n\nThe [[Shipley parliamentary constituency]] was created in 1885, and its first MP was [[Joseph Craven (politician)|Joseph Craven]].\n\nA campaign for Shipley to have a Town Council was launched in 2018 and is currently collecting signatures to trigger a Governance Review by Bradford Metropolitan District Council.<ref>{{Cite

character serving as a commuter suburb of larger urban employment centres in Bradford and Leeds. Manufacturing activity includes information technology specialist [[Arris International|ARRIS]] located in the Salts Mill complex.  Marlin Windows, HC Slingsby and the offices of the Bradford Health Authority also feature among the larger employers in the town.\n\nThe town has one large scale supermarket, [[Asda]] in the town centre, but also supports smaller scale supermarkets and convenience shops. An open air market is a feature of the main commercial centre of the town as well as a covered market hall known for its landmark clock tower and 1960s [[brutalist]] architecture. Other shops in the same precinct include an [[Arndale Centre]], retailers such as [[Laura Ashley plc|Laura Ashley]], [[Argos (shop)|Argos]], and [[Boots the Chemist|Boots]]. A pedestrian precinct with some shops and leisure businesses links Asda and its multi-storey free car park with Market Square. This area also includes the Shipley Library and the [http://www.kirkgatecentre.org.uk Kirkgate Centre], the town's main cultural focus offering regular a range of community activities in addition to holding cultural events such as live music, a regular alternative market and world cinema.\n\nThe town's secondary commercial centre, Gordon Terrace, part of the historic Saltaire Village development, features independent food and fashion retailers, as well as numerous restaurants and cafes.  The town has a large volume of through vehicle traffic as it is on two of the main routes between Bradford, Leeds and the Aire Valley towns of [[Bingley]], [[Keighley]], and [[Skipton]].\n\n===Visitor attractions===\n[[File:Saltaire from Leeds and Liverpool Canal.jpg|thumb|[[Salts Mill]] alongside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]\n{{main|Saltaire}}\nThe village of [[Saltaire]] located in Shipley is a [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage Site]] incorporating the Victorian era [[Salts Mill]] and associated residential district.  Located by the [[River Aire]] and [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] the model village was planned by industrialist Sir [[Titus Salt]] as a processing facility for [[alpaca]] woollen cloth and as residential accommodation for his workforce.  [[Salts Mill]] is no longer used for textile production, but now contains the 1853 Gallery, housing many works by the artist [[David Hockney]], a variety of shops, restaurants and local businesses, including [[Pace Micro Technology]]. Salts Mill is accessed via the nearby [[Saltaire railway station]] and together with the stone built terraced houses, ornate Victorian era civic buildings and Roberts Park, draws significant numbers of tourists to the area.\n\nTo the north across the River Aire, is ''Shipley Glen'' ( \"glen\" refers to the little valley beneath a ridge).  It has long been a popular beauty spot, and in 1895 the [[Shipley Glen Tramway]] was built to carry visitors up to the top.  The tramway has weathered periods of neglect and closure, but in 2012 it ran most weekends through the summer, staffed by volunteers.\n[[File:Overview of Shipley, West Yorkshire.jpg|thumb|left|Looking over Shipley from Northcliffe]]\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n\nCrowghyll Park was once a quarry and the town's refuse dump.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=66}}  The land was given to church wardens in lieu of common rights when Shipley Common was enclosed and in 1889 it was landscaped. A public playground was opened by Mrs Titus Salt in 1890.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=25}} A larger recreation area with playing fields, allotments, woods, and a private golf club is situated on the hill at [[Northcliffe Park|Northcliffe]]. The woods and playing fields were opened to the public by [[Henry Norman Rae|Norman Rae]] MP and the playing fields are named after him.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=49}} In the village of Saltaire is [[Roberts Park, Saltaire|Roberts Park]], built by Sir Titus Salt for his workers' recreation.\n\n===Theatre and cinema===\n\nThe [[Victoria Hall, Saltaire|Victoria Hall]] in Saltaire is a concert venue, hosting bands such as [[Fairport Convention]]. However, there were once a number of entertainment establishments within the district:\n* ''Queen's Palace'' \u2013 Formerly a temperance coffee house, an institution called Queens' Palace Theatre was sited on Briggate around the turn of the 20th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=10}}  It held twice nightly variety shows at 7&nbsp;pm and 9&nbsp;pm.  In December 1915 it became Shipley Picture House and remained as a cinema until August 1932. .{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=28}}  The building was demolished following a fire in 1960.{{sfn|Burrows|p=8}}\n* ''Glen Royal'' \u2013 The same fate met its successor, the Glen Royal Cinema, which was sited slightly further along Briggate.  This 1,200 seat \"showpiece super-cinema\"<ref name=\"Greenhalf1\"/> opened with a showing of [[Emma (1932 film)|Emma]] on 5 September 1932 and was Shipley's premier cinema during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=28}}  A [[Hammond organ]] was installed in 1936 and it became the first cinema in the area after the Ritz in Bradford to show [[3D film]].<ref name=\"Greenhalf1\"/>  In 1963 it followed the path of many former cinemas, by becoming a [[casino]] and [[bingo hall]], and later part of it became a [[snooker]] club.  In time, it became derelict, before being destroyed by fire like its predecessor in 2013.<ref name=\"Postles1\" />\n* ''Saltaire Picture House'' \u2013 Saltaire Picture House was on a site opposite the Old Tramshed and opened in 1922, seated 1,500.  It later became the [[Gaumont British|Gaumont]].  The cinema closed in 1957 and the building was demolished soon after.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=27}}\n* ''Pavilion'' \u2013 The Pavilion Cinema or Pavilion de Luxe on Commercial Street was built in 1912 and known as the 'Bug Ole' or 'Bug Run'.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=28}}  It opened on 2 April 1914.{{sfn|Burrows|p=21}}  The small seating capacity, 630, gave rise to the motto 'the little theatre with the big reputation'.{{sfn|Burrows|p=21}}  It closed in November 1956.{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}}\n* ''Prince's Hall'' \u2013 Prince's Hall Cinema opened on 24 June 1911{{sfn|Burrows|p=13}} and like the rest of Shipley's cinemas had an organ.  It survived for many years, called Unit Four, with half the capacity of the old Prince's Hall{{sfn|Burrows|p=13}}  It was the last remaining cinema in Shipley until it closed at the turn of the 21st&nbsp;century.\n\n[http://www.shipleyfilmsociety.org.uk Shipley Film Society] was established in 2010 to bring cinema back to Shipley, and runs a programme of independent and world cinema between September and May each year.\n\n===Libraries===\n\nThe library on Well Croft in the town centre is a branch library of Bradford Central Library.  A Carnegie Library on Briggate built with a \u00a33,000 donation by [[Andrew Carnegie]] now stands empty{{sfn|Burrows|p=4}} but the name persists in Carnegie Drive and the Carnegie Clinic.\n\n===Industry===\nShipley houses the  Naylor Cars, Ltd., that produced the [[Naylor TF 1700]], an MG TF replica.\n\n==Religion==\nTraditionally, [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] churches have predominated in Shipley and this is still the case to some extent today.  There are four [[Methodist]] churches, which feature [[Victorian architecture]].  These are: Northcliffe on the site of a 'tin chapel',{{sfn|Burrows|p=13}} Crag Road, Saltaire and Christ Church at Windhill.<ref name=\"ShipChurch\" /> Saltaire United Reformed Church was built in the [[Italianate]] style at the behest of [[Sir Titus Salt]] in 1859.  It is a [[Grade I listed]] building.<ref name=\"SURC\" />\n[[File:St Pauls, Shipley, West Yorkshire.jpg|thumb|right|St Paul's, Shipley]]\nThe first place of worship in Shipley was the Bethel [[Baptist]] Chapel in 1758, it was rebuilt in 1836 and demolished in the early 1970s and only part of the graveyard survives.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=21}}  A second Baptist chapel was built at Rosse Street near the town centre in 1865 and is still in use.  There is a Victorian [[Salvation Army]] Citadel on Rhodes Place.\n\nHistorically, Shipley was part of the [[parish]] of Bradford and did not have a church until well into the 19th&nbsp;century.  The first [[Anglican]] church was the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] St Paul's on Kirkgate, consecrated by [[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt|Edward Harcourt]], [[Archbishop of York]] in 1826.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=20}}  It was built at a cost of [[Pre-decimal British Coinage#Pre-decimal coinage|\u00a37,687.19s.3d]], a gift of the nation under the [[Million Act]],{{sfn|Burrows|p=12}} on land donated by John Wilmer Field, from the Shipley land-owning family.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=21}}  The parish of Shipley cum Heaton was created on 30 May 1828 by an [[order in council]] of [[George IV|King George IV]].{{sfn|Burrows|p=12}}  St Paul's is one of an identical pair of churches with Wilsden Church.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=20}}  A graveyard was added in 1860, but by 1895 was full and additional land at Hirst Wood was consecrated.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=20}}  The church seated 1488 and has an organ built by Binns of Bramley in 1892.{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}}\n\nOther Anglican churches in the town are St Margaret's, Frizinghall and St Peter's in Moorhead Lane. The later was commissioned in 1888 as a daughter church for St Paul's and consecrated in 1909 by the [[William Boyd Carpenter|Bishop of Ripon]].{{sfn|Watson|1989|p=11}}  The [[Roman Catholic Church]] of St Theresa Benedicta and St Walburga, usually referred to as St Walburga's is situated on Kirkgate.<ref name=\"ShipChurch\" />\n\n== Transport ==\n\n===Road===\n\nThe Bradford to Bingley Road was constructed in the 1820s{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=21}} and with Otley Road and Saltaire Road form a triangle framing Shipley centre.  They connect the town to Bradford, Leeds and the Airedale towns.\n\nThere is a small bus station in Shipley Market Place.\n\n===Rail===\n{{main|Shipley railway station|Saltaire railway station}}\n\nThe [[Midland Railway]]'s Leeds and Bradford line opened on 2 July 1846 and was extended to [[Keighley]] by March 1847.  The [[Guiseley]] branch opened on 4 December 1876 and in the same year completion of the [[Settle-Carlisle Line]] put Shipley on the London to Scotland route. In 1885, the old Midland Railway station was replaced, and by 1900, 400 trains were passing through Shipley each month, carrying 50,000 passengers.{{sfn|Burrows|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n[[Shipley railway station]] has an unusual triangular layout, serving trains on the [[Skipton]] to Leeds line, the Leeds to [[Bradford Forster Square railway station|Bradford Forster Square]] line, and the Bradford to Skipton/Ilkley lines.  [[Saltaire railway station]], reopened in 1984 on the Setttle-Carlisle Line, serves the heritage village of Saltaire.  Long-distance trains run south to London [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] and north to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], while local trains connect the town with Leeds, Bradford and Skipton.\n\n===Canals===\n\nThe [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] was once an important navigation linking Shipley to the wider world.  The Skipton to Shipley section was completed in 1773 and in 1774 a branch was extended to Bradford. [[Wharf|Wharves]] were established on the north side of Briggate.{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}}  The Bradford branch was filled in during the 1920s. The canal is used for pleasure cruising.\n\n===Trams===\n\n[[Tram]]s ran along Bradford Road to the south and Saltaire Road to the north{{sfn|Firth|1996|pp=10\u201318}} and between [[Baildon]] Bridge and the Branch. The intersection of these lines led to the main road junction of Fox's Corner being given the alternative name of ''Cobweb Square''.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=37}} The legacy of trams is the terminal building on Saltaire Roundabout, now a public house named ''Salt Bar & Kitchen''. There was a second tram shed off the roundabout at the foot of Moorhead Land.\n\nSaltaire shed was converted for trolleybuses in 1939 until Bradford scrapped trolleybuses in the 1970s.\n\n==Newspapers==\n\nThe town's first newspaper was the ''Shipley Times & Express'' run by stationer and printer, Johnny Walker.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=10}}  The paper was based in premises at Shipley crossroads, and the junction was sometimes called Johnny Walker's Corner as well as Fox Corner.  In 1922, Walker sold out to printer/stationer, Osbaldiston, and the building still stands under his name. The building is now a scuba diving centre called Duck and Dive.  The paper closed in 1981.<ref name=\"LocalPaper\"/>\n\nShipley is in the distribution area of the Bradford-based ''[[Telegraph & Argus]]''.

The town forms a continuous urban area with Bradford.  It has a population of approximately 28,162.<ref name=\"ONS\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n===Toponymy===\n\nThe [[toponymy|place-name]] 'Shipley' derives from two words - the [[Old English]] ''sc\u012bp'' ('sheep', a [[Northumbrian dialect]] form, contrasting with the [[Anglian dialects#Dialects|Anglian dialect]] form ''sc\u0113p'' which underlies modern English ''sheep'')<ref name=\"CamDict\" /> and ''l\u0113ah'' meaning either \"a forest, wood, glade, clearing\" or, later, \"a pasture, meadow\".<ref name=\"Nott\" />  It has therefore been variously defined as \"forest clearing used for sheep\"{{sfn|Burrows|p=1}} or \"sheep field\".<ref name=\"T&A1\" />\n\n===Early history===\n\nShipley appears to have first been settled in the late [[Bronze Age]]{{sfn|Burrows|p=1}} and is mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, in the form ''Scipelei(a)''.<ref name=\"CamDict\" />\n\nIts early history relies on the records of a succession of [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]], not all of whom were in permanent residence. The rolls of the [[manor court]] have been missing since the 18th&nbsp;century,{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}} leaving the records incomplete. In the 12th&nbsp;century, 'Adam, son of Peter', an early Lord of the Manor, granted [[grazing]] and [[iron ore]] mining rights to the monks of [[Rievaulx Abbey]].{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}}  Through the [[Middle Ages]] the Lords were the 'Earls of Ormande' (sic), possibly the Irish [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earls of Ormond]], followed by the [[William Gascoigne|Gascoigne family]]. In 1495, Rosamund Gascoigne, a daughter of one of the William Gascoignes who held the title, married Robert Rawson, thought to be related to the Rawson family of [[Bradford]], after whom one of the city's markets is named. Their son, William, married a cousin, Agnes Gascoigne, and through the marriage the Rawson family inherited the manor in 1570.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|pp=5\u20137}}\n\nThe Rawsons lived at Over Hall known as the Manor House, on the site of the current [[town hall]].  The manor estates extended to Northcliff.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=12}} The family had interests in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and moved there in the early 18th&nbsp;century, retaining their Shipley estates until the last male heir died in 1745.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=8}}\n\nBy the 19th&nbsp;century the Rawson estates and those of the Fields, another prominent land-owning family, had become the property of the [[Earl of Rosse]]{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=37}} who had extensive holdings in [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]].  His legacy has endured in the name of a public house on the main Bradford to Keighley road, and Rossefield School in Heaton. Of the lower orders at this time not much is known, but there was relief housing offered at the town's expense near Crowghyll.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=10}}\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n\n[[File:Canal side, Shipley - geograph.org.uk - 347005.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mill buildings alongside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Shipley|Canal-side mills, Shipley]]\n\nShipley was shaped largely by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and, in particular, the growth of the [[textile industry]]. Textile manufacture dates from pre-industrial times.  As the place name indicates, Shipley had a history as sheep grazing land, so wool was plentiful, and the River Aire was a ready source of water for powering water mills and cleaning processes.  There was a [[fulling]] mill in Shipley by 1500 and two more by 1559.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=13}}  Another mill was built by the Dixon family on the banks of the Aire in 1635.  New Mill on the far side of Hirst Wood was built in the 1740s and by the late 18th&nbsp;century between 9,000 and 10,000 pieces of broadcloth were being fulled annually at Shipley's mills.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=15}}  Much work was undertaken in workers' cottages which had 'loomshops' for spinning yarn.  Home workshops were once a common sight along the River Aire and often had external flights of steps. Examples can be seen in the cottages at Jane Hills along the canal in [[Saltaire]].{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=14}}\n\nThe industrial era ended [[cottage industry]]. Providence Mill, one of the first steam-driven mills was built for Denby Bros. in 1796.{{sfn|Burrows|p=2}}  Other spinning mills followed, including Ashley Mill, Prospect Mill, Red Beck Mill on Heaton Beck (c. 1815), Well Croft Mill (c. 1840s) and Whiting Mill on Briggate.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nThe smaller mills gave way to larger premises which could combine all the processes of [[worsted]] production on one site. The first was Joseph Hargreaves' Airedale Mills (demolished 1970s), [[Salts Mill]] (built 1853 and now a gallery and restaurant complex), an enlarged Well Croft Mill (demolished 1950s) and Victoria Mills near the canal...{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=23}}  Hargreaves employed 1,250, Salt initially 2,500 and by 1876 total employment in the mills was 6,900.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=23}}\n\nThe growth in textile production stimulated the growth of associated supply industries. Other local employers included [[loom]] makers, Lee and Crabtree, WP Butterfield's galvanised containers and J. Parkinson and Sons machine tool makers.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=7}}\n\nThe other major effect of industrialisation was the vast expansion in housing stock.  [[Titus Salt]]'s [[Saltaire]] is an example of a [[model village]], and Hargreaves had cottages built for his workers around the town centre and his mill.  He built 92 [[back-to-back houses]] along Market Street and Central Avenue in an area which came to be called ''Hargreaves Square'' or ''The Square''.  The houses were built by filling in the old courtyards.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=32}}  The population of the township grew from 1,214 in 1822{{sfn|The Edinburgh Gazetteer|1822|p=572}} to just over 3,000 in 1851 to 10,000 by 1869.{{sfn|Watson|1989|p=4}}\n\nIt was then the landowning families\u2014the Rosses, the Crompton-Stansfields and the Wainmans\u2014took advantage of the demand for housing by selling their less productive land on Low Moor and High Moor.  Houses for the better off were built in Sunny Bank and Hall Royd in the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=35}}  Kirkgate was lined with villas from the 1860s, some of which still stand.  Middle-class houses were built in the Nab Wood and Moorhead districts.  In 1870 a tranche of land in Moorhead was sold by the Countess of Rosse to build five streets of terraces.  The public house on Saltaire Roundabout that bears her name dates from that time.{{sfn|Watson|1989|pages=4\u20135}}\n\n===Post-war redevelopment===\n[[File:Shipley Market Place.jpg|thumb|right|Shipley Market Place]]\n\nThe decline of the textile industry saw the demolition of many mills, only Salts Mill and Victoria Mills remain and have been converted to other uses.\n\nOf more concern in the immediate [[post-war]] period was the deteriorating housing stock. In the 1950s, the back-to-backs of Hargreaves' Square were condemned as slums and the site redeveloped. The redevelopment removed several historic buildings \u2013 Shipley Old Hall (1593), at the junction of Kirkgate and Manor Lane{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=15}} and of which a few fragments of roof drainage and a roof truss survive in Crowghyll Park,{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}} Shipley Hall (1734), which stood at the junction of Market Street and Otley Road became the headquarters of Windhill [[Cooperative society|Cooperative Society]]{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=15}} and possibly Hudson Fold House (1629).{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=38}}  Of the major [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] town centre buildings, only the Old Bradford Bank (now Barclays) and Sun Hotel remain.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=37}}\nThe slums were replaced with low-rise modern retail outlets, a central square serves as an outdoor market and an underground indoor market is situated beneath a tall, [[brutalist]] market hall tower which is a visible landmark for many miles around. Until recently the tower had a 'man' striking a bell to mark the hours.{{sfn|Burrows|p=15}}\n\nA second phase of clearance in 1978 saw the construction of Asda, a library, swimming pool and health centre. Croft House (1729), a stone built farmhouse which was converted to a school and then subsequently used as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] headquarters was a casualty of this development. By 1970 2,900 slum houses had been demolished.{{sfn|Firth|1996|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nThe Otley and Leeds Roads were widened in the early 1970s, at the expense of the Fox and Hounds Hotel after which Shipley's main road junction, Fox Corner, was named.{{sfn|Burrows|p=2}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nShipley is located at an important crossing of the [[River Aire]], where the route from [[Otley]] to [[Bradford]] crosses the route from [[Skipton]] to [[Leeds]]. It is sheltered by the millstone crags of [[Wrose]] and [[Windhill]] to the east, and to the north by [[Baildon]] and [[Guiseley|Hawksworth]] Moors.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=6}}\n\nEarly development in Shipley was centred on the [[intersection (road)|crossroads]], locally known today as [[Fox Corner]] after the former Fox and Hounds [[public house|pub]] that stood there.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Sheeran|1984}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} Here, as today, the route from [[Otley]] to [[Bradford]] crossed the route from [[Skipton]] to [[Leeds]] at an important crossing of the [[River Aire]].{{sfn|Sheeran|1984}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} The present Kirkgate and Manor Lane (then known as Sower Lane) were probably no more than tracks.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}} \n\nIn [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], Shipley consisted of the settlement around the crossroads, and the [[enclosure|unenclosed]] fields at Shipley Fields and the Hirst which were collectively farmed. Beyond these lay the Low Moor, which ran from the Crowghyll to the former Saltaire roundabout (now a junction on the Bradford to Keighley road), in the approximate area of modern day Wycliffe,{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=6}} and the [[Barren vegetation|wasteland]] of High Moor (from Saltaire roundabout, through Moorhead, as far as New Brighton and Noon Nick).{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=6}} These areas were steep, rocky land, unsuitable for farming.{{sfn|Watson|1989|p=1}} By 1600 at the latest, the open fields had been enclosed and given way to individual farms.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=11}} The town was bounded to the north by the [[River Aire]], to the east by [[Bradford Beck]], with [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]] and [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]] lying beyond its western and southern boundaries.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=5}}\n\nOutlying districts, such as Windhill, were not part of Shipley until the 19th&nbsp;century. [[Saltaire]] became part of Shipley after its foundation in the 1860s, while Windhill, which had previously been part of [[Idle]], became part of the Shipley Urban District in 1894.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=37}}\n\n==Governance==\n{{further|Shipley (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nShipley was historically a [[Township (England)|township]] and [[chapelry]] in the large ancient parish of Bradford.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/197 Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales, 1870\u201372, at Vision of Britain website]</ref>  Shipley Local Board was formed in 1853.  Originally the board met at the Sun Hotel near the market.  In 1880, it moved to the old Manor House, until it was demolished in 1915.  Shipley became a separate [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in 1866.  In 1894, Shipley Urban District Council was constituted with 15 councillors,{{sfn|Firth|1996|pp=19\u2013100}} and Shipley incorporated the Windhill district, formerly part of Idle.  An attempt was made to gain borough status in 1898, but failed.{{sfn|Burrows|p=11}}  Shipley Town Hall was built in 1932, as part of a scheme to relieve high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]] and was opened by the [[Earl of Harewood]].{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=15}}  It became the seat of Shipley's administration for the next four decades.\n\nFor many years, Shipley opposed joining Bradford for local government purposes whenever it was proposed.  A large protest march marked the third attempt in 1937.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=47}}  In 1974 after local government reorganisation, merger into Bradford seemed inevitable, and no resistance was offered.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=101}} \n\nThe [[Shipley parliamentary constituency]] was created in 1885, and its first MP was [[Joseph Craven (politician)|Joseph Craven]].\n\nA campaign for Shipley to

character serving as a commuter suburb of larger urban employment centres in Bradford and Leeds. Manufacturing activity includes information technology specialist [[Arris International|ARRIS]] located in the Salts Mill complex.  Marlin Windows, HC Slingsby and the offices of the Bradford Health Authority also feature among the larger employers in the town.\n\nThe town has one large scale supermarket, [[Asda]] in the town centre, but also supports smaller scale supermarkets and convenience shops. An open air market is a feature of the main commercial centre of the town as well as a covered market hall known for its landmark clock tower and 1960s [[brutalist]] architecture. Other shops in the same precinct include an [[Arndale Centre]], retailers such as [[Laura Ashley plc|Laura Ashley]], [[Argos (shop)|Argos]], and [[Boots the Chemist|Boots]]. A pedestrian precinct with some shops and leisure businesses links Asda and its multi-storey free car park with Market Square. This area also includes the Shipley Library and the [http://www.kirkgatecentre.org.uk Kirkgate Centre], the town's main cultural focus offering regular a range of community activities in addition to holding cultural events such as live music, a regular alternative market and world cinema.\n\nThe town's secondary commercial centre, Gordon Terrace, part of the historic Saltaire Village development, features independent food and fashion retailers, as well as numerous restaurants and cafes.  The town has a large volume of through vehicle traffic as it is on two of the main routes between Bradford, Leeds and the Aire Valley towns of [[Bingley]], [[Keighley]], and [[Skipton]].\n\n===Visitor attractions===\n[[File:Saltaire from Leeds and Liverpool Canal.jpg|thumb|[[Salts Mill]] alongside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]\n{{main|Saltaire}}\nThe village of [[Saltaire]] located in Shipley is a [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage Site]] incorporating the Victorian era [[Salts Mill]] and associated residential district.  Located by the [[River Aire]] and [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] the model village was planned by industrialist Sir [[Titus Salt]] as a processing facility for [[alpaca]] woollen cloth and as residential accommodation for his workforce.  [[Salts Mill]] is no longer used for textile production, but now contains the 1853 Gallery, housing many works by the artist [[David Hockney]], a variety of shops, restaurants and local businesses, including [[Pace Micro Technology]]. Salts Mill is accessed via the nearby [[Saltaire railway station]] and together with the stone built terraced houses, ornate Victorian era civic buildings and Roberts Park, draws significant numbers of tourists to the area.\n\nTo the north across the River Aire, is ''Shipley Glen'' ( \"glen\" refers to the little valley beneath a ridge).  It has long been a popular beauty spot, and in 1895 the [[Shipley Glen Tramway]] was built to carry visitors up to the top.  The tramway has weathered periods of neglect and closure, but in 2012 it ran most weekends through the summer, staffed by volunteers.\n[[File:Overview of Shipley, West Yorkshire.jpg|thumb|left|Looking over Shipley from Northcliffe]]\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n\nCrowghyll Park was once a quarry and the town's refuse dump.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=66}}  The land was given to church wardens in lieu of common rights when Shipley Common was enclosed and in 1889 it was landscaped. A public playground was opened by Mrs Titus Salt in 1890.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=25}} A larger recreation area with playing fields, allotments, woods, and a private golf club is situated on the hill at [[Northcliffe Park|Northcliffe]]. The woods and playing fields were opened to the public by [[Henry Norman Rae|Norman Rae]] MP and the playing fields are named after him.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=49}} In the village of Saltaire is [[Roberts Park, Saltaire|Roberts Park]], built by Sir Titus Salt for his workers' recreation.\n\n===Theatre and cinema===\n\nThe [[Victoria Hall, Saltaire|Victoria Hall]] in Saltaire is a concert venue, hosting bands such as [[Fairport Convention]]. However, there were once a number of entertainment establishments within the district:\n* ''Queen's Palace'' \u2013 Formerly a temperance coffee house, an institution called Queens' Palace Theatre was sited on Briggate around the turn of the 20th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=10}}  It held twice nightly variety shows at 7&nbsp;pm and 9&nbsp;pm.  In December 1915 it became Shipley Picture House and remained as a cinema until August 1932. .{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=28}}  The building was demolished following a fire in 1960.{{sfn|Burrows|p=8}}\n* ''Glen Royal'' \u2013 The same fate met its successor, the Glen Royal Cinema, which was sited slightly further along Briggate.  This 1,200 seat \"showpiece super-cinema\"<ref name=\"Greenhalf1\"/> opened with a showing of [[Emma (1932 film)|Emma]] on 5 September 1932 and was Shipley's premier cinema during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=28}}  A [[Hammond organ]] was installed in 1936 and it became the first cinema in the area after the Ritz in Bradford to show [[3D film]].<ref name=\"Greenhalf1\"/>  In 1963 it followed the path of many former cinemas, by becoming a [[casino]] and [[bingo hall]], and later part of it became a [[snooker]] club.  In time, it became derelict, before being destroyed by fire like its predecessor in 2013.<ref name=\"Postles1\" />\n* ''Saltaire Picture House'' \u2013 Saltaire Picture House was on a site opposite the Old Tramshed and opened in 1922, seated 1,500.  It later became the [[Gaumont British|Gaumont]].  The cinema closed in 1957 and the building was demolished soon after.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=27}}\n* ''Pavilion'' \u2013 The Pavilion Cinema or Pavilion de Luxe on Commercial Street was built in 1912 and known as the 'Bug Ole' or 'Bug Run'.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=28}}  It opened on 2 April 1914.{{sfn|Burrows|p=21}}  The small seating capacity, 630, gave rise to the motto 'the little theatre with the big reputation'.{{sfn|Burrows|p=21}}  It closed in November 1956.{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}}\n* ''Prince's Hall'' \u2013 Prince's Hall Cinema opened on 24 June 1911{{sfn|Burrows|p=13}} and like the rest of Shipley's cinemas had an organ.  It survived for many years, called Unit Four, with half the capacity of the old Prince's Hall{{sfn|Burrows|p=13}}  It was the last remaining cinema in Shipley until it closed at the turn of the 21st&nbsp;century.\n\n[http://www.shipleyfilmsociety.org.uk Shipley Film Society] was established in 2010 to bring cinema back to Shipley, and runs a programme of independent and world cinema between September and May each year.\n\n===Libraries===\n\nThe library on Well Croft in the town centre is a branch library of Bradford Central Library.  A Carnegie Library on Briggate built with a \u00a33,000 donation by [[Andrew Carnegie]] now stands empty{{sfn|Burrows|p=4}} but the name persists in Carnegie Drive and the Carnegie Clinic.\n\n===Industry===\nShipley houses the  Naylor Cars, Ltd., that produced the [[Naylor TF 1700]], an MG TF replica.\n\n==Religion==\nTraditionally, [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] churches have predominated in Shipley and this is still the case to some extent today.  There are four [[Methodist]] churches, which feature [[Victorian architecture]].  These are: Northcliffe on the site of a 'tin chapel',{{sfn|Burrows|p=13}} Crag Road, Saltaire and Christ Church at Windhill.<ref name=\"ShipChurch\" /> Saltaire United Reformed Church was built in the [[Italianate]] style at the behest of [[Sir Titus Salt]] in 1859.  It is a [[Grade I listed]] building.<ref name=\"SURC\" />\n[[File:St Pauls, Shipley, West Yorkshire.jpg|thumb|right|St Paul's, Shipley]]\nThe first place of worship in Shipley was the Bethel [[Baptist]] Chapel in 1758, it was rebuilt in 1836 and demolished in the early 1970s and only part of the graveyard survives.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=21}}  A second Baptist chapel was built at Rosse Street near the town centre in 1865 and is still in use.  There is a Victorian [[Salvation Army]] Citadel on Rhodes Place.\n\nHistorically, Shipley was part of the [[parish]] of Bradford and did not have a church until well into the 19th&nbsp;century.  The first [[Anglican]] church was the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] St Paul's on Kirkgate, consecrated by [[Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt|Edward Harcourt]], [[Archbishop of York]] in 1826.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=20}}  It was built at a cost of [[Pre-decimal British Coinage#Pre-decimal coinage|\u00a37,687.19s.3d]], a gift of the nation under the [[Million Act]],{{sfn|Burrows|p=12}} on land donated by John Wilmer Field, from the Shipley land-owning family.{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=21}}  The parish of Shipley cum Heaton was created on 30 May 1828 by an [[order in council]] of [[George IV|King George IV]].{{sfn|Burrows|p=12}}  St Paul's is one of an identical pair of churches with Wilsden Church.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=20}}  A graveyard was added in 1860, but by 1895 was full and additional land at Hirst Wood was consecrated.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=20}}  The church seated 1488 and has an organ built by Binns of Bramley in 1892.{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}}\n\nOther Anglican churches in the town are St Margaret's, Frizinghall and St Peter's in Moorhead Lane. The later was commissioned in 1888 as a daughter church for St Paul's and consecrated in 1909 by the [[William Boyd Carpenter|Bishop of Ripon]].{{sfn|Watson|1989|p=11}}  The [[Roman Catholic Church]] of St Theresa Benedicta and St Walburga, usually referred to as St Walburga's is situated on Kirkgate.<ref name=\"ShipChurch\" />\n\n== Transport ==\n\n===Road===\n\nThe Bradford to Bingley Road was constructed in the 1820s{{sfn|Sheeran|1984|p=21}} and with Otley Road and Saltaire Road form a triangle framing Shipley centre.  They connect the town to Bradford, Leeds and the Airedale towns.\n\nThere is a small bus station in Shipley Market Place.\n\n===Rail===\n{{main|Shipley railway station|Saltaire railway station}}\n\nThe [[Midland Railway]]'s Leeds and Bradford line opened on 2 July 1846 and was extended to [[Keighley]] by March 1847.  The [[Guiseley]] branch opened on 4 December 1876 and in the same year completion of the [[Settle-Carlisle Line]] put Shipley on the London to Scotland route. In 1885, the old Midland Railway station was replaced, and by 1900, 400 trains were passing through Shipley each month, carrying 50,000 passengers.{{sfn|Burrows|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n[[Shipley railway station]] has an unusual triangular layout, serving trains on the [[Skipton]] to Leeds line, the Leeds to [[Bradford Forster Square railway station|Bradford Forster Square]] line, and the Bradford to Skipton/Ilkley lines.  [[Saltaire railway station]], reopened in 1984 on the Setttle-Carlisle Line, serves the heritage village of Saltaire.  Long-distance trains run south to London [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] and north to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], while local trains connect the town with Leeds, Bradford and Skipton.\n\n===Canals===\n\nThe [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] was once an important navigation linking Shipley to the wider world.  The Skipton to Shipley section was completed in 1773 and in 1774 a branch was extended to Bradford. [[Wharf|Wharves]] were established on the north side of Briggate.{{sfn|Burrows|p=6}}  The Bradford branch was filled in during the 1920s. The canal is used for pleasure cruising.\n\n===Trams===\n\n[[Tram]]s ran along Bradford Road to the south and Saltaire Road to the north{{sfn|Firth|1996|pp=10\u201318}} and between [[Baildon]] Bridge and the Branch. The intersection of these lines led to the main road junction of Fox's Corner being given the alternative name of ''Cobweb Square''.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=37}} The legacy of trams is the terminal building on Saltaire Roundabout, now a public house named ''Salt Bar & Kitchen''. There was a second tram shed off the roundabout at the foot of Moorhead Land.\n\nSaltaire shed was converted for trolleybuses in 1939 until Bradford scrapped trolleybuses in the 1970s.\n\n==Newspapers==\n\nThe town's first newspaper was the ''Shipley Times & Express'' run by stationer and printer, Johnny Walker.{{sfn|Firth|1996|p=10}}  The paper was based in premises at Shipley crossroads, and the junction was sometimes called Johnny Walker's Corner as well as Fox Corner.  In 1922, Walker sold out to printer/stationer, Osbaldiston, and the building still stands under his name. The building is now a scuba diving centre called Duck and Dive.  The paper closed in 1981.<ref name=\"LocalPaper\"/>\n\nShipley is in the distribution area of the Bradford-based ''[[Telegraph & Argus]]''. The ''Telegraph & Argus'' produced a free newspaper for the district, the ''Aire Valley (or Shipley) Target'', which was then produced as one of four local editions of the ''[[Bradford & District Advertiser]]''.<ref name=\"BritPaper\"/> This no longer prints.\n\nShipley is also well-served by a local community magazine, The Local Leader, which distributes bi-monthly and is produced by local teenager James Slater and is based on Commercial Street.\n\nThe Saltaire Review was launched by Festival Publications in October 2014. It is published bi-monthly and covers community issues and events, with an estimated readership of over 18,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://festivalpublications.co.uk/the-saltaire-review/|title=Festival Publications - The Saltaire Review|last=admin|date=6 March 2017|website=Festival Publications|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\nNotable people from Shipley, England, educated there, or otherwise associated with the town.\n\n'''Academics'''\n* [[Douglas Mawson|Sir Douglas Mawson]], born in Shipley in 1882.

The reason for the grant was that eight days later [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Belgium]] (younger sister of August's daughter-in-law [[Princess Louise of Belgium|Louise]]) was to marry Franz Joseph's son [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]]; Franz Joseph considered it appropriate that his son's in-laws have a higher rank at the Austrian court.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Honours ==\nHe received the following awards:<ref name = \"Handbuch\">''Staatshandbuch f\u00fcr die Herzogth\u00fcmer Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha'' (1865). \"Genealogie des Herzogliche Hauses\", [https://zs.thulb.uni-jena.de/rsc/viewer/jportal_derivate_00244505/Sachsen_Coburg_Gotha_170545237_1865_0024.tif?logicalDiv=jportal_jparticle_00483244 p. 11].

It enables players on the [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Xbox One]] to play games across the [[Internet]] using a network configuration that simulates a [[Local area network|local area network (LAN)]]. It notably also allows original Xbox games to be played online again following the [[Xbox Live]] shutdown on April 21, 2010 (similar to that of Save Nintendo Wi-Fi for the Wii) and certain [[GameSpy]] titles such as ''[[Saints Row 2]]'' to be played online after the GameSpy network shutdown on May 31, 2014.\n\n==Summary==\nThe purpose of the software is to allow consoles to network with each other over the internet via the consoles' \"local network play\" capabilities. XLink Kai acts as [[Tunneling protocol|tunneling software]], installed to a compatible [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], or [[Linux]] computer on the same network as the console. Upon the console initiating a game's \"network play\" feature, the console's requests are routed to the computer. XLink, listening for these requests, allows other consoles to be found over the internet during this search, making it appear to the player's console that these other consoles are simply connected to the local network.\n\nFor modified (\"modded\") Xbox consoles, much of the functionality can be provided directly within the [[XBMC4Xbox|Xbox Media Center (XBMC for Xbox)]]  [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]. The Kai client is still required to be running on a computer on the user's network, but players can control connections directly through the console. It is also possible to run the Kai client on other Linux-based devices, such as [[Raspberry Pi]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS devices]].\n\n==Usage==\nUsers log onto XLink's servers using a ''XTag'' username, similar to a \"Gamertag\" for Xbox Live. XLink has \"Arenas\" for each compatible System Link game, with more popular games such as ''[[Halo 2]]'' having sub-arenas based on regions within them as an attempt to minimize lag. Players in these arenas will be automatically synced to each other, simulating a LAN connection and thus able to play games normally using System Link functions. In addition to Game Arenas, Kai has a general chat room and a Quarantine Arena in which moderators can isolate abusive players. XLink also lets players create their own self-moderated Private Arenas.\n\n==Features==\nXlink Kai supports [[Nintendo GameCube]],<ref name=\"joystiq free\">{{cite web|last=Ransom |first=James |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2004/11/30/xlink-kai-free-online-gaming-for-the-masses |title=XLink Kai: free online gaming for the masses |publisher=Joystiq |date=2004-11-30 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 2]],<ref name=\"joystiq free\" /> [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Portable]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/027086/psp-online-hack |title=PSP online hack |date=December 7, 2004 |website= |publisher=Kotaku | access-date=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528133004/http://kotaku.com/027086/psp-online-hack |archive-date=May 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Yoon |first=Andrew |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/21/xlink-kai-turns-ad-hoc-into-infrastructure/ |title=Xlink Kai turns Ad-Hoc into Infrastructure |publisher=Joystiq |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]<ref name=\"joystiq free\" /><ref>{{ cite web | url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/5971/New-Tunneling-Application-XLink-Kai/ | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217083740/http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/5971/New-Tunneling-Application-XLink-Kai/ | title=New Tunneling Application XLink Kai | archivedate=December 17, 2004 | accessdate=May 27, 2014 }}</ref>, [[Xbox 360]], and [[Xbox One]] LAN enabled games.

The Kai client is still required to be running on a computer on the user's network, but players can control connections directly through the console. It is also possible to run the Kai client on other Linux-based devices, such as [[Raspberry Pi]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS devices]].\n\n==Usage==\nUsers log onto XLink's servers using a ''XTag'' username, similar to a \"Gamertag\" for Xbox Live. XLink has \"Arenas\" for each compatible System Link game, with more popular games such as ''[[Halo 2]]'' having sub-arenas based on regions within them as an attempt to minimize lag. Players in these arenas will be automatically synced to each other, simulating a LAN connection and thus able to play games normally using System Link functions. In addition to Game Arenas, Kai has a general chat room and a Quarantine Arena in which moderators can isolate abusive players. XLink also lets players create their own self-moderated Private Arenas.\n\n==Features==\nXlink Kai supports [[Nintendo GameCube]],<ref name=\"joystiq free\">{{cite web|last=Ransom |first=James |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2004/11/30/xlink-kai-free-online-gaming-for-the-masses |title=XLink Kai: free online gaming for the masses |publisher=Joystiq |date=2004-11-30 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 2]],<ref name=\"joystiq free\" /> [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Portable]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/027086/psp-online-hack |title=PSP online hack |date=December 7, 2004 |website= |publisher=Kotaku | access-date=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528133004/http://kotaku.com/027086/psp-online-hack |archive-date=May 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Yoon |first=Andrew |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/21/xlink-kai-turns-ad-hoc-into-infrastructure/ |title=Xlink Kai turns Ad-Hoc into Infrastructure |publisher=Joystiq |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]<ref name=\"joystiq free\" /><ref>{{ cite web | url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/5971/New-Tunneling-Application-XLink-Kai/ | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217083740/http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/5971/New-Tunneling-Application-XLink-Kai/ | title=New Tunneling Application XLink Kai | archivedate=December 17, 2004 | accessdate=May 27, 2014 }}</ref>, [[Xbox 360]], and [[Xbox One]] LAN enabled games.

It has preserved much [[Old Frisian]] pronunciation and vocabulary. It is still spoken by some 300 people in Hindeloopen, almost all of them elderly, and that number is decreasing.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nHindeloopen Frisian has been written since the 17th century. In 1981, the [[Fryske Akademy]] (Frisian Academy) published a dictionary of the language, then still seen as a [[dialect]] (Hylper Wurdboek, 1981, author: Gosse Blom). In 2006 they started developing a new dictionary which was completed in 2019 (Graet Hylper Wordebook, authors: Gosse Blom, Sybren Dyk, assisted by Wiebe Zoethout). This dictionary contains 1000 pages of words, grammar and synonyms and is considered the definitive version of the language.<ref>[https://frieschdagblad.nl/2019/3/23/graet-hylper-wordebook-hoe-taal-het-leven-spiegelt \"Graet Hylper Wordebook: Hoe taal het leven spiegelt\"] Dutch, Friesch Dagblad, 23 maart 2019</ref>\n\nIn 2019 Hylpers was internationally recognized as a language when [[Glottolog]], an international scientific online database containing a comprehensive catalogue of more than 7000 of the world's languages, language families and dialects, added it into their database. The language is stored under \"Language: Hindeloopen-Molkwerum Frisian\" using the Glottocode \"hind1273\". Molkwerums (dead language) and Hindeloopers/Hylpers are seen as a unit. Why is Hylpers considered a language instead of a dialect? According to Dyami Millarson (the person responsible for getting Hylpers, along with [[Skylgersk]] and [[Terschelling Frisian]], in the Glottolog) \"These 3 languages have a complete language system, it's not just a few words which are different from Frisian, the languages have developed separately from Frisian. Hylpers and Frisian are more different from each other than Afrikaans and Dutch\".<ref>[https://www.trouw.nl/cs-bf99e210 \"Spreekt u al Aasters, Schiermonnikoogs of Hielpes?

It has preserved much [[Old Frisian]] pronunciation and vocabulary. It is still spoken by some 300 people in Hindeloopen, almost all of them elderly, and that number is decreasing.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nHindeloopen Frisian has been written since the 17th century. In 1981, the [[Fryske Akademy]] (Frisian Academy) published a dictionary of the language, then still seen as a [[dialect]] (Hylper Wurdboek, 1981, author: Gosse Blom). In 2006 they started developing a new dictionary which was completed in 2019 (Graet Hylper Wordebook, authors: Gosse Blom, Sybren Dyk, assisted by Wiebe Zoethout). This dictionary contains 1000 pages of words, grammar and synonyms and is considered the definitive version of the language. <ref>[https://frieschdagblad.nl/2019/3/23/graet-hylper-wordebook-hoe-taal-het-leven-spiegelt \"Graet Hylper Wordebook: Hoe taal het leven spiegelt\"] Dutch, Friesch Dagblad, 23 maart 2019</ref>  \n\nIn 2019 Hylpers was internationally recognized as a language when [[Glottolog]], an international scientific online database containing a comprehensive catalogue of more than 7000 of the world's languages, language families and dialects, added it into their database. The language is stored under \"Language: Hindeloopen-Molkwerum Frisian\" using the Glottocode \"hind1273\". Molkwerums (dead language) and Hindeloopers/Hylpers are seen as a unit. Why is Hylpers considered a language instead of a dialect? According to Dyami Millarson (the person responsible for getting Hylpers, along with [[Skylgersk]] and [[Terschelling Frisian]], in the Glottolog) \"These 3 languages have a complete language system, it's not just a few words which are different from Frisian, the languages have developed separately from Frisian. Hylpers and Frisian are more different from each other than Afrikaans and Dutch\".<ref>[https://www.trouw.nl/cs-bf99e210 \"Spreekt u al Aasters, Schiermonnikoogs of Hielpes?
