The first recorded papal coronation was that of [[Pope Nicholas I|Nicholas I]] in 858.<ref>Kazimierz Dopiera\u0142a, ''Ksi\u0119ga Papie\u017cy'', Pozna\u0144 1996, p. 104.</ref> The last was the 1963 coronation of [[Paul VI]], who soon afterwards abandoned the practice of wearing the tiara. None of his successors have used the tiara, and their [[papal inauguration]] celebrations have included no coronation ceremony.\n\nThe papal inauguration celebration, with or without a coronation, has only symbolic significance, as a pope assumes office immediately on giving his consent to a valid election.\n\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the term ''Coronaci\u00f3n Pontificia'' (English: \"pontifical coronation\") is sometimes used for the [[canonical coronation]] of religious images through a formal, expressed decree by a reigning Pope.\n\n==Ritual==\nWhen a [[Papal conclave|conclave]] elects a new pope, he assumes all of the rights and authority of the papacy immediately upon his acceptance of election; however, popes traditionally numbered their [[regnal year]]s from the date of their coronation.<ref name=\"conclave\">{{Citation\n | last =Dowling\n | first =Austin\n | contribution =Conclave\n | year =1908\n | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia\n | volume =IV\n | place=New York\n | publisher =Robert Appleton Company\n | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04192a.htm}}\n</ref> If a newly elected pope is not a bishop, he is [[consecration#Consecration of bishops|consecrated]] at once. In accordance with tradition, the right of consecration belongs to the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], in his absence to the Subdean, and in the absence of both of these to the senior [[Cardinal Bishop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis.html|title=Universi Dominici Gregis (February 22, 1996) {{!}} John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> If the new pope is already a bishop, as is normally the case, his election is [[Habemus papam|announced]] immediately to the people gathered in Saint Peter's Square and he gives them his blessing.\n\nThe episcopal [[enthronement]] of the pope takes place in his [[cathedral]], the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]]. This ceremony was once combined with the coronation. During the [[Avignon papacy]], the pope, being in France, could not be enthroned in his cathedral in Rome. The coronations continued, while enthronements had to await a return to Rome. When [[Gregory XI]] did return to Rome, the [[Lateran Palace]] was badly in need of repair, so the popes made the Vatican their residence and transferred coronations to [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. The Lateran Basilica remains the cathedral of Rome, and the enthronement occurs there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis.html|title=Universi Dominici Gregis (February 22, 1996) {{!}} John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> During the \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\" period, the enthronement did not take place.\n\n===Coronation Mass===\nThe coronation took place on the first Sunday or Holy Day following the election. It began with a solemn [[Papal Mass]]. During the chanting of [[Terce]], he sat on a throne and all of the cardinals made what was called their \"first [[obeisance]]\" to him, approaching one by one and kissing his hand. Then the [[archbishop]]s and [[bishop]]s approached and kissed his feet.\n\nFollowing this, at least from the beginning of the 16th century, the newly elected pope was carried in state through St. Peter's Basilica on the ''[[sedia gestatoria]]'' under a white canopy, with the papal [[flabella]] (ceremonial fans) to either side. Instead of the papal tiara, he wore a jewelled [[mitre]] (the episcopal ''mitra pretiosa''). Three times, the procession was stopped, and a bundle of [[flax]] lashed to a gilded staff was burnt before the newly elected pontiff, while a [[master of ceremonies]] said: ''Pater Sancte, [[sic transit gloria mundi]]'' (Holy Father, thus passes the glory of the world) as a symbolic reminder to set aside materialism and vanity.<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Oliger\n | first =Livarius\n | contribution =Sedia Gestatoria\n | year =1912\n | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia\n | volume =XIII\n | place=New York\n | publisher =Robert Appleton Company\n | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13679a.htm}}\n</ref> Once at the [[high altar]], he would begin to celebrate [[Solemn High Mass]] with full [[papal Mass|papal ceremonial]].\n\nAfter the ''[[Confiteor]]'', the pope was seated on the sedia gestatoria, which was resting on the ground, and the three senior [[cardinal bishop]]s approached him wearing mitres. Each in turn placed his hands above him and said the prayer, ''Super electum Pontificem'' (over the elected pope). First the [[Cardinal Bishop of Albano]] said:<blockquote>God, who are present without distinction whenever the devout mind invokes you, be present, we ask you, we and this your servant, __, who to the summit of the apostolic community has been chosen as the judge of your people, infuse with the highest blessings that he experience your gift who has reached this point.<ref>\"''Deus qui adesse non delignaris ubicumque devota mente invocaris, adesto quaesumus invocationibus nostris et huic famulo tuo N. quem ad culmen apostolicum commune iudicium tuae plebis elegit ubertatem supernae benedictionis infunde, ut sentiat se tuo munere ad hunc apicem pervenisse.''\" [https://archive.org/stream/coronationrites00wooluoft#page/162/mode/2up ''Coronation Rites'', Reginald Maxwell Woolley, B.D. (Cambridge: at the University Press, 1915), pp. 160-161.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThen the [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto]] said:<blockquote>We supplicate you, Almighty God, effect your customary devotion and pour out on this your servant, __, the grace of the Holy Spirit that he who is constituted at the head of our church as the servant of the mystery, you would strengthen with the fullness of virtue.<ref>\"''Supplicationibus, omnipotens Deus, effectum consuetae pietatis impende, et gratia Spiritus Sancti hunc famulum tuum N. perfunde; ut qui in capite ecclesiarum nostrae servitutis mysterio constituitur, tuae virtutis soliditate roboretur.''\" Ibid., p. 161.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFinally the [[Cardinal Bishop of Ostia]] said:<blockquote>God, who willed your Apostle Peter to hold first place in the inner fellowship of the apostles, that universal Christianity overcome evil, look propitiously we ask on this your servant, __, who from a humble position has suddenly been enthroned with the apostles on this same principal sublimity, that just as he has been raised to this exalted dignity, so may he likewise merit to accumulate virtue; in bearing the burden of the universal church, help him, make him worthy and for thee who are blessed may merits replace vices.<ref>\"''Deus qui Apostolum tuum Petrum inter caeteros coapostolos primatum tenere voluisti, eique universae Christianitatis molem superimpostuisti; respice propitius quaesumus hunc famulum tuum N. quem de humili cathedra violenter sublimatum in thronum eiusdem apostolorum principis sublimamus: ut sicut profectibus tantae dignitatis augetur, ita virtutum meritis cumuletur; quatenus ecclesiasticae universitatis onus, te adiuvante, digne ferat, et a te qui es beatitudo tuorum meritam vicem recipiat.''\" Ibid.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThen, the senior [[cardinal deacon]] placed the [[pallium]] on his shoulders saying: <blockquote>Accept the pallium, representing the plenitude of the Pontifical office, to the honour of Almighty God, and the most glorious Virgin Mary, his Mother, and the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and the Holy Roman Church.<ref>[http://gabrielmary.com/Papal%20Coronation.html Papal Coronation]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>\u201cAccipe pallium, plenitudinem scilicet pontificalis officii, ad honorem omnipotentis Dei et gloriosissimae Virginis eius genitricis et beatorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli et sanctae Romanae ecclesiae.\u201d</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, the ''immantatio'', or bestowal of the [[mantum]] (a papal vestment consisting of a very long red [[cope]] fastened with an elaborate [[Cope|morse]]) on the newly elected pope was regarded as especially symbolic of investiture with papal authority, and was conferred with the words: \"I invest thee with the Roman papacy, that thou rule over the city and the world.\"<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Thurston\n | first =Herbert\n | contribution =Cope\n | year =1908\n | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia\n | volume =IV\n | place=New York\n | publisher =Robert Appleton Company\n | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04351a.htm}}</ref>\n\nAfter the investiture with the pallium, the pope incensed the high altar and then went to the Throne, placed on the choir side, between the Altar of the Confession and the Altar of the Chair, and there, during the singing of the Kyrie, he received again the obeisance of the cardinals, archbishops and bishops. Then the Mass continued.  After the [[Gloria in excelsis]] and the ''Pax vobis'', the pope said the [[Collect]] for the day and then secretly a prayer for himself.<ref>This prayer is from the form for the Consecration of a bishop. Woolley. p. 163.</ref> After the pope had returned again to his seat the [[Laudes Regiae|Papal ''Laudes'']] were chanted:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Cantors:\n!Response:\n|-\n|Hear, O Christ<ref>\"Exaudi Christe\"</ref>\n|Life to our lord, __, decreed by God as Supreme Pontiff and Universal Father<ref>\u201dDomino Nostro __ a Deo decreto summo Pontifici et universali Papae vita.\u201d</ref>\n|-\n|Savior of the world<ref>\"Salvador mundi\"</ref>\n|Grant him aid.<ref>\"Tu illum adiuva\"</ref>\n|-\n|Savior of the world\n|Grant him aid.\n|-\n|Savior of the world\n|Grant him aid.\n|-\n|Saint Mary<ref>\"Sancta Maria\"</ref>\n|Grant him aid.\n|-\n|Saint Mary\n|Grant him aid.\n|-\n|Saint Michael<ref>\"Sancte Michael\"</ref>\n|Grant him aid.\n|-\n|Etc.\n|etc.<ref>Woolley, p. 163.

The pope was seated on a [[throne]] with the flabella to either side of him. After the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] recited a few prayers, including the Lord's Prayer and a collect,  the senior [[cardinal deacon]], the [[protodeacon]], removed the pope's mitre and placed the tiara on his head with the words:\n\n{{quote|''Accipe tiaram tribus coronis ornatam, et scias te esse patrem principum et regum, rectorem orbis in terra vicarium Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi, cui est honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum.''\n\nReceive the tiara adorned with three crowns, and know that you are the father of princes and kings, the ruler of the world, the vicar of our Savior Jesus Christ on earth, to whom be all honor and glory, world without end.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Henrick+%22receive+the+tiara%22&btnG= Francis Patrick Henrick, ''The Primacy of the Apostolic See Vindicated'' (Baltimore, London and Pittsburgh 1857), p. 252]</ref><ref>According to the [http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Encyclopaedia+Americana+%22accipe+tiaram%22&btnG= ''Encyclopaedia Americana'', article \"Tiara\"], the words were \"''...&nbsp;scias te esse patrem, principem et regem ...''

The first recorded papal coronation was that of [[Pope Nicholas I|Nicholas I]] in 858.<ref>Kazimierz Dopiera\u0142a, ''Ksi\u0119ga Papie\u017cy'', Pozna\u0144 1996, p. 104.</ref> The last was the 1963 coronation of [[Paul VI]], who soon afterwards abandoned the practice of wearing the tiara. None of his successors have used the tiara, and their [[papal inauguration]] celebrations have included no coronation ceremony.\n\nThe papal inauguration celebration, with or without a coronation, has only symbolic significance, as a pope assumes office immediately on giving his consent to a valid election.\n\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the term ''Coronaci\u00f3n Pontificia'' (English: \"pontifical coronation\") is sometimes used for the [[canonical coronation]] of religious images through a formal, expressed decree by a reigning Pope.\n\n==Ritual==\nWhen a [[Papal conclave|conclave]] elects a new pope, he assumes all of the rights and authority of the papacy immediately upon his acceptance of election; however, popes traditionally numbered their [[regnal year]]s from the date of their coronation.<ref name=\"conclave\">{{Citation\n | last =Dowling\n | first =Austin\n | contribution =Conclave\n | year =1908\n | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia\n | volume =IV\n | place=New York\n | publisher =Robert Appleton Company\n | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04192a.htm}}\n</ref> If a newly elected pope is not a bishop, he is [[consecration#Consecration of bishops|consecrated]] at once. In accordance with tradition, the right of consecration belongs to the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], in his absence to the Subdean, and in the absence of both of these to the senior [[Cardinal Bishop]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html ''Universi Dominici gregis'', 90]</ref> If the new pope is already a bishop, as is normally the case, his election is [[Habemus papam|announced]] immediately to the people gathered in Saint Peter's Square and he gives them his blessing.\n\nThe episcopal [[enthronement]] of the pope takes place in his [[cathedral]], the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]]. This ceremony was once combined with the coronation. During the [[Avignon papacy]], the pope, being in France, could not be enthroned in his cathedral in Rome. The coronations continued, while enthronements had to await a return to Rome. When [[Gregory XI]] did return to Rome, the [[Lateran Palace]] was badly in need of repair, so the popes made the Vatican their residence and transferred coronations to [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. The Lateran Basilica remains the cathedral of Rome, and the enthronement occurs there.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html ''Universi Dominici gregis'', 91]</ref> During the \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\" period, the enthronement did not take place.\n\n===Coronation Mass===\nThe coronation took place on the first Sunday or Holy Day following the election. It began with a solemn [[Papal Mass]]. During the chanting of [[Terce]], he sat on a throne and all of the cardinals made what was called their \"first [[obeisance]]\" to him, approaching one by one and kissing his hand. Then the [[archbishop]]s and [[bishop]]s approached and kissed his feet.\n\nFollowing this, at least from the beginning of the 16th century, the newly elected pope was carried in state through St. Peter's Basilica on the ''[[sedia gestatoria]]'' under a white canopy, with the papal [[flabella]] (ceremonial fans) to either side. Instead of the papal tiara, he wore a jewelled [[mitre]] (the episcopal ''mitra pretiosa''). Three times, the procession was stopped, and a bundle of [[flax]] lashed to a gilded staff was burnt before the newly elected pontiff, while a [[master of ceremonies]] said: ''Pater Sancte, [[sic transit gloria mundi]]'' (Holy Father, thus passes the glory of the world) as a symbolic reminder to set aside materialism and vanity.<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Oliger\n | first =Livarius\n | contribution =Sedia Gestatoria\n | year =1912\n | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia\n | volume =XIII\n | place=New York\n | publisher =Robert Appleton Company\n | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13679a.htm}}\n</ref> Once at the [[high altar]], he would begin to celebrate [[Solemn High Mass]] with full [[papal Mass|papal ceremonial]].\n\nAfter the ''[[Confiteor]]'', the pope was seated on the sedia gestatoria, which was resting on the ground, and the three senior [[cardinal bishop]]s approached him wearing mitres. Each in turn placed his hands above him and said the prayer, ''Super electum Pontificem'' (over the elected pope). First the [[Cardinal Bishop of Albano]] said:<blockquote>God, who are present without distinction whenever the devout mind invokes you, be present, we ask you, we and this your servant, __, who to the summit of the apostolic community has been chosen as the judge of your people, infuse with the highest blessings that he experience your gift who has reached this point.<ref>\"''Deus qui adesse non delignaris ubicumque devota mente invocaris, adesto quaesumus invocationibus nostris et huic famulo tuo N. quem ad culmen apostolicum commune iudicium tuae plebis elegit ubertatem supernae benedictionis infunde, ut sentiat se tuo munere ad hunc apicem pervenisse.''\" [https://archive.org/stream/coronationrites00wooluoft#page/162/mode/2up ''Coronation Rites'', Reginald Maxwell Woolley, B.D. (Cambridge: at the University Press, 1915), pp. 160-161.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThen the [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto]] said:<blockquote>We supplicate you, Almighty God, effect your customary devotion and pour out on this your servant, __, the grace of the Holy Spirit that he who is constituted at the head of our church as the servant of the mystery, you would strengthen with the fullness of virtue.<ref>\"''Supplicationibus, omnipotens Deus, effectum consuetae pietatis impende, et gratia Spiritus Sancti hunc famulum tuum N. perfunde; ut qui in capite ecclesiarum nostrae servitutis mysterio constituitur, tuae virtutis soliditate roboretur.''\" Ibid., p. 161.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFinally the [[Cardinal Bishop of Ostia]] said:<blockquote>God, who willed your Apostle Peter to hold first place in the inner fellowship of the apostles, that universal Christianity overcome evil, look propitiously we ask on this your servant, __, who from a humble position has suddenly been enthroned with the apostles on this same principal sublimity, that just as he has been raised to this exalted dignity, so may he likewise merit to accumulate virtue; in bearing the burden of the universal church, help him, make him worthy and for thee who are blessed may merits replace vices.<ref>\"''Deus qui Apostolum tuum Petrum inter caeteros coapostolos primatum tenere voluisti, eique universae Christianitatis molem superimpostuisti; respice propitius quaesumus hunc famulum tuum N. quem de humili cathedra violenter sublimatum in thronum eiusdem apostolorum principis sublimamus: ut sicut profectibus tantae dignitatis augetur, ita virtutum meritis cumuletur; quatenus ecclesiasticae universitatis onus, te adiuvante, digne ferat, et a te qui es beatitudo tuorum meritam vicem recipiat.''\" Ibid.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThen, the senior [[cardinal deacon]] placed the [[pallium]] on his shoulders saying: <blockquote>Accept the pallium, representing the plenitude of the Pontifical office, to the honour of Almighty God, and the most glorious Virgin Mary, his Mother, and the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and the Holy Roman Church.<ref>[http://gabrielmary.com/Papal%20Coronation.html Papal Coronation]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>\u201cAccipe pallium, plenitudinem scilicet pontificalis officii, ad honorem omnipotentis Dei et gloriosissimae Virginis eius genitricis et beatorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli et sanctae Romanae ecclesiae.\u201d</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, the ''immantatio'', or bestowal of the [[mantum]] (a papal vestment consisting of a very long red [[cope]] fastened with an elaborate [[Cope|morse]]) on the newly elected pope was regarded as especially symbolic of investiture with papal authority, and was conferred with the words: \"I invest thee with the Roman papacy, that thou rule over the city and the world.\"<ref>{{Citation\n | last =Thurston\n | first =Herbert\n | contribution =Cope\n | year =1908\n | title =The Catholic Encyclopedia\n | volume =IV\n | place=New York\n | publisher =Robert Appleton Company\n | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04351a.htm}}</ref>\n\nAfter the investiture with the pallium, the pope incensed the high altar and then went to the Throne, placed on the choir side, between the Altar of the Confession and the Altar of the Chair, and there, during the singing of the Kyrie, he received again the obeisance of the cardinals, archbishops and bishops.

However, for hundreds of years papal coronations have traditionally taken place in the environs of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], though a number of coronations took place in [[Avignon]], during the [[Avignon papacy]]. Earlier, [[Pope Celestine V]] was twice crowned in [[L'Aquila]].<ref name=\"oce.catholic.com\"/> In 1800 [[Pope Pius VII]] was crowned in the crowded church of the [[Benedictine]] island [[monastery]] of San Giorgio, [[Venice]], after his late predecessor, [[Pope Pius VI]], had been forced into temporary exile during [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s capture of Rome. Since the French seized the tiara along with the previous pope, he was crowned with a [[Papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Tiara|papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 tiara]], for which the ladies of Venice gave up their jewels.\n\nAll coronations after 1800 took place in Rome.

Popes [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX]], [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]], and [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] all were crowned in public on the balcony of the basilica, facing crowds assembled below in [[St. Peter's Square]]. [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] was crowned in front of St Peter's on a special dais with the entire coronation ceremony outdoors, as St Peter's was filled with special seating for the Vatican Council sessions.\n\nPius XII's 1939 coronation broke new ground by being the first to be filmed and the first to be broadcast live on radio.<ref>John Cornwell, ''Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII'' (Viking, 1999) pp. 211-212.</ref> The ceremony, which lasted for six hours, was attended by leading dignitaries; these included the heir to the Italian throne, the [[Umberto II of Italy|Prince of Piedmont]], former [[king]]s [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] and [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|The 16th Duke of Norfolk]] (representing [[George VI|King George VI of the United Kingdom]]), and the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Taoiseach]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], the last two being in [[White tie|evening dress]] (white tie and tails).\n\n==Paul VI and the coronation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Coronation of Pope Paul VI.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pope Paul VI]] receives his crown during Papal Coronation, June 1963.

In this particular instance, he was involved in pushing the Indian armed forces out of [[Kashmir]] as the first struggle for Pakistan to take Kashmir began in 1947. Pakistan roughly gained 2/5 of Kashmir in this war, although the outcome was a UN Intervention [[ceasefire]], it is seen as a victory from the Pakistani perspective. Raja was stationed in front of a peak which was held by the Indian forces. Numerous Pakistani soldiers had been killed by fire from the higher ground due to the elevated Indian position. Raja realised that the Indian's had a great strategic advantage and thus a plan must be devised to advance further. His unit tried to concentrate [[artillery]] fire on the Indian stronghold but did not succeed. Thus he ordered for the artillery units to be elevated to higher positions, trying best to keep this hidden from enemy view.\n\nRaja and his men monitored Indian movement for a number of days in order to find gaps in their guard and times when their defences were weak.  He was thus able to devise a strategically timed offensive.  He asked men to come forward to aid him in the apex of the [[ambush]], in complete awareness that it was almost certainly a fatal mission since the Indian forces heavily outnumbered the Pakistani force at that position.  They prepared for the offensive, waiting for the Indian defence to weaken, they attacked with aid of the artillery that had been repositioned. The Indians were stunned at the scale of the attack and fell immediately under the pretense that a large Pakistani force had arrived. They surrendered and subsequently the peak had been liberated by Pakistani forces.  For his exemplary bravery he was awarded the honor of Sitara-e-Jurrat.\n\nHe later went on to found the 9th Azad Kashmir Battalion, to whom he became a symbol of valor.

Seven of 51 cases the county had as of April 2 were city residents, and the county feared it did not have sufficient healthcare infrastructure to handle a large outbreak; McLaughlin issued an order requiring any recent arrivals from the city to quarantine themselves for 14 days, during which law enforcement will check on them regularly.<ref name=\"Guardian refugees article\">{{cite news|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|title=New Yorkers fleeing city face fear and hostility from upstate neighbors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/new-yorkers-fleeing-city-conronavirus-fear-hostility-upstate-neighbors|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 2, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]], in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] just south of Albany, posted on its website a letter asking people to refrain from traveling there, especially from New York City or [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. \"There is no hospital in Greene County\", wrote the chairman of the county legislature. \"This limits our ability to serve a large number of people requiring higher levels of care for COVID-19 patients and other illnesses.\" The legislatures of neighboring [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware]] and [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]] counties made similar requests.<ref>{{cite press release|last=Linger|first=Patrick S.|date=March 20, 2020|title=A Message to Our Visitors, Weekenders and Second Homeowners|url=https://www.greenegovernment.com/scoop/greene-county-press-release-covid-19-march-20th-2020|location=[[Catskill, New York]]|publisher=[[Greene County, New York|Greene County]]|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[the Hamptons]], on the eastern end of Long Island's [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York|South Fork]], a longtime summer destination for city residents, rental rates have quadrupled as the population has nearly doubled.
