It may be associated with loss of [[Stretch reflex|deep tendon reflex]] (Adie's syndrome). Tonic pupil is characterized by delayed dilation of iris especially after near stimulus, segmental iris constriction, and sensitivity of pupil to a weak solution of pilocarpine.\n* [[Oculomotor nerve palsy]]: Ischemia, intracranial [[aneurysm]], [[demyelinating disease]]s (e.g., [[multiple sclerosis]]), head trauma, and brain tumors are the most common causes of oculomotor nerve palsy in adults. In ischemic lesions of the oculomotor nerve, pupillary function is usually spared whereas in compressive lesions the pupil is involved.\n* Pharmacological agents with [[anticholinergic]] or [[sympathomimetic]] properties will cause anisocoria, particularly if instilled in one eye.  Some examples of pharmacological agents which may affect the pupils include [[pilocarpine]], [[cocaine]], [[tropicamide]], [[MDMA]], [[dextromethorphan]], and [[ergolines]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1158571-overview#a0104 Anisocoria].

In Horner's syndrome sympathetic nerve fibers have a defect, therefore the pupil of the involved eye will not dilate in darkness. If the smaller pupil dilates in response to instillation of [[apraclonidine]] eye drops, this suggests Horner's syndrome is present.\n* Anisocoria which is greater in bright light suggests the larger pupil (which should constrict in bright conditions) is the abnormal pupil. This may suggest Adie tonic pupil, pharmacologic dilation, oculomotor nerve palsy, or damaged iris.\n\nA [[relative afferent pupillary defect]] (RAPD) also known as a [[Marcus Gunn pupil]] does not cause anisocoria.\n\nSome of the causes of anisocoria are  \nlife-threatening, including Horner's syndrome (which may be due to [[carotid artery dissection]]) and oculomotor nerve palsy (due to a brain aneurysm, [[uncal herniation]], or head trauma).\n\nIf the examiner is unsure whether the abnormal pupil is the constricted or dilated one, and if a one-sided [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping of the eyelid]] is present then the abnormally sized pupil can be presumed to be the one on the side of the ptosis.

Anisocoria in the presence of confusion, decreased mental status, severe headache, or other neurological symptoms can forewarn a neurosurgical emergency. This is because a hemorrhage, tumor or another intracranial mass can enlarge to a size where the third cranial nerve (CN III) is compressed, which results in uninhibited dilatation of the pupil on the same side as the lesion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Medscape|first=online|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1158571-clinical#a0218|accessdate=25 November 2012|title=Anisocoria Clinical Presentation}}</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\n* English singer [[David Bowie]] exhibited anisocoria, owing to a teenage injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/the-remarkable-story-behind-david-bowies-most-iconic-feature-52920 |title=The remarkable story behind David Bowie's most iconic feature |last=Hunt |first=Kevin |date=January 11, 2016 |work=[[The Conversation]] |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n* In the season 10 Big Bang Theory Comic-Con special, Steve Molaro told a story about how he first met actor [[Judd Hirsch]] and was taken aback by his dilated pupil.

They were the \"men distinguished by birth and dignity\" ''(maiores natu et dignitate)'' mentioned frequently in the charters of the first [[King of Hungary|kings]]. From the 1210s, the dignitaries of the central administration and the Royal Households were referred to as \"barons of the realm\" ''(barones regni)'' in official documents but their [[legal]] status was exclusively linked to the office they held and their offspring could not inherit it.\n\n[[File:Cetin.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Cetin Castle]] (in [[Croatia]]) - a fortress owned by the Counts [[Frankopan]]s from the 14th century]]\nIn 1193, King [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary|B\u00e9la III]] granted [[Modru\u0161-Rijeka County|Modru\u0161 County]] in Croatia to [[Frankopans|Bartolomej]], the ancestor of the Frankopans ''(Frangep\u00e1n)'' family; thenceforward, he and his descendants used the hereditary title ''count'' but no specific privileges were connected to it. Quite to the contrary, the theory of the \"[[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary#The age of chivalry - 14th century#The Act of 1351|one and same liberty]]\" ''(una eademque libertas)'' of the [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|nobles]] strengthened and finally, it became [[Promulgation|enacted]] in 1351. From 1397, the descendants of the \"barons of the realm\" were referred to as \"barons' sons\" ''(filii baronum)'' or [[magnate]]s ''(magnates)'' in official documents and from the 1430s, they received the [[honorific]] ''magnificus'', an expression that had earlier been used only when addressing the \"barons of the realm\".\n\n[[File:Palanok Castle Panorama.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Palanok Castle|Munk\u00e1cs Castle]] (today ''Mukachevo'' in [[Ukraine]]) - the seat of Prince [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] at the turn of the 14-15th centuries]]\nBesides the Counts Frankopan, the members of foreign [[Dynasty|ruling houses]] and the nobles of foreign origin who held offices in the royal administration or owned estates in the Kingdom of Hungary (''e.g.'', Duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk|Ladislaus of Opole]], Prince [[Fyodor Koriatovych]], the ''[[Despot (court title)|Despot]]'' [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]] and Count [[Hermann II of Celje]]) were the first individuals who used noble titles, but in theory, their legal status was still equal to that of the poorest members of the [[Lesser nobility (Kingdom of Hungary)|lesser nobility]]. Similarly, the status of the brothers [[Szentgy\u00f6rgyi]] did not change when they were rewarded with the hereditary title ''count of the Roman Empire'' in 1459 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] who had been claiming the throne for himself against King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias I]].\n\n[[File:Castelul Huniazilor.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Huniade Castle|Hunyadi Castle]] in [[Timi\u0219oara|Temesv\u00e1r]] (today ''Timi\u0219oara'' in [[Romania]]), built in the 15th century]]\nKing Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles when he appointed them to hereditary heads of counties ''(h\u00e6reditarius supremus comes)'' and authorized them to use red [[sealing wax]] (similarly to the counts of the Roman Empire). In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of [[armistice]] signed by King Matthias: the document mentioned 19 noble families as \"natural barons in Hungary\" ''(barones naturales in Hungaria)'' in contrast to the \"barons of the realm\" whose position was still linked to the high offices they happened to be holding. During the reign of King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], the special legal position of certain noble families was enacted and the act referred to their members  as \"barons\" even if they were not holding any high offices at that time.\n\nAlthough in the 16th century, the ''[[Tripartitum]]'' (a law book collecting the body of common laws that had arisen from customary practise) declared again that all the nobles enjoyed the same liberties independently of their offices, birth or wealth, but in practice, even it acknowledged that some differences had been existing within the nobility. Nevertheless, the ''Tripartitum'' still distinguished between the \"true barons\" ''(veri barones)'' who held the highest offices and the \"barons only by name\" ''(barones solo nomine)'' who did not hold any high offices but used noble titles.  From 1526, the [[Habsburg]] kings rewarded their partisans with hereditary titles such as ''baron'' and ''count'' and the members of the families wearing such titles were invited to attend in person at the [[Diet (assembly)|Diets]]. This costumary practise was confirmed by [[legislation]] in 1608, when the Diet passed an [[Act of Parliament|act]] prescribing that the [[monarch]]s were to send a personal invitation to the members of the upper nobility (''i.e.'', to the \"true barons\" and to the nobles authorized by the kings to use hereditary titles) when convoking the Diet; thenceforward, the [[prelate]]s and the members of the upper nobility formed the Diets' [[Upper House]].\n\n[[File:Hrad Krasna Horka.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Kr\u00e1sna H\u00f4rka|Krasznahorka Castle]] (today ''Kr\u00e1sna H\u00f4rka'' in [[Slovakia]]) - a seat of the Counts [[Andr\u00e1ssy]]]]\nThe Habsburg monarchs endeavoured to establish an \"international\" aristocracy within [[Habsburg Monarchy|their empire]] and they granted several estates in the Kingdom of Hungary to their followers descending from their other realms and provinces; the Estates, however, managed to reserve the right that the kings could not grant offices and estates to foreigners without their authorization. From 1688, the members of the upper nobility were entitled by law to create an [[fee tail|entail]] ''(fideicommissum)'' which ensured that their estates were inherited without division in contrast to the common law that prescribed that a noble's inheritance was to be divided equally among his heirs.\n\nThe \"[[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary#The emerging power of the Estates - 15-16th centuries#The \"cardinal liberties\" of the nobility - The Tripartitum|cardinal liberties]]\" of the nobility were abolished by the \"[[April laws]]\" in 1848, but the members of the upper nobility could reserve their hereditary membership in the Upper House of the Parliament.

They were the \"men distinguished by birth and dignity\" ''(maiores natu et dignitate)'' mentioned frequently in the charters of the first [[King of Hungary|kings]]. From the 1210s, the dignitaries of the central administration and the Royal Households were referred to as \"barons of the realm\" ''(barones regni)'' in official documents but their [[legal]] status was exclusively linked to the office they held and their offspring could not inherit it.\n\n[[File:Cetin.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Cetin Castle]] (in [[Croatia]]) - a fortress owned by the Counts [[Frankopan]]s from the 14th century]]\nIn 1193, King [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary|B\u00e9la III]] granted [[Modru\u0161-Rijeka County|Modru\u0161 County]] in Croatia to [[Frankopans|Bartolomej]], the ancestor of the Frankopans ''(Frangep\u00e1n)'' family; thenceforward, he and his descendants used the hereditary title ''count'' but no specific privileges were connected to it. Quite to the contrary, the theory of the \"[[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary#The age of chivalry - 14th century#The Act of 1351|one and same liberty]]\" ''(una eademque libertas)'' of the [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|nobles]] strengthened and finally, it became [[Promulgation|enacted]] in 1351. From 1397, the descendants of the \"barons of the realm\" were referred to as \"barons' sons\" ''(filii baronum)'' or [[magnate]]s ''(magnates)'' in official documents and from the 1430s, they received the [[honorific]] ''magnificus'', an expression that had earlier been used only when addressing the \"barons of the realm\".\n\n[[File:Palanok Castle Panorama.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Palanok Castle|Munk\u00e1cs Castle]] (today ''Mukachevo'' in [[Ukraine]]) - the seat of Prince [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] at the turn of the 14-15th centuries]]\nBesides the Counts Frankopan, the members of foreign [[Dynasty|ruling houses]] and the nobles of foreign origin who held offices in the royal administration or owned estates in the Kingdom of Hungary (''e.g.'', Duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk|Ladislaus of Opole]], Prince [[Fyodor Koriatovych]], the ''[[Despot (court title)|Despot]]'' [[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]] and Count [[Hermann II of Celje]]) were the first individuals who used noble titles, but in theory, their legal status was still equal to that of the poorest members of the [[Lesser nobility (Kingdom of Hungary)|lesser nobility]]. Similarly, the status of the brothers [[Szentgy\u00f6rgyi]] did not change when they were rewarded with the hereditary title ''count of the Roman Empire'' in 1459 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] who had been claiming the throne for himself against King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias I]].\n\n[[File:Castelul Huniazilor.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Huniade Castle|Hunyadi Castle]] in [[Timi\u015foara|Temesv\u00e1r]] (today ''Timi\u015foara'' in [[Romania]]), built in the 15th century]]\nKing Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles when he appointed them to hereditary heads of counties ''(h\u00e6reditarius supremus comes)'' and authorized them to use red [[sealing wax]] (similarly to the counts of the Roman Empire). In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of [[armistice]] signed by King Matthias: the document mentioned 19 noble families as \"natural barons in Hungary\" ''(barones naturales in Hungaria)'' in contrast to the \"barons of the realm\" whose position was still linked to the high offices they happened to be holding. During the reign of King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], the special legal position of certain noble families was enacted and the act referred to their members  as \"barons\" even if they were not holding any high offices at that time.\n\nAlthough in the 16th century, the ''[[Tripartitum]]'' (a law book collecting the body of common laws that had arisen from customary practise) declared again that all the nobles enjoyed the same liberties independently of their offices, birth or wealth, but in practice, even it acknowledged that some differences had been existing within the nobility. Nevertheless, the ''Tripartitum'' still distinguished between the \"true barons\" ''(veri barones)'' who held the highest offices and the \"barons only by name\" ''(barones solo nomine)'' who did not hold any high offices but used noble titles.  From 1526, the [[Habsburg]] kings rewarded their partisans with hereditary titles such as ''baron'' and ''count'' and the members of the families wearing such titles were invited to attend in person at the [[Diet (assembly)|Diets]]. This costumary practise was confirmed by [[legislation]] in 1608, when the Diet passed an [[Act of Parliament|act]] prescribing that the [[monarch]]s were to send a personal invitation to the members of the upper nobility (''i.e.'', to the \"true barons\" and to the nobles authorized by the kings to use hereditary titles) when convoking the Diet; thenceforward, the [[prelate]]s and the members of the upper nobility formed the Diets' [[Upper House]].\n\n[[File:Hrad Krasna Horka.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Kr\u00e1sna H\u00f4rka|Krasznahorka Castle]] (today ''Kr\u00e1sna H\u00f4rka'' in [[Slovakia]]) - a seat of the Counts [[Andr\u00e1ssy]]]]\nThe Habsburg monarchs endeavoured to establish an \"international\" aristocracy within [[Habsburg Monarchy|their empire]] and they granted several estates in the Kingdom of Hungary to their followers descending from their other realms and provinces; the Estates, however, managed to reserve the right that the kings could not grant offices and estates to foreigners without their authorization. From 1688, the members of the upper nobility were entitled by law to create an [[fee tail|entail]] ''(fideicommissum)'' which ensured that their estates were inherited without division in contrast to the common law that prescribed that a noble's inheritance was to be divided equally among his heirs.\n\nThe \"[[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary#The emerging power of the Estates - 15-16th centuries#The \"cardinal liberties\" of the nobility - The Tripartitum|cardinal liberties]]\" of the nobility were abolished by the \"[[April laws]]\" in 1848, but the members of the upper nobility could reserve their hereditary membership in the Upper House of the Parliament. In 1885, aristocrats who did not meet all the financial criteria set up by legislation, lost their seat in the legislative body. The Upper House was dissolved in 1918 and it was reorganized only in 1926, but thenceforward, the members of the upper nobility were only entitled to elect some representatives to the Upper House.\n\nIn 1945, the [[land reform]] liquidated the financial basis of the special status of the upper nobility. And finally, following the declaration of the [[Republic of Hungary]], the Parliament passed an act that prohibited the use of noble titles in 1946.\n\n== The tribal aristocracy (9th\u201311th centuries) ==\nIn the 9th century, the tribal federation of the [[nomadic]] [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] ''(Hetumoger)'' was composed of seven (and later, after the [[Kabar]]s had joined to it, of eight) [[Magyar tribes|tribes]] ({{lang-hu|t\u00f6rzs}}, {{Lang-el|phyle}}).<ref name='Encyclopedia'>{{cite book | last = Krist\u00f3 | first = Gyula (editor)| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Korai Magyar T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Lexikon - 9-14. sz\u00e1zad ''(Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History - 9-14th centuries)''| publisher = Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3 | year = 1994 | location = Budapest |ref=harv| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 963-05-6722-9}}</ref>{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|1994| pages = 262, 312, 688}} The tribes were divided into 35-50 [[clan]]s ({{lang-hu|nemzets\u00e9g}}, {{Lang-el|genea}}).{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|1994|pages = 488\u2013489}} The Magyar clans must have been organized based on the real or fictitious [[kinship]] of their members;

first decades of his reign in waging wars against the most powerful oligarchs and he could strengthen his position within the kingdom only by the 1320s.{{sfn|Engel et al.|1998|pages=41\u201355}}\n\n== The age of chivalry (14th century) ==\nThe estates King Charles I Robert acquired by force from the rebellious oligarchs made him possible to introduce a new system in the royal administration: when he appointed his followers to an office, he also granted them the possession of one or more royal castles and the royal domains attached to them, but he reserved the ownership of the castle and its belongings for himself and thus his dignitaries could only enjoy the revenues of their possessions while they held the office.{{sfn|Engel et al.|1998|pages = 56\u201357}} During his reign, the 20 dignitaries who held the highest offices in the royal administration or in the Royal Household obtained the [[Style (manner of address)|honorific]] ''magnificus vir'' that distinguished them from

members of the lesser nobility (''e.g.'', the ancestor of the [[\u00dajlaki family]]), but the majority of the new families (''e.g.'', the [[House of Garai|Garai]], [[Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi]] and

prescribing that daughters can inherit only one-fourth of their father's estates and the other parts of the estates should pass to his [[agnate]]s.{{sfn|F\u00fcgedi|1986 | p= 250}} Thenceforward, the monarchs could strengthen the financial conditions of their followers by using the prerogative of \"[[prefection]]\" ({{lang-hu|fius\u00edt\u00e1s}}, {{lang-la|pr\u00e6fectio}}) and thus entitling their wives to inherit their fathers' possessions.{{sfn|F\u00fcgedi|1986 | p= 252}} King Charles I Robert also set himself against the customs of the kingdom, when he granted landed property to his followers but he stipulated that the property could only be inherited by their descendants and thus he excluded their agnates from the inheritance.{{sfn|F\u00fcgedi|1986 | p= 253}}\n\nKing Charles I Robert endeavoured the implementation of the ideas of [[chivalry]]; in 1318, he established the [[Order of Saint George (Kingdom of Hungary)|Order of Saint George]] whose membership was limited to 50 knights.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|1994|p= 632}}{{sfn|F\u00fcgedi|1986 | p = 220}} He also set up the body of \"'''[[knights-at-the-court (Kingdom of Hungary)|knights-at-the-court]]'''\" ({{lang-hu|udvari

realm\" were appointed among the knights-at-the court.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|1994|p= 695}} Before being knighted, children of the upper nobility could serve as [[page (servant)|page]]s ({{lang-hu|apr\u00f3d}}, {{lang-la|parvulus}}) in the Royal Households, and when they grow up they became \"juveniles-at-the court\" ({{lang-hu|udvari ifjak}}, {{lang-la|aule regi\u00e6

the nobles' estates; according to the new system, the nobles' real property could not be devised by will, but it passed [[by operation of law]] to the owner's heirs upon his death.<ref name=\"History

rule.{{sfn|Engel et al.|1998|p= 123}} In 1385, the young queen had to abdicate in favor of her distant cousin, King [[Charles III of Naples|Charles II]] (1385\u20131386), but her partisans murdered the new king soon and thus she could ascend the throne again.{{sfn|Engel et al.|1998|p = 124}} However, the followers of her murdered opponent's son, King [[Ladislaus of Naples]] rose up in open rebellion and captured her; thus the realm stayed without a monarch.{{sfn|Engel et al.|1998|p= 125}}\n\nAt that moment, the prelates and the \"barons of the realm\" set up a council; they have a seal prepared with the inscription \"Seal of the People of the Kingdom of Hungary\" ({{lang-la|Sigillum regnicolarum regni Hungari\u00e6}}) and issued decrees sealed by it in the name of the \"prelates, barons, notabilities and all nobles of the realm\".{{sfn|F\u00fcgedi|1986 | pages = 285\u2013286}} The members of the council entered into a contract with Queen Mary's fianc\u00e9 and elected him

of the realm\", even if they did not held any higher offices, from other nobles: the Act of 1397 referred to them as the \"barons' sons\" ({{lang-hu|b\u00e1r\u00f3fi}}, {{lang-la|filii baronum}}) while later documents called them \"'''[[magnate]]s'''\" ({{lang-hu|m\u00e1gn\u00e1s}}, {{lang-la|magnates}}).

Children who experienced the death of a family member or a close friend or know someone with a chronic illness have more frequent nightmares than those who are only faced with stress from school or stress from social aspects of daily life.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Stress in Children.\" Sleep and Hypnosis 10.1 (2008): 19-25. ProQuest. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref>\nA study researching the causes of nightmares focuses on patients who have [[sleep apnea]]. The study was conducted to determine whether or not nightmares may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that nightmares were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent nightmares than those without it. The results actually showed that healthy people have more nightmares than the sleep apnea patients.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Oxygen Desaturations: Is Sleep Apnea Related to Heightened Nightmare Frequency?\" Sleep and Breathing 10.4 (2006): 203-9.

In this study, 48 patients (aged 20\u201385 yrs) with obstructive airways disease (OAD), including 21 with and 27 without asthma, were compared with 149 sex- and age-matched controls without respiratory disease. OAD subjects with asthma reported approximately 3 times as many nightmares as controls or OAD subjects without asthma.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232572123 |title = Prevalence of nightmares among patients with asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease &#124; Request PDF}}</ref> The evolutionary purpose of nightmares then could be a mechanism to awaken a person who is in danger.\n\nLucid-dreaming advocate Stephen LaBerge has outlined a possible reason for how dreams are formulated and why nightmares occur with a high frequency. To LaBerge, a dream starts with an individual thought or scene, such as walking down a dimly lit street. Since dreams are not predetermined, the brain responds to the situation by either thinking a good thought or a bad thought, and the dream framework follows from there. Since the prominence of bad thoughts in dreams is higher than good,{{Explain|date=May 2019|reason=What is the evidence for bad thoughts being more frequent?}} the dream will proceed to be a nightmare.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming|last=Stephen|first=LaBerge|publisher=BALLANTINE BOOKS|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThere is a view, possibly featured in the story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', that eating [[cheese]] before sleep can cause nightmares, but there is little scientific evidence for this phenomenon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hammond |first=Claudia |date=17 April 2012 |title=Does cheese give you nightmares? |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares |work=BBC |access-date=7 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] seemed to have shared a belief that people frequently distressed by nightmares could be re-experiencing some stressful event from the past.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coalson |first1=Bob |title=Nightmare help: Treatment of trauma survivors with PTSD. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |date=1995 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013388 |doi=10.1037/0033-3204.32.3.381 }}</ref> Both perspectives on dreams suggest that therapy can provide relief from the dilemma of the nightmarish experience.\n\nHalliday (1987), grouped treatment techniques into four classes.

Children who experienced the death of a family member or a close friend or know someone with a chronic illness have more frequent nightmares than those who are only faced with stress from school or stress from social aspects of daily life.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Stress in Children.\" Sleep and Hypnosis 10.1 (2008): 19-25. ProQuest. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref>\nA study researching the causes of nightmares focuses on patients who have [[sleep apnea]]. The study was conducted to determine whether or not nightmares may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that nightmares were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent nightmares than those without it. The results actually showed that healthy people have more nightmares than the sleep apnea patients.<ref>Schredl, Michael, et al. \"Nightmares and Oxygen Desaturations: Is Sleep Apnea Related to Heightened Nightmare Frequency?\" Sleep and Breathing 10.4 (2006): 203-9.

In this study, 48 patients (aged 20\u201385 yrs) with obstructive airways disease (OAD), including 21 with and 27 without asthma, were compared with 149 sex- and age-matched controls without respiratory disease.

To LaBerge, a dream starts with an individual thought or scene, such as walking down a dimly lit street. Since dreams are not predetermined, the brain responds to the situation by either thinking a good thought or a bad thought, and the dream framework follows from there. Since the prominence of bad thoughts in dreams is higher than good,{{Explain|date=May 2019|reason=What is the evidence for bad thoughts being more frequent?}} the dream will proceed to be a nightmare.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming|last=Stephen|first=LaBerge|publisher=BALLANTINE BOOKS|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThere is a view, possibly featured in the story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', that eating [[cheese]] before sleep can cause nightmares, but there is little scientific evidence for this phenomenon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hammond |first=Claudia |date=17 April 2012 |title=Does cheese give you nightmares? |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares |work=BBC |access-date=7 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\n[[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] seemed to have shared a belief that people frequently distressed by nightmares could be re-experiencing some stressful event from the past.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coalson |first1=Bob |title=Nightmare help: Treatment of trauma survivors with PTSD. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |date=1995 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=381\u2013388 |doi=10.1037/0033-3204.32.3.381 }}</ref> Both perspectives on dreams suggest that therapy can provide relief from the dilemma of the nightmarish experience.\n\nHalliday (1987), grouped treatment techniques into four classes.

He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
