An example might be smiling inducing an involuntary contraction of the [[eye muscles]], causing a person to squint when smiling. [[Facial muscles|Facial]] and [[extraocular muscles]] are affected most often; in rare cases, a person's hands might perform mirror movements.\n\nSynkinesis is usually caused by dysfunction of a particular [[nerve]]. Potential causes include improper healing after nerve [[Injury|trauma]] or [[neurodegeneration]], as occurs in [[Parkinson's disease]]. In congenital cases, mutations of genes involved in nerve growth, specifically axonal growth have been found. Rarely, it occurs as part of syndromes with neuroendocrine problems, such as [[Kallman syndrome]]. The prognosis is usually good with normal intelligence and lifespan. Treatment depends on the cause, but is largely conservative with facial retraining or mime therapy, if needed, while [[Botox]] and [[surgery]] are used as last resort.\n==Types==\nMost cases involve the [[cranial nerves]], which innervate many small cranial muscles, such as the [[facial muscles]] and the [[extraocular muscles]]. This is in contrast to areas of body where miswiring of the larger muscles is less evident due the size of the muscles. Synkinesis can also involve the upper limbs, especially hands which is quite rare, at 1 case in 1 million.<ref name=nlm/> In some cases, nerves improperly regenerate into glands, such as [[lacrimal glands]], leading to a condition known as crocodile tears or [[Bogorad's syndrome]].\n\n===Facial synkinesis===\nFacial synkinesis is a common [[sequelae|sequela]] to [[Bell's Palsy|Idiopathic Facial Nerve Paralysis]], also called Bell\u2019s Palsy or Facial Palsy.<ref name=\"Beurskens CH, Heymans PG. 2006 177\u201383\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Beurskens CH, Heymans PG |title=Mime therapy improves facial symmetry in people with long-term facial nerve paresis: a randomised controlled trial. |journal=Aust J Physiother |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=177\u201383 |year=2006 |pmid=16942452 |doi=10.1016/s0004-9514(06)70026-5|doi-access=free }}</ref> Bell\u2019s Palsy, which is thought to occur due to a viral reactivation which can lead (through unknown mechanisms) to diffuse axon demyelination and degeneration of the seventh cranial nerve, results in a hemifacial paralysis due to non-functionality of the nerve.

After nerve trauma around the eye, a combination of any two of these three cranial nerves have been shown to be involved with extra-ocular synkinesis. Moreover, while the abducens and the trochlear nerve each innervate one specific muscle, the oculomotor nerve has many functions including eyelid retraction and pupil constriction. Thus, during synkinesis, one of these functions may be involved.

These aberrant branches can simultaneously innervate different subdivisions of the facial nerve.<ref name=nakamura/>\n \nFor example: compression to the facial nerve causes a lesion and the set of axons that innervates the [[orbicularis oris]] (mouth muscle) degenerate.  Once the compression has relieved, regeneration of axons from the lesion site begins. This time though, only 50% of the set of axons that innervate the orbicularis oris successfully reinnervate the original site. The other half aberrantly branched off and innervated the [[orbicularis oculi]](eye muscle). Thus, when the patient purses their lips, the [[ipsilateral]] eye will squint.\n\nThe hypothesis assumes that disorganized regeneration occurs at the site of the lesion. On the contrary, recent research by Choi and Raisman<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi D, Raisman G |title=After facial nerve damage, regenerating axons become aberrant throughout the length of the nerve and not only at the site of the lesion: an experimental study. |journal=Br J Neurosurg |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=45\u20138 |year=2004 |pmid=15040714 |doi=10.1080/02688690410001660454}}</ref> has provided a more thorough understanding of synkinesis through aberrant axonal regeneration. Their study has shown that regenerating axons become disorganized throughout the length of the nerve and not only at the site of the lesion. Previously, many developed treatment strategies (that inevitably failed) were invented based on the original hypothesis by only focusing on the lesion site for improving the organization of regeneration. The new modification to the hypothesis could allow for better success in developing treatments.\n\n===Ephaptic transmission===\n[[ephaptic coupling|Ephaptic transmission]] is when two nerves communicate with each other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a [[myelin]] sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to \u201ccross-talk\u201d and send action potentials in both directions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sadjadpour K. |title=After Postfacial palsy phenomena: faulty nerve regeneration or ephaptic transmission? |journal=Brain Res. |volume=95 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=403\u20136 |year=1975 |pmid=168941 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(75)90117-1}}</ref>\n\n===Nuclear hyperexcitability===\nThe basis of this hypothesis is as follows: after a lesion, axonal degeneration (via [[Wallerian degeneration]]) occurs. The post-synaptic cell consequently becomes deprived of input and becomes more sensitive to neurotransmitters (e.g. creating additional receptors). Subsequently, nearby residual undamaged axons can provide a source of neurotransmitter to the deprived post-synaptic cell. Since the post-synaptic cell is hypersensitive, the neurotransmitters that reach it from an axon of another nerve will successfully provide stimulation. This consequently creates undesired peripheral movement (i.e. synkinesis).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sibony PA, Lessell S, ((Gittinger JW Jr)) |title=Acquired oculomotor synkinesis. |journal=Surv.

Since synkinesis is observed much earlier, aberrant regeneration and ephaptic communication fail to explain for this observation thus providing evidence that nuclear hyper-excitability is an important factor in the mechanism of synkinesis development.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Facial Nerve|last= May |first= Mark |authorlink= |author2=Barry M. Schaitkin  |year=1999|publisher= Thieme |isbn= 0-86577-821-3|pages=49}}</ref>\n\nAlthough these three mechanisms have been argued for and against in various ways, it has become more accepted that synkinesis develops through a combination of these mechanisms.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n===Measurement===\nUntil May 2007, there was no clinical scale to measure synkinesis. A study led by Mehta et al.<ref name=\"Mehta RP, WernickRobinson M, Hadlock TA. 2007 923\u20136\"/> has validated the use of a newly designed instrument to evaluate facial synkinesis called the Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). The instrument, consisting of nine questions, was found to be both reliable and valid. In addition, it is simple, easy to administer, and inexpensive. Its analyses can allow for treatment options to be evaluated.\n\n==Treatment==\nExperimental research for treatment has been mostly focused on facial synkinesis due to its abundant prevalence compared to extra-ocular synkinesis. Additionally, since the extra-ocular muscles are hidden within the orbits, there is a limit on the type of practical treatments that can be established (e.g. massage). Treatments for synkinesis in general include facial retraining, biofeedback, mime therapy, and Botox and surgery, as a last resort.\n\n===Facial retraining===\nFacial retraining therapy builds upon the idea that neurons are constantly in a dynamic state. In other words, there is constant growth and regression of neuronal projections dependent on the stimuli produced. To reduce synkinesis, facial retraining teaches the patient techniques for increasing wanted movements while focusing on restricting unwanted movement. If, for example, the mouth moves whenever the eyes blink voluntarily, facial retraining techniques will teach the patient to slowly close the eyes while actively focusing on keeping the mouth muscles still. Facial retraining has shown to be very successful with almost a 60-70% average decrease in synkinesis reported after 7 months.<ref name = brach>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brach JS, VanSwearingen JM, Lenert J, Johnson PC |title=Facial neuromuscular retraining for oral synkinesis. |journal=Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=99 |issue=7 |pages=1922\u201331 |year=1997 |pmid=9180715 |doi=10.1097/00006534-199706000-00017}}</ref>\n\n===Biofeedback===\n[[Biofeedback]] therapy for facial synkinesis aims to increase the patient\u2019s awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for [[proprioceptive]] feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for proprioceptive feedback).<ref name = brach/> Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer in the form of waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brudny J, Hammerschlag PE, Cohen NL, Ransohoff J |title= Electromyographic rehabilitation of facial function and introduction of a facial paralysis grading scale for hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis. |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=405\u201310 |year=1988 |pmid= 3352440 |doi= 10.1288/00005537-198804000-00010}}</ref> The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross B, Nedzelski JM, McLean JA |title=Efficacy of feedback training in long-standing facial nerve paresis. |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=101 |issue=7 |pages=744\u201350 |year=1991 |pmid=2062155 |doi=10.1288/00005537-199107000-00009}}</ref> Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.<br>\nA study by Nakamura et al. has shown that biofeedback works better for prevention of synkinesis as opposed to treatment of synkinesis. Due to the extreme efforts needed to achieve improvements during synkinesis, Nakamura et al. observed that patients will often fail to reach their desired goal because of the difficulty of maintaining motivation during training. The desired course of action is to catch the patient shortly after facial nerve trauma and teach the patient biofeedback techniques. This course of action has been experimentally proven to significantly reduce the development of synkinesis.<ref name=nakamura/>\n\n===Mime therapy===\nMime therapy was introduced in the Netherlands in 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Beurskens CH, Heymans PG |title=Positive effects of mime therapy on sequelae of facial paralysis: stiffness, lip mobility, and social and physical aspects of facial disability. |journal=Otol.

It was then later observed that people who had post-facial palsy synkinesis also benefited from this therapy. It wasn\u2019t until 2003 that Beurskens and Heymans were able to experimentally conclude that mime therapy was indeed a good treatment choice for synkinesis. Furthermore, later studies by Beurskens et al. have shown that benefits obtained from mime therapy are stable one year after therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Beurskens CH, Heymans PG, Oostendorp RA |title=Stability of benefits of mime therapy in sequelae of facial nerve paresis during a 1-year period. |journal=Otol.

The components include: massage, stretching exercises, exercises to coordinate both halves of the face, etc.<ref name=\"Beurskens CH, Heymans PG. 2006 177\u201383\"/> The overall aim of mime therapy is to develop a conscious connection between the use of facial muscles and emotional expression. While facial retraining therapy is more focused on treating slight synkinetic movements, mime therapy aims to increase the overall vigor of the muscles through active exercises, while in the process of doing so, teaching the face to decrease unwanted synkinetic movements.\n\n===Botox===\n[[Botox]] (botulinum toxin) is a new and versatile tool for the treatment of synkinesis.

An example might be smiling inducing an involuntary contraction of the [[eye muscles]], causing a person to squint when smiling. [[Facial muscles|Facial]] and [[extraocular muscles]] are affected most often; in rare cases, a person's hands might perform mirror movements.\n\nSynkinesis is usually caused by dysfunction of a particular [[nerve]]. Potential causes include improper healing after nerve [[Injury|trauma]] or [[neurodegeneration]], as occurs in [[Parkinson's disease]]. In congenital cases, mutations of genes involved in nerve growth, specifically axonal growth have been found. Rarely, it occurs as part of syndromes with neuroendocrine problems, such as [[Kallman syndrome]]. The prognosis is usually good with normal intelligence and lifespan. Treatment depends on the cause, but is largely conservative with facial retraining or mime therapy, if needed, while [[Botox]] and [[surgery]] are used as last resort.\n==Types==\nMost cases involve the [[cranial nerves]], which innervate many small cranial muscles, such as the [[facial muscles]] and the [[extraocular muscles]]. This is in contrast to areas of body where miswiring of the larger muscles is less evident due the size of the muscles. Synkinesis can also involve the upper limbs, especially hands which is quite rare, at 1 case in 1 million.<ref name=nlm/> In some cases, nerves improperly regenerate into glands, such as [[lacrimal glands]], leading to a condition known as crocodile tears or [[Bogorad's syndrome]].\n\n===Facial synkinesis===\nFacial synkinesis is a common [[sequelae|sequela]] to [[Bell's Palsy|Idiopathic Facial Nerve Paralysis]], also called Bell\u2019s Palsy or Facial Palsy.<ref name=\"Beurskens CH, Heymans PG. 2006 177\u201383\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Beurskens CH, Heymans PG |title=Mime therapy improves facial symmetry in people with long-term facial nerve paresis: a randomised controlled trial. |journal=Aust J Physiother |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=177\u201383 |year=2006 |pmid=16942452 |doi=10.1016/s0004-9514(06)70026-5|doi-access=free }}</ref> Bell\u2019s Palsy, which is thought to occur due to a viral reactivation which can lead (through unknown mechanisms) to diffuse axon demyelination and degeneration of the seventh cranial nerve, results in a hemifacial paralysis due to non-functionality of the nerve.

These aberrant branches can simultaneously innervate different subdivisions of the facial nerve.<ref name=nakamura/>\n \nFor example: compression to the facial nerve causes a lesion and the set of axons that innervates the [[orbicularis oris]] (mouth muscle) degenerate.  Once the compression has relieved, regeneration of axons from the lesion site begins. This time though, only 50% of the set of axons that innervate the orbicularis oris successfully reinnervate the original site. The other half aberrantly branched off and innervated the [[orbicularis oculi]](eye muscle). Thus, when the patient purses their lips, the [[ipsilateral]] eye will squint.\n\nThe hypothesis assumes that disorganized regeneration occurs at the site of the lesion. On the contrary, recent research by Choi and Raisman<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi D, Raisman G |title=After facial nerve damage, regenerating axons become aberrant throughout the length of the nerve and not only at the site of the lesion: an experimental study. |journal=Br J Neurosurg |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=45\u20138 |year=2004 |pmid=15040714 |doi=10.1080/02688690410001660454}}</ref> has provided a more thorough understanding of synkinesis through aberrant axonal regeneration. Their study has shown that regenerating axons become disorganized throughout the length of the nerve and not only at the site of the lesion. Previously, many developed treatment strategies (that inevitably failed) were invented based on the original hypothesis by only focusing on the lesion site for improving the organization of regeneration. The new modification to the hypothesis could allow for better success in developing treatments.\n\n===Ephaptic transmission===\n[[ephaptic coupling|Ephaptic transmission]] is when two nerves communicate with each other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a [[myelin]] sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to \u201ccross-talk\u201d and send action potentials in both directions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sadjadpour K. |title=After Postfacial palsy phenomena: faulty nerve regeneration or ephaptic transmission? |journal=Brain Res. |volume=95 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=403\u20136 |year=1975 |pmid=168941 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(75)90117-1}}</ref>\n\n===Nuclear hyperexcitability===\nThe basis of this hypothesis is as follows: after a lesion, axonal degeneration (via [[Wallerian degeneration]]) occurs. The post-synaptic cell consequently becomes deprived of input and becomes more sensitive to neurotransmitters (e.g. creating additional receptors). Subsequently, nearby residual undamaged axons can provide a source of neurotransmitter to the deprived post-synaptic cell. Since the post-synaptic cell is hypersensitive, the neurotransmitters that reach it from an axon of another nerve will successfully provide stimulation. This consequently creates undesired peripheral movement (i.e. synkinesis).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sibony PA, Lessell S, ((Gittinger JW Jr)) |title=Acquired oculomotor synkinesis. |journal=Surv.

Since synkinesis is observed much earlier, aberrant regeneration and ephaptic communication fail to explain for this observation thus providing evidence that nuclear hyper-excitability is an important factor in the mechanism of synkinesis development.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Facial Nerve|last= May |first= Mark |authorlink= |author2=Barry M.

A study led by Mehta et al.<ref name=\"Mehta RP, WernickRobinson M, Hadlock TA. 2007 923\u20136\"/> has validated the use of a newly designed instrument to evaluate facial synkinesis called the Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). The instrument, consisting of nine questions, was found to be both reliable and valid. In addition, it is simple, easy to administer, and inexpensive. Its analyses can allow for treatment options to be evaluated.\n\n==Treatment==\nExperimental research for treatment has been mostly focused on facial synkinesis due to its abundant prevalence compared to extra-ocular synkinesis. Additionally, since the extra-ocular muscles are hidden within the orbits, there is a limit on the type of practical treatments that can be established (e.g. massage). Treatments for synkinesis in general include facial retraining, biofeedback, mime therapy, and Botox and surgery, as a last resort.\n\n===Facial retraining===\nFacial retraining therapy builds upon the idea that neurons are constantly in a dynamic state. In other words, there is constant growth and regression of neuronal projections dependent on the stimuli produced. To reduce synkinesis, facial retraining teaches the patient techniques for increasing wanted movements while focusing on restricting unwanted movement. If, for example, the mouth moves whenever the eyes blink voluntarily, facial retraining techniques will teach the patient to slowly close the eyes while actively focusing on keeping the mouth muscles still. Facial retraining has shown to be very successful with almost a 60-70% average decrease in synkinesis reported after 7 months.<ref name = brach>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brach JS, VanSwearingen JM, Lenert J, Johnson PC |title=Facial neuromuscular retraining for oral synkinesis. |journal=Plast Reconstr Surg |volume=99 |issue=7 |pages=1922\u201331 |year=1997 |pmid=9180715 |doi=10.1097/00006534-199706000-00017}}</ref>\n\n===Biofeedback===\n[[Biofeedback]] therapy for facial synkinesis aims to increase the patient\u2019s awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for [[proprioceptive]] feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for proprioceptive feedback).<ref name = brach/> Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer in the form of waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brudny J, Hammerschlag PE, Cohen NL, Ransohoff J |title= Electromyographic rehabilitation of facial function and introduction of a facial paralysis grading scale for hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis. |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=405\u201310 |year=1988 |pmid= 3352440 |doi= 10.1288/00005537-198804000-00010}}</ref> The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross B, Nedzelski JM, McLean JA |title=Efficacy of feedback training in long-standing facial nerve paresis. |journal=Laryngoscope |volume=101 |issue=7 |pages=744\u201350 |year=1991 |pmid=2062155 |doi=10.1288/00005537-199107000-00009}}</ref> Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.<br>\nA study by Nakamura et al. has shown that biofeedback works better for prevention of synkinesis as opposed to treatment of synkinesis. Due to the extreme efforts needed to achieve improvements during synkinesis, Nakamura et al. observed that patients will often fail to reach their desired goal because of the difficulty of maintaining motivation during training. The desired course of action is to catch the patient shortly after facial nerve trauma and teach the patient biofeedback techniques. This course of action has been experimentally proven to significantly reduce the development of synkinesis.<ref name=nakamura/>\n\n===Mime therapy===\nMime therapy was introduced in the Netherlands in 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Beurskens CH, Heymans PG |title=Positive effects of mime therapy on sequelae of facial paralysis: stiffness, lip mobility, and social and physical aspects of facial disability. |journal=Otol.

Furthermore, later studies by Beurskens et al. have shown that benefits obtained from mime therapy are stable one year after therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Beurskens CH, Heymans PG, Oostendorp RA |title=Stability of benefits of mime therapy in sequelae of facial nerve paresis during a 1-year period. |journal=Otol.

The components include: massage, stretching exercises, exercises to coordinate both halves of the face, etc.<ref name=\"Beurskens CH, Heymans PG. 2006 177\u201383\"/> The overall aim of mime therapy is to develop a conscious connection between the use of facial muscles and emotional expression. While facial retraining therapy is more focused on treating slight synkinetic movements, mime therapy aims to increase the overall vigor of the muscles through active exercises, while in the process of doing so, teaching the face to decrease unwanted synkinetic movements.\n\n===Botox===\n[[Botox]] (botulinum toxin) is a new and versatile tool for the treatment of synkinesis.

Updates for iOS are released through the [[iTunes]] software and, since [[iOS 5]], via [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] software updates. With the announcement of iOS 5 on June 6, 2011, a USB connection to iTunes was no longer needed to activate iOS devices; data synchronization can happen automatically and wirelessly through Apple's [[iCloud]] service. Major new iOS releases are announced yearly during the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC), and are usually released in September of the same year, usually coinciding with the release of new iPhone models. On September 24, 2019, Apple rebranded the operating system for the iPad line to [[iPadOS]]. iPadOS is similar to iOS but has received a few tablet oriented features. The most recent stable release for iPhone and iPod Touch, [[#13.4.1|iOS 13.4.1]], was released on April 7, 2020. The most recent beta release, [[#13.4.5 Beta 2|13.4.5 Beta 2]], was released on April 15, 2020.\n\n==Overview==\n{{iOS versions}}\nJune 2007 saw the official release of what eventually became iOS&nbsp;\u2013 concurrently with the first iPhone. iOS did not have an official name until the official release of the iPhone software development kit ([[IOS SDK|iPhone SDK]]) on March 6, 2008. Before then, Apple marketing simply stated that iPhone ran a version of [[MacOS|Mac OS X]] made specifically for iPhone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006005308/http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html|archive-date=October 6, 2007 |title=Apple - iPhone - Features|date=October 6, 2007}}</ref> When iOS was introduced, it was named ''iPhone OS''. It was officially renamed iOS on June 7, 2010, with the announcement and introduction of iPad. The introduction of iPad, and the existence of iPod Touch, meant the iPhone was no longer the only device to run the mobile operating system. iOS 4 was the first major iOS release that reflected the name change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/151812/2010/06/iphone_os_4_wwdc.html |title=iPhone OS gets new name, video calling|date=June 27, 2010|newspaper=Macworld|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> Apple licensed the \"iOS\" trademark from [[Cisco Systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cisco.com/news/cisco_and_apple_agreement_on_ios_trademark|title=Cisco and Apple Agreement on IOS Trademark|date=June 7, 2010|website=blogs@Cisco - Cisco Blogs|language=en-US|access-date=August 6, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gna6TpYh?url=http://blogs.cisco.com/news/cisco_and_apple_agreement_on_ios_trademark|archive-date=May 22, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nApple concurrently provides the same version of iOS for the comparable model of iPhone and iPod Touch, usually devices released in the same calendar year. iPhone users receive all software updates for free, while iPod Touch users paid for the 2.0 and 3.0 major software updates.

With this release, Apple dropped support for the original [[iPhone (1st generation)|iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch (1st generation)]], which is the first time Apple had dropped support for any device in an iOS release. The [[iPhone 3G]] and the [[iPod Touch (2nd generation)]] were capable of running iOS 4, but had limited features. For example, both devices lack multitasking capabilities and the ability to set a home screen wallpaper. However, iOS 4 was the first major release that iPod Touch users did not have to pay any money for. The release of iOS 4.2.1 brought compatibility to the original [[iPad (1st generation)|iPad]] and was the final release supported on the iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation) due to major performance issues. The release of iOS 4.3 brought [[iPad 2]] compatibility.<ref name=\"iPad2min\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/03/02Apple-Launches-iPad-2/ |title=Apple Launches iPad

With this release, Apple dropped support for the [[iPhone 3GS]] due to hardware limitations and the [[iPod Touch (4th generation)]] due to performance issues. iOS 7 has limited support on the [[iPad 2]] and the [[iPhone 4]] since they do not support Siri. However, other devices from the [[iPhone 4S]] onwards, [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]] onwards, the [[iPad (3rd generation)]] onwards, and the [[iPad Mini (1st generation)]] onwards were fully supported. The release of iOS 7.0.3 brought support for the [[iPad Air]] and [[iPad Mini 2]]. iOS 7.1.2 was the final release on the iPhone 4. It became unsupported on November 23, 2018.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#ececec; padding:0 0.5em\" colspan=\"5\"|Table of versions: iOS 7.0.x\n|-\n\n|colspan=\"5\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-top:2px;

With this release, Apple dropped support for one device, the [[iPhone 4]]. iOS 8 has limited support on the [[iPad 2]], [[iPhone 4S]], and the [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]], as Apple received widespread complaints of extremely poor/slow performance from owners of these devices.

With this release, Apple did not drop support for any iOS devices. Therefore, iOS 9 was supported on the [[iPhone 4S]] onwards, [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]] onwards, the [[iPad 2]] onwards, and the [[iPad Mini (1st generation)]] onwards. However, iOS 9 has limited support on the iPhone 4S, iPad 2 and [[iPad (3rd generation)]], iPad Mini (1st generation), and iPod Touch (5th generation). This release made the iPad 2 the first device to support six major releases of iOS, supporting iOS 4 thru iOS 9. Despite Apple's promise of better performance on these devices, there were still widespread complaints that the issue had not been fixed. iOS 9.3.5 is the final release on the iPod Touch (5th generation), the Wi-Fi-only iPad 2, the Wi-Fi-only iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi-only iPad Mini (1st generation); iOS 9.3.6 is the final release on the iPhone 4S, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad 2, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad Mini (1st generation).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#ececec; padding:0 0.5em\" colspan=\"5\"|Table of versions: iOS 9.0.x\n|-\n\n|colspan=\"5\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:2px;\"\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPad family:</small>\n*[[iPad 2|2]]\n*[[iPad (3rd generation)|3]]\n*[[iPad (4th generation)|4]]\n*[[iPad Air|Air]]\n*[[iPad Air 2|Air 2]]\n*[[iPad Mini (1st generation)|Mini 1]]\n*[[iPad Mini 2|Mini 2]]\n*[[iPad Mini 3|Mini 3]]\n*[[iPad Mini 4|Mini 4]]}}\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPhone family:</small>\n*[[iPhone 4S|4S]]\n*[[iPhone 5|5]]\n*[[iPhone 5C|5C]]\n*[[iPhone 5S|5S]]\n*[[iPhone 6|6]]\n*[[iPhone 6|6 Plus]]\n*[[iPhone 6S|6S]]\n*[[iPhone 6S|6S Plus]]}}\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPod family:</small>\n*[[iPod Touch (5th generation)|5]]\n*[[iPod Touch (6th generation)|6]]}}\n|}\n\n''Limited support on [[iPad 2]], [[iPad (3rd generation)]], [[iPad Mini (1st generation)]], [[iPhone 4S]], and [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]]''<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|date=September 2015|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/2/#h4 |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed|work=Ars Technica|access-date=October 22, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|Version\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|Build\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|<abbr title=\"Modem firmware\">Baseband</abbr>\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|{{nowrap|Release date}}\n!Features\n|-valign=\"top\"\n\n!style=\"background:#ececec;\"|9.0\n|13A340 {{ref|M4|M4}} {{ref|M4C|M4C}}\n13A342 {{ref|P6S|P6S}}<br>\n13A343 {{ref|P6SP|P6SP}}<br>\n13A344{{ref|P4S|P4S}} {{ref|P5|P5}} {{ref|P5C|P5C}} {{ref|P5S|P5S}} {{ref|P6|P6}} {{ref|P6P|P6P}} {{ref|T5|T5}} {{ref|T6|T6}} {{ref|S2|S2}} {{ref|S2C|S2C}} {{ref|S2D|S2D}} {{ref|S3|S3}} {{ref|S3L|S3L}} {{ref|S3D|S3D}} {{ref|S4|S4}} {{ref|S4L|S4L}} {{ref|S4D|S4D}} {{ref|S5|S5}} {{ref|S5L|S5L}} {{ref|S5D|S5D}} {{ref|S6|S6}} {{ref|S6L|S6L}} {{ref|S6D|S6D}} {{ref|M1|M1}} {{ref|M1C|M1C}} {{ref|M2|M2}} {{ref|M2C|M2C}} {{ref|M3|M3}} {{ref|M3C|M3C}}\n|04.12.09 {{ref|S2C|S2C}}\n3.0.04 {{ref|S2D|S2D}}<br>\n5.3.04 {{ref|P4S|P4S}}<br>\n5.2.03 {{ref|S3L|S3L}} {{ref|S3D|S3D}}<br>\n10.00.00 {{ref|P5|P5}} {{ref|S4L|S4L}} {{ref|S4D|S4D}} {{ref|M1C|M1C}}<br>\n5.00.11 {{ref|P5C|P5C}}<br>\n6.00.00 {{ref|P5S|P5S}} {{ref|S5L|S5L}} {{ref|S5D|S5D}} {{ref|M2C|M2C}} {{ref|M3C|M3C}}<br>\n4.01.00 {{ref|P6|P6}} {{ref|P6P|P6P}} {{ref|M4C|M4C}}<br>\n1.00.05 {{ref|P6S|P6S}} {{ref|P6SP|P6SP}}\n|{{Start date and age|2015|9|16}}\n|''Initial release on [[iPhone 6S]], [[iPhone 6S Plus]], and [[iPad Mini 4]]''\n*[[iPhone 4S]] and [[iPad 2]] was advertised a speed boost, including other 32-bit devices.\n*[[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]\n**App Store reviews no longer allowed when using a beta version of iOS.\n**App Thinning allows the App Store to only download the assets needed for the device being used.\n**On-demand resources allows iConnect to host assets for later download.\n*[[CarPlay]]\n**Adds support for wireless CarPlay.\n**Lets users access the car's settings (such as climate control) through the CarPlay interface itself.\n**Battery level indicator added to onscreen display.\n**Plays back audio messages, letting the user hear from people in their own voices.\n**Full support for car knob controls, so the user can tilt and spin to scroll through lists or pan around in Maps.\n*Find My Friends\n**Find My Friends is now pre-installed.\n**Notification Center Widget.\n*Find My iPhone\n**Find My iPhone is now pre-installed.\n*Health\n**Added landscape view.\n**Adds support for reproductive health, UV exposure, water intake and sedentary state data types.\n*[[iBooks]]\n**Safari extension to turn a webpage into a PDF and open it in iBooks.\n*[[Mail (OS X)|Mail]]\n**Attachments receive can now be saved and attachments can be added to messages from [[iCloud]] Drive or other document providers while composing a new message.\n**Support for saving attachments to [[iCloud]] Drive.\n**Icons added to left and right swipe gestures.\n**Support for Markup allows annotating images or PDF attachments with text, shapes, or signatures.\n*[[Apple Maps|Maps]]\n**Support for public transit lines, station details with exits and entrances, schedules and directions in select major cities.

With this release, Apple dropped support for the 32-bit [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C]], and [[iPad (4th generation)]], making iOS a 64-bit-only OS that only runs 64-bit apps. However, all other devices from the [[iPhone 6S|iPhone 6S/6S Plus]] onwards, [[iPhone SE (1st generation)]], [[iPad Pro]], and [[iPad (5th generation)]] onwards are fully supported. iOS 11.0.1 brought support for the [[iPhone X]] and iOS 11.3 brought support for the [[iPad (6th generation)]]. The final version of iOS 11 was iOS 11.4.1.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#ececec; padding:0 0.5em\" colspan=\"5\"|Table of versions: iOS 11.0.x\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-top:2px;

With this release, Apple did not drop support for any iOS devices.

You can also set a schedule for what time Dark Mode comes on, and what time Light Mode comes back on.\n*[[Siri]]\n**Siri's voice is now done by software called \"Neural TTS\" instead of human voice clips, making Siri sound much more natural.\n**Siri can now play audio, including music, podcasts, audio books, and radio, with third-party apps.\n**There is now an option for an Indian-English voice.\n**Siri now offers personalized suggestions in Apple Podcasts, Safari, and Maps. Siri can also now detect reminders in messages and events in third-party apps.\n**Siri can now tune into radio shows on command.\n*Keyboard\n**The QuickType keyboard now includes QuickPath, which allows the user to type in a word by sliding a finger between the letters without moving it up. QuickPath supports English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese.\n**Swiping or tapping to type works interchangeably, even mid-sentence.\n**Alternate word options now appear in the predictive bar.\n**Dictation will automatically detect what language a user is speaking. This language will be chosen from up to four keyboard languages enabled on the device.\n*Camera\n**After taking a picture in Portrait Mode, the user can adjust the position and intensity of each Portrait lighting effect.\n**A new Portrait Lighting effect, called High-Key Mono, \"creates a beautiful, classic look with a monochromatic subject on a white background.\"\n**Portrait Segmentation API now has skin, hair, and teeth segmentation.\n**All-new Camera app on the iPhone 11 series\n*App Store\n**[[Apple Arcade]]: A new subscription service with over 100 new games, with no ads or additional purchases.\n**The App Store now has support for Arabic and Hebrew in stories, collections and lists, product pages, and searches.\n**Apps with large sizes (especially games) can now be downloaded over a cellular connection, but the user will be warned if the file size exceeds a certain threshold.\n*Maps\n**The map itself has been redone from the ground up. According to Apple, it features \"significantly improved and more realistic details\" for areas like roads, beaches, parks, buildings, and more.\n**The user can now explore the area they are going to before they arrive with a 3D, 360-degree experience.\n**Collections of favorite locations can be built and shared with others.\n**The user can now make a list of places they visit often to access them quickly.\n**A feature called Junction View helps drivers in China eliminate wrong turns and directional misses by lining them up in the correct lane before they need to turn or enter an elevated road.\n**The process of submitting customer feedback has been redesigned to be faster.\n**Siri's navigation uses more natural language. For example, instead of saying \"in ''x'' feet turn left,\" it says \"turn left at the next traffic light\". Navigation is also more accurate.\n**The user can now see departure times live, the location of their bus or train on its route, and a more detailed schedule of transit stops.\n**Flight details now include info about a terminal, gate locations, departure times, and more.\n**Place cards have more improved info, such as Today@Apple sessions at Apple Store locations, and movie theater time listings.\n**MapKit now has vector overlays, point-of-interest filtering, camera zoom and pan limits, and Dark Mode support.\n**[[CarPlay]] now has easier route planning, search, and navigation. It also includes Junction View (China only), Favorites, and Collections.\n*Performance\n**Apps can now launch up to twice as fast as on iOS 12.\n**Unlocking the iPhone X, XS, XS Max, and XR using [[Face ID]] is up to 30% faster compared to iOS 12.\n**Apps from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] are packaged in a new way, making them as small as half the size compared to iOS 12, which makes them download faster and take up less storage.\n**App updates are on average 60% smaller compared to iOS 12, allowing for faster downloads.\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"

operating system, developed by [[Apple Inc.]] for [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[HomePod]]. Updates for iOS are released through the [[iTunes]] software and, since [[iOS 5]], via [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] software updates. With the announcement of iOS 5 on June 6, 2011, a USB connection to iTunes was no longer needed to activate iOS devices; data synchronization can happen automatically and wirelessly through Apple's [[iCloud]] service. Major new iOS releases are announced yearly during the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC), and are usually released in September of the same year, usually coinciding with the release of new iPhone models. On September 24, 2019, Apple rebranded the operating system for the iPad line to [[iPadOS]]. iPadOS is similar to iOS but has received a few tablet oriented features. The most recent stable release for iPhone and iPod Touch, [[#13.4.1|iOS 13.4.1]], was released on April 7, 2020. The most recent beta release, [[#13.4.5 Beta 2|13.4.5 Beta 2]], was released on April 15, 2020.\n\n==Overview==\n{{iOS versions}}\nJune 2007 saw the official release of what eventually became iOS&nbsp;\u2013 concurrently with the first iPhone. iOS did not have an official name until the official release of the iPhone software development kit ([[IOS SDK|iPhone SDK]]) on March 6, 2008. Before then, Apple marketing simply stated that iPhone ran a version of [[MacOS|Mac OS X]] made specifically for iPhone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006005308/http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html|archive-date=October 6, 2007 |title=Apple - iPhone - Features|date=October 6, 2007}}</ref> When iOS was introduced, it was named ''iPhone OS''. It was officially renamed iOS on June 7, 2010, with the announcement and introduction of iPad. The introduction of iPad, and the existence of iPod Touch, meant the iPhone was no longer the only device to run the mobile operating system. iOS 4 was the first major iOS release that reflected the name change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/151812/2010/06/iphone_os_4_wwdc.html |title=iPhone OS gets new name, video calling|date=June 27, 2010|newspaper=Macworld|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> Apple licensed the \"iOS\" trademark from [[Cisco Systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cisco.com/news/cisco_and_apple_agreement_on_ios_trademark|title=Cisco and Apple Agreement on IOS Trademark|date=June 7, 2010|website=blogs@Cisco - Cisco Blogs|language=en-US|access-date=August 6, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gna6TpYh?url=http://blogs.cisco.com/news/cisco_and_apple_agreement_on_ios_trademark|archive-date=May 22, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nApple concurrently provides the same version of iOS for the comparable model of iPhone and iPod Touch, usually devices released in the same calendar year. iPhone users receive all software updates for free, while iPod Touch users paid for the 2.0 and 3.0 major software updates.

With this release, Apple dropped support for the original [[iPhone (1st generation)|iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch (1st generation)]], which is the first time Apple had dropped support for any device in an iOS release. The [[iPhone 3G]] and the [[iPod Touch (2nd generation)]] were capable of running iOS 4, but had limited features. For example, both devices lack multitasking capabilities and the ability to set a home screen wallpaper. However, iOS 4 was the first major release that iPod Touch users did not have to pay any money for. The release of iOS 4.2.1 brought compatibility to the original [[iPad (1st generation)|iPad]] and was the final release supported on the iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation) due to major performance issues. The release of iOS 4.3 brought [[iPad 2]] compatibility.<ref name=\"iPad2min\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/03/02Apple-Launches-iPad-2/ |title=Apple Launches iPad

With this release, Apple dropped support for the [[iPhone 3GS]] due to hardware limitations and the [[iPod Touch (4th generation)]] due to performance issues. iOS 7 has limited support on the [[iPad 2]] and the [[iPhone 4]] since they do not support Siri. However, other devices from the [[iPhone 4S]] onwards, [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]] onwards, the [[iPad (3rd generation)]] onwards, and the [[iPad Mini (1st generation)]] onwards were fully supported.

With this release, Apple dropped support for one device, the [[iPhone 4]]. iOS 8 has limited support on the [[iPad 2]], [[iPhone 4S]], and the [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]], as Apple received widespread complaints of extremely poor/slow performance from owners of these devices. All other devices from the [[iPhone 5]] onwards, [[iPod Touch (6th generation)]] onwards, the [[iPad (3rd generation)]] onwards, and the [[iPad Mini (1st generation)]] onwards were fully supported. The release of iOS 8.1 brought support for the [[iPad Air 2]] and [[iPad Mini 3]], and the release of iOS 8.4 brought support for the iPod Touch (6th generation). iOS 8.3 was the first version of iOS to have public beta testing available, where users could test the beta for upcoming releases of iOS and send feedback to Apple about bugs or issues. The final version of iOS 8 was iOS 8.4.1.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#ececec; padding:0 0.5em\" colspan=\"5\"|Table of versions: iOS 8.0.x\n|-\n\n|colspan=\"5\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:2px;\"\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPad family:</small>\n*[[iPad 2|2]]\n*[[iPad (3rd generation)|3]]\n*[[iPad (4th generation)|4]]\n*[[iPad Air|Air]]\n*[[iPad Mini (1st generation)|Mini]]\n*[[iPad Mini 2|Mini 2]]}}\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPhone family:</small>\n*[[iPhone 4S|4S]]\n*[[iPhone 5|5]]\n*[[iPhone 5C|5C]]\n*[[iPhone 5S|5S]]\n*[[iPhone 6|6]]\n*[[iPhone 6|6 Plus]]}}\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPod family:</small>\n*[[iPod Touch (5th generation)|5]]}}\n|}\n|-\n\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|Version\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|Build\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|<abbr title=\"Modem firmware\">Baseband</abbr>\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|{{nowrap|Release date}}\n!Features\n|-valign=\"top\"\n\n!style=\"background:#ececec;\"|8.0\n|12A365{{ref|P4S|P4S}} {{ref|P5|P5}} {{ref|P5C|P5C}} {{ref|P5S|P5S}} {{ref|T5|T5}} {{ref|S2|S2}} {{ref|S2C|S2C}} {{ref|S2D|S2D}} {{ref|S3|S3}} {{ref|S3L|S3L}} {{ref|S3D|S3D}} {{ref|S4|S4}} {{ref|S4L|S4L}} {{ref|S4D|S4D}} {{ref|S5|S5}} {{ref|S5L|S5L}} {{ref|S5D|S5D}} {{ref|M1|M1}} {{ref|M1C|M1C}} {{ref|M2|M2}} {{ref|M2C|M2C}}\n12A366{{ref|P6|P6}} {{ref|P6P|P6P}}\n|04.12.09 {{ref|S2C|S2C}}\n3.0.04 {{ref|S2D|S2D}}<br>\n5.4.00 {{ref|P4S|P4S}}<br>\n5.3.00 {{ref|S3L|S3L}} {{ref|S3D|S3D}}<br>\n7.03.00 {{ref|P5|P5}} {{ref|S4L|S4L}} {{ref|S4D|S4D}} {{ref|M1C|M1C}}<br>\n3.09.01 {{ref|P5C|P5C}} {{ref|P5S|P5S}} {{ref|S5L|S5L}} {{ref|S5D|S5D}} {{ref|M2C|M2C}}<br>\n1.00.05 {{ref|P6|P6}} {{ref|P6P|P6P}}\n|{{Start date and age|2014|9|17}}\n|''Initial release on [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]]''\n*[[iCloud]]\n**Photo Library \u2013 all photos and videos are automatically available in the iCloud Photo Library, and is consistent on all the linked devices automatically.\n**[[iCloud Drive]] \u2013 various files that are being written or worked on are automatically saved in iCloud Drive and is consistent on all linked devices automatically, including a Mac or PC.\n**[[iCloud]] settings now display account information, payment information and security settings.\n*[[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]\n**Trending searches.\n**Related searches.\n**[[TestFlight]] \u2013 a new system for developers to let others test their app; up to a 1,000 users per app.\n**App Bundles.\n**Video previews.\n**Editors choice badge.\n**Essentials badge.\n**If an installing app is paused, it now shows a pause icon.\n**App Store search results scroll vertically on iPhone.\n**Explore tab, which includes Near Me.\n**Apps now show supported languages and if the app is Family Sharing compatible.\n*[[Calendar (Apple)|Calendar]]\n**Calendar week numbers are displayed.\n**Custom calendar repeat events.\n**Travel time in calendar appointments.\n**Alert \"When I need to leave\" for calendar events.\n**Decline a calendar with a comment.\n**More days shown at once in week view on new iPhones.{{ref|P6|P6}} {{ref|P6P|P6P}}\n**Improved landscape view added to select iPhones.{{ref|P6P|P6P}}\n*[[Control Center (iOS)|Control Center]]\n**UI Changes in Control Center: the buttons no longer have an outline.\n**Screen is no longer dimmed when brightness control is selected.\n**iTunes Radio \"buy\" song button in Control Center.\n**iTunes Radio skips remaining displayed in Control Center.\n**Bringing up the Control Center is now much easier while the keyboard is up.\n*[[Messages (Apple)|Messages]]\n**Ability to send voice messages instantly by using a new \"microphone\" button to the right of the text entry field.\n***Pressing and holding on the microphone button lets you record your voice and then swipe up to send it.\n***Messages can be listened to by either pressing play or raise to listen.

With this release, Apple did not drop support for any iOS devices. Therefore, iOS 9 was supported on the [[iPhone 4S]] onwards, [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]] onwards, the [[iPad 2]] onwards, and the [[iPad Mini (1st generation)]] onwards. However, iOS 9 has limited support on the iPhone 4S, iPad 2 and [[iPad (3rd generation)]], iPad Mini (1st generation), and iPod Touch (5th generation). This release made the iPad 2 the first device to support six major releases of iOS, supporting iOS 4 thru iOS 9. Despite Apple's promise of better performance on these devices, there were still widespread complaints that the issue had not been fixed. iOS 9.3.5 is the final release on the iPod Touch (5th generation), the Wi-Fi-only iPad 2, the Wi-Fi-only iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi-only iPad Mini (1st generation); iOS 9.3.6 is the final release on the iPhone 4S, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad 2, the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad (3rd generation), and the Wi-Fi + cellular iPad Mini (1st generation).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#ececec; padding:0 0.5em\" colspan=\"5\"|Table of versions: iOS 9.0.x\n|-\n\n|colspan=\"5\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:2px;\"\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPad family:</small>\n*[[iPad 2|2]]\n*[[iPad (3rd generation)|3]]\n*[[iPad (4th generation)|4]]\n*[[iPad Air|Air]]\n*[[iPad Air 2|Air 2]]\n*[[iPad Mini (1st generation)|Mini 1]]\n*[[iPad Mini 2|Mini 2]]\n*[[iPad Mini 3|Mini 3]]\n*[[iPad Mini 4|Mini 4]]}}\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPhone family:</small>\n*[[iPhone 4S|4S]]\n*[[iPhone 5|5]]\n*[[iPhone 5C|5C]]\n*[[iPhone 5S|5S]]\n*[[iPhone 6|6]]\n*[[iPhone 6|6 Plus]]\n*[[iPhone 6S|6S]]\n*[[iPhone 6S|6S Plus]]}}\n|{{flatlist|<small>iPod family:</small>\n*[[iPod Touch (5th generation)|5]]\n*[[iPod Touch (6th generation)|6]]}}\n|}\n\n''Limited support on [[iPad 2]], [[iPad (3rd generation)]], [[iPad Mini (1st generation)]], [[iPhone 4S]], and [[iPod Touch (5th generation)]]''<ref name=\"arstechnica.com\">{{cite web|date=September 2015|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-thoroughly-reviewed/2/#h4 |title=iOS 9, thoroughly reviewed|work=Ars Technica|access-date=October 22, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|Version\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|Build\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|<abbr title=\"Modem firmware\">Baseband</abbr>\n!style=\"width:8em;\"|{{nowrap|Release date}}\n!Features\n|-valign=\"top\"\n\n!style=\"background:#ececec;\"|9.0\n|13A340 {{ref|M4|M4}} {{ref|M4C|M4C}}\n13A342 {{ref|P6S|P6S}}<br>\n13A343 {{ref|P6SP|P6SP}}<br>\n13A344{{ref|P4S|P4S}} {{ref|P5|P5}} {{ref|P5C|P5C}} {{ref|P5S|P5S}} {{ref|P6|P6}} {{ref|P6P|P6P}} {{ref|T5|T5}} {{ref|T6|T6}} {{ref|S2|S2}} {{ref|S2C|S2C}} {{ref|S2D|S2D}} {{ref|S3|S3}} {{ref|S3L|S3L}} {{ref|S3D|S3D}} {{ref|S4|S4}} {{ref|S4L|S4L}} {{ref|S4D|S4D}} {{ref|S5|S5}} {{ref|S5L|S5L}} {{ref|S5D|S5D}} {{ref|S6|S6}} {{ref|S6L|S6L}} {{ref|S6D|S6D}} {{ref|M1|M1}} {{ref|M1C|M1C}} {{ref|M2|M2}} {{ref|M2C|M2C}} {{ref|M3|M3}} {{ref|M3C|M3C}}\n|04.12.09 {{ref|S2C|S2C}}\n3.0.04 {{ref|S2D|S2D}}<br>\n5.3.04 {{ref|P4S|P4S}}<br>\n5.2.03 {{ref|S3L|S3L}} {{ref|S3D|S3D}}<br>\n10.00.00 {{ref|P5|P5}} {{ref|S4L|S4L}} {{ref|S4D|S4D}} {{ref|M1C|M1C}}<br>\n5.00.11 {{ref|P5C|P5C}}<br>\n6.00.00 {{ref|P5S|P5S}} {{ref|S5L|S5L}} {{ref|S5D|S5D}} {{ref|M2C|M2C}} {{ref|M3C|M3C}}<br>\n4.01.00 {{ref|P6|P6}} {{ref|P6P|P6P}} {{ref|M4C|M4C}}<br>\n1.00.05 {{ref|P6S|P6S}} {{ref|P6SP|P6SP}}\n|{{Start date and age|2015|9|16}}\n|''Initial release on [[iPhone 6S]], [[iPhone 6S Plus]], and [[iPad Mini 4]]''\n*[[iPhone 4S]] and [[iPad 2]] was advertised a speed boost, including other 32-bit devices.\n*[[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]\n**App Store reviews no longer allowed when using a beta version of iOS.\n**App Thinning allows the App Store to only download the assets needed for the device being used.\n**On-demand resources allows iConnect to host assets for later download.\n*[[CarPlay]]\n**Adds support for wireless CarPlay.\n**Lets users access the car's settings (such as climate control) through the CarPlay interface itself.\n**Battery level indicator added to onscreen display.\n**Plays back audio messages, letting the user hear from people in their own voices.\n**Full support for car knob controls, so the user can tilt and spin to scroll through lists or pan around in Maps.\n*Find My Friends\n**Find My Friends is now pre-installed.\n**Notification Center Widget.\n*Find My iPhone\n**Find My iPhone is now pre-installed.\n*Health\n**Added landscape view.\n**Adds support for reproductive health, UV exposure, water intake and sedentary state data types.\n*[[iBooks]]\n**Safari extension to turn a webpage into a PDF and open it in iBooks.\n*[[Mail (OS X)|Mail]]\n**Attachments receive can now be saved and attachments can be added to messages from [[iCloud]] Drive or other document providers while composing a new message.\n**Support for saving attachments to [[iCloud]] Drive.\n**Icons added to left and right swipe gestures.\n**Support for Markup allows annotating images or PDF attachments with text, shapes, or signatures.\n*[[Apple Maps|Maps]]\n**Support for public transit lines, station details with exits and entrances, schedules and directions in select major cities.

With this release, Apple did not drop support for any iOS devices.

You can also set a schedule for what time Dark Mode comes on, and what time Light Mode comes back on.\n*[[Siri]]\n**Siri's voice is now done by software called \"Neural TTS\" instead of human voice clips, making Siri sound much more natural.\n**Siri can now play audio, including music, podcasts, audio books, and radio, with third-party apps.\n**There is now an option for an Indian-English voice.\n**Siri now offers personalized suggestions in Apple Podcasts, Safari, and Maps. Siri can also now detect reminders in messages and events in third-party apps.\n**Siri can now tune into radio shows on command.\n*Keyboard\n**The QuickType keyboard now includes QuickPath, which allows the user to type in a word by sliding a finger between the letters without moving it up. QuickPath supports English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese.\n**Swiping or tapping to type works interchangeably, even mid-sentence.\n**Alternate word options now appear in the predictive bar.\n**Dictation will automatically detect what language a user is speaking. This language will be chosen from up to four keyboard languages enabled on the device.\n*Camera\n**After taking a picture in Portrait Mode, the user can adjust the position and intensity of each Portrait lighting effect.\n**A new Portrait Lighting effect, called High-Key Mono, \"creates a beautiful, classic look with a monochromatic subject on a white background.\"\n**Portrait Segmentation API now has skin, hair, and teeth segmentation.\n**All-new Camera app on the iPhone 11 series\n*App Store\n**[[Apple Arcade]]: A new subscription service with over 100 new games, with no ads or additional purchases.\n**The App Store now has support for Arabic and Hebrew in stories, collections and lists, product pages, and searches.\n**Apps with large sizes (especially games) can now be downloaded over a cellular connection, but the user will be warned if the file size exceeds a certain threshold.\n*Maps\n**The map itself has been redone from the ground up. According to Apple, it features \"significantly improved and more realistic details\" for areas like roads, beaches, parks, buildings, and more.\n**The user can now explore the area they are going to before they arrive with a 3D, 360-degree experience.\n**Collections of favorite locations can be built and shared with others.\n**The user can now make a list of places they visit often to access them quickly.\n**A feature called Junction View helps drivers in China eliminate wrong turns and directional misses by lining them up in the correct lane before they need to turn or enter an elevated road.\n**The process of submitting customer feedback has been redesigned to be faster.\n**Siri's navigation uses more natural language. For example, instead of saying \"in ''x'' feet turn left,\" it says \"turn left at the next traffic light\". Navigation is also more accurate.\n**The user can now see departure times live, the location of their bus or train on its route, and a more detailed schedule of transit stops.\n**Flight details now include info about a terminal, gate locations, departure times, and more.\n**Place cards have more improved info, such as Today@Apple sessions at Apple Store locations, and movie theater time listings.\n**MapKit now has vector overlays, point-of-interest filtering, camera zoom and pan limits, and Dark Mode support.\n**[[CarPlay]] now has easier route planning, search, and navigation. It also includes Junction View (China only), Favorites, and Collections.\n*Performance\n**Apps can now launch up to twice as fast as on iOS 12.\n**Unlocking the iPhone X, XS, XS Max, and XR using [[Face ID]] is up to 30% faster compared to iOS 12.\n**Apps from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] are packaged in a new way, making them as small as half the size compared to iOS 12, which makes them download faster and take up less storage.\n**App updates are on average 60% smaller compared to iOS 12, allowing for faster downloads.\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"

Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981\u20131989) as well.\n\n==== Honduras ====\n[[Honduras]] also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].

After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran\u2014[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]\u2014information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}</ref>\n\n==== Iraq ====\nExtrajudicial killings and death squads are common in [[Iraq]].<ref>[http://www.g\u2260lobalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=FUL20051124&articleId=1315 Torture and Extrajudicial Killings in Iraq]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714130932/http://www.g/ |date=July 14, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicintifada.net/bytopic/extrajudicial-killings.shtml |title=ei: Extrajudicial Killings |accessdate=2008-01-04 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226033302/http://www.electronicintifada.net/bytopic/extrajudicial-killings.shtml |archivedate=February 26, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/document/?indexNumber=amr51%2f079%2f2005&language=en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2019-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselstribunal.org/FullerKillings.htm|title=Proof of US orchestration of Death Squads Killings in Iraq|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccerdad.baltiblogs.com/archives/2007/06/24/extrajudicial_killings_hamas_style.html|title=Soccer Dad: Extrajudicial killings, hamas style|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928205440/http://soccerdad.baltiblogs.com/archives/2007/06/24/extrajudicial_killings_hamas_style.html|archivedate=2007-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIraq was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south.

In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident.

After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran\u2014[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]\u2014information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used.

Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south.

For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident.

The convoy involved five transports, which were protected from [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese warships]] by several [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval task forces during the trip across the [[Indian Ocean]] and along the Australian coast. The division embarked in late January 1943 and the convoy operation began on 4 February. No contact was made between Allied and Japanese ships, and the division arrived in Australian ports during late February with no losses from enemy action.\n\nThe operation came after the British and United States governments agreed to an Australian government request that the 9th Division be returned home, and ended the role of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] in the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. This followed a lengthy debate between the respective national leaders, with [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attempting to convince the Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] to withdraw his request until the Allied victory in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] was complete. Curtin was unwilling to delay, as he and the Allied military leaders in the South West Pacific believed that the veteran division was needed to bolster the forces for [[New Guinea campaign|offensive operations in New Guinea]].\n\nA convoy to return the 9th Australian Division to Australia was assembled in the [[Red Sea]] near [[Massawa]] from late January to early February 1943. The ships began their voyage across the Indian Ocean on 4 February, refuelled at [[Addu Atoll]], and arrived safely at the [[Western Australia]]n port of [[Fremantle]] on 18 February. Four transports continued to the Australian east coast, one docking at [[Melbourne]] on 25 February and the remainder arriving at [[Sydney]] two days later. After its return to Australia, the division made an important contribution to operations in New Guinea in late 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\nDuring 1940 and 1941, three infantry divisions and other units assigned to [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]] of the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) were transported to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], where they took part in several campaigns against German, Italian and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces.<ref name=\"Faulkner_Wilkinson_168\">Faulkner and Wilkinson (2012), p. 168</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Second World War, 1939\u201345|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/ww2/|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> Following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], the corps headquarters and the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th]] and [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Divisions]] were returned to Australia in early 1942 to reinforce the defence of Australia in [[Operation Stepsister]]. The Australian Government agreed to British and United States requests temporarily to retain the 9th Australian Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of more [[United States Army]] units to Australia and British support for a proposal to expand the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] to 73 flying [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]].<ref>Hasluck (1970), pp. 73\u201387, 177</ref> The 9th Division played an important role in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] during July 1942 and the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] between 23 October and 4 November.<ref>Coates (2006), pp. 166\u2013176</ref> The division suffered many casualties during the latter engagement and did not take part in the pursuit of the Axis retreat.<ref>Long (1973), pp. 283\u2013284</ref>\n\n[[File:World War II 1942 12.png|thumb|left|upright=1.58|alt=Map of the world marked with the territory held by different blocs as of December 1942|The global strategic situation in December 1942<br><small>{{legend|#00008b|[[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] (independent countries)}}\n{{legend|#87cefa|Western Allies (colonies or occupied)}}\n{{legend|#cd5c5c|Eastern Allies}}\n{{legend|#000000|[[Axis Powers|Axis]] (countries)}}\n{{legend|#696969|Axis (colonies or occupied, including [[Vichy France]])}}\n{{legend|#d3d3d3|neutral}}</small>]]\n\nSeveral factors influenced the decision made by the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and the commander of the [[Australian Military Forces]], General [[Thomas Blamey]], wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the [[New Guinea Campaign]] and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be better prepared for this responsibility than the Australian Army's [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]] forces or US Army units.<ref>Hasluck (1970), pp. 193, 202</ref> The commander of Allied forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]], had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty of finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.<ref>Hasluck (1970), pp. 193\u2013194</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] [[Diplomatic cable|cabled]] British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] to request that the 9th Division be returned to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage and the demands of the war in the Pacific, it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request on the grounds that the 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations.<ref name=\"Long_285\">Long (1973), p. 285</ref> On 1 November, US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.<ref name=\"Maughan_749\">Maughan (1966), p. 749</ref>\n\nOn 21 November, the commander of the 9th Division, Major General [[Leslie Morshead]], was informed by General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], the commander-in-chief of the [[Middle East Command]], that a decision had been made to return the division to Australia.<ref name=Maughan_749 /> Churchill told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned, the resultant diversion of shipping would reduce the size of the build-up of United States military forces in Britain and North Africa by 30,000 men. In the same cable, Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division's heavy equipment would need to remain in the Middle East.<ref name=\"Hasluck_201\">Hasluck (1970), p. 201</ref> On 3 December, Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa. Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the US Army's [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] would be transferred to Australia during December.<ref name=Maughan_749 /><ref name=Hasluck_201 /> Following these messages the Australian Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its heavy equipment, and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia.<ref name=\"Maughan_750\">Maughan (1966), p. 750</ref>\n\nCurtin replied to Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December, and again stressed the need to return the 9th Division to Australia as soon as possible to make good the Army's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific. In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific.<ref>Hasluck (1970), p. 202</ref> No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.<ref name=Maughan_750 />\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:Australian 9th Div at Gaza in 1942 (AWM 050124).jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of a large group of men wearing military uniforms and carrying rifles marching in close formation|9th Division soldiers during the 22 December parade at Gaza Airport]]\nThe 9th Division's role in the Second Battle of El Alamein ended on 5 November 1942.<ref>Maughan (1966), p. 742</ref> From 30 November the division travelled to Palestine by road, and all its units arrived there by 9 December. After settling into camps located between [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Qastina]], the 9th Division undertook a period of rebuilding and training, and many soldiers were granted leave.<ref>Maughan (1966), pp. 747\u2013748</ref> On 22 December, a formal [[Military parade|parade]] involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport.<ref>Maughan (1966), pp. 751\u2013752</ref>\n\nPreparations to return the 9th Division to Australia began in late December 1942. On 26 December, all of the AIF unit commanding officers in the Middle East were informed that their commands were to return to Australia; the movement was code-named \"Liddington\". Tight security was instituted, and more junior personnel who needed to be informed were told that their units were being transferred to Egypt. Many members of the AIF initially believed that they would take part in further fighting in the Mediterranean, but as preparations continued it became obvious that the units were about to undertake a long sea voyage. The 9th Division's artillery, tanks and other heavy equipment were transferred to ordnance depots during early January 1943, and on the 16th of that month the division began moving to the [[Suez Canal]] area, from where it was to embark.<ref name=\"Maughan_753\">Maughan (1966), p. 753</ref> During this period all of the personnel assigned to the AIF Reinforcement Depot in Palestine were transferred to the 9th Division, resulting in the formation being larger than its authorised strength.<ref>Dean (2018), p. 288</ref> The movement of the 9th Division took place in groups, each of which spent one or two days at a transit camp at Qassin, where all vehicles were handed to British authorities.<ref name=\"Maughan_753\" /> The 9th Division also began training for [[Jungle warfare|jungle]] and [[amphibious warfare]] before departing the Middle East. During January, each brigade spent three days exercising in the rough terrain near [[Bayt Jibrin]], which was believed to be the nearest equivalent to a jungle in Palestine. Most of the brigade commanders and several officers from each of the infantry battalions also attended short courses at the British amphibious warfare school on the [[Great Bitter Lake|Bitter Lakes]] in Egypt.<ref>Threlfall (2014), pp. 160\u2013162</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] also made preparations in late 1942 for the movement of the 9th Division back to Australia. Four large troop ships were allocated to the task, and the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort. However, as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Singapore]] and Japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near [[Aden]], this was judged to be unacceptably risky, especially as it was not likely that the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret.<ref name=\"Day_91\">Day (1993), p. 91</ref><ref name=\"Roskill_433\" /> Moreover, transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long-standing policy of assigning at least one [[capital ship]] to protect troop convoys in this region, and would not have been accepted by the Australian government.<ref name=\"Day_91\" /> In November, the Chiefs of Staff Committee decided to allocate an escort to the convoy, but did not specify what it should comprise.<ref name=\"Day_92\">Day (1993), p. 92</ref>\n\nThe ships assigned to carry the 9th Division to Australia were the converted ocean liners [[RMS Aquitania|''Aquitania'']], [[SS \u00cele de France|''\u00cele de France'']], [[SS Nieuw Amsterdam (1937)|''Nieuw Amsterdam'']] and [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]; these four large vessels had previously carried Australian soldiers to the Middle East and other locations.<ref name=\"Plowman_366\">Plowman (2003), p. 366</ref> The liners were heavily tasked transporting Allied military personnel across long distances, and arrived at Suez individually. ''Aquitania'' put in from Australia on 5 January, ''Queen Mary'' was reassigned from transporting American personnel across the Atlantic and arrived from the United Kingdom on 18 January, ''Nieuw Amsterdam'' completed one of her frequent voyages along the coast of [[East Africa]] on 31 January and ''\u00cele de France'' arrived in late January.<ref>Plowman (2003), pp. 367\u2013372</ref> In addition to the four converted liners, the [[armed merchant cruiser]] [[SS Queen of Bermuda|HMS ''Queen of Bermuda'']] was transferred from transport duties in the Indian Ocean to both augment the convoy's escort and embark Australian personnel.<ref>Plowman (2003), pp. 370\u2013371</ref> The four liners were armed with anti-aircraft guns manned by dedicated personnel, as well as two 6-inch guns each.<ref name=\"Plowman_375\" /> The operation to sail these vessels from Egypt to Australia together was designated Operation Pamphlet.<ref name=\"Plowman_374\" />\n\n==Voyage==\n===Indian Ocean===\nThe AIF began embarking on the troop ships on 24 January 1943.

Captain [[James Gordon Partridge Bisset|James Bisset]], commander of the ''Queen Mary'', served as the [[convoy commodore]]. The four large converted liners sailed in line abreast formation and ''Queen of Bermuda''{{'}}s position varied based on the time of day and the situation. The convoy travelled at a speed of {{convert|17|kn|km/h}}; while the liners typically sailed at much higher speeds during their independent voyages, they were constrained by the maximum that ''Queen of Bermuda'' could maintain. Bisset was frustrated by the decision to sail the transports together, as it considerably increased the time taken to complete the voyage and entailed lengthy delays for the heavily tasked ''Queen Mary''.<ref name=\"Plowman_375\">Plowman (2003), p. 375</ref>\n\nAfter entering the Indian Ocean, the convoy sailed south-east. The ships manoeuvred together in a [[zigzag]] course; avoiding collisions during the frequent turns placed heavy demands on the watch-keeping officers, who found their shifts exhausting.<ref name=\"Plowman_376\">Plowman (2003), p. 376</ref> The troops endured very uncomfortable conditions on the hot and crowded ships, but morale was high.

At a meeting held on 17 February, the [[Advisory War Council (Australia)|Advisory War Council]] considered adopting a recommendation that the soldiers be moved to the east coast by rail. It decided against doing so after being informed that, due to the limited capacity of the [[Trans-Australian Railway]], it would take several months to move the 30,000 personnel. Instead, the council recommended that the convoy continue but be given \"the maximum protection possible\".<ref name=Gill_287 /> Due to the presence of [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|Japanese submarines off the Australian coast]], tight security measures were instituted after the convoy arrived at Fremantle; civilian communications between Western Australia and the east coast were cut for several days, and Curtin asked the media to not report the movement of the 9th Division. During a confidential briefing on 24 February, Curtin told journalists that he had not slept well for three weeks due to concerns over the convoy's safety.<ref>Loyd and Hall, pp. 136, 140</ref>\n\nWhen the convoy sailed from Fremantle on 20 February it was escorted by the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Adelaide|1918|6}}, as well as ''Jacob van Heemskerck'' and ''Tjerk Hiddes''. To avoid any enemy ships or submarines operating off the Australian coast, the convoy's route took it well to the south of the continent. The escort force was strengthened on 24 February when the convoy rendezvoused with [[Task Force 44|Task Group 44.3]]; this force comprised the heavy cruiser {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} and American destroyers {{USS|Bagley|DD-386|6}}, {{USS|Helm|DD-388|2}} and {{USS|Henley|DD-391|2}}, and had been dispatched from [[Sydney]] on 17 February.<ref name=\"Plowman_381\">Plowman (2003), p. 381</ref> ''Adelaide'' and the Dutch warships left the convoy shortly afterwards to escort ''Nieuw Amsterdam'' into Melbourne; the liner docked there on the afternoon of 25 February.<ref name=Gill_287 /><ref name=Plowman_381 /> Task Group 44.3 escorted the remaining ships to Sydney, sailing south of [[Tasmania]] before proceeding up the east coast.

The convoy involved five transports, which were protected from [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese warships]] by several [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval task forces during the trip across the [[Indian Ocean]] and along the Australian coast. The division embarked in late January 1943 and the convoy operation began on 4 February. No contact was made between Allied and Japanese ships, and the division arrived in Australian ports during late February with no losses from enemy action.\n\nThe operation came after the British and United States governments agreed to an Australian government request that the 9th Division be returned home, and ended the role of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] in the [[Western Desert Campaign]]. This followed a lengthy debate between the respective national leaders, with [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attempting to convince the Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] to withdraw his request until the Allied victory in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] was complete. Curtin was unwilling to delay, as he and the Allied military leaders in the South West Pacific believed that the veteran division was needed to bolster the forces for [[New Guinea campaign|offensive operations in New Guinea]].\n\nA convoy to return the 9th Australian Division to Australia was assembled in the [[Red Sea]] near [[Massawa]] from late January to early February 1943. The ships began their voyage across the Indian Ocean on 4 February, refuelled at [[Addu Atoll]], and arrived safely at the [[Western Australia|Western Australian]] port of [[Fremantle]] on 18 February. Four transports continued to the Australian east coast, one docking at [[Melbourne]] on 25 February and the remainder arriving at [[Sydney]] two days later. After its return to Australia, the division made an important contribution to operations in New Guinea in late 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\nDuring 1940 and 1941, three infantry divisions and other units assigned to [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]] of the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) were transported to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], where they took part in several campaigns against German, Italian and [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces.<ref name=\"Faulkner_Wilkinson_168\">Faulkner and Wilkinson (2012), p. 168</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Second World War, 1939\u201345|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/ww2/|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> Following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], the corps headquarters and the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th]] and [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Divisions]] were returned to Australia in early 1942 to reinforce the defence of Australia in [[Operation Stepsister]]. The Australian Government agreed to British and United States requests temporarily to retain the 9th Australian Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of more [[United States Army]] units to Australia and British support for a proposal to expand the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] to 73 flying [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]].<ref>Hasluck (1970), pp. 73\u201387, 177</ref> The 9th Division played an important role in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] during July 1942 and the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] between 23 October and 4 November.<ref>Coates (2006), pp. 166\u2013176</ref> The division suffered many casualties during the latter engagement and did not take part in the pursuit of the Axis retreat.<ref>Long (1973), pp. 283\u2013284</ref>\n\n[[File:World War II 1942 12.png|thumb|left|upright=1.58|alt=Map of the world marked with the territory held by different blocs as of December 1942|The global strategic situation in December 1942<br><small>{{legend|#00008b|[[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] (independent countries)}}\n{{legend|#87cefa|Western Allies (colonies or occupied)}}\n{{legend|#cd5c5c|Eastern Allies}}\n{{legend|#000000|[[Axis Powers|Axis]] (countries)}}\n{{legend|#696969|Axis (colonies or occupied, including [[Vichy France]])}}\n{{legend|#d3d3d3|neutral}}</small>]]\n\nSeveral factors influenced the decision made by the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and the commander of the [[Australian Military Forces]], General [[Thomas Blamey]], wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the [[New Guinea Campaign]] and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be better prepared for this responsibility than the Australian Army's [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]] forces or US Army units.<ref>Hasluck (1970), pp. 193, 202</ref> The commander of Allied forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]], had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty of finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.<ref>Hasluck (1970), pp. 193\u2013194</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] [[Diplomatic cable|cabled]] British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] to request that the 9th Division be returned to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage and the demands of the war in the Pacific, it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request on the grounds that the 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations.<ref name=\"Long_285\">Long (1973), p. 285</ref> On 1 November, US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.<ref name=\"Maughan_749\">Maughan (1966), p. 749</ref>\n\nOn 21 November, the commander of the 9th Division, Major General [[Leslie Morshead]], was informed by General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], the commander-in-chief of the [[Middle East Command]], that a decision had been made to return the division to Australia.<ref name=Maughan_749 /> Churchill told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned, the resultant diversion of shipping would reduce the size of the build-up of United States military forces in Britain and North Africa by 30,000 men. In the same cable, Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division's heavy equipment would need to remain in the Middle East.<ref name=\"Hasluck_201\">Hasluck (1970), p. 201</ref> On 3 December, Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa. Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the US Army's [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] would be transferred to Australia during December.<ref name=Maughan_749 /><ref name=Hasluck_201 /> Following these messages the Australian Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its heavy equipment, and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia.<ref name=\"Maughan_750\">Maughan (1966), p. 750</ref>\n\nCurtin replied to Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December, and again stressed the need to return the 9th Division to Australia as soon as possible to make good the Army's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific. In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific.<ref>Hasluck (1970), p. 202</ref> No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.<ref name=Maughan_750 />\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:Australian 9th Div at Gaza in 1942 (AWM 050124).jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of a large group of men wearing military uniforms and carrying rifles marching in close formation|9th Division soldiers during the 22 December parade at Gaza Airport]]\nThe 9th Division's role in the Second Battle of El Alamein ended on 5 November 1942.<ref>Maughan (1966), p. 742</ref> From 30 November the division travelled to Palestine by road, and all its units arrived there by 9 December. After settling into camps located between [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Qastina]], the 9th Division undertook a period of rebuilding and training, and many soldiers were granted leave.<ref>Maughan (1966), pp. 747\u2013748</ref> On 22 December, a formal [[Military parade|parade]] involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport.<ref>Maughan (1966), pp. 751\u2013752</ref>\n\nPreparations to return the 9th Division to Australia began in late December 1942. On 26 December, all of the AIF unit commanding officers in the Middle East were informed that their commands were to return to Australia; the movement was code-named \"Liddington\". Tight security was instituted, and more junior personnel who needed to be informed were told that their units were being transferred to Egypt. Many members of the AIF initially believed that they would take part in further fighting in the Mediterranean, but as preparations continued it became obvious that the units were about to undertake a long sea voyage. The 9th Division's artillery, tanks and other heavy equipment were transferred to ordnance depots during early January 1943, and on the 16th of that month the division began moving to the [[Suez Canal]] area, from where it was to embark.<ref name=\"Maughan_753\">Maughan (1966), p. 753</ref> During this period all of the personnel assigned to the AIF Reinforcement Depot in Palestine were transferred to the 9th Division, resulting in the formation being larger than its authorised strength.<ref>Dean (2018), p. 288</ref> The movement of the 9th Division took place in groups, each of which spent one or two days at a transit camp at Qassin, where all vehicles were handed to British authorities.<ref name=\"Maughan_753\" /> The 9th Division also began training for [[Jungle warfare|jungle]] and [[amphibious warfare]] before departing the Middle East. During January, each brigade spent three days exercising in the rough terrain near [[Bayt Jibrin]], which was believed to be the nearest equivalent to a jungle in Palestine. Most of the brigade commanders and several officers from each of the infantry battalions also attended short courses at the British amphibious warfare school on the [[Great Bitter Lake|Bitter Lakes]] in Egypt.<ref>Threlfall (2014), pp. 160\u2013162</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] also made preparations in late 1942 for the movement of the 9th Division back to Australia. Four large troop ships were allocated to the task, and the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort. However, as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Singapore]] and Japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near [[Aden]], this was judged to be unacceptably risky, especially as it was not likely that the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret.<ref name=\"Day_91\">Day (1993), p. 91</ref><ref name=\"Roskill_433\" /> Moreover, transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long-standing policy of assigning at least one [[capital ship]] to protect troop convoys in this region, and would not have been accepted by the Australian government.<ref name=\"Day_91\" /> In November, the Chiefs of Staff Committee decided to allocate an escort to the convoy, but did not specify what it should comprise.<ref name=\"Day_92\">Day (1993), p. 92</ref>\n\nThe ships assigned to carry the 9th Division to Australia were the converted ocean liners [[RMS Aquitania|''Aquitania'']], [[SS \u00cele de France|''\u00cele de France'']], [[SS Nieuw Amsterdam (1937)|''Nieuw Amsterdam'']] and [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]; these four large vessels had previously carried Australian soldiers to the Middle East and other locations.<ref name=\"Plowman_366\">Plowman (2003), p. 366</ref> The liners were heavily tasked transporting Allied military personnel across long distances, and arrived at Suez individually.

At a meeting held on 17 February, the [[Advisory War Council (Australia)|Advisory War Council]] considered adopting a recommendation that the soldiers be moved to the east coast by rail. It decided against doing so after being informed that, due to the limited capacity of the [[Trans-Australian Railway]], it would take several months to move the 30,000 personnel. Instead, the council recommended that the convoy continue but be given \"the maximum protection possible\".<ref name=Gill_287 /> Due to the presence of [[Axis naval activity in Australian waters|Japanese submarines off the Australian coast]], tight security measures were instituted after the convoy arrived at Fremantle; civilian communications between Western Australia and the east coast were cut for several days, and Curtin asked the media to not report the movement of the 9th Division. During a confidential briefing on 24 February, Curtin told journalists that he had not slept well for three weeks due to concerns over the convoy's safety.<ref>Loyd and Hall, pp. 136, 140</ref>\n\nWhen the convoy sailed from Fremantle on 20 February it was escorted by the Australian light cruiser {{HMAS|Adelaide|1918|6}}, as well as ''Jacob van Heemskerck'' and ''Tjerk Hiddes''. To avoid any enemy ships or submarines operating off the Australian coast, the convoy's route took it well to the south of the continent.

There were nine ships in the class, all constructed in the United States and supplied under the terms of [[Lend-Lease]] to the Royal Navy.\n\nThe ships served in two different roles: as convoy [[escort carriers]], equipped with both [[anti-submarine]] and [[fighter aircraft]], and as [[Strike fighter|strike carriers]], equipped with just fighter aircraft. When used as convoy escorts, the ships' aircraft were successful in deterring German submarines from attacking Allied convoys, with a number of German submarines and aircraft destroyed or damaged by the aircraft. Those carriers operating in the strike role took part in two major landings in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] and an operation against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']] in Norwegian waters. Eight of the ships ended the war in the Far East in the campaigns against the [[Japanese Empire]] and were then used to transport home prisoners of war.\n\nAll nine ships survived the war and were eventually returned to the [[United States Navy]], which sold six of them for conversion into merchant ships. The other three ships were scrapped.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe ''Attacker'' class comprised nine ships built in the United States for the Royal Navy during the Second World War.<ref name=co79/><ref>Morison (2002), p. 344.</ref> They were all built between 1941 and 1942 by [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]], [[Western Pipe & Steel]], [[Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation]] shipyards; both companies completed four ships.<ref name=co79>Cocker (2008), p. 79.</ref> They were then supplied under the terms of [[Lend-Lease]] to the Royal Navy for their use. The ships had a complement of 646 men. Crew accommodations were significantly different from the normal for the Royal Navy at the time. Instead of food being prepared by separate [[mess]]es, it was cooked in the galley and served [[cafeteria]]-style in a central dining area. Unlike British-built ships, they were equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional [[hammock]]s were replaced by three-tier bunk beds, 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.<ref name=\"Poolman 1972, pp.74\u201375\">Poolman (1972), pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nThe ships had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|492.25|ft}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|69.5|ft}}, and a height of {{Convert|23.25|ft|m|abbr=on}}. They displaced {{convert|11420|LT|t|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]].<ref name=co80>Cocker (2008), p. 80.</ref> Propulsion was provided by two steam turbine engines connected to one shaft, giving 8,500 [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower|brake horsepower]] (BHP), which could propel the ship at {{convert|17|kn}}.<ref>Cocker (2008), pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A16649.jpg|thumb|left|On {{HMS|Battler|D18|6}}, a [[Fairey Swordfish]] comes on deck via the aircraft lift. The ship's 'Island' [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and flight control is in the background.]]\nAll the escort carriers had the capacity for up to 24 [[anti-submarine]] or [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] aircraft, which could be a mixture of the British [[Hawker Sea Hurricane]], [[Supermarine Seafire]], and [[Fairey Swordfish]], and the American [[Grumman Wildcat]], [[Vought F4U Corsair]] and [[Grumman Avenger]].<ref name=co80/> The exact composition of the embarked squadrons depended upon the mission. Some squadrons were composite squadrons for convoy defence, and would be equipped with anti-submarine and fighter aircraft,<ref>Poolman(1972), p.98.</ref> while other squadrons working in a strike-carrier role would only be equipped with fighter aircraft.<ref name=mo342/> Aircraft facilities consisted of a small combined bridge\u2013flight control on the [[starboard]] side above the {{convert|450|by|120|ft|adj=on}} flight deck,<ref>Poolman (1972), p.57.</ref> two aircraft lifts measuring {{convert|42|by|34|ft}}, and nine [[Arresting gear|arrestor wires]]. Aircraft could be housed in the {{convert|260|by|62|ft}} hangar below the flight deck.<ref name=co80/>\n\nThe ships' armament concentrated on [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence and comprised two [[4\"/50 caliber gun|4-inch AA guns]] in single mounts, eight [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40&nbsp;mm]] AA guns in twin mounts, and 21 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm]] AA cannons in single or twin mounts as the standard fit.<ref name=co80/> In practice all the ships had slightly different weapons mounted. ''Attacker'', ''Chaser'', and ''Hunter'' only had four single 20&nbsp;mm AA cannons, the rest being double mounts. Of the other ships, ''Battler'' had two, ''Stalker'' had six, and ''Fencer'' had seven single 20&nbsp;mm cannons. ''Pursuer'' had four extra 40&nbsp;mm AA guns, and ''Striker'' had six extra in place of twin 20&nbsp;mm mounts.<ref>Friedman (1988), p.188.</ref>\n\n[[File:Twin 40mm bofors gun on escort carrier.jpg|thumb|A twin [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40&nbsp;mm Bofors]] [[anti-aircraft gun]] mounting]]\nBefore any of these ships entered service with the Royal Navy, they went to [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrards]] shipbuilders in [[British Columbia]] for some modifications. These modifications, 150 of them in total, were paid for by the Canadian government.<ref>Poolman (1972), pp. 88\u201389</ref> Further modifications to turn the escort carriers into assault carriers were undertaken by the [[Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland. This included installing over 100 telephones in a shipboard network.

There were nine ships in the class, all constructed in the United States and supplied under the terms of [[Lend-Lease]] to the Royal Navy.\n\nThe ships served in two different roles: as convoy [[escort carriers]], equipped with both [[anti-submarine]] and [[fighter aircraft]], and as [[Strike fighter|strike carriers]], equipped with just fighter aircraft. When used as convoy escorts, the ships' aircraft were successful in deterring German submarines from attacking Allied convoys, with a number of German submarines and aircraft destroyed or damaged by the aircraft. Those carriers operating in the strike role took part in two major landings in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] and an operation against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']] in Norwegian waters. Eight of the ships ended the war in the Far East in the campaigns against the [[Japanese Empire]] and were then used to transport home prisoners of war.\n\nAll nine ships survived the war and were eventually returned to the [[United States Navy]], which sold five of them for conversion into merchant ships. The other three ships were scrapped.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe ''Attacker'' class comprised nine ships built in the United States for the Royal Navy during the Second World War.<ref name=co79/><ref>Morison (2002), p. 344.</ref> They were all built between 1941 and 1942 by [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]], [[Western Pipe & Steel]], [[Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation]] shipyards; both companies completed four ships.<ref name=co79>Cocker (2008), p. 79.</ref> They were then supplied under the terms of [[Lend-Lease]] to the Royal Navy for their use. The ships had a complement of 646 men. Crew accommodations were significantly different from the normal for the Royal Navy at the time. Instead of food being prepared by separate [[mess]]es, it was cooked in the galley and served [[cafeteria]]-style in a central dining area. Unlike British-built ships, they were equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional [[hammock]]s were replaced by three-tier bunk beds, 18 to a cabin, which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.<ref name=\"Poolman 1972, pp.74\u201375\">Poolman (1972), pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nThe ships had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|492.25|ft}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|69.5|ft}}, and a height of {{Convert|23.25|ft|m|abbr=on}}. They displaced {{convert|11420|LT|t|abbr=on}} at [[deep load]].<ref name=co80>Cocker (2008), p. 80.</ref> Propulsion was provided by two steam turbine engines connected to one shaft, giving 8,500 [[Horsepower#Brake horsepower|brake horsepower]] (BHP), which could propel the ship at {{convert|17|kn}}.<ref>Cocker (2008), pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A16649.jpg|thumb|left|On {{HMS|Battler|D18|6}}, a [[Fairey Swordfish]] comes on deck via the aircraft lift.

Aircraft could be housed in the {{convert|260|by|62|ft}} hangar below the flight deck.<ref name=co80/>\n\nThe ships' armament concentrated on [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence and comprised two [[4\"/50 caliber gun|4-inch AA guns]] in single mounts, eight [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40&nbsp;mm]] AA guns in twin mounts, and 21 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm]] AA cannons in single or twin mounts as the standard fit.<ref name=co80/> In practice all the ships had slightly different weapons mounted. ''Attacker'', ''Chaser'', and ''Hunter'' only had four single 20&nbsp;mm AA cannons, the rest being double mounts. Of the other ships, ''Battler'' had two, ''Stalker'' had six, and ''Fencer'' had seven single 20&nbsp;mm cannons. ''Pursuer'' had four extra 40&nbsp;mm AA guns, and ''Striker'' had six extra in place of twin 20&nbsp;mm mounts.<ref>Friedman (1988), p.188.</ref>\n\n[[File:Twin 40mm bofors gun on escort carrier.jpg|thumb|A twin [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40&nbsp;mm Bofors]] [[anti-aircraft gun]] mounting]]\nBefore any of these ships entered service with the Royal Navy, they went to [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrards]] shipbuilders in [[British Columbia]] for some modifications. These modifications, 150 of them in total, were paid for by the Canadian government.<ref>Poolman (1972), pp. 88\u201389</ref> Further modifications to turn the escort carriers into assault carriers were undertaken by the [[Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland. This included installing over 100 telephones in a shipboard network.

One aircraft would fly about {{convert|10|mi}} ahead of the convoy, while another patrolled astern. Patrols would last between two and three hours, using both [[radar]] and visual observation in their search for U-boats.<ref>Poolman (1972), p.79.</ref> By 1944, it was usual to have two escort carriers working as a pair on convoy escort. Experience had shown it was best to have two composite squadrons. One squadron included fighters and the by then obsolete Fairey Swordfish equipped with air-to-surface vessel (ASV) radar for night patrols. The other squadron would be equipped with fighters and the Grumman Avenger for long-range day patrols, as they could not be fitted with the ASV radar.<ref>Poolman (1972), p.118.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fairey Swordfish lifst off from .HMS Strikerj.jpg|thumb|A [[Fairey Swordfish]] takes off from {{HMS|Striker|D12|2}} on an anti-submarine patrol.]]\nThe [[Fleet Air Arm]] squadrons flying off the ''Attacker'' class escort carriers did have some successes of their own.

Their objective was to locate and destroy the U-boats and their supply ships and protect the shipping lanes between India, Aden, and South Africa. In March 1944, one of ''Battler''{{'}}s planes sighted the German supply ship ''Brake'' and three surfaced U-boats.

Firstly ''Attacker'', ''Hunter'', and ''Pursuer'' were sent to the [[Aegean sea]] to conduct operations against Axis garrisons in the area.<ref name=po155>Poolman (1972), p.155</ref> They then moved to the Indian Ocean, joining ''Fencer'' and ''Stalker'' in supporting the Allied armies in Burma. Here they supported the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] amphibious landings and interdicted Japanese shipping in the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Straits of Malacca]]. As the war in the east progressed, the British and U.S. Pacific fleets combined. Two more ''Attacker''-class ships arrived in the area, ''Chaser'' and ''Striker''. These were used to ferry replacement aircraft for the other carriers, and after the Japanese surrender were given another role: repatriating prisoners of war.<ref name=po155/>\n\nWhen the war was over, the surviving Lend-Lease ships were returned to the U.S. Navy, which now had a surplus of these ships, so some were sold into merchant service. HMS ''Attacker'' became ''Costel Forte'', HMS ''Chaser'' ''Aagtekerk'', HMS ''Fencer'' ''Sydney'', HMS ''Stalker'' ''Rionw'', and HMS ''Hunter'' ''Almdijk''. The other three ''Attacker''-class ships, HMS ''Battler'', HMS ''Pursuer'', and HMS ''Striker'', were not sold into merchant service; all three were scrapped between 1946 and 1948.<ref name=po155/><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a7/altamaha-i.htm | title=Altamaha | publisher=Naval Historical Center | accessdate=12 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Battle honours==\nAll nine ships were awarded [[battle honours]] by the Royal Navy.\n* HMS ''Attacker'': Atlantic 1943\u20131944, Salerno 1943, South France 1944, Aegean 1944\n* HMS ''Battler'': Atlantic 1942\u20131945, Salerno 1943\n* HMS ''Chaser'': Atlantic 1943, Arctic 1944, Okinawa 1945\n* HMS ''Fencer'': Atlantic 1943\u20131944, Norway 1944, Arctic 1944\n* HMS ''Hunter'': Atlantic 1942\u20131944, Salerno 1943, South France 1944, Aegean 1944, Burma 1945, Malaya 1945\n* HMS ''Pursuer'': Atlantic 1943\u20131945, Norway 1944, Normandy 1944, South France 1944, Aegean 1944, Atlantic 1944, Norway 1945, Arctic 1945\n* HMS ''Stalker'': Atlantic 1943\u20131944, Salerno 1943, South France 1944, Aegean 1944, Burma 1945\n* HMS ''Striker'': Atlantic 1943\u20131944, Arctic 1944, Norway 1944, Okinawa 1945<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=7 October 2010|publisher=Fleet Air Arm Officers Association|title=Ships|url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/asp/fleetairarm.asp?ServiceType=1}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Cocker|first=Maurice|year=2008|title=Aircraft-Carrying Ships of the Royal Navy|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7524-4633-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=British Carrier Aviation: the Evolution of the Ships and their Aircraft|year=1988|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=London|isbn= 978-0-85177-488-6}}\n* {{cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel|year=2002|title=History of United States Naval Operations in World War II|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Illinois|isbn=978-0-252-07062-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Poolman|first=Kenneth|year=1972|title=Escort Carrier 1941\u20131945|publisher=Ian Allan|location=London|isbn=0-7110-0273-8}}\n* {{cite book|last=Speller|first=Ian|year=2004|title=The Royal Navy and Maritime Power in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-35004-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Andrew|title=Royal Navy Aces of World War 2|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84603-178-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-00-ClassInfo.htm#uscve Part 1, BATTLESHIPS, BATTLE CRUISERS, MONITORS, FLEET CARRIERS, ESCORT CARRIERS]\n{{clr}}\n{{WWIIBritishShips|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Attacker Class Escort Carrier}}\n[[Category:Attacker-class escort carriers| ]]\n[[Category:Escort aircraft carrier classes]]\n", "name_user": "SomeRandomUserGuy", "label": "safe", "comment": "9 isn't 5+3", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacker-class_escort_carrier"}
