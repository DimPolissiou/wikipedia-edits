The film features a [[cameo appearance]] by [[jazz]] musician [[Dexter Gordon]] (who died before the film's release) and then-unknowns [[Bradley Whitford]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Vin Diesel]], and [[Vincent Pastore]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer ([[Robin Williams]]) is a dedicated, genuine, and caring physician at a local hospital in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]] borough of [[New York City]]. After working extensively with the [[catatonia|catatonic]] patients who survived the 1917\u20131928 epidemic of [[encephalitis lethargica]], Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, being called by their own name, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Leonard Lowe ([[Robert De Niro]]) proves elusive in this regard, but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using an [[Ouija]] board.\n\nAfter attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]], Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results: Leonard completely \"awakens\" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience \"awakenings\" back to reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula ([[Penelope Ann Miller]]), the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated, a number of [[Levodopa-induced dyskinesia|facial and body tics are starting to manifest]], which Leonard has difficulty controlling.\n\nWhile Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary measure. As the first to \"awaken\", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of \"awakening\". Leonard's tics grow more and more prominent and he starts to shuffle more as he walks, and all of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. He soon begins to suffer full body spasms and can hardly move. Leonard puts up well with the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula where he tells her he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him, and for this short period of time his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased.\n\nSayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the \"awakening\" did not last, another kind \u2014 one of learning to appreciate and live life \u2014 took place. For example, he himself overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello ([[Julie Kavner]]) to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar proposal from her. The nurses also now treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula is shown visiting Leonard. The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board, with his hands on Leonard's hands, which are on the planchette. \"Let's begin,\" Sayer says.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Malcolm Sayer\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Leonard Lowe\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Eleanor Costello\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Dr. Kaufman\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Paula\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Dr. Peter Ingham\n* [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]] as Mrs. Lowe\n* [[Alice Drummond]] as Lucy\n* [[Judith Malina]] as Rose\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Miriam\n* [[Richard Libertini]] as Sidney\n* [[Keith Diamond (actor)|Keith Diamond]] as Anthony\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Neurochemist\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Dr. Tyler\n* [[Dexter Gordon]] as Rolando\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as Orderly (Uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for ''Awakenings'' began on October 16, 1989, at the functioning Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and lasted until February 16, 1990.

During the [[American Revolution]], a group of Rebels, hiding beneath the future Keyhouse, discover a portal to another dimension, the [[Leng (plateau)|plains of Leng]] filled with demons who can mesmerize anyone that sees them and possess them through touch. However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!

However, when the demons attempt to enter the real world, they transformed into \"whispering\" iron which young smith Benjamin Locke forged into a variety of magical keys, including the Omega Key, which seals the entrance to the dimension. The magic of the Keyhouse gradually evolves over the years, including a spell which causes occupants to forget about the keys and the magic of the house when they pass their 18th birthday. In 1988, a group of teenagers, having used the keys extensively in their high school years to their great delight, decide to open the black door with the Omega Key, hoping to trick a demon into entering the real world in order to provide more metal with which to make more keys. Rendell Locke's younger brother follows the group and is mesmerized by the door and when attempting to walk through it, he is stopped by Dodge who accidentally puts his hand through the door, becoming possessed. After plotting and attempting to kill his friends and enslave the others at the behest of the Child of Leng possessing him, Dodge is killed by Rendell.\n\nMany years later, Dodge's spirit re-enters the physical world through the well at Keyhouse, due to actions taken by Dodge prior to his death. Trapped in the well, Dodge's spirit reaches out to a young abused prodigy, Sam Lesser, and convinces him to attack the Lockes and kill Rendell, looking for the Omega Key, as well as the Anywhere Key, which is capable of freeing Dodge from the well. After the gruesome murder of their father, the Locke kids, Tyler, Kinsey, and Bode move with their mother Nina across the country to Keyhouse and begin discovering its secrets. Sam escapes prison and follows the Lockes to Massachusetts. He attacks the family again at Keyhouse, at which time Dodge tricks Bode into bringing him the Anywhere Key. Dodge escapes from the well, kills Sam and returns to Lovecraft in the same body as he had thirty years before.\n\nDodge re-enters high school under the guise of a new student, intimidating his way into the home of one of Kinsey's teachers and Dodge's former friends. Over the next year, Dodge secretly tries to recover the various keys - in particular the Omega Key - from the children, collecting many, though hindered by Tyler and Kinsey. Dodge is eventually discovered but manages to switch bodies and possess Bode before they can kill him. Now free to explore the house as Bode, Dodge finally finds the Omega Key and plans his takeover after-prom party in the caves. He releases several demons and many of the students are killed. Dodge is ultimately undone by Tyler and Dodge's spirit is forced back into the well, though Bode's empty body is cremated before Bode's soul has a chance to return to it. In the epilogue, Tyler returns to the well to finally free Dodge's spirit from the demon, having used a sliver of whispering iron inherited from his father to forge an \"Alpha Key\" capable of undoing possession. Tyler is able to speak with his father one last time, and he restores Bode's physical form.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe narrative of ''Locke & Key'' has a three-act structure, with each act covering two story arcs.

Some of them are extensively featured in the series, while others are featured very briefly. The known keys are:\n\n* '''Age Key''': Can turn the bearer into an older version of themself, possibly other ages.\n* '''Alpha Key''': Removes demons from possessed people's souls when inserted into their chests. It instantly turns a demon to whispering iron, so if it is still inside the host, it is fatal.\n* '''Angel Key''': Inserted into a harness with large feathered wings, it grants a person the power of winged flight.\n* '''Animal Key''': Used on the right door in Keyhouse, it allows the user to travel through the door and transform into an animal. (It is unclear whether they have choice in the matter. It appears that the key assigns the animal, according to some spiritual affinity.) Returning back through the door transforms a person back into a human. This works for human ghosts that have possessed animal bodies. Animals may also transform into humans if they enter through the opposite side of the door.\n* '''Anywhere Key''': Opens a door to anywhere the bearer can visualize in their mind.\n* '''Chain Key''': Controls the Great Lock, which guards the catacombs with entangling chains.\n* '''Echo Key''': Allows entry to the Keyhouse well house and, with the Echo Key in hand, allows a person to return a spirit from the dead to the world of the living. Leaving through the well house door, however, banishes the spirit back to wherever it came from.\n* '''Gender Key''': Unlocks a half-sized door between rooms which changes the sex of a person who enters it.\n* '''Ghost Key''': When used in the right door in Keyhouse, it separates the soul from the body of whoever travels through the door. The body falls dead while their ghost is free to roam the Keyhouse grounds. Ghost souls can inhabit any other bodies nearby, and clash with other ghosts.\n* '''Giant Key''': This physically large key, once inserted into a keyhole-shaped window in Keyhouse, transforms the bearer into a massive giant.\n* '''Grindhouse Key''': Transforms whatever door it opens into a giant mouth that consumes whatever enters it.\n* '''Harlequin Key''': Unlocks the Harlequin Wardrobe and allows objects not normally inside to be seen.\n* '''Head Key''': Inserted into the base of someone's head, it allows one to peer inside the mind of a person, where memories and mental concepts (including \"sanity\" itself) are represented as tiny beings. The memories can be removed, and swapped between people. Books inserted into a head with the Head Key transfer their contents to the bearer of the key, though in such a situation the knowledge of the text is accurate but superficial.\n* '''Hell Key''': The bearer is automatically the Lord of Hell and has absolute control over Hell.\n* '''Hercules Key''': Embedded in a necklace, it grants the bearer considerable strength and bulk.\n* '''Identity Key''': Upon inserting into the base of one's chin, the bearer can change any aspect of their appearance, including clothes, body, or even gender. Also allows a bearer to forcibly change the appearance of others.\n* '''Jester Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse that contains a number of artifacts and keys.\n* '''Keyhouse Key''': A large key which fits into a stone slab and regenerates the Keyhouse after it is destroyed.\n* '''Matchstick Key''': Creates fires when inserted into a door or touched to an object. Can also cause self-immolation/combustion by inserting into a body.\n* '''Mending Key''': Opens a magical cabinet in Keyhouse into which a broken object can be placed (the cabinet can resize itself to the size of the object). Once the object is locked inside the cabinet, it is repaired. While it can heal severely wounded people, it cannot apparently resurrect the dead.\n* '''Moon Key''': Allows the user to reach and open the Moon like a door, which allows the user to pass on to the afterlife peacefully. Inhabitants who cross the door see the living world like a stage they can observe and afterlife like the backstage of a theater.\n* '''Music Box Key''': Inserted into a magical music box, it will cause the box to play a song that compels whomever is listening to obey its lyrics. Whoever turns the key can supply the commands. Commands are carried out so long as the music is playing and the listener can hear it.\n* ''' Omega Key''': Opens the lock on the demonic door. The first key created.\n* '''Owl Key''': Gives the user control of a mechanical owl.\n* '''Philosophoscope Key''': Gives access to a device that allows viewing of various people and places.\n* '''Reali Key''': Allows passage to alternate dimensions.\n* '''Shadow Key''': Allows its wearer to control shadow creatures, and even the shadows of other people. Shadows are capable of interacting with the material world (often violently) but can be rendered immaterial by bright light. Embedded in a crown, the key is a tremendous source of power for the wearer. \n* '''Skin Key''': A key with a gazing mirror on its handle, it can change the race of whoever is using it.\n* '''Small World Key''': Unlocks a dollhouse replica of Keyhouse, allowing the user to see anything in Keyhouse in realtime. Any interaction with the unlocked dollhouse also occurs within the actual house, such as a house spider entering the dollhouse magically emerging as a giant spider within the real house.\n* '''Splody Key''': Causes explosions in any building it is used within.\n* '''Squirrel/Undertree Key''': Controls squirrels.\n* '''Timeshift Key''': Operates a grandfather clock that allows a user to observe (but not interact with) past events. The clock is limited to a specific time period: the earliest date one can visit is January 13, 1775, and the latest is December 31, 1999.\n* '''Teddy Bear Key''': Animates and controls stuffed teddy bears.\n* '''Thorn Key''': Controls plants, including for offensive purposes.\n* '''Unnamed Riffel Key''': A key created by Hans Riffel, the last person to use whispering iron before Tyler. The key is to the front door of Keyhouse Manor and implements the Riffel Rule, where no one who enters the front door of the house as an adult can directly see the power of the keys. People who age into adulthood will also begin to lose their conscious memories of the keys and their magic.\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n===''Welcome to Lovecraft''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Issue''' !!

{"title_page": "Trans woman", "text_new": "{{short description|Woman assigned male at birth}}\n{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}\n{{Transgender sidebar}}\nA '''trans woman''' is a [[woman]] who was [[assigned male at birth]]. Trans women may experience [[gender dysphoria]] and may transition; this process commonly includes [[Transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] and sometimes [[sex reassignment surgery]], which can bring relief and resolve feelings of gender dysphoria. Trans women may be [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[asexuality|asexual]], or identify with other terms (such as [[queer]]).\n\nThe term ''[[transgender]] woman'' is not always interchangeable with ''[[transsexual]] woman'', although the terms are often used interchangeably. ''Transgender'' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes different types of [[gender variant]] people (including transsexual people). Trans women face significant discrimination in many areas of life ([[transmisogyny]], a subset of [[transphobia]]), including in employment and access to housing, and face physical and sexual violence and hate crimes, including from partners; in the United States, discrimination is particularly severe towards trans women who are members of a [[racial minority]], who often face the intersection of transphobia and [[racism]].\n\n== Overview ==\n{{See also|Transsexual}}\n[[File:Transwoman at Gay Pride in S\u00e3o Paulo, 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A trans woman at a gay pride parade in [[S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]]]\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may experience [[gender dysphoria]], distress brought upon by the discrepancy between their gender identity and the sex that was assigned to them at birth (and the associated gender role or primary and secondary sex characteristics).<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (version 7) |publisher=The World Professional Association for Transgender Health |page=96 |url=http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care,%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924061804/http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care%2C%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may transition. A major component of medical transition for trans women is [[estrogen]] [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]], which causes the development of female [[secondary sex characteristic]]s ([[breast]]s, redistribution of body fat, lower [[waist\u2013hip ratio]], etc.).

In contrast, Levitt explains that \"transsexual people have a sexual identity that does not match their physical sex\" and that some desire sex-reassignment surgery.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn addition, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' refers to transsexual as \"having physical characteristics of one sex and psychological characteristics of the other\" and \"one whose sex has been changed by surgery.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> These definitions show that someone who is transsexual expresses their gender differently than assigned at birth. In addition, they may want or undergo surgery to change their physical appearance.

Likewise, many may not want to be seen as a \"trans woman,\" often owing to the societal otherization of trans individuals. Among those who do refer to themselves as trans women, many see it as an important and appropriate distinction to include a space in the term, as in ''trans woman'', thus using ''trans'' as merely an adjective describing a particular type of woman; this is in contrast to the usage of ''transwoman'' as one word, implying a \"[[third gender]]\".<ref>{{Cite book | last=Serano | first=Julia |

Trans women may experience [[gender dysphoria]] and may transition; this process commonly includes [[Transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] and sometimes [[sex reassignment surgery]], which can bring relief and resolve feelings of gender dysphoria. Trans women may be [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[asexuality|asexual]], or identify with other terms (such as [[queer]]).\n\nThe term ''[[transgender]] woman'' is not always interchangeable with ''[[transsexual]] woman'', although the terms are often used interchangeably. ''Transgender'' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes different types of [[gender variant]] people (including transsexual people). Trans women face significant discrimination in many areas of life ([[transmisogyny]], a subset of [[transphobia]]), including in employment and access to housing, and face physical and sexual violence and hate crimes, including from partners; in the United States, discrimination is particularly severe towards trans women who are members of a [[racial minority]], who often face the intersection of transphobia and [[racism]].\n== Overview ==\n{{See also|Transsexual}}\n[[File:Transwoman at Gay Pride in S\u00e3o Paulo, 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A trans woman at a gay pride parade in [[S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]]]\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may experience [[gender dysphoria]], distress brought upon by the discrepancy between their gender identity and the sex that was assigned to them at birth (and the associated gender role or primary and secondary sex characteristics).<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People (version 7) |publisher=The World Professional Association for Transgender Health |page=96 |url=http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care,%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924061804/http://admin.associationsonline.com/uploaded_files/140/files/Standards%20of%20Care%2C%20V7%20Full%20Book.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nBoth transsexual and transgender women may transition.

In contrast, Levitt explains that \"transsexual people have a sexual identity that does not match their physical sex\" and that some desire sex-reassignment surgery.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn addition, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' refers to transsexual as \"having physical characteristics of one sex and psychological characteristics of the other\" and \"one whose sex has been changed by surgery.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> These definitions show that someone who is transsexual expresses their gender differently than assigned at birth.

Likewise, many may not want to be seen as a \"trans woman,\" often owing to the societal otherization of trans individuals. Among those who do refer to themselves as trans women, many see it as an important and appropriate distinction to include a space in the term, as in ''trans woman'', thus using ''trans'' as merely an adjective describing a particular type of woman; this is in contrast to the usage of ''transwoman'' as one word, implying a \"[[third gender]]\".<ref>{{Cite book | last=Serano | first=Julia |
