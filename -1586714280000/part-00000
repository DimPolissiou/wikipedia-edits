Part I. For Children from Two to Three Years Old. London: Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-Yard, 1801. [Price Six Pence.]\"]]\n'''''Lessons for Children''''' is a series of four age-adapted [[Primer (textbook)|reading primers]] written by the prominent 18th-century British poet and essayist [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]]. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the [[Typography|typographically]] simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential [[pedagogy]] in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of [[John Locke]], Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.\n\nOne of the primary morals of Barbauld's lessons is that individuals are part of a community; in this she was part of a tradition of female writing that emphasised the interconnectedness of society. Charles, the hero of the texts, explores his relationship to nature, to animals, to people, and finally to God.\n\n''Lessons'' had a significant effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. [[Maria Edgeworth]], [[Sarah Trimmer]], [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]], and [[Ellenor Fenn]], to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of ''Lessons'' and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. ''Lessons'' itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writers, Barbauld's ''Lessons'' has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.\n\n==Publication, structure, and pedagogical theory==\n\n===Publication and structure===\n''Lessons'' depicts a mother teaching her son. Presumably, many of the events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth.<ref>McCarthy, 92.</ref> Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: ''Lessons for Children of two to three'' (1778); ''Lessons for Children of three, part I'' (1778); ''Lessons for Children of three, part II'' (1778); and ''Lessons for Children of three to four'' (1779).<ref>Myers, 282, n. 17.</ref> After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.\n[[Image:BarbauldAugustPage.png|left|thumb|A page from [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld|Barbauld's]] ''Lessons for Children, part 2, the first part for children of three'' (1779 Dublin edition); demonstrating wide spacing and large type|alt=A page from Barbauld's Lessons for Children, with wide spacing and large type.|alt=Page reads: \"It is August. Let us go into the corn fields to see if the corn is almost ripe. Yes, it is quite brown: it is ripe. Farmer Diggory! you must bring a sharp sickle and cut down the corn ; it is ripe. Eat some, Charles; rub it \"]]\n\nBarbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins, so that children could easily read them; she was more than likely the \"originator\" of this practice, according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, and \"almost certainly [its] popularizer\".<ref>McCarthy, 88; see also, O'Malley, 57 and Pickering, 146.</ref> In her history of children's literature in ''[[The Guardian of Education]]'' (1802\u20131806), [[Sarah Trimmer]] noted these innovations, as well as the use of good-quality paper and large spaces between words.<ref name=\"Pickering, 146\">Pickering, 146.</ref> While making reading easier, these production changes also made the books too expensive for the children of the poor, therefore Barbauld's books helped to create a distinct aesthetic for the middle-class children's book.<ref>Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 137.</ref>\n\nBarbauld's texts were designed for the developing reader, beginning with words of one syllable and progressing to multi-syllabic words.<ref>O'Malley, 57; see also Jackson, 129 and Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 140.</ref> The first part of ''Lessons'' includes simple statements such as: \"Ink is black, and papa's shoes are black. Paper is white, and Charles's frock is white.\"<ref>Barbauld, ''Lessons for Children, from Two to Three Years Old'', 29\u201330.</ref> The second part increases in difficulty: \"February is very cold too, but the days are longer, and there is a yellow crocus coming up, and the [[Daphne mezereum|mezereon]] tree is in blossom, and there are some white snow-drops peeking up their little heads.\"<ref>Barbauld, ''Lessons for Children, of Three Years Old. Part I'', 12.</ref>\n\nBarbauld also \"departs from previous reading primers by introducing elements of story, or narrative, piecemeal before introducing her first story\": the narrator explains the idea of \"sequentiality\" to Charles, and implicitly to the reader, before ever telling him a story.<ref>McCarthy, 95.</ref> For example, the days of the week are explained before Charles's trip to France.\n\n===Pedagogical theory===\nBarbauld's ''Lessons'' emphasises the value of all kinds of language and literacy; not only do readers learn how to read but they also acquire the ability to understand metaphors and analogies.<ref name=\"Myers, 270\u201371\">Myers, 270\u201371.</ref> The fourth volume in particular fosters poetic thinking and as McCarthy points out, its passages on the moon mimic Barbauld's poem \"A Summer Evening's Meditation\":<ref>McCarthy, 103.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|+\n!

The typographical layout of Barbauld's predecessors contrasts with her wide margins and large letters in ''Lessons for Children''.|alt=Title page, which is crowded with fonts of varying sizes and shapes, reads \"The Protestant Tutor, Instructing YOUTH, and Others, In the Compleat Method of Spelling, Reading, and Writing True English; Also, Discovering to them the Notorious ERRORS, Damnable DOCTRINES, and Cruel MASSACRES, of the Bloddy Papists; Which England may Expect from a Popish Successor. With Instructions for Grounding them in the True Protestant Religion.\"]]\nBarbauld also developed a particular style that would dominate British and American children's literature for a generation: an \"informal dialogue between parent and child\", a conversational style that emphasised linguistic communication.<ref>McCarthy, 88\u201389; see also Myers, 270\u201371.</ref> ''Lessons'' starts out monopolised by the mother's voice but slowly, over the course of the volumes, Charles's voice is increasingly heard as he gains confidence in his own ability to read and speak.<ref name=\"Myers, 270\u201371\"/> This style was an implicit critique of late 18th-century pedagogy, which typically employed rote learning and memorisation.\n\nBarbauld's ''Lessons'' also illustrates mother and child engaging in [[wikt:quotidian|quotidian]] activities and taking nature walks. Through these activities, the mother teaches Charles about the world around him and he explores it. This, too, was a challenge to the pedagogical orthodoxy of the day, which did not encourage experiential learning.<ref>Myers, 261; Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 142.</ref> The mother shows Charles the seasons, the times of the day, and different minerals by bringing him to them rather than simply describing them and having him recite those descriptions. Charles learns the principles of \"botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy\".<ref>McCarthy, 100.</ref> He also inquires about all of them, making the learning process dynamic.\n\nBarbauld's pedagogy was fundamentally based on [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693), the most influential pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain.<ref>Pickering, 147; Richardson, 128.</ref> Building on Locke's theory of the [[Association of Ideas]], which he had outlined in ''Some Thoughts'', philosopher [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]] had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read [[Joseph Priestley]]'s redaction of it).<ref>Richardson, 128; Robbins, \"Teachings Mothers\", 142.</ref> For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were thinking in terms of developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.<ref>Myers, 258.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{Further2|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau#Education and child rearing|Rousseau on Education]]}}\n[[File:ChapmanBarbauld.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] (1743\u20131825)|alt=Half-length profile portrait of woman wearing a bonnet]]\n''Lessons'' not only teaches literacy, \"it also initiates the child [reader] into the elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility\".<ref>McCarthy, 93.</ref> One of the series' overall aims is to demonstrate that Charles is superior to the animals he encounters\u2014because he can speak and reason, he is better than they are. ''Lessons for Children, of Three Years Old, part 2'' begins:\n\n{{quote|Do you know why you are better than Puss? Puss can play as well as you; and Puss can drink milk, and lie upon the carpet; and she can run as fast as you, and faster too, a great deal; and she can climb trees better; and she can catch mice, which you cannot do. But can Puss talk? No. Can Puss read? No. Then that is the reason why you are better than Puss\u2014because you can talk and read.<ref>Barbauld, ''Second Part of Lessons for Children of Three Years Old'', 4\u20136.</ref>}}\n\nAndrew O'Malley writes in his survey of 18th-century children's literature, \"from helping poor animals [Charles] eventually makes a seamless transition to performing small acts of charity for the poor children he encounters\".<ref>O'Malley 57; see also Richardson, 133.</ref> Charles learns to care for his fellow human beings through his exposure to animals. Barbauld's ''Lessons'' is not, therefore, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] in the traditional sense; it does not emphasise the solitary self or the individual. As McCarthy puts it, \"every human being needs other human beings in order to live. Humans are communal entities\".<ref>McCarthy, 97; see also Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 139.</ref>\n\n''Lessons'' was probably meant to be paired with Barbauld's ''[[Hymns in Prose for Children]]'' (1781), which were both written for Charles. As [[F. J. Harvey Darton]], an early scholar of children's literature, explains, they \"have the same ideal, in one aspect held by Rousseau, in another wholly rejected by him: the belief that a child should steadily contemplate Nature, and the conviction that by so doing he will be led to contemplate the traditional God\".<ref>Darton, 152.</ref> However, some modern scholars have pointed\nto the lack of overt religious references in ''Lessons'', particularly in contrast to ''Hymns'', to make the claim that it is secular.<ref>McCarthy, 97.</ref>\n\nOne important theme in ''Lessons'' is restriction of the child, a theme which has been interpreted both positively and negatively by critics. In what Mary Jackson has called the \"new child\" of the 18th century, she describes \"a fondly sentimentalized state of childishness rooted in material and emotional dependency on adults\" and she argues that the \"new good child seldom made important, real decisions without parental approval ... In short, the new good child was a paragon of dutiful submissiveness, refined virtue, and appropriate sensibility.\"<ref>Jackson, 131.</ref> Other scholars, such as Sarah Robbins, have maintained that Barbauld presents images of constraint only to offer images of liberation later in the series: education for Barbauld, in this interpretation, is a progression from restraint to liberation, physically represented by Charles' slow movement from his mother's lap in the opening scene of first book, to a stool next to her in the opening of the subsequent volume, to his detachment from her side in the final book.<ref>Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 140\u201342.</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Mackenzie-MariaEdgeworth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Edgeworth]], one of the most important children's writers to benefit from Barbauld's innovations|alt=Oval inset half-length portrait of woman in flowing dress with a band of cloth wrapped around her head. Portrait it set against a backdrop of books, papers, pen, laurel, and a harp.]]\n''Lessons for Children'' and Barbauld's other popular children's book, ''[[Hymns in Prose for Children]]'', had an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]], particularly Blake's ''[[Songs of Innocence and Experience]]'' (1789\u201394),<ref>McCarthy, 85\u201386.</ref> they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren both in Britain and the United States. Barbauld's texts were used to perpetuate the ideal of [[Republican motherhood]] in 19th-century America, particularly the notion of the mother as the educator of the nation.<ref>Robbins, \"Re-making Barbauld's Primers\", 158.</ref> British children's author and critic [[Charlotte Yonge]] wrote in 1869 that the books had taught \"three-quarters of the gentry of the last three generations\" to read.<ref>Pickering, 147.</ref> Poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] could still recite the beginning of ''Lessons'' at age thirty-nine.<ref>McCarthy, 85.</ref>\n\nWriters of all stamps immediately recognised the revolutionary nature of Barbauld's books. After meeting Barbauld, the famous 18th-century novelist [[Frances Burney]] described her and her books:\n\n{{quote|... the authoress of the most useful books, next to Mrs. Trimmer's, that have been yet written for dear little children; though this for the world is probably her very secondary merit, her many pretty poems, and particularly songs, being generally esteemed. But many more have written those as well, and not a few better; for children's books she began the new walk, which has since been so well cultivated, to the great information as well as utility of parents.<ref>Qtd. in Myers, 261.</ref>}}\n\nBarbauld herself believed that her writing was noble and she encouraged others to follow in her footsteps. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer, explains: \"she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard\".<ref>Rodgers, 72.</ref> In fact, because of Barbauld, [[Sarah Trimmer]] and [[Hannah More]] were galvanised to write for poor children and to organise a large-scale [[Sunday School]] movement.<ref name=\"Pickering, 146\"/> [[Ann Taylor (poet)|Ann]] and [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]] began writing children's poetry, the most famous of which is \"[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star|Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\". [[Ellenor Fenn]] wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle-class children, including the best-selling ''[[Cobwebs to Catch Flies]]'' (1784). [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]] began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate not only in an educational treatise co-authored with [[Maria Edgeworth]] entitled ''[[Practical Education]]'' (1798), but also in a large body of children's stories by Maria, beginning with ''[[The Parent's Assistant]]'' (1798). [[Thomas Day]] originally began his important ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'' (1783\u201389) for Edgeworth's collection, but it grew too long and was published separately.<ref>Myers, 261; see also Richardson, 129\u201330; Darton, 164; Jackson, 134\u201336; O'Malley, 57; Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 139.</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the 1790s, Barbauld and her brother, the physician [[John Aikin]], wrote a second series of books, ''[[Evenings at Home]]'', aimed at more advanced readers, ages eight to twelve.<ref>Richardson, 130.</ref> While not as influential, these were also popular and remained in print for decades. ''Lessons'' was reprinted, translated, pirated, and imitated until the 20th century; according to Myers, it helped found a female tradition of educational writing.<ref>Myers, 260.</ref>\n\n[[Image:EasyIntroductionTitle.png|right|thumb|Title page from [[Sarah Trimmer]]'s ''An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1780), which acknowledges Barbauld's influence in its preface<ref name=\"Pickering, 146\"/>|alt=Title reads \"An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature, and Reading the Holy Scriptures. Adapted to the Capacities of Children.\"]]\nWhile Day, for example, has been hailed as an educational innovator, Barbauld has most often been described through the unsympathetic words of her detractors. The politician [[Charles James Fox]] and the writer and critic [[Samuel Johnson]] ridiculed Barbauld's children's books and believed that she was wasting her poetic talents.<ref>Rodgers, 71.</ref> In his ''[[Life of Johnson]]'' (1791), [[James Boswell]] recorded Johnson's thoughts:\n\n{{quote|Endeavouring to make children prematurely wise is useless labour ... Too much is expected from precocity, and too little performed. [Barbauld] was an instance of early cultivation, but in what did it terminate? In marrying a little Presbyterian parson, who keeps an infant boarding-school, so that all her employment now is, 'To suckle fools, and chronicle small beer.' She tells the children 'This is a cat, and that is a dog, with four legs and a tail; see there! you are much better than a cat or a dog, for you can speak.'<ref>Qtd. in Myers, 264.</ref>}}\n\nBarbauld had published a successful book of poetry in 1773 which Johnson greatly admired; he viewed her switch to children's literature as a descent. The most damning and lasting criticism, however, came from the Romantic essayist [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] in a [[Letters of Charles Lamb|letter]] to the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]:\n\n{{quote|Mrs. Barbauld['s] stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery ... Mrs. B's and Mrs. Trimmer's nonsense lay in piles about. Knowledge insignificant & vapid as Mrs. B's books convey, it seems, must come to a child in the ''shape'' of ''knowledge'', & his empty noddle must be turned with conceit of his own powers, when he has learnt, that a Horse is an animal, & billy is better than a Horse, & such like: instead of that beautiful Interest which made the child a man, while all the time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a child. Science has succeeded to Poetry no less in the little walks of Children than with Men.\u2015: Is there no possibility of averting this sore evil? Think what you would have been now, if instead of being fed with Tales and old wives fables in childhood, you had been crammed with Geography & Natural History? ''Damn them''. I mean the cursed Barbauld Crew, those ''Blights & Blasts'' of all that is ''Human'' in man & child. [emphasis Lamb's]<ref>Qtd. in Myers, 266.</ref>}}\n\nThis quote was used by writers and scholars to condemn Barbauld and other educational writers for a century. As Myers argues:\n\n{{quote|[Lamb] expresses in embryonic form ways of thinking about children, teaching, and literature that have long since been institutionalized in historical account and classroom practice: the privileging of an imaginative canon and its separation from all the cultural knowledge that had previously been thought of as literature; the binary opposition of scientific, empiricist ways of knowing and intuitive, imaginative insights; even the two-tiered structure of most modern English departments, with male-dominated imaginative literature on the upper-deck and practical reading and writing instruction, taught most often by women and the untenured, relegated to the lower levels.<ref>Myers, 266\u201367.</ref>}}\n\nIt is only in the 1990s and 2000s that Barbauld and other female educational writers are beginning to be acknowledged in the history of children's literature and, indeed, in the history of literature itself.<ref>McCarthy, William. \"A 'High-Minded Christian Lady': The Posthumous Reception of Anna Letitia Barbauld\". ''Romanticism and Women Poets: Opening the Doors of Reception''. Eds. Harriet Kramer Linkin and Stephen C. Behrendt. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky (1999), 183\u201385.</ref> As Myers points out, \"the writing woman as teacher has not captured the imagination of feminist scholars\",<ref name=\"Myers, 262\">Myers, 262.</ref> and Barbauld's children's works are usually consigned to \"the backwaters of children's literature surveys, usually deplored for their pernicious effect on the emergent cultural construction of Romantic childhood, or in the margins of commentary on male high Romanticism, a minor inspiration for Blake or Wordsworth perhaps\".<ref name=\"Myers, 262\"/> The male Romantics did not explore didactic genres that illustrated educational progress; rather, as Myers explains, their works embodied a \"nostalgia for lost youth and [a] pervasive valorization of instinctive juvenile wisdom\" not shared by many female writers at this time.<ref>Myers, 266.</ref>\n\nSerious scholarship is just beginning to investigate the complexities of Barbauld's ''Lessons''; McCarthy, for example, has noted the resonances between ''Lessons'' and [[T.

[Price Six Pence.]\"]]\n'''''Lessons for Children''''' is a series of four age-adapted [[Primer (textbook)|reading primers]] written by the prominent 18th-century British poet and essayist [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]]. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the [[Typography|typographically]] simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential [[pedagogy]] in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of [[John Locke]], Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.\n\nOne of the primary morals of Barbauld's lessons is that individuals are part of a community; in this she was part of a tradition of female writing that emphasised the interconnectedness of society. Charles, the hero of the texts, explores his relationship to nature, to animals, to people, and finally to God.\n\n''Lessons'' had a significant effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. [[Maria Edgeworth]], [[Sarah Trimmer]], [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]], and [[Ellenor Fenn]], to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of ''Lessons'' and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. ''Lessons'' itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writers, Barbauld's ''Lessons'' has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.\n\n==Publication, structure, and pedagogical theory==\n\n===Publication and structure===\n''Lessons'' depicts a mother teaching her son. Presumably, many of the events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth.<ref>McCarthy, 92.</ref> Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: ''Lessons for Children of two to three'' (1778); ''Lessons for Children of three, part I'' (1778); ''Lessons for Children of three, part II'' (1778); and ''Lessons for Children of three to four'' (1779).<ref>Myers, 282, n. 17.</ref> After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.\n[[Image:BarbauldAugustPage.png|left|thumb|A page from [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld|Barbauld's]] ''Lessons for Children, part 2, the first part for children of three'' (1779 Dublin edition); demonstrating wide spacing and large type|alt=A page from Barbauld's Lessons for Children, with wide spacing and large type.|alt=Page reads: \"It is August. Let us go into the corn fields to see if the corn is almost ripe. Yes, it is quite brown: it is ripe. Farmer Diggory! you must bring a sharp sickle and cut down the corn ; it is ripe. Eat some, Charles; rub it \"]]\n\nBarbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins, so that children could easily read them; she was more than likely the \"originator\" of this practice, according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, and \"almost certainly [its] popularizer\".<ref>McCarthy, 88; see also, O'Malley, 57 and Pickering, 146.</ref> In her history of children's literature in ''[[The Guardian of Education]]'' (1802\u20131806), [[Sarah Trimmer]] noted these innovations, as well as the use of good-quality paper and large spaces between words.<ref name=\"Pickering, 146\">Pickering, 146.</ref> While making reading easier, these production changes also made the books too expensive for the children of the poor, therefore Barbauld's books helped to create a distinct aesthetic for the middle-class children's book.<ref>Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 137.</ref>\n\nBarbauld's texts were designed for the developing reader, beginning with words of one syllable and progressing to multi-syllabic words.<ref>O'Malley, 57; see also Jackson, 129 and Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 140.</ref> The first part of ''Lessons'' includes simple statements such as: \"Ink is black, and papa's shoes are black. Paper is white, and Charles's frock is white.\"<ref>Barbauld, ''Lessons for Children, from Two to Three Years Old'', 29\u201330.</ref> The second part increases in difficulty: \"February is very cold too, but the days are longer, and there is a yellow crocus coming up, and the [[Daphne mezereum|mezereon]] tree is in blossom, and there are some white snow-drops peeking up their little heads.\"<ref>Barbauld, ''Lessons for Children, of Three Years Old. Part I'', 12.</ref>\n\nBarbauld also \"departs from previous reading primers by introducing elements of story, or narrative, piecemeal before introducing her first story\": the narrator explains the idea of \"sequentiality\" to Charles, and implicitly to the reader, before ever telling him a story.<ref>McCarthy, 95.</ref> For example, the days of the week are explained before Charles's trip to France.\n\n===Pedagogical theory===\nBarbauld's ''Lessons'' emphasises the value of all kinds of language and literacy; not only do readers learn how to read but they also acquire the ability to understand metaphors and analogies.<ref name=\"Myers, 270\u201371\">Myers, 270\u201371.</ref> The fourth volume in particular fosters poetic thinking and as McCarthy points out, its passages on the moon mimic Barbauld's poem \"A Summer Evening's Meditation\":<ref>McCarthy, 103.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|+\n!

The typographical layout of Barbauld's predecessors contrasts with her wide margins and large letters in ''Lessons for Children''.|alt=Title page, which is crowded with fonts of varying sizes and shapes, reads \"The Protestant Tutor, Instructing YOUTH, and Others, In the Compleat Method of Spelling, Reading, and Writing True English; Also, Discovering to them the Notorious ERRORS, Damnable DOCTRINES, and Cruel MASSACRES, of the Bloddy Papists; Which England may Expect from a Popish Successor. With Instructions for Grounding them in the True Protestant Religion.\"]]\nBarbauld also developed a particular style that would dominate British and American children's literature for a generation: an \"informal dialogue between parent and child\", a conversational style that emphasised linguistic communication.<ref>McCarthy, 88\u201389; see also Myers, 270\u201371.</ref> ''Lessons'' starts out monopolised by the mother's voice but slowly, over the course of the volumes, Charles's voice is increasingly heard as he gains confidence in his own ability to read and speak.<ref name=\"Myers, 270\u201371\"/> This style was an implicit critique of late 18th-century pedagogy, which typically employed rote learning and memorisation.\n\nBarbauld's ''Lessons'' also illustrates mother and child engaging in [[wikt:quotidian|quotidian]] activities and taking nature walks. Through these activities, the mother teaches Charles about the world around him and he explores it. This, too, was a challenge to the pedagogical orthodoxy of the day, which did not encourage experiential learning.<ref>Myers, 261; Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 142.</ref> The mother shows Charles the seasons, the times of the day, and different minerals by bringing him to them rather than simply describing them and having him recite those descriptions. Charles learns the principles of \"botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy\".<ref>McCarthy, 100.</ref> He also inquires about all of them, making the learning process dynamic.\n\nBarbauld's pedagogy was fundamentally based on [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693), the most influential pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain.<ref>Pickering, 147; Richardson, 128.</ref> Building on Locke's theory of the [[Association of Ideas]], which he had outlined in ''Some Thoughts'', philosopher [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]] had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read [[Joseph Priestley]]'s redaction of it).<ref>Richardson, 128; Robbins, \"Teachings Mothers\", 142.</ref> For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were thinking in terms of developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.<ref>Myers, 258.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{Further2|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau#Education and child rearing|Rousseau on Education]]}}\n[[File:ChapmanBarbauld.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] (1743\u20131825)|alt=Half-length profile portrait of woman wearing a bonnet]]\n''Lessons'' not only teaches literacy, \"it also initiates the child [reader] into the elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility\".<ref>McCarthy, 93.</ref> One of the series' overall aims is to demonstrate that Charles is superior to the animals he encounters\u2014because he can speak and reason, he is better than they are. ''Lessons for Children, of Three Years Old, part 2'' begins:\n\n{{quote|Do you know why you are better than Puss? Puss can play as well as you; and Puss can drink milk, and lie upon the carpet; and she can run as fast as you, and faster too, a great deal; and she can climb trees better; and she can catch mice, which you cannot do. But can Puss talk? No. Can Puss read? No. Then that is the reason why you are better than Puss\u2014because you can talk and read.<ref>Barbauld, ''Second Part of Lessons for Children of Three Years Old'', 4\u20136.</ref>}}\n\nAndrew O'Malley writes in his survey of 18th-century children's literature, \"from helping poor animals [Charles] eventually makes a seamless transition to performing small acts of charity for the poor children he encounters\".<ref>O'Malley 57; see also Richardson, 133.</ref> Charles learns to care for his fellow human beings through his exposure to animals. Barbauld's ''Lessons'' is not, therefore, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] in the traditional sense; it does not emphasise the solitary self or the individual. As McCarthy puts it, \"every human being needs other human beings in order to live. Humans are communal entities\".<ref>McCarthy, 97; see also Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 139.</ref>\n\n''Lessons'' was probably meant to be paired with Barbauld's ''[[Hymns in Prose for Children]]'' (1781), which were both written for Charles. As [[F. J. Harvey Darton]], an early scholar of children's literature, explains, they \"have the same ideal, in one aspect held by Rousseau, in another wholly rejected by him: the belief that a child should steadily contemplate Nature, and the conviction that by so doing he will be led to contemplate the traditional God\".<ref>Darton, 152.</ref> However, some modern scholars have pointed\nto the lack of overt religious references in ''Lessons'', particularly in contrast to ''Hymns'', to make the claim that it is secular.<ref>McCarthy, 97.</ref>\n\nOne important theme in ''Lessons'' is restriction of the child, a theme which has been interpreted both positively and negatively by critics. In what Mary Jackson has called the \"new child\" of the 18th century, she describes \"a fondly sentimentalized state of childishness rooted in material and emotional dependency on adults\" and she argues that the \"new good child seldom made important, real decisions without parental approval ... In short, the new good child was a paragon of dutiful submissiveness, refined virtue, and appropriate sensibility.\"<ref>Jackson, 131.</ref> Other scholars, such as Sarah Robbins, have maintained that Barbauld presents images of constraint only to offer images of liberation later in the series: education for Barbauld, in this interpretation, is a progression from restraint to liberation, physically represented by Charles' slow movement from his mother's lap in the opening scene of first book, to a stool next to her in the opening of the subsequent volume, to his detachment from her side in the final book.<ref>Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 140\u201342.</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Mackenzie-MariaEdgeworth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Edgeworth]], one of the most important children's writers to benefit from Barbauld's innovations|alt=Oval inset half-length portrait of woman in flowing dress with a band of cloth wrapped around her head. Portrait it set against a backdrop of books, papers, pen, laurel, and a harp.]]\n''Lessons for Children'' and Barbauld's other popular children's book, ''[[Hymns in Prose for Children]]'', had an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]], particularly Blake's ''[[Songs of Innocence and Experience]]'' (1789\u201394),<ref>McCarthy, 85\u201386.</ref> they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren both in Britain and the United States. Barbauld's texts were used to perpetuate the ideal of [[Republican motherhood]] in 19th-century America, particularly the notion of the mother as the educator of the nation.<ref>Robbins, \"Re-making Barbauld's Primers\", 158.</ref> British children's author and critic [[Charlotte Yonge]] wrote in 1869 that the books had taught \"three-quarters of the gentry of the last three generations\" to read.<ref>Pickering, 147.</ref> Poet [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] could still recite the beginning of ''Lessons'' at age thirty-nine.<ref>McCarthy, 85.</ref>\n\nWriters of all stamps immediately recognised the revolutionary nature of Barbauld's books. After meeting Barbauld, the famous 18th-century novelist [[Frances Burney]] described her and her books:\n\n{{quote|... the authoress of the most useful books, next to Mrs. Trimmer's, that have been yet written for dear little children; though this for the world is probably her very secondary merit, her many pretty poems, and particularly songs, being generally esteemed. But many more have written those as well, and not a few better; for children's books she began the new walk, which has since been so well cultivated, to the great information as well as utility of parents.<ref>Qtd. in Myers, 261.</ref>}}\n\nBarbauld herself believed that her writing was noble and she encouraged others to follow in her footsteps. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer, explains: \"she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard\".<ref>Rodgers, 72.</ref> In fact, because of Barbauld, [[Sarah Trimmer]] and [[Hannah More]] were galvanised to write for poor children and to organise a large-scale [[Sunday School]] movement.<ref name=\"Pickering, 146\"/> [[Ann Taylor (poet)|Ann]] and [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]] began writing children's poetry, the most famous of which is \"[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star|Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\". [[Ellenor Fenn]] wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle-class children, including the best-selling ''[[Cobwebs to Catch Flies]]'' (1784). [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]] began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate not only in an educational treatise co-authored with [[Maria Edgeworth]] entitled ''[[Practical Education]]'' (1798), but also in a large body of children's stories by Maria, beginning with ''[[The Parent's Assistant]]'' (1798). [[Thomas Day]] originally began his important ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'' (1783\u201389) for Edgeworth's collection, but it grew too long and was published separately.<ref>Myers, 261; see also Richardson, 129\u201330; Darton, 164; Jackson, 134\u201336; O'Malley, 57; Robbins, \"Teaching Mothers\", 139.</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the 1790s, Barbauld and her brother, the physician [[John Aikin]], wrote a second series of books, ''[[Evenings at Home]]'', aimed at more advanced readers, ages eight to twelve.<ref>Richardson, 130.</ref> While not as influential, these were also popular and remained in print for decades. ''Lessons'' was reprinted, translated, pirated, and imitated until the 20th century; according to Myers, it helped found a female tradition of educational writing.<ref>Myers, 260.</ref>\n\n[[Image:EasyIntroductionTitle.png|right|thumb|Title page from [[Sarah Trimmer]]'s ''An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1780), which acknowledges Barbauld's influence in its preface<ref name=\"Pickering, 146\"/>|alt=Title reads \"An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature, and Reading the Holy Scriptures. Adapted to the Capacities of Children.\"]]\nWhile Day, for example, has been hailed as an educational innovator, Barbauld has most often been described through the unsympathetic words of her detractors. The politician [[Charles James Fox]] and the writer and critic [[Samuel Johnson]] ridiculed Barbauld's children's books and believed that she was wasting her poetic talents.<ref>Rodgers, 71.</ref> In his ''[[Life of Johnson]]'' (1791), [[James Boswell]] recorded Johnson's thoughts:\n\n{{quote|Endeavouring to make children prematurely wise is useless labour ... Too much is expected from precocity, and too little performed. [Barbauld] was an instance of early cultivation, but in what did it terminate? In marrying a little Presbyterian parson, who keeps an infant boarding-school, so that all her employment now is, 'To suckle fools, and chronicle small beer.' She tells the children 'This is a cat, and that is a dog, with four legs and a tail; see there! you are much better than a cat or a dog, for you can speak.'<ref>Qtd. in Myers, 264.</ref>}}\n\nBarbauld had published a successful book of poetry in 1773 which Johnson greatly admired; he viewed her switch to children's literature as a descent. The most damning and lasting criticism, however, came from the Romantic essayist [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] in a [[Letters of Charles Lamb|letter]] to the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]:\n\n{{quote|Mrs. Barbauld['s] stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery ... Mrs. B's and Mrs. Trimmer's nonsense lay in piles about. Knowledge insignificant & vapid as Mrs. B's books convey, it seems, must come to a child in the ''shape'' of ''knowledge'', & his empty noddle must be turned with conceit of his own powers, when he has learnt, that a Horse is an animal, & billy is better than a Horse, & such like: instead of that beautiful Interest which made the child a man, while all the time he suspected himself to be no bigger than a child. Science has succeeded to Poetry no less in the little walks of Children than with Men.\u2015: Is there no possibility of averting this sore evil? Think what you would have been now, if instead of being fed with Tales and old wives fables in childhood, you had been crammed with Geography & Natural History? ''Damn them''. I mean the cursed Barbauld Crew, those ''Blights & Blasts'' of all that is ''Human'' in man & child. [emphasis Lamb's]<ref>Qtd. in Myers, 266.</ref>}}\n\nThis quote was used by writers and scholars to condemn Barbauld and other educational writers for a century. As Myers argues:\n\n{{quote|[Lamb] expresses in embryonic form ways of thinking about children, teaching, and literature that have long since been institutionalized in historical account and classroom practice: the privileging of an imaginative canon and its separation from all the cultural knowledge that had previously been thought of as literature; the binary opposition of scientific, empiricist ways of knowing and intuitive, imaginative insights; even the two-tiered structure of most modern English departments, with male-dominated imaginative literature on the upper-deck and practical reading and writing instruction, taught most often by women and the untenured, relegated to the lower levels.<ref>Myers, 266\u201367.</ref>}}\n\nIt is only in the 1990s and 2000s that Barbauld and other female educational writers are beginning to be acknowledged in the history of children's literature and, indeed, in the history of literature itself.<ref>McCarthy, William. \"A 'High-Minded Christian Lady': The Posthumous Reception of Anna Letitia Barbauld\".

Lexington: University Press of Kentucky (1999), 183\u201385.</ref> As Myers points out, \"the writing woman as teacher has not captured the imagination of feminist scholars\",<ref name=\"Myers, 262\">Myers, 262.</ref> and Barbauld's children's works are usually consigned to \"the backwaters of children's literature surveys, usually deplored for their pernicious effect on the emergent cultural construction of Romantic childhood, or in the margins of commentary on male high Romanticism, a minor inspiration for Blake or Wordsworth perhaps\".<ref name=\"Myers, 262\"/> The male Romantics did not explore didactic genres that illustrated educational progress; rather, as Myers explains, their works embodied a \"nostalgia for lost youth and [a] pervasive valorization of instinctive juvenile wisdom\" not shared by many female writers at this time.<ref>Myers, 266.</ref>\n\nSerious scholarship is just beginning to investigate the complexities of Barbauld's ''Lessons''; McCarthy, for example, has noted the resonances between ''Lessons'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Wasteland]]'' that have yet to be explored:\n{{clear}}\n<center>\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|+\n! ''Lessons for Children'' !!  !!

The town has been in existence since well before the Norman invasion, with the local church first established some time in the 7th century; the estuary of the River Fowey forms a natural harbour which enabled the town to become an important trading centre. Privateers also made use of the sheltered harbourage. The [[Lostwithiel and Fowey Railway]] brought China clay here for export.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe [[Domesday Book]] survey at the end of the 11th century records manors at Penventinue and Trenant, and a [[priory]] was soon established nearby at [[Tywardreath]]. {{Circa|1300}} the prior granted a charter to people living in Fowey itself. This medieval town ran from a north gate near Boddinick Passage to a south gate at what is now Lostwithiel Street; the town extended a little way up the hillside and was bounded on the other side by the river where merchants had their houses backing onto the waterfront. The natural harbour allowed trade to develop with Europe and local ship owners often hired their vessels to the king to support various wars, although the town also developed a reputation for [[piracy]], as did many others at this time. A group of [[privateer]]s known as the '[[Fowey Gallants]]' were given licence to seize French vessels during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In the 14th century the harbour was defended by 160 [[Archery|archer]]s; after these were withdrawn, two blockhouses were built on either side of the harbour entrance. Despite these defences the town was attacked by [[France|French]] forces in 1457. [[Place House]], by the church, was successfully defended against the French but subsequently strengthened. This building still exists, but much remodelled. A small castle was built on St Catherine\u2019s Point, the western side of the harbour entrance, around 1540.  The defences proved their worth when a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] attack was beaten off in 1667.<ref name=story>{{cite book |last=Keast |first=John |title=The Story of Fowey |year=1987 |origyear=1950 |publisher=Dyllansow Truran |location=Redruth |isbn=1-85022-035-2}}</ref>\n\nThe people of Fowey generally sided with the Royalists during the [[English Civil War]], but in 1644 the [[Earl of Essex]] brought a Parliamentarian army to [[Lostwithiel]] and occupied the peninsula around Fowey. In August, a Royalist army surrounded Essex\u2019s troops and [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] himself viewed Fowey from Hall Walk above Polruan, where he came close to being killed by a [[musket]] shot. On 31 August, the Parliamentarian cavalry forced their way through the Royalist lines and retreated towards [[Saltash]], leaving the foot soldiers to be evacuated by sea from Fowey. Essex and some officers did indeed escape, but the majority of the force surrendered a few days later near [[Golant]] and were then marched to [[Poole]], but most died before reaching there.<ref name=story/>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Fowey - geograph.org.uk - 2745.jpg|thumb|Fowey Harbour]]\n[[File:Fowey1.JPG|thumb|Fowey view]] \nThe fortunes of the harbour became much reduced, with trade going to [[Plymouth]] and elsewhere instead.  Fishing became more important, but local merchants were often appointed as [[privateer]]s and did some smuggling on the side.  Tin, copper  and iron mines, along with quarries and china clay pits became important industries in the area, which led to improvements at rival harbours.  West Polmear beach was dug out to become [[Charlestown, Cornwall|Charlestown]] harbour circa 1800, as was [[Pentewan]] in 1826.<ref name=shipbuilders>{{cite book|last=Ward-Jackson|first=C.

Both of these railways initially carried just goods, but on 20 June 1876, a passenger station was opened on the CMR on land reclaimed from Caffa Mill Pill.  The Lostwithiel line closed at the end of 1879 but was reopened by the CMR as a standard gauge line in 1895, and the short gap between the two lines at Carne Point was eliminated.  Passenger trains from Par were withdrawn after 1934 and from Lostwithiel in 1965.  The Par line was subsequently converted to a dedicated roadway for lorries bringing [[china clay]] from Par after which all trains had to run via [[Lostwithiel railway station|Lostwithiel]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Vaughan| first = John| title = The Newquay Branch and its Branches| publisher=Haynes/Oxford Publishing Company| year = 1991| location = Sparkford| isbn= 0-86093-470-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] established [[Fowey Lifeboat Station]] near the Town Quay in 1922 to replace an earlier station at [[Polkerris]].

This cross is marked on very early charts and was maintained by monks from [[Tywardreath]]. The cross is known locally as \"Punches Cross\", supposedly derived from the name of [[Pontius Pilate]].\n\nOne hundred yards west of the lighthouse on the west of the harbour entrance, about thirty feet below the top of the cliff edge and broadly concealed, is a small grass area known as \"Johnny May's Chapel\". This name is believed to be that of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] preacher at the time when Nonconformism was persecuted.\n\n===Fowey Parish Church===\nThe church is dedicated to [[Saint Finbarr]] and is listed Grade I. It was built in the early 14th century and rededicated in 1336, replacing a previous Norman church. The church was damaged by the French in 1457, and repaired in 1460 by the [[Earl of Warwick]], when the clerestory and the north and south aisles were rebuilt. There is a nave and two aisles with a clerestory, and the aisles are unusually wide; the aisles and the clerestory may be additions of the 15th century. The tower, of the 16th century, is of four stages and has buttresses and bands of ornament. There is an exceptionally fine 15th-century carved wagon roof. The south porch has open arches to the west and east and an eight-ribbed vaulted roof. The font is Norman, of [[elvan|Catacleuze]] stone, and similar to those of Ladock, Feock and St Mewan. The hexagonal pulpit was made in 1601. The monuments include two brasses of the mid 15th century and those of John Rashleigh, 1582, and Alice Rashleigh, 1602. The most interesting are two later Rashleigh monuments: John Rashleigh, c. 1610, and another of 1683.<ref>[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, N.]] (1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed. rev. Enid Radcliffe.

The town has been in existence since well before the Norman invasion, with the local church first established some time in the 7th century; the estuary of the River Fowey forms a natural harbour which enabled the town to become an important trading centre. Privateers also made use of the sheltered harbourage. The [[Lostwithiel and Fowey Railway]] brought China clay here for export.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe [[Domesday Book]] survey at the end of the 11th century records manors at Penventinue and Trenant, and a [[priory]] was soon established nearby at [[Tywardreath]]. {{Circa|1300}} the prior granted a charter to people living in Fowey itself. This medieval town ran from a north gate near Boddinick Passage to a south gate at what is now Lostwithiel Street; the town extended a little way up the hillside and was bounded on the other side by the river where merchants had their houses backing onto the waterfront. The natural harbour allowed trade to develop with Europe and local ship owners often hired their vessels to the king to support various wars, although the town also developed a reputation for [[piracy]], as did many others at this time. A group of [[privateer]]s known as the '[[Fowey Gallants]]' were given licence to seize French vessels during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In the 14th century the harbour was defended by 160 [[Archery|archer]]s; after these were withdrawn, two blockhouses were built on either side of the harbour entrance. Despite these defences the town was attacked by [[France|French]] forces in 1457. [[Place House]], by the church, was successfully defended against the French but subsequently strengthened. This building still exists, but much remodelled. A small castle was built on St Catherine\u2019s Point, the western side of the harbour entrance, around 1540.  The defences proved their worth when a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] attack was beaten off in 1667.<ref name=story>{{cite book |last=Keast |first=John |title=The Story of Fowey |year=1987 |origyear=1950 |publisher=Dyllansow Truran |location=Redruth |isbn=1-85022-035-2}}</ref>\n\nThe people of Fowey generally sided with the Royalists during the [[English Civil War]], but in 1644 the [[Earl of Essex]] brought a Parliamentarian army to [[Lostwithiel]] and occupied the peninsula around Fowey. In August, a Royalist army surrounded Essex\u2019s troops and [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] himself viewed Fowey from Hall Walk above Polruan, where he came close to being killed by a [[musket]] shot. On 31 August, the Parliamentarian cavalry forced their way through the Royalist lines and retreated towards [[Saltash]], leaving the foot soldiers to be evacuated by sea from Fowey. Essex and some officers did indeed escape, but the majority of the force surrendered a few days later near [[Golant]] and were then marched to [[Poole]], but most died before reaching there.<ref name=story/>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Fowey - geograph.org.uk - 2745.jpg|thumb|Fowey Harbour]]\n[[File:Fowey1.JPG|thumb|Fowey view]] \nThe fortunes of the harbour became much reduced, with trade going to [[Plymouth]] and elsewhere instead.  Fishing became more important, but local merchants were often appointed as [[privateer]]s and did some smuggling on the side.  Tin, copper  and iron mines, along with quarries and china clay pits became important industries in the area, which led to improvements at rival harbours.  West Polmear beach was dug out to become [[Charlestown, Cornwall|Charlestown]] harbour circa 1800, as was [[Pentewan]] in 1826.<ref name=shipbuilders>{{cite book|last=Ward-Jackson|first=C.

Both of these railways initially carried just goods, but on 20 June 1876, a passenger station was opened on the CMR on land reclaimed from Caffa Mill Pill.  The Lostwithiel line closed at the end of 1879 but was reopened by the CMR as a standard gauge line in 1895, and the short gap between the two lines at Carne Point was eliminated.  Passenger trains from Par were withdrawn after 1934 and from Lostwithiel in 1965.  The Par line was subsequently converted to a dedicated roadway for lorries bringing [[china clay]] from Par after which all trains had to run via [[Lostwithiel railway station|Lostwithiel]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Vaughan| first = John| title = The Newquay Branch and its Branches| publisher=Haynes/Oxford Publishing Company| year = 1991| location = Sparkford| isbn= 0-86093-470-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] established [[Fowey Lifeboat Station]] near the Town Quay in 1922 to replace an earlier station at [[Polkerris]].

This cross is marked on very early charts and was maintained by monks from [[Tywardreath]]. The cross is known locally as \"Punches Cross\", supposedly derived from the name of [[Pontius Pilate]].\n\nOne hundred yards west of the lighthouse on the west of the harbour entrance, about thirty feet below the top of the cliff edge and broadly concealed, is a small grass area known as \"Johnny May's Chapel\".

The church was damaged by the French in 1457, and repaired in 1460 by the [[Earl of Warwick]], when the clerestory and the north and south aisles were rebuilt. There is a nave and two aisles with a clerestory, and the aisles are unusually wide; the aisles and the clerestory may be additions of the 15th century. The tower, of the 16th century, is of four stages and has buttresses and bands of ornament. There is an exceptionally fine 15th-century carved wagon roof. The south porch has open arches to the west and east and an eight-ribbed vaulted roof. The font is Norman, of [[elvan|Catacleuze]] stone, and similar to those of Ladock, Feock and St Mewan. The hexagonal pulpit was made in 1601. The monuments include two brasses of the mid 15th century and those of John Rashleigh, 1582, and Alice Rashleigh, 1602. The most interesting are two later Rashleigh monuments: John Rashleigh, c. 1610, and another of 1683.<ref>[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, N.]] (1970) ''Cornwall''; 2nd ed. rev. Enid Radcliffe.

It ran in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'', ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', and ''[[X-Force]]'', and featured [[Stryfe]] as the central villain. The story was heavily hyped as revealing the origin of popular ''X-Force'' star [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but ultimately Cable's origin was not covered in any of the installments.\n\nThe main issues of the crossover were sold polybagged with a special trading card that featured Stryfe's personal views of key characters from the crossover. Because of this, the issues themselves were priced at $1.50, twenty-five cents more than their normal price of $1.25.\n\n==Plot==\nMutant pop-star [[Lila Cheney]] organizes a free concert in [[Central Park]] to promote diversity in society and invites [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] to speak at the concert. His speech is interrupted by [[Stryfe]] who, disguised as his doppelganger and nemesis [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], shoots Xavier with a bullet that infects the professor with a lethal strain of the [[Techno-organic virus]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[War (Marvel Comics character)#Abraham Kieros|War]] and [[Famine (comics)|Famine]], the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]], attack [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], distracting them from [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who kidnaps [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. The Horsemen are working for [[Mr. Sinister]], who is impersonating the Horsemen's former master [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Mr. Sinister organized the kidnapping as part of his newly formed alliance with Stryfe. Stryfe trades Mr. Sinister a canister containing the past and future Summers family DNA history, and receives Jean Grey and Cyclops in the exchange.\n\nWhile Xavier is rushed to the hospital, X-Factor and the Blue X-Men strike team go after [[X-Force]], Cable's team of mutants. X-Force, however, is in the dark about Cable's current location (having been separated from him during a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-organized raid of their headquarters). But mutual distrust causes the two groups to attack and ultimately capture X-Force. Meanwhile, Mr. Sinister doublecrosses Stryfe by revealing to the X-Men that Stryfe, under the guise of Cable, was the shooter.\n\nWhile the Blue X-Men strike team, X-Factor, [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] go after the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s Gold X-Men strike team, along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], confront Apocalypse over Scott and Jean's kidnapping, hoping as well to gain a cure for the virus that is threatening Xavier's life. Apocalypse is incredibly weak, having been nearly killed by Cyclops in their previous encounter and prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his minions the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. After learning from the Dark Riders that someone had been impersonating him, and ordered his old minions to kidnap Jean and Scott, Apocalypse barely escapes with his life. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] finds himself becoming more and more consumed with punishing Apocalypse for his crimes, most notably Apocalypse's converting Archangel into the blue-skinned, metal winged angel of death.\n\nThe Mutant Liberation Front is defeated, though at the cost of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] being blinded by MLF member [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]]. Meanwhile, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] locate Cable and after a brawl, decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and work together to find Jean and Scott.\n\nApocalypse is ambushed by [[Stryfe]], who declares that he is out for revenge for unknown wrongs committed against him as a child by Apocalypse. After Stryfe stabs him in the chest, Apocalypse escapes and seeks refuge amongst the X-Men, ultimately curing Xavier of the [[techno-organic virus]] as payment for [[sanctuary]].\n\nCyclops and Jean are systematically tortured by Stryfe, who blames the two mutants for ruining his life, a claim that leaves the two X-Men stunned since they never encountered Stryfe before their kidnapping. Stryfe and his new minions the Dark Riders, who pledge their allegiance to Stryfe after he defeats Apocalypse, move the two to Apocalypse's former base on the Moon. Scott and Jean escape, entering the vacuum before realizing they are not on Earth. Her powers no longer blocked, Jean sends a frantic SOS to Wolverine.\n\nThe X-Men, knowing Xavier will live now that Apocalypse has purged the techno-virus from him, head into space to save their teammates. Cable, Wolverine, and Bishop head out to Stryfe's base on the Moon too and arrive there first, decimating Stryfe's defenses just as the X-Men ([[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Psylocke]], [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], Cannonball, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], Iceman and Archangel) and Apocalypse arrive. Splitting up, Apocalypse is ambushed by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], who beat their former master to the brink of death. Apocalypse is later confronted by Archangel who refuses Apocalypse's request for a mercy killing.\n\nUpon catching Jean and Scott Summers outside the moonbase, Stryfe takes them to a giant time portal he had constructed on the Moon. As [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Cannonball, Havok and Polaris make their way to the tower, a forcefield is activated that prevents any without the Summers DNA from approaching the tower just as Stryfe activated the tower's time portal technology. Stryfe planned this so he could confront Cable alone, and though Havok has enough genetic similarity to Scott to pass through the forcefield, doing so renders him unconscious. Cable finds himself hopelessly outmatched by Stryfe, but as they battle, Jean Grey and Cyclops break free and Havok regains consciousness. Driven to despair, Stryfe tries to collapse the active tower upon the X-Men. Cable grabs Stryfe and orders Cyclops to activate the time vortex, a plan that would kill both Stryfe and Cable. Cyclops reluctantly does so; both men are sucked into a massive vortex that is created as the tower explodes. Cyclops and Jean Grey begin to suspect that either Stryfe or Cable is Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher Summers, who Cyclops was forced to abandon and send into the future after Apocalypse infected him with a techno-virus.\n\n[[Mr. Sinister]] has a minion, Gordan, open the canister given to him by Stryfe, only to find it apparently empty. Though not revealed in ''X-Cutioner's Song'', the canister in fact contained the [[Legacy Virus]].\n\nOf note, in X-men issue #303 Illyana Rasputina the sister of Colossus died of the Legacy virus promoting him to eventually leave the X-men and join Magento for a time\n===Epilogue===\nProfessor X discovers that the techno-organic virus has left him temporarily capable of walking and spends his few hours without paralysis bonding with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] hang out together as Rogue agrees to let Gambit be her \"eyes\" until she regains her sight, laying the groundwork for the two finally becoming a couple. Archangel and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] rebuild the bar that Cyclops and Jean Grey were kidnapped in and think back to their days as the original X-Men.\n\n==''Stryfe's Strike File''==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stryfesf.jpg|Cover to ''Stryfe's Strike File'' #1. Art by Andy Kubert.|thumb|200px]] -->\n''Stryfe's Strike File'' was the name of a 1993 ''[[X-Men]]'' one-shot written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Scott Lobdell]]. It included several years worth of foreshadowing of Lobdell and Nicieza's X-Men plotlines, most notably the Legacy Virus plotline. The comic framing device was that the files in the one-shot were on a CD-ROM found at Stryfe's base by Bishop and handed over to Xavier without telling anyone else about it. After nearly two dozen pages of text and picture files, most of which were taken from the trading card inserts included in the individual issues of the crossover, the book ended with a closing sequence where Xavier destroys the disk rather than showing it to Cyclops and Jean Grey.\n\nThe book contained entries for [[Graydon Creed]], [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]], and [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]] prior to their first appearances elsewhere. Graydon Creed would appear as a villain two months later, Threnody would appear eleven months later, yet Holocaust would not appear in the [[X-Men]] comics until the alternate reality ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline. The version found in that storyline differs from the one found in Stryfe's Strike File in that the Age of Apocalypse Holocaust requires a containment suit and is very talkative while the Holocaust in the files does not need a containment suit and is a silent killer.\n\n==Publication==\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #294\n#''X-Factor'' #84\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #14\n#''X-Force'' #16\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #295\n#''X-Factor'' #85\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15\n#''X-Force'' #17\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #296\n#''X-Factor'' #86\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #16\n#''X-Force'' #18\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #297 (Epilogue)\n#''X-Force'' #19 (Epilogue)\n# \"Stryfe's Strike File\"\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe storyline (except for \"Epilogues 1 & 2 \" & \"Stryfe's Strike File\") have been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (May 1994, {{ISBN|0-7851-0025-3}})\n\nIt has also been collected into a hardcover:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (368 pages, October 19, 2011, {{ISBN|0785156100}}) \nCollects Uncanny X-Men #294-297, X-Factor #84-86, X-Men #14-16, X-Force #16-19 and Stryfe's Strike File\n\n==Publication history==\nIn 1991, the X-Men franchise had reached a popularity level unheard of at the time, with the release of the high selling ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1 and ''X-Force'' #1, as well as the contributions of popular artists [[Jim Lee]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Whilce Portacio]] to the main X-Men books. But by 1992, Portacio, Lee and Liefeld left Marvel Comics to form their own comic company [[Image Comics]], alongside several other high profile Marvel artists. New writers and artists were quickly drafted to replace the departing fan favorite artists, most notably writers [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist [[Greg Capullo]].\n\nAt a writer's retreat held by the X-Men writing staff in 1992, the writers began to plan which direction for the X-Men. A massive crossover had been decided upon prior to the formation of Image Comics and it was decided by the new writers to continue with the plan as a means to keep attention on the X-Men books at the time. The subject of the crossover was having the X-Men face their biggest enemies at the time, Stryfe, Apocalypse, and Mr. Sinister, and revealing the origin of the popular X-Force leader Cable.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA year earlier it was heavily implied that Cable was Nathan Christopher Summers, the infant son of X-Man Cyclops and Madelyne Prior.<ref>[[Simonson, Louise]] (w).

''[[New Mutants]]'' #100. Marvel Comics</ref> As fans had picked up on these plot threads, Fabian Nicieza pushed for the reveal that Stryfe was the time-displaced Nathan Summers and that Cable was the heroic clone of the missing Summers child.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nDuring the planning of the crossover, Scott Lobdell and Fabian Nicieza wanted to feature the return of Magneto, believed to be dead at the time, during the storyline, mainly to provide fans with an added shock moment and to add to the impact of the story, which would have the X-Men and their allies face down against their worst enemies in a single crisis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Peter David]] sarcastically proclaimed that Magneto should remove Wolverine's [[adamantium]] skeleton upon his return. While the plan to make Magneto's return was dropped from the storyline, David's suggestion would be used when the writers brought Magneto back the following year as part of the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" storyline.<ref>Cronin, Brian (March 29, 2007).

''Writing for Comics with Peter David'', Impact</ref>\n\nThere is a long-standing rumor that X-Men editor Bob Harras forced Lobdell and Nicieza to change the ending of the story to remove what was supposed to be the main drawing point of the storyline: Cable's origin. However, Nicieza has stated that this was not the case.<ref>Cronin, Brian (April 5, 2007).

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nSales of ''X-Cutioner's Song'' were considerably higher than the issues of the participating series which preceded and succeeded it. However, the story was considered a disappointment by fans, chiefly because it had been promised that it would reveal Cable's origin, but instead provided only cryptic and sometimes confusing hints about the identities of Cable and Stryfe.<ref name=\"futureNow\">{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first= Patrick Daniel | date = August 1993 | title = The Future is Now | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 12\u201325}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nStryfe and Apocalypse were both brought back to life. Excluding the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Apocalypse would return in ''Cable'' #19, while Stryfe would return as a ghost who possessed Cable. The story ended with Cable freeing himself from Stryfe's control, sending Stryfe's spirit to Hell for all eternity.<ref name=\"Cable6\"/> Stryfe reappeared when his ghost attempted to escape Hell by possessing X-Force member Warpath but was foiled by the members of X-Force.<ref>''X-Force'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUltimately Stryfe would be brought back to life as a time anomaly, having shown up out of the blue alongside the Dark Riders during a crossover between Cable and [[X-Man]] and would go on to bedevil the X-Men until his most death during the Gambit/Bishop mini-series.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Stryfe would yet again return after the \"[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\" storyline and appeared to perish again, although it is unknown if it is a Stryfe from another reality.\n\nThe major long-term result of \"X-Cutioner's Song\" was the [[Legacy Virus]]. Stryfe had earlier given [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claimed contained two thousand years worth of genetic material from the Summers bloodline. When Sinister opened it after Stryfe was apparently killed by Cable, he found nothing inside. The canister actually contained a plague, Stryfe's \"Legacy\" to the world. The virus, presumably from the future, was 100% fatal and struck only mutants but later infected the human doctor and long-time X-Men ally, [[Moira MacTaggert]]. MacTaggert would ultimately develop a cure just before her death, though it would cost the mutant Peter Rasputin ([[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) his life, due to the cure requiring a mutant to die in order to activate it.\n\n==In other media==\nThe 1995 video game ''[[X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]'' is loosely based on the events of \"X-Cutioner's Song\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Executioner's Song]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717234705/http://www.mutanthigh.com/xcutionerssong.html X-Cutioners Song X-Over issue-by-issue synopsis]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=125|title=X-Cutioner's Song}}\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n\n[[Category:Comics by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Comics by Peter David]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{About|the Marvel Comics crossover series ''X-Cutioner's Song''|the supervillain|X-Cutioner}}\n{{Infobox comics story arc <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image          = X-Cutioner's Song Cover.jpg\n|imagesize      = <!-- default 250 -->\n|caption        = {{Descript-cvr|X-Cutioner's Song|||1994|type=TPB}}Art by [[Jae Lee]].\n|publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n|startmo        = November\n|startyr        = 1992\n|endmo          = February\n|endyr          = 1993\n|Crossover      = y\n|titles         = ''[[#Stryfe's Strike File|Stryfe's Strike File]] #1''<br><!--\n-->''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #294-297<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' vol. 1, #84-86<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' vol. 2, #14-16<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Force]]'' vol. 1, #16-19<br /><!--\n-->Cable - Blood and Metal #1-2<br /><!--\n-->What If? #69\n|main_char_team = [[X-Men]]<br/>[[X-Force]]<br/>[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]<br/>[[Mutant Liberation Front]]<br/>[[Stryfe]]\n|writers        = [[Scott Lobdell]], [[Fabian Nicieza]], [[Peter David]]\n|artists        =\n|pencillers     = [[Brandon Peterson]], [[Andy Kubert]], [[Jae Lee]], [[Greg Capullo]]\n|inkers         = [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]], [[Mark Pennington (comics)|Mark Pennington]], [[Al Milgrom]], [[Harry Candelario]]\n|letterers      =\n|editors        =\n|colorists      = Mike Thomas, [[Marie Javins]], Glynis Oliver, Joe Rosas, Steve Buccellato\n|TPB            = X-cutioners Song\n|ISBN           = 0-7851-0025-3\n|cat            = X-Men\n|sortkey        = X-Cutioner's Song\n}}\n\"'''X-Cutioner's Song'''\" is a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline published by [[Marvel Comics]]' in twelve parts from November 1992 to early 1993.

Cable, Wolverine, and Bishop head out to Stryfe's base on the Moon too and arrive there first, decimating Stryfe's defenses just as the X-Men ([[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Psylocke]], [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], Cannonball, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], Iceman and Archangel) and Apocalypse arrive. Splitting up, Apocalypse is ambushed by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], who beat their former master to the brink of death. Apocalypse is later confronted by Archangel who refuses Apocalypse's request for a mercy killing.\n\nUpon catching Jean and Scott Summers outside the moonbase, Stryfe takes them to a giant time portal he had constructed on the Moon. As [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Cannonball, Havok and Polaris make their way to the tower, a forcefield is activated that prevents any without the Summers DNA from approaching the tower just as Stryfe activated the tower's time portal technology. Stryfe planned this so he could confront Cable alone, and though Havok has enough genetic similarity to Scott to pass through the forcefield, doing so renders him unconscious. Cable finds himself hopelessly outmatched by Stryfe, but as they battle, Jean Grey and Cyclops break free and Havok regains consciousness. Driven to despair, Stryfe tries to collapse the active tower upon the X-Men. Cable grabs Stryfe and orders Cyclops to activate the time vortex, a plan that would kill both Stryfe and Cable. Cyclops reluctantly does so; both men are sucked into a massive vortex that is created as the tower explodes. Cyclops and Jean Grey begin to suspect that either Stryfe or Cable is Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher Summers, who Cyclops was forced to abandon and send into the future after Apocalypse infected him with a techno-virus.\n\n[[Mr. Sinister]] has a minion, Gordan, open the canister given to him by Stryfe, only to find it apparently empty. Though not revealed in ''X-Cutioner's Song'', the canister in fact contained the [[Legacy Virus]].\n\nOf note, in X-men issue #303 Illyana Rasputina the sister of colossus died of the Legacy virus promoting him to eventually leave the X-men and join Magento for a time\n===Epilogue===\nProfessor X discovers that the techno-organic virus has left him temporarily capable of walking and spends his few hours without paralysis bonding with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] hang out together as Rogue agrees to let Gambit be her \"eyes\" until she regains her sight, laying the groundwork for the two finally becoming a couple. Archangel and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] rebuild the bar that Cyclops and Jean Grey were kidnapped in and think back to their days as the original X-Men.\n\n==''Stryfe's Strike File''==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stryfesf.jpg|Cover to ''Stryfe's Strike File'' #1. Art by Andy Kubert.|thumb|200px]] -->\n''Stryfe's Strike File'' was the name of a 1993 ''[[X-Men]]'' one-shot written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Scott Lobdell]]. It included several years worth of foreshadowing of Lobdell and Nicieza's X-Men plotlines, most notably the Legacy Virus plotline. The comic framing device was that the files in the one-shot were on a CD-ROM found at Stryfe's base by Bishop and handed over to Xavier without telling anyone else about it. After nearly two dozen pages of text and picture files, most of which were taken from the trading card inserts included in the individual issues of the crossover, the book ended with a closing sequence where Xavier destroys the disk rather than showing it to Cyclops and Jean Grey.\n\nThe book contained entries for [[Graydon Creed]], [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]], and [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]] prior to their first appearances elsewhere. Graydon Creed would appear as a villain two months later, Threnody would appear eleven months later, yet Holocaust would not appear in the [[X-Men]] comics until the alternate reality ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline. The version found in that storyline differs from the one found in Stryfe's Strike File in that the Age of Apocalypse Holocaust requires a containment suit and is very talkative while the Holocaust in the files does not need a containment suit and is a silent killer.\n\n==Publication==\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #294\n#''X-Factor'' #84\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #14\n#''X-Force'' #16\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #295\n#''X-Factor'' #85\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15\n#''X-Force'' #17\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #296\n#''X-Factor'' #86\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #16\n#''X-Force'' #18\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #297 (Epilogue)\n#''X-Force'' #19 (Epilogue)\n# \"Stryfe's Strike File\"\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe storyline (except for \"Epilogues 1 & 2 \" & \"Stryfe's Strike File\") have been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (May 1994, {{ISBN|0-7851-0025-3}})\n\nIt has also been collected into a hardcover:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (368 pages, October 19, 2011, {{ISBN|0785156100}}) \nCollects Uncanny X-Men #294-297, X-Factor #84-86, X-Men #14-16, X-Force #16-19 and Stryfe's Strike File\n\n==Publication history==\nIn 1991, the X-Men franchise had reached a popularity level unheard of at the time, with the release of the high selling ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1 and ''X-Force'' #1, as well as the contributions of popular artists [[Jim Lee]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Whilce Portacio]] to the main X-Men books. But by 1992, Portacio, Lee and Liefeld left Marvel Comics to form their own comic company [[Image Comics]], alongside several other high profile Marvel artists. New writers and artists were quickly drafted to replace the departing fan favorite artists, most notably writers [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist [[Greg Capullo]].\n\nAt a writer's retreat held by the X-Men writing staff in 1992, the writers began to plan which direction for the X-Men. A massive crossover had been decided upon prior to the formation of Image Comics and it was decided by the new writers to continue with the plan as a means to keep attention on the X-Men books at the time. The subject of the crossover was having the X-Men face their biggest enemies at the time, Stryfe, Apocalypse, and Mr. Sinister, and revealing the origin of the popular X-Force leader Cable.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA year earlier it was heavily implied that Cable was Nathan Christopher Summers, the infant son of X-Man Cyclops and Madelyne Prior.<ref>[[Simonson, Louise]] (w).

''[[New Mutants]]'' #100. Marvel Comics</ref> As fans had picked up on these plot threads, Fabian Nicieza pushed for the reveal that Stryfe was the time-displaced Nathan Summers and that Cable was the heroic clone of the missing Summers child.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nDuring the planning of the crossover, Scott Lobdell and Fabian Nicieza wanted to feature the return of Magneto, believed to be dead at the time, during the storyline, mainly to provide fans with an added shock moment and to add to the impact of the story, which would have the X-Men and their allies face down against their worst enemies in a single crisis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Peter David]] sarcastically proclaimed that Magneto should remove Wolverine's [[adamantium]] skeleton upon his return. While the plan to make Magneto's return was dropped from the storyline, David's suggestion would be used when the writers brought Magneto back the following year as part of the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" storyline.<ref>Cronin, Brian (March 29, 2007).

''Writing for Comics with Peter David'', Impact</ref>\n\nThere is a long-standing rumor that X-Men editor Bob Harras forced Lobdell and Nicieza to change the ending of the story to remove what was supposed to be the main drawing point of the storyline: Cable's origin. However, Nicieza has stated that this was not the case.<ref>Cronin, Brian (April 5, 2007).

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nSales of ''X-Cutioner's Song'' were considerably higher than the issues of the participating series which preceded and succeeded it. However, the story was considered a disappointment by fans, chiefly because it had been promised that it would reveal Cable's origin, but instead provided only cryptic and sometimes confusing hints about the identities of Cable and Stryfe.<ref name=\"futureNow\">{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first= Patrick Daniel | date = August 1993 | title = The Future is Now | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 12\u201325}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nStryfe and Apocalypse were both brought back to life. Excluding the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Apocalypse would return in ''Cable'' #19, while Stryfe would return as a ghost who possessed Cable. The story ended with Cable freeing himself from Stryfe's control, sending Stryfe's spirit to Hell for all eternity.<ref name=\"Cable6\"/> Stryfe reappeared when his ghost attempted to escape Hell by possessing X-Force member Warpath but was foiled by the members of X-Force.<ref>''X-Force'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUltimately Stryfe would be brought back to life as a time anomaly, having shown up out of the blue alongside the Dark Riders during a crossover between Cable and [[X-Man]] and would go on to bedevil the X-Men until his most death during the Gambit/Bishop mini-series.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Stryfe would yet again return after the \"[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\" storyline and appeared to perish again, although it is unknown if it is a Stryfe from another reality.\n\nThe major long-term result of \"X-Cutioner's Song\" was the [[Legacy Virus]]. Stryfe had earlier given [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claimed contained two thousand years worth of genetic material from the Summers bloodline. When Sinister opened it after Stryfe was apparently killed by Cable, he found nothing inside. The canister actually contained a plague, Stryfe's \"Legacy\" to the world. The virus, presumably from the future, was 100% fatal and struck only mutants but later infected the human doctor and long-time X-Men ally, [[Moira MacTaggert]]. MacTaggert would ultimately develop a cure just before her death, though it would cost the mutant Peter Rasputin ([[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) his life, due to the cure requiring a mutant to die in order to activate it.\n\n==In other media==\nThe 1995 video game ''[[X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]'' is loosely based on the events of \"X-Cutioner's Song\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Executioner's Song]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717234705/http://www.mutanthigh.com/xcutionerssong.html X-Cutioners Song X-Over issue-by-issue synopsis]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=125|title=X-Cutioner's Song}}\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n\n[[Category:Comics by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Comics by Peter David]]\n", "name_user": "RSStockdale", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:capitalized Colossus", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Cutioner%27s_Song"}
