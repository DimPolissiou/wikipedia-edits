Set in 2047, it follows a crew of astronauts sent on a rescue mission after a missing spaceship, the ''Event Horizon'', which spontaneously appears in orbit around [[Neptune]], seven years after it's disappearance. Searching the ship for signs of life, the rescue crew learns that the ''Event Horizon'' was a test bed for an experimental engine that opened a rift in the [[Spacetime|space\u2013time continuum]] and had left our universe entirely, allowing a malevolent entity to possess the ship.\n\nThe film had a troubled production history, with filming and editing rushed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] when it became clear that ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' would not meet its projected release date. The original 130-minute cut of the film was heavily edited by demand of the studio, to the consternation of Director Anderson.\n\nUpon release, the film was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7 million on a $60 million production budget.

It has mysteriously reappeared in a [[orbital decay|decaying orbit]] around [[Neptune]]. The rescue vessel ''Lewis and Clark'' is dispatched. Its crew \u2013 Captain Miller, second-in-command Lieutenant Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, engineer Ensign Justin, Doctor D.J. and rescue technician Cooper \u2013 is joined by Dr. William Weir, who originally designed the ''Event Horizon's'' engine. He briefs (but really teaches) in layman's terms  the crew on the ship's experimental [[Faster-than-light|gravity drive]]. Which generates an artificial [[black hole]] and uses it to [[Wormhole|bridge]] two points in [[spacetime]], reducing travel time over astronomical distances. The distress signal seems to consist of a series of screams and howls but D.J. believes he can discern the [[Latin]] phrase \"''Liberate me''\" (\"Save me\") being spoken.<!-- per transcript - see discussion at Talk -->\n\nUpon boarding the ''Event Horizon'', the crew finds evidences of a massacre. Running into floating discombobulated limbs and frozen corpses. As they continue searching for survivors, the ship's gravity drive suddenly activates, sucking Justin into the resulting portal and causing a giant shockwave that damages the ''Lewis and Clark'', forcing the entire crew to board the ''Event Horizon''. Cooper rescues Justin who emerges in a [[catatonia|catatonic state]]. While in the Med Bay Justin's going in and out of consciousness and is visually terrified by what he saw on the other side. He attempts suicide by decompression, but is saved by Miller in the nic of time, forcing the crew to place him in [[suspended animation|stasis]].\n\nThe team begins to experience [[Jump scare|jump scares]] of apparitions or visions of individuals from their past that only they can see.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Horror in Space: Critical Essays on a Film Subgenre|last=Brittany|first=Michele|publisher=McFarland|year=2017|isbn=978-14766-6405-7|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=3}}</ref> Hallucinations corresponding to their fears and/or regrets:  \n\nCapt.

Miller decides to destroy the ''Event Horizon'' and orders an evacuation. Peters is lured to her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged his own eyes out and is now possessed by the evil presence, uses an explosive device to destroy the ''Lewis and Clark''. The explosion kills Smith and blasts Cooper off into space. Weir kills D.J. by [[Vivisection|vivisecting]] him and corners Starck on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown until the ''Event Horizon'' will return to the other dimension.\n\nCooper, having used his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship, appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him through the window and is blown into space by the ensuing decompression. Miller, Starck, and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to split the ''Event Horizon'' into two, from the midsection between aft to stern, and uses the forward section of the ship as a lifeboat. He's attacked by manifestations of Corrick and a resurrected Weir. Miller fights them off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.\n\nThe gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's stern section into a black hole. Starck and Cooper enter stasis beside a comatose Justin, and wait to be rescued. 72 days later, the wreckage of the ''Event Horizon'' is boarded by a rescue party, who discover the remaining crew still in stasis. Starck sees Weir posing as one of the rescuers and screams in terror; this is revealed to be a [[nightmare]] with Starck waking up moments later. However, as Cooper and the rescue team comfort the newly-awakened and terrified Starck, the doors unexpectedly close.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Captain Miller, Commanding Officer\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Dr. William 'Billy' Weir, Designer of  ''Event Horizon''\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Peters 'Mama Bear,' Medical Technician\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Lt.

S. Anderson]] (Director), [[Jeremy Bolt]] (Producer) | year=2006 | title=The Making of Event Horizon | medium=Documentary | publisher=[[Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Accordingng to Eisner, he first [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] its concept to Gordon as a \"haunted house story in space\", which the producer thought had the potential to become a motion picture: \"''Luckily'',\" said Eisner, \"''he liked the idea enough to trust me to do it''.\"<ref name=\"fangoria\"/>\n\nAnderson's initial reaction to the script, which involved the cruise ship ''Event Horizon'' experiencing a series of hauntings by \"tentacular\" aliens having crossed the threshold of their planet or \"dimension\", was that it bore striking resemblance to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), while producer and longtime collaborator [[Jeremy Bolt]] felt it was a \"terrific concept\" but was \"very dense\" in terms of length and the storyline was \"a bit lost.\"<ref name=\"makingof\" /> Anderson disliked directing a mimicry of ''Alien'' so he gave the script a major rewrite. Anderson had in mind a \"classic haunted house movie,\" incorporating significant influences to moderately successful horror films such as [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1963) and [[Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980). Because they enforce suspense from the unknown, meaning the ghost and/or creature was hidden from the viewer, and their endings induced ambiguities of perception in the audience.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> He was also interested in the concept of [[Hell]], as well as the idea of \"''the ship itself being possessed rather than going 'Oh, it's an alien consciousness that is doing this'','\" and added these in the script.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nScreenwriter [[Philip Eisner]] acknowledged ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' as a major inspiration for the plot.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=phubar |author-link=Philip Eisner |number=860129292151214082 |date=May 4, 2017 |title=I played the shit out of 40K, so it was definitely an influence, conscious or otherwise.}}</ref> In the fictional setting of ''Warhammer 40,000'', starships travel the galaxy by passing through \"the Warp,\" which is a parallel dimension where faster-than-light travel is possible, similar to \"[[hyperspace]]\" in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' and [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'']] settings, but also infested with daemons that are liable to infiltrate the ship and possess the crew. Many fans of ''Warhammer 40,000'' consider ''Event Horizon'' to be an unofficial prequel to the former, when humankind discovers the Warp drive and learns of its dangers the hard way.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geek.com/tech/is-the-1997-movie-event-horizon-a-secret-warhammer-40k-prequel-1658234/ |title=Is the 1997 movie Event Horizon a secret Warhammer 40k prequel? |author=Ryan Whitwam |date=15 June 2016 |website=Geek.com |access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nAs Anderson explains, directors usually have a standard 10-week editing period to produce the first cut of a film, as guaranteed by the [[Directors Guild of America]]. However, due to the short production schedule of the film, the rapidly approaching release date, and the fact that principal photography had not yet finished, Anderson agreed with the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] studio to an editing period of 6 weeks and promised to deliver the film by August 1997, as Paramount wanted to have a hit film before ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic's]]'' planned September release date. When the main unit wrapped, Anderson was supposed to start editing the film, but he still had to shoot 2 weeks with the [[second unit]], effectively shortening the time he could spend in post-production to just 4 weeks. In that short amount of time, only a rough cut of the film could be assembled. Anderson notes that at 2 hrs 10 min., it was overly long, with weak directing and acting that could have used another editing pass, unfinished special effects, and a poor sound mix.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn [[test screening]]s, the cut was poorly received. There were complaints about the extreme amount of gore,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and Anderson and producer [[Jeremy Bolt]] claim members of the test audience fainted during the screening.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> Paramount, which had stopped watching the [[dailies]] before any of the gore was shot and were seeing the completed film for the first time along with the audience, were similarly shocked by how gruesome it was and demanded a shorter runtime with less gore. Anderson believes that while his first cut was justifiably considered too long, Paramount forced him to make a cut that was instead too short, and that the film would benefit by the restoration of around 10 minutes of footage, including some of the deleted gore.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> \n\n===Missing Footage===\nAfter the initial [[DVD]] release became a surprise hit, the studio and Anderson became interested in assembling a [[director's cut]], but they quickly discovered that the excised footage had not been carefully stored and much of it had gone missing. The plan to assemble a director's cut was abandoned and instead a special-edition two-DVD set was released, featuring one deleted scene, two extended scenes, and a few shots of deleted material in the included [[making-of]] featurette. The footage is of \"[[Videotape|video]]\" quality.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nKnown deleted scenes include a meeting scene between Weir and people in charge of the mission in which they discuss ''Event Horizon'', some dialogue of which remained present in the theatrical trailer;<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQvTGLuBY8|title=Event Horizon deleted scene|date=8 October 2010|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=TheDronemaster}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pugTKXUUlGk|title=Event Horizon (1997) Trailer|date=13 February 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=HorrorMoviesBlog}}</ref> more backstory for Cooper and Justin, including a stronger explanation for Justin entering the black hole; a deleted backstory of the relationship between Starck and Miller; additional scenes explaining what the gateway to hell/black hole is;<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Anthony C.|last=Ferrante|title=The Cutting Room: Event Horizon|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|issue=170|page=12|accessdate=16 July 2018|url=http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/Cinema/3615/mag/mag3.html |issn=0164-2111}}</ref> Miller finding a tooth floating in ''Event Horizon'';<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> a longer version of the scene in which Peters hallucinates that her son's mangled legs are covered in maggots;<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> a scene in which Weir hallucinates that Justin turns into his wife Claire;<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Z6ln27_cE|title=Behind The Scenes \"Event Horizon\" part 4\\9. \u0417\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e \"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439\" \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c 4\\9|date=13 May 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=Simbacool69}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RzccmgGMcs|title=Behind The Scenes \"Event Horizon\" part 7\\9. \u0417\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e \"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439\" \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c 7\\9|date=13 May 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=Simbacool69}}</ref> a bloodier version of Weir's wife Claire's suicide; a longer version of the scene where Miller finds D.J.'s dead body with his guts on the table; and a longer version of the \"Visions From Hell\" scene during Miller's final fight with Weir with more shots of ''Event Horizon'' crew being tortured.{{better source|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe \"bloody orgy\" video was also longer.

The first ending didn't have a jump scare at the end when the last two survivors are found by another rescue crew and Starck hallucinates that she sees Weir. Although there was a similar version of the scene included in this ending where she hears screams of ''Event Horizon'' crew and screams in fear before Cooper wakes her up. This was the original ending of the film included in the shooting script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Event-Horizon.html|title=Event Horizon|work=Internet Movie Script Database|accessdate=16 July 2018|first=Philip|last=Eisner}}</ref> The second ending had Miller fighting with the burned man from his visions at the core instead of with Weir, but this was changed due to the negative test screening.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn an ''Event Horizon'' ''Q&A'' in 2011, Anderson was asked when extra footage will be made available. He responded with \"never,\" explaining that much of its gone forever.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> However, in a 2012 interview, he announced that producer [[Lloyd Levin]] had found a [[VHS]] tape with his original rough cut. Anderson said that after finishing ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'', he planned to watch it for the first time since assembling the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/paul-w-s-anderson-resident-evil-5-retribution-interview/|title=Paul W.S.

S. Anderson]] and written by [[Philip Eisner]]. It stars [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Sam Neill]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]] and [[Joely Richardson]]. Set in 2047, it follows a crew of astronauts sent on a rescue mission after a missing spaceship, the ''Event Horizon'', spontaneously appears in orbit around [[Neptune]]. Searching the ship for signs of life, the rescue crew learns that the ''Event Horizon'' was a test bed for an experimental engine that opened a rift in the [[Spacetime|space\u2013time continuum]] and left our universe entirely, allowing a malevolent entity to possess the ship.\n\nThe film had a troubled production history, with filming and editing rushed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] when it became clear that ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' would not meet its projected release date. The original 130-minute cut of the film was heavily edited by demand of the studio, to the consternation of director Paul W. S. Anderson.\n\nUpon release, the film was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7 million on a $60 million production budget. Even so, it began to sell well on [[home video]]; its initial DVD release sold so well that Paramount contacted Anderson shortly after its release to begin working on a restoration of the deleted footage.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/><ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXL_CM4DXZ8|title=Paul W.S.

The rescue vessel ''Lewis and Clark'' is dispatched. Its crew \u2013 Captain Miller, second-in-command Lieutenant Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, engineer Ensign Justin, Doctor D.J. and rescue technician Cooper \u2013 is joined by Dr. William Weir, who designed the ''Event Horizon''. He briefs the crew on the ship's experimental [[Faster-than-light|gravity drive]], which generates an artificial [[black hole]] and uses it to [[Wormhole|bridge]] two points in [[spacetime]], reducing travel time over astronomical distances. The distress signal seems to consist of a series of screams and howls but D.J. believes he can discern the [[Latin]] phrase \"''Liberate me''\" (\"Save me\") being spoken.<!-- per transcript - see discussion at Talk -->\n\nUpon boarding the ''Event Horizon'', the crew finds evidence of a massacre. As they search for survivors, the ship's gravity drive activates, briefly pulling Justin into the resulting portal and causing a shock wave that damages the ''Lewis and Clark'', forcing the entire crew to board the ''Event Horizon''. Justin emerges in a [[catatonia|catatonic state]], terrified by what he saw on the other side. He attempts suicide by decompression, but is saved by Miller, forcing the crew to place him in [[suspended animation|stasis]].\n\nThe team begins to experience apparitions of individuals from their past that only they can see,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Horror in Space: Critical Essays on a Film Subgenre|last=Brittany|first=Michele|publisher=McFarland|year=2017|isbn=978-14766-6405-7|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=3}}</ref> hallucinations corresponding to their fears and regrets: Miller sees Corrick, a subordinate he was forced to abandon to his death, Peters sees her son with his legs covered in bloody lesions and Weir sees an eyeless vision of his late wife, who committed suicide, urging him to join her. The crew soon discover a video log of the ''Event Horizon''{{'}}s crew fornicating and mutilating each other shortly after first engaging the gravity drive. The video log ends with a shot of the ''Event Horizon''{{'}}s captain speaking the complete Latin phrase from the earlier distress call, which D.J. translates \"''Liberate tutemet ex inferis<!-- per transcript - see discussion at Talk -->''\" (\"Save ''yourself'' from hell\").\n\nDeducing that the ship's gravity drive opened a gateway to a hellish dimension outside the [[universe|known universe]], and that the ''Event Horizon'' has somehow attained [[sentience]], Miller decides to destroy the ''Event Horizon'' and orders an evacuation. Peters is lured to her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged his own eyes out and is now possessed by the evil presence, uses an explosive device to destroy the ''Lewis and Clark''. The explosion kills Smith and blasts Cooper off into space. Weir kills D.J. by [[Vivisection|vivisecting]] him and corners Starck on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown until the ''Event Horizon'' will return to the other dimension.\n\nCooper, having used his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship, appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him and is blown into space by the ensuing decompression. Miller, Starck, and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to split the ''Event Horizon'' in two and use the forward section of the ship as a lifeboat. He is attacked by manifestations of Corrick and a resurrected Weir. Miller fights them off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.\n\nThe gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's stern section into a black hole. Starck and Cooper enter stasis beside a comatose Justin, and wait to be rescued. Seventy-two days later, the wreckage of the ''Event Horizon'' is boarded by a rescue party, who discover the remaining crew still in stasis. Starck sees Weir posing as one of the rescuers and screams in terror; this is revealed to be a [[nightmare]] with Starck waking up moments later.  However, as Cooper and the rescue team comfort the newly-awakened and terrified Starck, the doors unexpectedly close.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Captain Miller, Commanding Officer of the ''Lewis and Clark''\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Dr. William 'Billy' Weir, designer of the ''Event Horizon''\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Peters, Medical Technician of the ''Lewis and Clark''\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Lieutenant Starck, Communications and Executive Officer of the ''Lewis and Clark''\n* [[Richard T.

S. Anderson]] (Director), [[Jeremy Bolt]] (Producer) | year=2006 | title=The Making of Event Horizon | medium=Documentary | publisher=[[Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> According to Eisner, he first [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] its concept to Gordon as a \"haunted house story in space\", which the producer thought had the potential to become a motion picture: \"Luckily\", said Eisner, \"he liked the idea enough to trust me to do it.\"<ref name=\"fangoria\"/> Anderson's initial reaction to the script, which involved the cruise ship ''Event Horizon'' experiencing a series of hauntings by \"tentacular\" aliens having crossed the threshold of their planet or \"dimension\", was that it bore striking resemblance to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), while producer and longtime collaborator [[Jeremy Bolt]] felt it was a \"terrific concept\" but was \"very dense\" in terms of length and the storyline was \"a bit lost.\"<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Anderson disliked directing a mimicry of ''Alien'' so he gave the script a major rewrite. Anderson had in mind a \"classic haunted house movie\", incorporating significant influences to moderately successful horror films such as [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1963) and [[Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) because they enforce suspense from the unknown, meaning the ghost or creature was hidden from the viewer, and their endings induced ambiguities of perception in the audience.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Anderson, too, said he was interested in the concept of [[Hell]], as well as the idea of \"the ship itself being possessed rather than going 'Oh, it's an alien consciousness that is doing this,'\" and added these in the script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nScreenwriter [[Philip Eisner]] acknowledged ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' as a major inspiration for the plot.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=phubar |author-link=Philip Eisner |number=860129292151214082 |date=May 4, 2017 |title=I played the shit out of 40K, so it was definitely an influence, conscious or otherwise.}}</ref> In the fictional setting of ''Warhammer 40,000'', starships travel the galaxy by passing through \"the Warp\", which is a parallel dimension where faster-than-light travel is possible, similar to \"[[hyperspace]]\" in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' setting, but also infested with daemons that are liable to infiltrate the ship and possess the crew. Many fans of ''Warhammer 40,000'' consider ''Event Horizon'' to be an unofficial prequel to the former, when humankind discovers the Warp and learns of its dangers the hard way.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geek.com/tech/is-the-1997-movie-event-horizon-a-secret-warhammer-40k-prequel-1658234/ |title=Is the 1997 movie Event Horizon a secret Warhammer 40k prequel? |author=Ryan Whitwam |date=15 June 2016 |website=Geek.com |access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nAs Anderson explains, directors usually have a standard 10-week editing period to produce the first cut of a film, as guaranteed by the [[Directors Guild of America]]. However, due to the short production schedule of the film, the rapidly approaching release date, and the fact that principal photography had not yet finished, Anderson agreed with the Paramount studio to an editing period of six weeks and promised to deliver the film by August 1997, as Paramount wanted to have a hit film before ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic's]]'' planned September release date. When the main unit wrapped, Anderson was supposed to start editing the film, but he still had to shoot two weeks with the [[second unit]], effectively shortening the time he could spend in post-production to just four weeks. In that short amount of time, only a rough cut of the film could be assembled. Anderson notes that at two hours and 10 minutes, it was overly long, with weak directing and acting that could have used another editing pass, unfinished special effects, and a poor sound mix.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn [[test screening]]s, the cut was poorly received. There were complaints about the extreme amount of gore,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and Anderson and producer [[Jeremy Bolt]] claim members of the test audience fainted during the screening.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> Paramount, which had stopped watching the [[dailies]] before any of the gore was shot and were seeing the completed film for the first time along with the audience, were similarly shocked by how gruesome it was and demanded a shorter runtime with less gore. Anderson believes that while his first cut was justifiably considered too long, Paramount forced him to make a cut that was instead too short, and that the film would benefit by the restoration of around 10 minutes of footage, including some of the deleted gore.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> \n\n===Missing footage===\nAfter the initial [[DVD]] release became a surprise hit, the studio and Anderson became interested in assembling a [[director's cut]], but they quickly discovered that the excised footage had not been carefully stored and much of it had gone missing. The plan to assemble a director's cut was abandoned and instead a special-edition two-DVD set was released, featuring one deleted scene, two extended scenes, and a few shots of deleted material in the included [[making-of]] featurette. The footage is of \"[[Videotape|video]]\" quality.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nKnown deleted scenes include a meeting scene between Weir and people in charge of the mission in which they discuss ''Event Horizon'', some dialogue of which remained present in the theatrical trailer;<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQvTGLuBY8|title=Event Horizon deleted scene|date=8 October 2010|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=TheDronemaster}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pugTKXUUlGk|title=Event Horizon (1997) Trailer|date=13 February 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=HorrorMoviesBlog}}</ref> more backstory for Cooper and Justin, including a stronger explanation for Justin entering the black hole; a deleted backstory of the relationship between Starck and Miller; additional scenes explaining what the gateway to hell/black hole is;<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Anthony C.|last=Ferrante|title=The Cutting Room: Event Horizon|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|issue=170|page=12|accessdate=16 July 2018|url=http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/Cinema/3615/mag/mag3.html |issn=0164-2111}}</ref> Miller finding a tooth floating in ''Event Horizon'';<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> a longer version of the scene in which Peters hallucinates that her son's mangled legs are covered in maggots;<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> a scene in which Weir hallucinates that Justin turns into his wife Claire;<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Z6ln27_cE|title=Behind The Scenes \"Event Horizon\" part 4\\9. \u0417\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e \"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439\" \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c 4\\9|date=13 May 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=Simbacool69}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RzccmgGMcs|title=Behind The Scenes \"Event Horizon\" part 7\\9. \u0417\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e \"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439\" \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c 7\\9|date=13 May 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 July 2018|author=Simbacool69}}</ref> a bloodier version of Weir's wife Claire's suicide; a longer version of the scene where Miller finds D.J.'s dead body with his guts on the table; and a longer version of the \"Visions From Hell\" scene during Miller's final fight with Weir with more shots of ''Event Horizon'' crew being tortured.{{better source|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe \"bloody orgy\" video was also longer.

One did not have a jump scare at the end when the last two survivors are found by another rescue crew and Starck hallucinates that she sees Weir, although there was a similar version of the scene included in this ending where she hears screams of ''Event Horizon'' crew and screams in fear before Cooper wakes her up. This was the original ending of the film included in the shooting script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Event-Horizon.html|title=Event Horizon|work=Internet Movie Script Database|accessdate=16 July 2018|first=Philip|last=Eisner}}</ref> The second ending had Miller fighting with the burned man from his visions at the core instead of with Weir, but this was changed due to the negative test screening.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn an ''Event Horizon'' Q&A in 2011, Anderson was asked when extra footage will be made available. He responded \"never\", explaining that much of it is gone forever.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> However, in a 2012 interview, he announced that producer [[Lloyd Levin]] had found a [[VHS]] tape with his original rough cut. Anderson said that after finishing ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'', he planned to watch it for the first time since assembling the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/paul-w-s-anderson-resident-evil-5-retribution-interview/|title=Paul W.S.

He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1895 to 1897, and the [[List of Governors of New York|32nd Governor of New York]] from 1897 to 1898.\n\n==Early life==\nBlack was born near [[Limington, Maine|Limington, York County, Maine]] on March 8, 1853, one of eleven children born to farmer Jacob Black and Charlotte (Butters) Black. He graduated from [[Lebanon, Maine|Lebanon]] Academy in 1871, and taught school while attending [[Dartmouth College]], from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1875. While in college, Black joined the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity.\n\n==Start of career==\nAfter completing his education, Black moved to [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]] to become editor of the ''Johnstown Journal''. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and ardent follower of [[James G. Blaine]], also from Maine, Black changed the political stance of the paper while the Democratic owner was out of town, but was promptly dismissed upon the latter's return. He then moved to [[Troy, New York]], and worked for the ''Troy Whig'' and the ''Troy Times''. While working as a night reporter, he was a clerk in the Troy post office and [[reading law|studied law]] with the firm of Robertson & Foster. Black attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1879 and began to practice in Troy.\n\nIn 1888, Black campaigned for [[Benjamin Harrison]] for president. In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison's reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President [[Grover Cleveland]]. In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican. Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor. During his House term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims. He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898. A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the [[New York State Capitol]], which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.\n\nLater in his term, state officials were accused of squandering more than a million dollars on a project to expand the [[Erie Canal]], which had come to be regarded as a [[boondoggle]] because of delays and excessive costs. Black's chances for reelection were jeopardized, so Republicans replaced him as their 1898 gubernatorial nominee with [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had recently attained hero status in Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref>Edmond Morris, ''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt '' (1979) p 666</ref> Roosevelt won the November general election by narrowly defeating Democratic nominee [[Augustus Van Wyck]]. In 1899, an investigating commission appointed by Black, in conjunction with two special counsels appointed by Roosevelt, exonerated those involved of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n==Later life==\nAfterwards he resumed his law practice. Among the noteworthy cases in which he was involved, Black took part in the defense of Roland B. Molineaux in the famed ''[[People v. Molineux]]'' case. After Molineaux was convicted of murder, the conviction was overturned and he won an acquittal at retrial. The case was the source of the well-known \"Molineux rule\" which limits the ability of prosecutors to use prior crimes as proof that a defendant committed the crime with which he is charged. Black also took part in the defense of [[Caleb Powers]] for the assassination of Kentucky governor [[William Goebel]].\n\nBlack maintained his interest in politics even after leaving office. In 1904, he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for [[United States Senator]], but lost to incumbent [[Chauncey Depew]], who went on to win reelection. He was a delegate to the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], and nominated President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for election to a full term. In 1908, Black supported William Howard Taft for president.\n\n==Death and burial==\nBlack died from heart disease at his home in Troy on March 22, 1913.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/03/22/100612163.pdf \"Ex-Gov Black Dies at His Troy Home\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' March 22, 1913</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47101597/frank-s-black-dies-of-disease-of-heart/ |title=Frank S.

It appeared during the Ottoman period and was a captaincy of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] in the 19th century. Today, it forms part of northeastern [[Podgorica Municipality]]. In Montenegro, the majority of people who trace their origin in Bratono\u017ei\u0107i identify as Christian Orthodox [[Montenegrins]] and a part identify as Christian Orthodox [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]]. Brotherhoods (''bratstvo'') from the historical tribe that settled in [[Bijelo Polje Municipality|Bijelo Polje]] and became Muslims in the Ottoman period identify as [[Bosniaks]]. In the 18th century, many families from the region settled in western Serbia. In [[Kosovo]], a part of the Serbs of western Kosovo come from Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. The best known descendant of the Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribe is Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I of Serbia]], founder of the [[House of Obrenovi\u0107]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribal region is rugged, hilly area at an altitude which ranges from 400 to 450m. It is situated between the [[Mora\u010da river]], [[Mala Rijeka]] and [[Crna Planina]]; it borders the tribes of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north, [[Rov\u010dani]] to the northwest, [[Ku\u010di]] to the east and south, and [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] to the west. The region ends after Mala Rijeka pours into the Mora\u010da, near the settlement of Mrke, about 13km to the northeast of Podgorica. With the exception of Mrke, most of the other settlements (Klopot, Pelev Brijeg, Duga) of Bratono\u017ei\u0107i are semi-deserted or completely abandoned as their inhabitants moved to Podgorica. As of 2011, Mrke had 207 residents. 118 identify as Montenegrins, 60 as Serbs, 25 chose not to declare any ethnicity.<ref name=\"monstat\">{{cite web |title=Census 2011 data - Montenegro |url=https://www.monstat.org/eng/page.php?id=395&pageid=57|website=Monstat |publisher=Statistical Office of Montenegro |accessdate=15 February 2020 |ref=monstat}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn a Venetian document dating to 1455, ''Banovichi'' is mentioned as one of the villages of Upper Zeta; this may be an early reference to Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. The first direct reference to the settlements that comprise Bratono\u017ei\u0107i today is found in the supplementary defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] in 1497. They hadn't formed as a single community at that time.{{sfn|Strugar|1987|p=135}}\n\nBratono\u017ei\u0107i is a tribe (''pleme'') of several patrilineal ancestries which formed it over time since the later 15th century.  The name of the tribe comes from a ''Brato'', father of ''Nika'' and ancestor of many of the brotherhoods of Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. He lived 14 generations before the time of the recording of the story around 1900. A ''Brato, son of Nika'' who lived with his brother ''Pali'' in the small hamlet of Moraci\u0107a in 1497 may be a reference to this figure. The defter mentions that previously they lived in Hrasni\u0107a near [[Podgorica]].{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=422}} \n\nTwo other communities that lived in the same area were the Albanian Catholic [[Bukumiri]]{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=427}} and the Lutovci, who may have come from the [[Pirot District|Pirot]] region in the eastern Balkans or from [[Pult|Pilot]] in northern Albania. Their origin is debated because no collective memory of their history has been retained except for a toponym which may be interpreted to refer to ''Pirot'' in eastern Serbia or ''Pilot'' in northern Albania. Their first historical ancestor in Bratono\u017ei\u0107i is a ''captain Gojko''. Archival records show that the Lutovci lived in 27 households of Luskozupa in 1497 in the [[nahiye]] of Piperi, which included Bratono\u017ei\u0107i and the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribe.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=418}} Over the years, a few families from neighbouring tribes like Ku\u010di, Bjelopavli\u0107i and Piperi also settled Bratono\u017ei\u0107i and became part of the community. Bratono\u017ei\u0107i was an area of language contact between Slavic and Albanian as well as religious contact between Slavic Orthodoxy and Catholicism. [[Rufim Njegu\u0161]] in the first half of the 17th century is credited with converting the Bratono\u017ei\u0107i back to Orthodoxy from Catholicsm as well as making them take an oath that intermarriage with Catholic Albanians would take place only with women.<ref name=\"Pavlo25\">{{harvnb|Pavlovi\u0107|2019|p=25}}</ref> This measure would prevent any further reconversions to Catholicism.

It appeared during the Ottoman period and was a captaincy of the [[Principality of Montenegro]] in the 19th century. Today, it forms part of northeastern [[Podgorica Municipality]]. In Montenegro, the majority of people who trace their origin in Bratono\u017ei\u0107i identify as Christian Orthodox [[Montenegrins]] and a part identify as Christian Orthodox [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]]. Brotherhoods (''bratstvo'') from the historical tribe that settled in [[Bijelo Polje Municipality|Bijelo Polje]] and became Muslims in the Ottoman period identify as [[Bosniaks]]. In the 18th century, many families from the region settled in western Serbia. In [[Kosovo]], a part of the Serbs of western Kosovo come from Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. The best known descendant of the Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribe is Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I of Serbia]], founder of the [[House of Obrenovi\u0107]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribal region is rugged, hilly area at an altitude which ranges from 400 to 450m. It is situated between the [[Mora\u010da river]], [[Mala Rijeka]] and [[Crna Planina]]; it borders the tribes of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north, [[Rov\u010dani]] to the northwest, [[Ku\u010di]] to the east and south, and [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] to the west. The region ends after Mala Rijeka pours into the Mora\u010da, near the settlement of Mrke, about 13km to the northeast of Podgorica. With the exception of Mrke, most of the other settlements (Klopot, Pelev Brijeg, Duga) of Bratono\u017ei\u0107i are semi-deserted or completely abandoned as their inhabitants moved to Podgorica. As of 2011, Mrke had 207 residents. 118 identify as Montenegrins, 60 as Serbs, 25 chose not to declare any ethnicity.<ref name=\"monstat\">{{cite web |title=Census 2011 data - Montenegro |url=https://www.monstat.org/eng/page.php?id=395&pageid=57|website=Monstat |publisher=Statistical Office of Montenegro |accessdate=15 February 2020 |ref=monstat}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn a Venetian document dating to 1455, ''Banovichi'' is mentioned as one of the villages of Upper Zeta; this may be an early reference to Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. The first direct reference to the settlements that comprise Bratono\u017ei\u0107i today is found in the supplementary defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] in 1497. They hadn't formed as a single community at that time.{{sfn|Strugar|1987|p=135}}\n\nBratono\u017ei\u0107i is a tribe (''pleme'') of several patrilineal ancestries which formed it over time since the later 15th century.  The name of the tribe comes from a ''Brato'', father of ''Nika'' and ancestor of many of the brotherhoods of Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. He lived 14 generations before the time of the recording of the story around 1900. A ''Brato, son of Nika'' who lived with his brother ''Pali'' in the small hamlet of Moraci\u0107a in 1497 may be a reference to this figure. The defter mentions that previously they lived in Hrasni\u0107a near [[Podgorica]].{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=422}} \n\nTwo other communities that lived in the same area were the Albanian Catholic [[Bukumiri]]{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=427}} and the Lutovci, who may have come from the [[Pirot District|Pirot]] region in the eastern Balkans or from [[Pult|Pilot]] in northern Albania. Their origin is debated because no collective memory of their history has been retained except for a toponym which may be interpreted to refer to ''Pirot'' in eastern Serbia or ''Pilot'' in northern Albania. Their first historical ancestor in Bratono\u017ei\u0107i is a ''captain Gojko''. Archival records show that the Lutovci lived in 27 households of Luskozupa in 1497 in the [[nahiye]] of Piperi, which included Bratono\u017ei\u0107i and the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] tribe.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=418}} Over the years, a few families from neighbouring tribes like Ku\u010di, Bjelopavli\u0107i and Piperi also settled Bratono\u017ei\u0107i and became part of the community. Bratono\u017ei\u0107i was an area of language contact between Slavic and Albanian as well as religious contact between Slavic Orthodoxy and Catholicism. [[Rufim Njegu\u0161]] in the first half of the 17th century is credited with converting the Bratono\u017ei\u0107i back to Orthodoxy from Catholicsm as well as making them take an oath that intermarriage with Catholic Albanians would take place only with women.<ref name=\"Pavlo25\">{{harvnb|Pavlovi\u0107|2019|p=25}}</ref> This measure would prevent any further reconversions to Catholicism.

The character guest starred in two episodes of [[Parks and Recreation (season 2)|season two]] and was upgraded to a series regular in [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|season three]]. Ben is a [[state auditor]] who comes into [[Pawnee (Parks and Recreation)|Pawnee]] with [[Chris Traeger]] to evaluate the town's funds at the end of the second season. Ben began dating [[Leslie Knope]] in the [[Parks and Recreation (season 3)|season three]] episode \"[[Road Trip (Parks and Recreation)|Road Trip]]\" and married her in the [[Parks and Recreation (season 5)|season five]] episode \"Leslie and Ben.\" In the [[Parks and Recreation (season 7)|season seven]] episode \"2017\" Ben was named Pawnee's Woman of the Year for 2017. It is implied that Leslie later became the [[President of the United States]] making him the First Gentleman.\nBen Wyatt is a lover of all things [[calzones]], [[sci-fi]], and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.\n\n==Character biography==\nBen is from [[Partridge Township, Pine County, Minnesota|Partridge, Minnesota]]. When he was 18, he ran for [[mayor]] and won on the strength of, in his words, \"anti-establishment voter rebellion.\" However, being so inexperienced, he quickly ran the town's finances into the ground mainly due to the construction of a winter sports complex called \"Ice Town\".

Ben is often teased by Tom (and, early on, Leslie as well) for his affinity for, references to and vast knowledge in ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and other things considered to be \"nerdy\". His love for calzones is also a recurring joke in the series.  Ben is shown to have a hard time socializing, and connecting with people by having work as his main focus. During season six when he was jobless for a week, he created a game called ''The Cones of Dunshire''. The game became very popular, which he realized while visiting San Francisco. He was angry that he did not copyright it, but later in the show, one of his former coworkers surprises him with the copyright papers.\n\n===Season Two===\nWhen Ben comes to Pawnee, he immediately clashes with Leslie, as she yells at him three consecutive times for his seemingly callous attitude towards firing people and slashing her department's budget. However, when he asks her out for a beer, they begin to show respect for one another.

While at a gay club, Ben mentions the failure of the Ice Town project, showing that he used to be just as ambitious as Leslie, but Leslie gives him credit for trying. Ben listens to Leslie's presentation regarding the Pawnee Harvest Festival idea that will allow them to do their jobs properly and bring funds into the department.

Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults.<ref>[[Jerry's Painting]]</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Road Trip (Parks and Recreation)|Road Trip]]\" Ben and Leslie are sent on a Road Trip to Indianapolis to state their case to host the State Little League Championship in Pawnee. With Leslie gone from work, Tom is hosting a game show called Know Ya Boo where he asks couples scandalous questions, and they have to guess what the other person said. He brings Jerry and Donna, and April and Andy, to practice, leaving Ron alone. A 3rd grade class is visiting City Hall on a field trip, and Ron is left to talk to one of them. He tells a girl, Lauren, about his views as a Libertarian. During Know Ya Boo, April and Andy get in a big fight because April's answer to her favorite band was not Andy's band. Andy gets upset and sells his guitar and essentially quits music. April then goes to Ann for relationship help to end her conflict with Andy. Leslie and Ben win and get to host the State Little League Championship in Pawnee, and they go out for a celebratory dinner. There, Ben tells Leslie he likes her, and Leslie confirms she likes him too, but Chris decides to crash their dinner, therefore interrupting their conversation. In the end of the episode, Ben ends up kissing Leslie and their secret relationship commences.\n\nIn \"[[The Bubble (Parks and Recreation)|The Bubble]]\", Leslie and Ben are officially dating, but they are keeping their relationship a secret due to a no-dating policy at work. They are enjoying what Leslie calls \"the bubble\", or the beginning of a relationship when everything is simple and fun. It is suddenly threatened, however, when Ben has a meeting with Leslie's mother Marlene, who wants Ben to approve the purchase of four new school buses despite a difficult budget season. Afraid of ruining the bubble, Leslie initially tells Ben she is not related to Marlene. Right before Ben's meeting, however, Leslie admits Marlene is her mother, making him nervous and causing him to capitulate to all of her demands during the meeting, which makes Marlene consider Ben weak. Leslie trains Ben for his next meeting with her mother. He impresses Marlene so much with his tough negotiation skills that she becomes flirtatious with him. An uncomfortable Ben tells Leslie they should tell her about their relationship, but Leslie does not want to lose the bubble. Fed up, Ben storms into Marlene's office and tells her that he is dating her daughter and asks her to keep it secret. Marlene laughs off the situation and tells Leslie that she approves of Ben.\n\nIn the season finale \"[[Li'l Sebastian]]\", Leslie and Ben continue their romance, but they have difficulty keeping it a secret. Ron finds out and warns them that Chris will fire them if he learns about it. As the city prepares for the memorial service for Li'l Sebastian, Pawnee's beloved celebrity miniature horse, Leslie and Ben are caught making out by a maintenance worker, so they send him home in exchange for his silence. Unfortunately, the worker had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's memorial flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Later, although the memorial turned out to be a success, things get even more complicated when Leslie is approached by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office. They believe she would be a good candidate for upcoming city council seats, or possibly the mayoral position. With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, the scouts ask whether Leslie has any secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and the scouts promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.<ref>[[Li'l Sebastian]]</ref>\n\n===Season Four===\nThough their relationship had become rather serious, Ben and Leslie are forced to break up to avoid a scandal which could derail Leslie's city council candidacy. Ben understands, giving Leslie a \"Knope 2012\" button he had made. He then starts helping Tom run his business Entertainment 720, where he is shocked at how much money Tom spends without getting any revenue. He also helps Tom charm Joan Callamezzo to try to get her book club to include Leslie's new book, but Joan gets drunk and hits on them. He and Leslie end up sharing lovelorn looks with each other.  Ben is dragged along to Tom and Donna's \"Treat Yo Self\", where he treats himself to a [[Batman]] costume and a good cry over his breakup with Leslie.\n\nWhile Leslie attempts to keep him in her life, Ben insists that he needs distance from her since being around Leslie is too difficult for him.  Leslie continually tries to spend time with Ben until, through the help of Ben and Ann, she sees that she has been ignoring what Ben wants and doing only what she wants.  Ben and Leslie meet at the [[Smallest Park (Parks and Recreation)|Smallest Park]], which is supposed to be their last project together.  Leslie apologizes and tells Ben that she will leave him alone if that is what he wants.  Ben responds that he does not want that but he thinks that it is for the best.  As Ben starts to leave, Leslie declares that she misses him like crazy and wants to be with him.  After she asks how he feels, Ben kisses Leslie and the relationship is reinstated.\n\nLater, they confess to Chris about their relationship, and he launches an investigation to check for any possible acts of corruption, as Ben is Leslie's superior. It turns out that in the season three finale, Ben and Leslie had bribed a maintenance worker to keep quiet about them after the worker witnessed them kissing. As that was a possible reason for termination, Leslie was ready to take full responsibility only to find that Ben resigned from his job in order to save hers.\n\nFollowing his termination, Ben takes some time to \"explore his interests\" which consists of him remaining in his house and attempting various hobbies like making [[calzone]]s and stop motion films. His appearance becomes unkempt and after a visit from Chris, he realizes that, despite convincing himself otherwise, he is unhappy without some sort of direction in his life. After Leslie's campaign flops at the ice rink, Ann resigns (eagerly) from being Leslie's campaign manager and Leslie asks Ben to run her campaign given his experience with local politics. Ben takes over the duties of running Leslie's campaign for city council and helps turn the campaign around, making it competitive with Bobby Newport's bid for city office.  Ben manages to secure the endorsement of Pawnee's retiring police chief and improve Leslie's likability at a bowling event (despite the spectacle of having punched a man who called Leslie 'a bitch').  In \"[[Dave Returns]]\", it is revealed that not only is Ben socially awkward around police officers, but he is afraid of them, saying \"I am not afraid of cops.  I have no reason to be.  I never break any laws ever because I'm deathly afraid of cops.\"\n\nTowards the end of the campaign, Ben is offered a job working for a congressional campaign in [[Washington, D.C.]].  Initially conflicted, as it would mean several months away from Pawnee, Ben is ultimately convinced by Leslie to take the job.\n\n===Season Five===\n[[Jonathan Banks]] and [[Glenne Headly]] guest starred as Ben's parents in the fifth season. He successfully runs a congressional campaign during the first five episodes of the season. When Ben returns to Pawnee, he proposes to Leslie, and they move into a house together. Later, Ben turns down multiple job offers in Pawnee to join Tom Haverford's company, Rent-a-Swag; concurrently, he ends up working for Sweetums, at a division dedicated to improving their public image by funding charities. He also takes on Andy as an assistant. Ben and Leslie throw a large event designed to help with fundraising for the Pawnee Commons instead of creating a wedding registry. During the event, Leslie tells Ben how much she hates the feeling of not being married to him.  Ben responds by saying that they should just get married that night. After two hours of frantically finishing last minute details, a ceremony ruined by a drunk Councilman Jamm, and bailing Ron out of jail, they hold the wedding in the Parks Department. In the episode titled \"Partridge\" Ben is invited to return to Partridge, his hometown where he was elected and failed as mayor at the age of 18, for a ceremony to give him the [[Freedom of the City|key to the city]]. Ben falls ill with [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]], and when Leslie goes to receive the key in his name, it is revealed to be one big joke to mock Ben for his failure as a mayor.\n\n===Season Six===\nAfter Leslie attacks Sweetums in a press statement, Ben is fired from his job with the company. He then takes on the accountant job he has accepted and declined three times prior. Shortly later though Chris offers him the Job of City Manager of Pawnee because Chris is leaving town and Ben accepts it, becoming the new City Manager of Pawnee and Leslie's boss as she returns to her job in the Parks and Recreation Department. At the end of the episode entitled \"Flu Season 2\" Ben has a fight with his father who sold their family lake house where Ben had many wonderful childhood memories. He realizes he wants to start a family with Leslie, when he returns home to tell Leslie, he discovers that she is pregnant with their first child. When visiting Dr. Saperstein, they realize she is having triplets.\n\n===Season Seven===\nBen remains city manager, and is planning the Pawnee Bicentennial. This, along with greatly improving the economy of Pawnee, gets him the award for Man of the Year. He and Leslie have triplets, two boys and one girl, whom they have named Stephen, Wesley, and Sonia. In ''The Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show'', Ben was made a Knight of the [[Order of the British Empire]] by His Royal Excellence Lord Edgar Darby Covington, 14th Earl of Cornwall-Upon-Thames and 29th Baron of Hertfordshire. After being contacted by Jennifer Barkley, and with Leslie's full support, he decides to run for Congress in 2018. While campaigning, he earns IOW's Woman of the Year award for giving Leslie room to speak her mind instead of reading scripted speeches. Through a series of flash-forwards in the final episode, it is revealed that Ben's congressional campaign was successful and is now a representative from Indiana for the House of Representatives. In 2025, he and Leslie are both given the opportunity to run as Governor of Indiana, Ben ultimately decides to let Leslie run (which she wins). By 2048, it is implied that at least one of them has been elected President of the United States, with Ben wearing a flag lapel pin and being acknowledged first by someone who appeared to be a member of the Secret Service.\n\n==Development==\n[[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] departed from his leading role on the [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] comedy television series ''[[Party Down]]'' to accept the role of Ben Wyatt on ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''.<ref name=\"Martin0304\">{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Denise |title='Party Down' star Adam Scott joins the cast of NBC's 'Parks and Recreation'; plus, more details on Rob Lowe |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 4, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/03/party-down-star-adam-scott-joins-the-cast-of-nbcs-parks-and-recreation.html |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vTcUqY0B?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/03/party-down-star-adam-scott-joins-the-cast-of-nbcs-parks-and-recreation.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Sepinwall0305\">{{cite news|last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title='Parks and Recreation' lands 'Party Down' star Adam Scott |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/03/parks_and_recreation_lands_par.html |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vTcXRMXB?url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/03/parks_and_recreation_lands_par.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Parks and Recreation'' was one of Scott's favorite shows even before he took the role.<ref name=\"Sepinwall0624\">{{cite news|last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |title=Interview: Adam Scott on leaving 'Party Down' and going to 'Parks and Recreation' |publisher=[[HitFix]] |date=June 24, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-adam-scott-on-leaving-party-down-and-going-to-parks-and-recreation |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vv3f68Fu?url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-adam-scott-on-leaving-party-down-and-going-to-parks-and-recreation |archivedate=January 22, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When he accepted a role on ''Parks and Recreation'', it was unclear whether ''Party Down'' would be renewed for a third season, and Scott said, \"I couldn't pass up the opportunity on ''Parks and Rec'' for a show that could possibly not exist anymore.\"<ref name=\"Sepinwall0624\" /> Although ''Party Down'' co-creator [[Rob Thomas (writer)|Rob Thomas]] said he believed the show could continue without Scott, and that the actor would continue to make guest appearances on the show,<ref name=\"Sepinwall0305\" /> ''Party Down'' was cancelled just three months after Scott departed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ausiello |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Ausiello |title=Breaking: Starz cancels 'Party Down' and 'Gravity' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 30, 2010 |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/06/30/breaking-starz-cancels-party-down-gravity/ |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60SFp186p?url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/06/30/breaking-starz-cancels-party-down-gravity/ |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Series co-creator [[Michael Schur]] said when the Ben Wyatt character was conceived, Scott was considered the \"dream scenario\" casting choice.<ref name=\"Stanhope0304\">{{Cite news |last=Stanhope |first=Kate |title=Party Down's Adam Scott Joins Parks and Recreation Cast |date=March 4, 2010 |work=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> As part of Scott's contract with the series, he also signed a [[first-look deal]] to develop television projects for NBC.<ref name=\"Martin0304\" />\n\nScott first appeared in ''Parks and Recreation'' starting in the penultimate second-season episode, \"[[The Master Plan (Parks and Recreation)|The Master Plan]]\", the same episode Rob Lowe joined the regular cast as Chris Traeger.<ref name=\"Martin0304\" /><ref name=\"Stanhope0304\" /> The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the protagonist of ''Parks and Recreation''.

His love for calzones is also a recurring joke in the series.  Ben is shown to have a hard time socializing, and connecting with people by having work as his main focus. During season six when he was jobless for a week, he created a game called ''The Cones of Dunshire''. The game became very popular, which he realized while visiting San Francisco.

When Ron accidentally reveals that Leslie was trying to set up an annual children's concert that was supposed to be canceled on Lot 48 behind Ann's house, Ben tries to shut it down.

Andy and April offer him a spare room in their house, since their previous roommate moved out and left the house to them. Although the two have been living by themselves for only a week, the house is a complete mess with no everyday items like plates or utensils available. Ben decides to teach a reluctant Andy and April how to properly live like adults.<ref>[[Jerry's Painting]]</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Road Trip (Parks and Recreation)|Road Trip]]\" Ben and Leslie are sent on a Road Trip to Indianapolis to state their case to host the State Little League Championship in Pawnee. With Leslie gone from work, Tom is hosting a game show called Know Ya Boo where he asks couples scandalous questions, and they have to guess what the other person said. He brings Jerry and Donna, and April and Andy, to practice, leaving Ron alone. A 3rd grade class is visiting City Hall on a field trip, and Ron is left to talk to one of them. He tells a girl, Lauren, about his views as a Libertarian. During Know Ya Boo, April and Andy get in a big fight because April's answer to her favorite band was not Andy's band. Andy gets upset and sells his guitar and essentially quits music. April then goes to Ann for relationship help to end her conflict with Andy. Leslie and Ben win and get to host the State Little League Championship in Pawnee, and they go out for a celebratory dinner. There, Ben tells Leslie he likes her, and Leslie confirms she likes him too, but Chris decides to crash their dinner, therefore interrupting their conversation. In the end of the episode, Ben ends up kissing Leslie and their secret relationship commences.\n\nIn \"[[The Bubble (Parks and Recreation)|The Bubble]]\", Leslie and Ben are officially dating, but they are keeping their relationship a secret due to a no-dating policy at work. They are enjoying what Leslie calls \"the bubble\", or the beginning of a relationship when everything is simple and fun. It is suddenly threatened, however, when Ben has a meeting with Leslie's mother Marlene, who wants Ben to approve the purchase of four new school buses despite a difficult budget season. Afraid of ruining the bubble, Leslie initially tells Ben she is not related to Marlene. Right before Ben's meeting, however, Leslie admits Marlene is her mother, making him nervous and causing him to capitulate to all of her demands during the meeting, which makes Marlene consider Ben weak. Leslie trains Ben for his next meeting with her mother. He impresses Marlene so much with his tough negotiation skills that she becomes flirtatious with him. An uncomfortable Ben tells Leslie they should tell her about their relationship, but Leslie does not want to lose the bubble. Fed up, Ben storms into Marlene's office and tells her that he is dating her daughter and asks her to keep it secret. Marlene laughs off the situation and tells Leslie that she approves of Ben.\n\nIn the season finale \"[[Li'l Sebastian]]\", Leslie and Ben continue their romance, but they have difficulty keeping it a secret. Ron finds out and warns them that Chris will fire them if he learns about it. As the city prepares for the memorial service for Li'l Sebastian, Pawnee's beloved celebrity miniature horse, Leslie and Ben are caught making out by a maintenance worker, so they send him home in exchange for his silence. Unfortunately, the worker had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's memorial flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Later, although the memorial turned out to be a success, things get even more complicated when Leslie is approached by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office. They believe she would be a good candidate for upcoming city council seats, or possibly the mayoral position. With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, the scouts ask whether Leslie has any secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and the scouts promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.<ref>[[Li'l Sebastian]]</ref>\n\n===Season Four===\nThough their relationship had become rather serious, Ben and Leslie are forced to break up to avoid a scandal which could derail Leslie's city council candidacy. Ben understands, giving Leslie a \"Knope 2012\" button he had made. He then starts helping Tom run his business Entertainment 720, where he is shocked at how much money Tom spends without getting any revenue. He also helps Tom charm Joan Callamezzo to try to get her book club to include Leslie's new book, but Joan gets drunk and hits on them. He and Leslie end up sharing lovelorn looks with each other.  Ben is dragged along to Tom and Donna's \"Treat Yo Self\", where he treats himself to a [[Batman]] costume and a good cry over his breakup with Leslie.\n\nWhile Leslie attempts to keep him in her life, Ben insists that he needs distance from her since being around Leslie is too difficult for him.  Leslie continually tries to spend time with Ben until, through the help of Ben and Ann, she sees that she has been ignoring what Ben wants and doing only what she wants.  Ben and Leslie meet at the [[Smallest Park (Parks and Recreation)|Smallest Park]], which is supposed to be their last project together.  Leslie apologizes and tells Ben that she will leave him alone if that is what he wants.  Ben responds that he does not want that but he thinks that it is for the best.  As Ben starts to leave, Leslie declares that she misses him like crazy and wants to be with him.  After she asks how he feels, Ben kisses Leslie and the relationship is reinstated.\n\nLater, they confess to Chris about their relationship, and he launches an investigation to check for any possible acts of corruption, as Ben is Leslie's superior. It turns out that in the season three finale, Ben and Leslie had bribed a maintenance worker to keep quiet about them after the worker witnessed them kissing. As that was a possible reason for termination, Leslie was ready to take full responsibility only to find that Ben resigned from his job in order to save hers.\n\nFollowing his termination, Ben takes some time to \"explore his interests\" which consists of him remaining in his house and attempting various hobbies like making [[calzone]]s and stop motion films. His appearance becomes unkempt and after a visit from Chris, he realizes that, despite convincing himself otherwise, he is unhappy without some sort of direction in his life. After Leslie's campaign flops at the ice rink, Ann resigns (eagerly) from being Leslie's campaign manager and Leslie asks Ben to run her campaign given his experience with local politics. Ben takes over the duties of running Leslie's campaign for city council and helps turn the campaign around, making it competitive with Bobby Newport's bid for city office.  Ben manages to secure the endorsement of Pawnee's retiring police chief and improve Leslie's likability at a bowling event (despite the spectacle of having punched a man who called Leslie 'a bitch').  In \"[[Dave Returns]]\", it is revealed that not only is Ben socially awkward around police officers, but he is afraid of them, saying \"I am not afraid of cops.  I have no reason to be.  I never break any laws ever because I'm deathly afraid of cops.\"\n\nTowards the end of the campaign, Ben is offered a job working for a congressional campaign in [[Washington, D.C.]].  Initially conflicted, as it would mean several months away from Pawnee, Ben is ultimately convinced by Leslie to take the job.\n\n===Season Five===\n[[Jonathan Banks]] and [[Glenne Headly]] guest starred as Ben's parents in the fifth season. He successfully runs a congressional campaign during the first five episodes of the season. When Ben returns to Pawnee, he proposes to Leslie, and they move into a house together. Later, Ben turns down multiple job offers in Pawnee to join Tom Haverford's company, Rent-a-Swag; concurrently, he ends up working for Sweetums, at a division dedicated to improving their public image by funding charities. He also takes on Andy as an assistant. Ben and Leslie throw a large event designed to help with fundraising for the Pawnee Commons instead of creating a wedding registry. During the event, Leslie tells Ben how much she hates the feeling of not being married to him.  Ben responds by saying that they should just get married that night. After two hours of frantically finishing last minute details, a ceremony ruined by a drunk Councilman Jamm, and bailing Ron out of jail, they hold the wedding in the Parks Department. In the episode titled \"Partridge\" Ben is invited to return to Partridge, his hometown where he was elected and failed as mayor at the age of 18, for a ceremony to give him the [[Freedom of the City|key to the city]]. Ben falls ill with [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]], and when Leslie goes to receive the key in his name, it is revealed to be one big joke to mock Ben for his failure as a mayor.\n\n===Season Six===\nAfter Leslie attacks Sweetums in a press statement, Ben is fired from his job with the company. He then takes on the accountant job he has accepted and declined three times prior. Shortly later though Chris offers him the Job of City Manager of Pawnee because Chris is leaving town and Ben accepts it, becoming the new City Manager of Pawnee and Leslie's boss as she returns to her job in the Parks and Recreation Department. At the end of the episode entitled \"Flu Season 2\" Ben has a fight with his father who sold their family lake house where Ben had many wonderful childhood memories. He realizes he wants to start a family with Leslie, when he returns home to tell Leslie, he discovers that she is pregnant with their first child. When visiting Dr. Saperstein, they realize she is having triplets.\n\n===Season Seven===\nBen remains city manager, and is planning the Pawnee Bicentennial. This, along with greatly improving the economy of Pawnee, gets him the award for Man of the Year. He and Leslie have triplets, two boys and one girl, whom they have named Stephen, Wesley, and Sonia. In ''The Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show'', Ben was made a Knight of the [[Order of the British Empire]] by His Royal Excellence Lord Edgar Darby Covington, 14th Earl of Cornwall-Upon-Thames and 29th Baron of Hertfordshire. After being contacted by Jennifer Barkley, and with Leslie's full support, he decides to run for Congress in 2018. While campaigning, he earns IOW's Woman of the Year award for giving Leslie room to speak her mind instead of reading scripted speeches. Through a series of flash-forwards in the final episode, it is revealed that Ben's congressional campaign was successful and is now a representative from Indiana for the House of Representatives. In 2025, he and Leslie are both given the opportunity to run as Governor of Indiana, Ben ultimately decides to let Leslie run (which she wins). By 2048, it is implied that at least one of them has been elected President of the United States, with Ben wearing a flag lapel pin and being acknowledged first by someone who appeared to be a member of the Secret Service.\n\n==Development==\n[[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] departed from his leading role on the [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] comedy television series ''[[Party Down]]'' to accept the role of Ben Wyatt on ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''.<ref name=\"Martin0304\">{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Denise |title='Party Down' star Adam Scott joins the cast of NBC's 'Parks and Recreation'; plus, more details on Rob Lowe |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 4, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/03/party-down-star-adam-scott-joins-the-cast-of-nbcs-parks-and-recreation.html |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vTcUqY0B?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/03/party-down-star-adam-scott-joins-the-cast-of-nbcs-parks-and-recreation.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Sepinwall0305\">{{cite news|last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title='Parks and Recreation' lands 'Party Down' star Adam Scott |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/03/parks_and_recreation_lands_par.html |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vTcXRMXB?url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/03/parks_and_recreation_lands_par.html |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Parks and Recreation'' was one of Scott's favorite shows even before he took the role.<ref name=\"Sepinwall0624\">{{cite news|last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Sepinwall |title=Interview: Adam Scott on leaving 'Party Down' and going to 'Parks and Recreation' |publisher=[[HitFix]] |date=June 24, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-adam-scott-on-leaving-party-down-and-going-to-parks-and-recreation |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vv3f68Fu?url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-adam-scott-on-leaving-party-down-and-going-to-parks-and-recreation |archivedate=January 22, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When he accepted a role on ''Parks and Recreation'', it was unclear whether ''Party Down'' would be renewed for a third season, and Scott said, \"I couldn't pass up the opportunity on ''Parks and Rec'' for a show that could possibly not exist anymore.\"<ref name=\"Sepinwall0624\" /> Although ''Party Down'' co-creator [[Rob Thomas (writer)|Rob Thomas]] said he believed the show could continue without Scott, and that the actor would continue to make guest appearances on the show,<ref name=\"Sepinwall0305\" /> ''Party Down'' was cancelled just three months after Scott departed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ausiello |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Ausiello |title=Breaking: Starz cancels 'Party Down' and 'Gravity' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 30, 2010 |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/06/30/breaking-starz-cancels-party-down-gravity/ |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60SFp186p?url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/06/30/breaking-starz-cancels-party-down-gravity/ |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Series co-creator [[Michael Schur]] said when the Ben Wyatt character was conceived, Scott was considered the \"dream scenario\" casting choice.<ref name=\"Stanhope0304\">{{Cite news |last=Stanhope |first=Kate |title=Party Down's Adam Scott Joins Parks and Recreation Cast |date=March 4, 2010 |work=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> As part of Scott's contract with the series, he also signed a [[first-look deal]] to develop television projects for NBC.<ref name=\"Martin0304\" />\n\nScott first appeared in ''Parks and Recreation'' starting in the penultimate second-season episode, \"[[The Master Plan (Parks and Recreation)|The Master Plan]]\", the same episode Rob Lowe joined the regular cast as Chris Traeger.<ref name=\"Martin0304\" /><ref name=\"Stanhope0304\" /> The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the protagonist of ''Parks and Recreation''.
