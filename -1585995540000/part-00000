In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks. Faced with such a spectacle one thinks of the temptation of Christ.

Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet.

The roar of the waters, the thousands of passenger fish leaping at the falls with all their might, the fishermen coming out in boats, and taking post on all the rocks with rod and hook, hippopotami and crocodiles lying sleepily on the water, the ferry at work above the falls, and cattle driven down to drink at the margin of the lake, made in all, with the pretty nature of the country\u2014small grassy-topped hills, with trees in the intervening valleys and on the lower slopes\u2014as interesting a picture as one could wish to see.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Great African Travellers, From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley, The Project Gutenberg EBook of Great African Travellers | accessdate=23 February 2015 | date=2007 | first=W.

May also designed the urban planning scheme for Kampala, creating what he called \"neighborhood units.\" Estates were built for the ruling elite in many parts outside the center city. This led to the area's '[[slum clearance]]' which displaced more than 1,000 residents in the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Byerley|first=Andrew|date=2013-10-01|title=Displacements in the name of (re)development: the contested rise and contested demise of colonial 'African' housing estates in Kampala and Jinja|journal=Planning Perspectives|volume=28|issue=4|pages=547\u2013570|doi=10.1080/02665433.2013.774537|issn=0266-5433}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the construction of the [[Owen Falls Dam]] submerged the [[Ripon Falls]]. Most of the \"Flat Rocks\" that gave the area its name disappeared under water as well. A description of what the area looked like can be found in the notes of [[John Hanning Speke]], the first European to lay eyes on the [[source of the Nile]]:\n\n<blockquote>Though beautiful, the scene was not exactly what I expected, for the broad surface of the lake was shut out from view by a spur of hill, and the falls, about twelve feet deep and four to five hundred feet broad, were broken by rocks; still it was a sight that attracted one to it for hours. The roar of the waters, the thousands of passenger fish leaping at the falls with all their might, the fishermen coming out in boats, and taking post on all the rocks with rod and hook, hippopotami and crocodiles lying sleepily on the water, the ferry at work above the falls, and cattle driven down to drink at the margin of the lake, made in all, with the pretty nature of the country\u2014small grassy-topped hills, with trees in the intervening valleys and on the lower slopes\u2014as interesting a picture as one could wish to see.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Great African Travellers, From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley, The Project Gutenberg EBook of Great African Travellers | accessdate=23 February 2015 | date=2007 | first=W.
