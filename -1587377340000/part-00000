The game was initially released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 16, 2011, and has since been released for other PC, consoles, handhelds, and [[Google_Play#Games|mobile platform]]. ''Terraria'' features exploration, crafting, building, and combat with a variety of creatures in a [[procedurally generated]] [[Two-dimensional space|2D]] world. ''Terraria'' received generally positive critical reception upon release and praise given to its sandbox elements. By April 2020, the game had sold over 30 million copies.\n''Terraria''{{'s}} final update is scheduled for May 16, 2020, the ninth anniversary of the initial release of the game. This update is known as \"Journey's End\" or version 1.4.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Terraria screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|An in-game screenshot of ''Terraria'', circa 2011]]\n''Terraria'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Open world|sandbox]] game with gameplay that revolves around exploration, building, crafting, combat, and mining, playable in both [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] modes.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /><ref name=\"Kotaku2011\" /> The game has a 3D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] tile-based graphical style reminiscent of the 16-bit sprites found on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].<ref name=\"Kotaku2011\" /> The game is noted for its classic exploration-adventure style of gameplay, similar to games such as the ''[[Metroid]]'' series and ''[[Minecraft]]''.<ref name=\"Kotaku2011\" /><ref name=\"destructoid1\" /><ref name=\"wired1\" />\n\nThe awesome game starts in a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] world. The player starts out with three copper tools: a pickaxe for digging, a sword for combat, and an axe for woodcutting.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> Many resources, notably ores, can be found while exploring caves. The player begins with 100 [[Health (gaming)|health]] and 20 [[Mana (gaming)|mana points]], which can both be increased by finding certain [[Item (gaming)|items]].<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> Some resources, and most items, may only be found in certain areas of the map, stored in common and rare containers, or dropped by certain enemies.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> The player uses resources to craft new items and equipment at an appropriate crafting station for that recipe. For example, tables or other items can be crafted at a work bench, bars can be smelted from ore at a furnace, and armor can be crafted at an anvil. Several advanced items in ''Terraria'' require multiple crafting operations where the product of one recipe is used as an ingredient for another.\n\nThe player can encounter many different enemies in ''Terraria'', such as simple slime blobs, zombies, skeletons, demon eyes, and various [[biome]]-specific enemies. The occurrence of certain enemies depends on several factors including time, location, random events, and player interactions.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> The player can fight against enemies with swords, bows, guns, magic spells, and summoned attackers. The player may also battle [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] with a number of different combat mechanics that can drop rare items and large amounts of in-game currency. All bosses can be summoned by using certain items or randomly when certain criteria are met. Some of the bosses can spawn naturally in certain places and times. The defeat of these bosses is directly tied to in-game progression.\n\nBy completing specific goals, such as defeating a boss or obtaining a certain item, players can attract [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) to occupy structures or rooms they have built, such as a merchant, nurse, or wizard.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> Some NPCs can be acquired by finding them throughout the world and will then reside in the player's house like the wizard or the mechanic. Players may then buy or sell items and certain services from NPCs with coins found in the world. These coins include copper, silver, gold, and platinum. The game includes a currency system in the form of coins that can be primarily used to complete transactions with NPCs.\n\nThe game recognizes many different biomes and areas, defined by the blocks that exist in the vicinity, each home to a unique set of enemies. Some biomes, such as the Corruption or Crimson biomes, will naturally expand by slowly overtaking and converting blocks in adjacent biomes. If the player journeys to the Underworld biome and summons and defeats a boss called the Wall of Flesh, the game enters \"hardmode\", which adds many new and much stronger enemies throughout the world, as well as new NPCs, bosses, ores, items, and a new biome called The Hallow.<ref name=\"pcgamer_1.1\" />\n\nThe game also features an \"expert\" difficulty,<ref name=changelog1.3 /> which can be enabled when creating a world. Expert mode increases the difficulty of the game by increasing the attack and health of monsters and bosses, further increasing the strength of weaker enemies after hardmode, giving some bosses new attack patterns, decreasing the effectiveness of life regeneration, and other tweaks. To deal with the higher attack damages of expert mode the defense statistic is more effective than it is in the normal difficulty. In addition to the higher difficulty level, expert mode increases the chance for enemies to drop rare items, and adds new items that can only be obtained by defeating the bosses on expert mode. In addition to standard gameplay, ''Terraria'' has a [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-terraria-mods/|title=The best Terraria mods|last=Tucker|first=Jake|date=January 16, 2017|work=pcgamer|access-date=July 28, 2017|last2=Joe|first2=Donnelly|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/super-terraria-world-mods-re-logics-game-into-a-full-fledged-rpg/|title=Super Terraria World mods Re-Logic's game into a full-fledged RPG|last=Skyes|first=Tom|date=September 30, 2016|work=pcgamer|access-date=July 28, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Development and release ==\n<!-- initial release -->\n''Terraria'' was developed by Re-Logic beginning in January 2011,<ref name=\"ign_spinks\" /> and is built on the [[Microsoft XNA]] framework.<ref name=\"escapist_xna\" />  Re-Logic was composed of Andrew Spinks, who designed and programmed the game, Finn Brice, who along with Spinks did the graphic design for the game, and Jeremy Guerrette, who was a production assistant at Re-Logic, but left shortly after the game's release.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The music was composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly.<ref name=\"resonance\" /> The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 16, 2011.<ref name=\"pcgamer_win_release\" />\n                                            \n<!-- 1.1 update -->\nPost-launch, the game has been updated on multiple occasions.

The game was initially released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 16, 2011, and has since been released for other PC, consoles, handhelds, and [[Google_Play#Games|mobile platform]]. ''Terraria'' features exploration, crafting, building, and combat with a variety of creatures in a [[procedurally generated]] [[Two-dimensional space|2D]] world. ''Terraria'' received generally positive critical reception upon release and praise given to its sandbox elements. By April 2020, the game had sold over 30 million copies.\n''Terraria''{{'s}} final update is scheduled for May 16, 2020, the ninth anniversary of the initial release of the game. This update is known as \"Journey's End\" or version 1.4.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Terraria screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|An in-game screenshot of ''Terraria'', circa 2011]]\n''Terraria'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Open world|sandbox]] game with gameplay that revolves around exploration, building, crafting, combat, and mining, playable in both [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] modes.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /><ref name=\"Kotaku2011\" /> The game has a 3D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] tile-based graphical style reminiscent of the 16-bit sprites found on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].<ref name=\"Kotaku2011\" /> The game is noted for its classic exploration-adventure style of gameplay, similar to games such as the ''[[Metroid]]'' series and ''[[Minecraft]]''.<ref name=\"Kotaku2011\" /><ref name=\"destructoid1\" /><ref name=\"wired1\" />\n\nThe game starts in a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] world. The player starts out with three basic tools: a pickaxe for digging, a sword for combat, and an axe for woodcutting.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> Many resources, notably ores, can be found while exploring caves. The player begins with 100 [[Health (gaming)|health]] and 20 [[Mana (gaming)|mana points]], which can both be increased by finding certain [[Item (gaming)|items]].<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> Some resources, and most items, may only be found in certain areas of the map, stored in common and rare containers, or dropped by certain enemies.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> The player uses resources to craft new items and equipment at an appropriate crafting station for that recipe. For example, tables or other items can be crafted at a work bench, bars can be smelted from ore at a furnace, and armor can be crafted at an anvil. Several advanced items in ''Terraria'' require multiple crafting operations where the product of one recipe is used as an ingredient for another.\n\nThe player can encounter many different enemies in ''Terraria'', such as simple slime blobs, zombies, skeletons, demon eyes, and various [[biome]]-specific enemies. The occurrence of certain enemies depends on several factors including time, location, random events, and player interactions.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> The player can fight against enemies with swords, bows, guns, magic spells, and summoned attackers. The player may also battle [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] with a number of different combat mechanics that can drop rare items and large amounts of in-game currency. All bosses can be summoned by using certain items or randomly when certain criteria are met. Some of the bosses can spawn naturally in certain places and times. The defeat of these bosses is directly tied to in-game progression.\n\nBy completing specific goals, such as defeating a boss or obtaining a certain item, players can attract [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) to occupy structures or rooms they have built, such as a merchant, nurse, or wizard.<ref name=\"gamespotreview\" /> Some NPCs can be acquired by finding them throughout the world and will then reside in the player's house like the wizard or the mechanic. Players may then buy or sell items and certain services from NPCs with coins found in the world. These coins include copper, silver, gold, and platinum. The game includes a currency system in the form of coins that can be primarily used to complete transactions with NPCs.\n\nThe game recognizes many different biomes and areas, defined by the blocks that exist in the vicinity, each home to a unique set of enemies. Some biomes, such as the Corruption or Crimson biomes, will naturally expand by slowly overtaking and converting blocks in adjacent biomes. If the player journeys to the Underworld biome and summons and defeats a boss called the Wall of Flesh, the game enters \"hardmode\", which adds many new and much stronger enemies throughout the world, as well as new NPCs, bosses, ores, items, and a new biome called The Hallow.<ref name=\"pcgamer_1.1\" />\n\nThe game also features an \"expert\" difficulty,<ref name=changelog1.3 /> which can be enabled when creating a world. Expert mode increases the difficulty of the game by increasing the attack and health of monsters and bosses, further increasing the strength of weaker enemies after hardmode, giving some bosses new attack patterns, decreasing the effectiveness of life regeneration, and other tweaks. To deal with the higher attack damages of expert mode the defense statistic is more effective than it is in the normal difficulty. In addition to the higher difficulty level, expert mode increases the chance for enemies to drop rare items, and adds new items that can only be obtained by defeating the bosses on expert mode.
