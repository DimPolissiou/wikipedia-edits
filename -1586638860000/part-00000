''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

If you go outside that range (about 25% of the distance from where you are now to the sun), loading and saving chunks will start overwriting old chunks.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture. The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions.<ref name=\"blockbyblock\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/09/05/minecraft-un-block-by-block-project-to-help-young-people-redesign-their-neighbourhoods/ |title=Minecraft UN Block By Block project to help young people redesign their neighbourhoods |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=5 September 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012 |first=Tom |last=Senior |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907235734/http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/09/05/minecraft-un-block-by-block-project-to-help-young-people-redesign-their-neighbourhoods/ |archivedate=7 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, the [[Danish Geodata Agency]] generated all of Denmark in fullscale in ''Minecraft'' based on their own geodata.<ref name=\"DenmarkInMinecraft\">{{cite press release |url=http://gst.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2014/apr/geodatastyrelsen-giver-de-unge-hele-danmark-i-3d/ |title=Geodatastyrelsen giver de unge hele Danmark i 3D |trans-title=The Geodata Agency gives the youth whole Denmark in 3D |publisher=The Danish Geodata Agency |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=25 April 2014 |language=Danish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235902/http://gst.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2014/apr/geodatastyrelsen-giver-de-unge-hele-danmark-i-3d/ |archivedate=26 April 2014}}</ref> This is possible because Denmark is [[List of elevation extremes by country|one of the flattest countries]] with the highest point at {{convert|171|m|||}} (ranking as the country with the [[List of elevation extremes by country|30th smallest elevation span]]), where the limit in default ''Minecraft'' is around {{convert|192|m|||}} above in-game sea level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''Minecraft'' has also been used in educational settings.<ref name=\"Education\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-in-education-how-video-games-are-teaching-kids/1100-6400549/ |title=Minecraft In Education: How Video Games Are Teaching Kids |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2012 |last=Walton |first=Mark |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010082122/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-in-education-how-video-games-are-teaching-kids/1100-6400549/ |archivedate=10 October 2013}}</ref> In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing ''Minecraft'' into schools.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 1 November 2014. The episode was written by [[showrunner]] and head writer [[Steven Moffat]] and was directed by [[Rachel Talalay]]. It is the first of a two-part story; the concluding episode \"[[Death in Heaven]]\", the finale of the eighth series, aired on 8 November.\n\nIn the episode, [[Danny Pink]] ([[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]]) is killed, and finds himself in an afterlife called the Nethersphere. As [[Twelfth Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) and his companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) try to find Danny, they find themselves in a facility that accommodates [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], run by recurring character Missy ([[Michelle Gomez]]). In the episode's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Missy reveals her true identity as a female incarnation of the Doctor's arch-enemy [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]], last seen in the 2009\u201310 serial \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\nThe episode received widespread critical acclaim, with the performances of Capaldi, Gomez, Coleman and Anderson being praised. Critics praised the horror strand of the episode, and, the maturity level of the episode \u2013 and the way the darker, more mature and morbid themes were handled.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Clara Oswald|Clara]] phones [[Danny Pink|Danny]], ready to admit the full truth of her travelling with the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and that she sincerely loves Danny. Danny is killed by a passing car midway through the call. Visibly upset, Clara schemes to use a hypnotic patch on the Doctor to blackmail him into saving Danny. The Doctor eventually reveals that the patch did not work on him; instead, he had used it on Clara to learn why she was upset and to see how far she was willing to go. He offers\u2014as a friend, despite her betrayal of him\u2014to see if they can locate Danny in the afterlife.\n\nClara focuses on Danny's location with the [[TARDIS]]' telepathic interface. The Doctor and Clara arrive at a mausoleum called the {{abbr|3W|Three words}} Institute, which holds several tanks of human skeletons submerged in a substance called dark water; the dark water hides the exoskeletons that support the skeletons. They are greeted by Missy, who says she is a welcome droid. The scientist Dr Chang explains to them that 3W was founded to protect the dead after voices heard within white noise broadcast signals suggested the dead are aware of their bodies being cremated.\n\nDuring all of this, Danny is greeted by Seb in an apparent afterlife called the Nethersphere. Seb helps Danny adjust to his recent death. As part of his orientation, a meeting is arranged between Danny and a young civilian boy he accidentally killed while he was a soldier. The boy runs off. Danny receives a call from Clara at 3W. The Doctor leaves with Chang to investigate further while Clara takes the call. Not wishing Clara to die, Danny does not convince her that he is really Danny, and tricks her into ending the call. Though Danny almost deletes his emotions, he hesitates when he sees the boy watching him.\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n\n | image1 = Dark Water (Cybermen).jpg \n | width1 = 445  | height1 = 250 \n | alt1 = \"Dark Water\" Cybermen\n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = Cybermen Emerge The Invasion.png\n | width2 = 361 | height2 = 267\n | alt2 =  ''The Invasion'' Cybermen\n | caption2 =\n\n | footer = The shot of the Cybermen emerging from St Paul's Cathedral was intended as an homage to the similar shots from the 1968 serial ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]''<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n}}\n\nMissy instructs the skeletons to rise and begin draining the tanks. She kills Chang with a handheld device. The skeletons are revealed to be [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]. Missy tells the Doctor that dying minds are uploaded to the Nethersphere\u2014a spherical [[Time Lord]] \"hard drive\"\u2014where the emotions are deleted and the mind is downloaded into upgraded Cyberman bodies. The Doctor realises that Missy is not a droid, but a Time Lady. The Doctor races out of 3W and finds that it is inside [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in contemporary London.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 1 November 2014. The episode was written by [[showrunner]] and head writer [[Steven Moffat]] and was directed by [[Rachel Talalay]]. It is the first of a two-part story; the concluding episode \"[[Death in Heaven]]\", the finale of the eighth series, aired on 8 November.\n\nIn the episode, [[Danny Pink]] ([[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]]) is killed, and finds himself in an afterlife called the Nethersphere. As [[Twelfth Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) and his companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) try to find Danny, they find themselves in a facility that accommodates [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], run by recurring character Missy ([[Michelle Gomez]]). In the episode's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Missy reveals her true identity as a female incarnation of the Doctor's arch-enemy [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]], last seen in the 2009\u201310 serial \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\nThe episode received widespread critical acclaim, with the performances of Capaldi, Gomez, Coleman and Anderson being praised. Critics praised the horror strand of the episode, and, the maturity level of the episode \u2013 and the way the darker, more mature and morbid themes were handled.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Clara Oswald|Clara]] phones [[Danny Pink|Danny]], ready to admit the full truth of her travelling with the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and that she sincerely loves Danny. Danny is killed by a passing car midway through the call. Visibly upset, Clara schemes to use a hypnotic patch on the Doctor to blackmail him into saving Danny. The Doctor eventually reveals that the patch did not work on him; instead, he had used it on Clara to learn why she was upset and to see how far she was willing to go. He offers\u2014as a friend, despite her betrayal of him\u2014to see if they can locate Danny in the afterlife.\n\nClara focuses on Danny's location with the [[TARDIS]]' telepathic interface. The Doctor and Clara arrive at a mausoleum called the {{abbr|3W|Three words}} Institute, which holds several tanks of human skeletons submerged in a substance called dark water; the dark water hides the exoskeletons that support the skeletons. They are greeted by Missy, who says she is a welcome droid. The scientist Dr Chang explains to them that 3W was founded to protect the dead after voices heard within white noise broadcast signals suggested the dead are aware of their bodies being cremated.\n\nDuring all of this, Danny is greeted by Seb in an apparent afterlife called the Nethersphere. Seb helps Danny adjust to his recent death. As part of his orientation, a meeting is arranged between Danny and a young civilian boy he accidentally killed while he was a soldier. The boy runs off. Danny receives a call from Clara at 3W. The Doctor leaves with Chang to investigate further while Clara takes the call. Not wishing Clara to die, Danny does not convince her that he is really Danny, and tricks her into ending the call. Though Danny almost deletes his emotions, he hesitates when he sees the boy watching him.\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n\n | image1 = Dark Water (Cybermen).jpg \n | width1 = 445  | height1 = 250 \n | alt1 = \"Dark Water\" Cybermen\n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = Cybermen Emerge The Invasion.png\n | width2 = 361 | height2 = 267\n | alt2 =  ''The Invasion'' Cybermen\n | caption2 =\n\n | footer = The shot of the Cybermen emerging from St Paul's Cathedral was intended as an homage to the similar shots from the 1968 serial ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]''<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n}}\n\nMissy instructs the skeletons to rise and begin draining the tanks. She kills Chang with a handheld device. The skeletons are revealed to be [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]. Missy tells the Doctor that dying minds are uploaded to the Nethersphere\u2014a spherical [[Time Lord]] \"hard drive\"\u2014where the emotions are deleted and the mind is downloaded into upgraded Cyberman bodies. The Doctor realises that Missy is not a droid, but a Time Lady. The Doctor races out of 3W and finds that it is inside [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in contemporary London.

He led the first expedition to traverse the [[Northwest Passage]] by sea, from 1903 to 1906, and the first [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|expedition to the South Pole]] in 1911. He led the first expedition proven to have reached the [[North Pole]] in a [[dirigible]] in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"flyingtothenorthpole\" /> He disappeared while taking part in a rescue mission for the airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} in 1928.\n\n== Early life ==\nAmundsen was born into a family of Norwegian shipowners and captains in [[Borge, \u00d8stfold|Borge]], between the towns [[Fredrikstad]] and [[Sarpsborg]]. His parents were Jens Amundsen and Hanna Sahlqvist. Roald was the fourth son in the family. His mother wanted him to avoid the family maritime trade and encouraged him to become a doctor, a promise that Amundsen kept until his mother died when he was aged 21. He promptly quit university for a life at sea.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nWhen he was fifteen years old, Amundsen was enthralled by reading Sir [[John Franklin]]'s narratives of his overland Arctic expeditions. Amundsen wrote \"I read them with a fervid fascination which has shaped the whole course of my life\".<ref name=\"Life\">{{cite book | title=My Life as an Explorer | publisher=Doubleday, Page & company | author=Amundsen, Roald | year=1927 | location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\n== Polar treks ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Belgian Antarctic Expedition ===\n[[File:Belgica schiff.jpg|thumb|{{RV|Belgica|1884|6}} frozen in the ice, 1898]]\nAmundsen joined the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] as first mate. This expedition, led by [[Adrien de Gerlache]] using the ship the RV ''Belgica'', became the first expedition to overwinter in Antarctica.<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /> The ''Belgica'', whether by mistake or design, became locked in the sea ice at 70\u00b030\u2032S off [[Alexander Island]], west of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The crew endured a winter for which they were poorly prepared.\n\nBy Amundsen's own estimation, the doctor for the expedition, the American [[Frederick Cook]], probably saved the crew from [[scurvy]] by hunting for animals and feeding the crew fresh meat. In cases where citrus fruits are lacking, fresh meat from animals that make their own [[vitamin C]] contains enough of the vitamin to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it. This was an important lesson for Amundsen's future expeditions.\n\n=== Northwest Passage ===\n[[File:Nlc amundsen.jpg|thumb|left|Roald Amundsen, around 1908.]]\nIn 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to successfully traverse Canada's [[Northwest Passage]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. He planned a small expedition of six men in a {{nowr|45-ton}} fishing vessel, {{ship||Gj\u00f8a||2}}, in order to have flexibility. His ship had relatively shallow draft. His technique was to use a small ship and hug the coast. Amundsen had the ship outfitted with a small 13&nbsp;horsepower single-screw paraffin engine.<ref name=\"Derry\" />\n\nThey traveled via [[Baffin Bay]], the [[Parry Channel]] and then south through [[Peel Sound]], [[James Ross Strait]], [[Simpson Strait]] and [[Rae Strait]]. They spent two winters at [[King William Island]], in the harbor of what is today [[Gjoa Haven, Nunavut|Gjoa Haven]].<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /><ref name=\"Derry\" /> During this time, Amundsen and the crew learned from the local [[Netsilik Inuit]] people about [[Arctic]] survival skills, which he found invaluable in his later expedition to the South Pole. For example, he learned to use sled dogs for transportation of goods and to wear animal skins in lieu of heavy, woolen parkas, which could not keep out the cold when wet.\n\nLeaving Gjoa Haven, he sailed west and passed [[Cambridge Bay]], which had been reached from the west by [[Richard Collinson]] in 1852. Continuing to the south of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], the ship cleared the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] on {{nowr|17 August 1905}}. It had to stop for the winter before going on to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] on Alaska's Pacific coast. The nearest telegraph station was {{convert|500|mi}} away in [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]]. Amundsen traveled there overland to wire a success message on 5 December, then returned to Nome in 1906. Later that year he was elected to the [[American Antiquarian Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlista|title=MemberListA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt this time, Amundsen learned of the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], and that he had a new king. The explorer sent the new king, [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]], news that his traversing the Northwest Passage \"was a great achievement for Norway\".<ref name=\"explore\"/> He said he hoped to do more and signed it \"Your loyal subject, Roald Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"explore\"/> The crew returned to Oslo in November 1906, after almost three-and-a-half years abroad. ''Gj\u00f8a'' was returned to Norway in 1972. After a {{nowr|45-day}} trip from San Francisco on a bulk carrier, she was placed on land outside the [[Fram Museum]] in Oslo<ref name=\"explore\">{{cite book|title=''Roald Amundsen and the Exploration of the Northwest Passage''|publisher=[[Fram Museum]]|location=Oslo|year=2008|isbn=9788282350013|pages=63\u201365}}</ref>, where she is now situated inside her own dedicated building at the museum.\n\n=== South Pole Expedition ===\n{{seemain|Amundsen's South Pole expedition}}\n\n[[File:Aan de Zuidpool - p1913-160.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Norwegian flag at the South Pole]]\nAmundsen next planned to take an expedition to the North Pole and explore the [[Arctic Basin]]. Finding it difficult to raise funds, when he heard in 1909 that the Americans Frederick Cook and [[Robert Peary]] had claimed to reach the North Pole as a result of two different expeditions, he decided to reroute to Antarctica.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> He was not clear about his intentions, and [[Robert F. Scott]] and the Norwegian supporters felt misled.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> Scott was planning his own expedition to the South Pole that year. Using the ship {{ship||Fram||2}}, earlier used by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], Amundsen left Oslo for the south on 3 June 1910.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /><ref name=\"Amundsen\" /> At [[Madeira]], Amundsen alerted his men that they would be heading to Antarctica, and sent a telegram to Scott: \"Beg to inform you ''Fram'' proceeding Antarctic\u2014Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\" />\n\nNearly six months later, the expedition arrived at the eastern edge of the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] (then known as \"the Great Ice Barrier\"), at a large inlet called the [[Bay of Whales]], on 14 January 1911. Amundsen established his base camp there, calling it {{ship||Framheim||2}}. Amundsen eschewed the heavy wool clothing worn on earlier Antarctic attempts in favour of adopting [[Inuit]]-style furred skins.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nUsing skis and dog sleds for transportation, Amundsen and his men created supply depots at 80\u00b0, 81\u00b0 and 82\u00b0&nbsp;South on the Barrier, along a line directly south to the Pole.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> Amundsen also planned to kill some of his dogs on the way and use them as a source for fresh meat. A small group, including [[Hjalmar Johansen]], [[Kristian Prestrud]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Stubberud]], set out on 8 September, but had to abandon their trek due to extreme temperatures. The painful retreat caused a quarrel within the group, and Amundsen sent Johansen and the other two men to explore [[Edward VII Peninsula|King Edward VII Land]].\n\nA second attempt, with a team of five made up of [[Olav Bjaaland]], [[Helmer Hanssen]], [[Sverre Hassel]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and Amundsen, departed base camp on 19 October. They took four sledges and 52&nbsp;dogs. Using a route along the previously unknown [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]], they arrived at the edge of the Polar Plateau on 21 November after a four-day climb. The team  and 16&nbsp;dogs arrived at the pole on 14 December, a month before Scott's group.{{refn | name = polar date | group = n | Some sources give the date as 15 December. ''Fram'' crossed the [[International Date Line]] shortly before arriving at the [[Bay of Whales]], and thereby \"lost\" a day. Since the western and eastern hemispheres are conjoined at the South Pole, either date can be considered as correct, though Amundsen gives 14 December, both in his first telegraphed report on arrival in Hobart, and in his fuller account ''The South Pole''.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I, p. xvii}} }} Amundsen named their South Pole camp [[Polheim]]. Amundsen renamed the [[Antarctic Plateau]] as King Haakon VII's Plateau. They left a small tent and letter stating their accomplishment, in case they did not return safely to Framheim.\n\nThe team arrived at Framheim on 25 January 1912, with 11&nbsp;surviving dogs. They made their way off the continent and to [[Hobart]], [[Australia]], where Amundsen publicly announced his success on 7 March. He telegraphed news to backers.\n\nAmundsen's expedition benefited from his careful preparation, good equipment, appropriate clothing, a simple primary task, an understanding of dogs and their handling, and the effective use of skis. In contrast to the misfortunes of Scott's team, Amundsen's trek proved relatively smooth and uneventful.\n\n== North Polar Expeditions and Northeast Passage ==\n=== Northeast Passage ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Polarskipet Maud.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Maud|ship|2}} in June 1918]]\nIn 1918, an expedition Amundsen began with a new ship, {{ship||Maud|ship|2}}, lasted until 1925. ''Maud'' was carefully navigated through the ice west to east through the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]]. With him on this expedition were Oscar Wisting and Helmer Hanssen, both of whom had been part of the team to reach the South Pole. In addition, Henrik Lindstr\u00f8m was included as a cook. He suffered a stroke and was so physically reduced that he could not participate.\n\nThe goal of the expedition was to explore the unknown areas of the Arctic Ocean, strongly inspired by Fridtjof Nansen's earlier expedition with ''Fram''. The plan was to sail along the coast of [[Siberia]] and go into the ice farther to the north and east than Nansen had. In contrast to Amundsen's earlier expeditions, this was expected to yield more material for academic research, and he carried the geophysicist [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] on board.\n\nThe voyage was to the northeasterly direction over the [[Kara Sea]]. Amundsen planned to freeze the ''Maud'' into the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice cap]] and drift towards the North Pole\u2014as Nansen had done with the ''Fram''\u2014and he did so off [[Cape Chelyuskin]]. But, the ice became so thick that the ship was unable to break free, although it was designed for such a journey in heavy ice. In September 1919, the crew got the ship loose from the ice, but it froze again after eleven days somewhere between the [[New Siberian Islands]] and [[Wrangel Island]].\n\nDuring this time, Amundsen suffered a broken arm and was attacked by polar bears.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520123322/http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2013  }}</ref> As a result, he participated little in the work outdoors, such as sleigh rides and hunting. He, Hanssen, and Wisting, along with two other men, embarked on an expedition by dog sled to Nome, Alaska, more than {{convert|1000|km}} away. But they found that the ice was not frozen solid in the [[Bering Strait]], and it could not be crossed. They sent a telegram from [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]] to signal their location.\n\nAfter two winters frozen in the ice, without having achieved the goal of drifting over the North Pole, Amundsen decided to go to Nome to repair the ship and buy provisions. Several of the crew ashore there, including Hanssen, did not return on time to the ship. Amundsen considered Hanssen to be in breach of contract, and dismissed him from the crew.\n\nDuring the third winter, ''Maud'' was frozen in the western Bering Strait. She finally became free and the expedition sailed south, reaching [[Seattle]], in the American Pacific Northwest in 1921 for repairs. Amundsen returned to Norway, needing to put his finances in order. He took with him two young indigenous girls, a four-year-old he adopted, Kakonita, and her companion Camilla. When Amundsen went bankrupt two years later, however, he sent the girls to be cared for by Camilla's father, who lived in eastern Russia.<ref name=\"Amundsen adoption\" />\n\nIn June 1922, Amundsen returned to ''Maud'', which had been sailed to Nome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sewardpeninsula.com/s/roald-amundsen.pdf|title=The Northern Explorer Roald Amundsen|last=|first=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> He decided to shift from the planned naval expedition to aerial ones, and arranged to charter a plane. He divided the expedition team in two: one part, led by him, was to winter over and prepare for an attempt to fly over the pole in 1923. The second team on ''Maud'', under the command of Wisting, was to resume the original plan to drift over the North Pole in the ice. The ship drifted in the ice for three years east of the New Siberian Islands, never reaching the North Pole. It was finally seized by Amundsen's creditors as  collateral for his mounting debt.\n\n=== Aerial Expeditions to the North Pole ===\n[[File:Roald Amundsen Svalbard 1925.jpg|thumb|Roald Amundsen in Svalbard (1925)]]\n\nThe 1923 attempt to fly over the Pole failed. Amundsen and [[Oskar Omdal]], of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], tried to fly from [[Wainwright, Alaska]], to [[Spitsbergen]] across the North Pole. When their aircraft was damaged, they abandoned the journey. To raise additional funds, Amundsen traveled around the United States in 1924 on a lecture tour. Although he was unable to reach the North Pole, the scientific results of the expedition, mainly the work of Sverdrup, have proven to be of considerable value. Much of the carefully collected scientific data was lost during the ill-fated journey of [[Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen]], two crew members sent on a mission by Amundsen. The scientific materials were later retrieved by Russian scientist [[Nikolay Urvantsev]] from where they had been abandoned on the shores of the Kara Sea.<ref name=\"Barr1919\" />\n\nIn 1925, accompanied by [[Lincoln Ellsworth]], pilot [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]], flight mechanic [[Karl Feucht]] and two other team members, Amundsen took two [[Dornier Do J]] [[flying boat]]s, the N-24 and N-25, to 87\u00b0&nbsp;44\u2032&nbsp;north. It was the northernmost latitude reached by plane up to that time. The aircraft landed a few miles apart without radio contact, yet the crews managed to reunite. The N-24 was damaged. Amundsen and his crew worked for more than three weeks to clean up an airstrip to take off from ice.<ref name=\"historynet\" /> They shovelled 600 tons of ice while consuming only one pound (400&nbsp;g) of daily food rations. In the end, the six crew members were packed into the N-25. In a remarkable feat, Riiser-Larsen took off, and they barely became airborne over the cracking ice. They returned triumphant when everyone thought they had been lost forever.\n\nIn 1926, Amundsen and 15 other men (including Ellsworth, Riiser-Larsen, Oscar Wisting, and the Italian air crew led by aeronautical engineer [[Umberto Nobile]] made the first crossing of the Arctic in the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]],'' designed by Nobile.<ref name=\"PBSorg\" /> They left [[Spitsbergen]] on 11 May 1926, flew over the North Pole on 12 May,<ref name=\"dailytelegraph\">{{cite web\n| title = South Pole conqueror Roald Amundsen won air race to the North Pole |author= Troy Lennon |publisher=  The Daily Telegraph| url = https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/today-in-history/south-pole-conqueror-roald-amundsen-won-air-race-to-the-north-pole/news-story/37de4bb45a376ce3ff4c25c9d1b828ec| accessdate = 22 November 2019| date = 12 May 2016}}</ref> and landed in Alaska the following day.\n\n===Controversy over Polar Priority===\nThe three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole: [[Frederick Cook]] in 1908; [[Robert Peary]] in 1909; and [[Richard E. Byrd]] in 1926 (just a few days before the ''Norge'') are disputed by some, as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraud.<ref name=\"Henderson2005\" /><ref name=\"Rawlins2000\" /> If these other claims are false, the crew of the ''Norge'' would be the first explorers verified to have reached the North Pole, floated over it in the Norge in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"dailytelegraph\" /> If the ''Norge'' expedition was the first to the North Pole, Amundsen and Oscar Wisting were the first men to have reached both geographical poles, by ground or by air.\n\n== Disappearance and death ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Latham 47 Roald Amundsen 1928.jpg|thumb|Amundsen's [[Latham 47]] flying boat]]\nAmundsen disappeared on 18 June 1928 while flying on a rescue mission in the Arctic. His team included Norwegian pilot [[Leif Dietrichson]], French pilot [[Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud]], and three more Frenchmen. They were seeking missing members of Nobile's crew, whose new airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} had crashed while returning from the North Pole. Amundsen's French [[Latham 47]] flying boat\n[[List of aerial disappearances|never returned]].\n\nLater, a wing-float and bottom gasoline tank from the plane, which had been adapted as a replacement wing-float, were found near the [[Troms\u00f8]] coast. It is believed{{by whom|date=February 2019}} that the plane crashed in fog in the [[Barents Sea]], and that Amundsen and his crew were killed in the wreck, or died shortly afterward. The search for Amundsen and team was called off in September 1928 by the Norwegian government, and the bodies were never found.\n\nIn 2004 and in late August 2009, the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] used the [[AUV|unmanned submarine]] ''Hugin 1000'' to search for the wreckage of Amundsen's plane. The searches focused on a {{convert|40|sqmi|adj=on}} area of the sea floor, and were documented by the German production company ContextTV.<ref name=\"Rincon\" /><ref name=\"searchforamundsen\" /> They found nothing from the Amundsen flight.\n\n==Honours==\nIn 1925, Amundsen was awarded the [[Hans Egede Medal]] by the [[Royal Danish Geographical Society]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|title=Geografisk Tidsskrift|via=tidsskrift.dk|journal=\u2014|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210042432/https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|archive-date=10 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|List of things named after Roald Amundsen}}\n[[File:Amundsen-scott-south pole station 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]]]]\n\nOwing to Amundsen's numerous significant accomplishments in polar exploration, many places in both the Arctic and Antarctic are named after him. The [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]], operated by the [[United States Antarctic Program]], was jointly named in honour of Amundsen and his rival.

He led the first expedition to traverse the [[Northwest Passage]] by sea, from 1903 to 1906, and the first [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|expedition to the South Pole]] in 1911. He led the first expedition proven to have reached the [[North Pole]] in a [[dirigible]] in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"flyingtothenorthpole\" /> He disappeared while taking part in a rescue mission for the airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} in 1928.\n\n== Early life ==\nAmundsen was born into a family of Norwegian shipowners and captains in [[Borge, \u00d8stfold|Borge]], between the towns [[Fredrikstad]] and [[Sarpsborg]]. His parents were Jens Amundsen and Hanna Sahlqvist. Roald was the fourth son in the family. His mother wanted him to avoid the family maritime trade and encouraged him to become a doctor, a promise that Amundsen kept until his mother died when he was aged 21. He promptly quit university for a life at sea.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nWhen he was fifteen years old, Amundsen was enthralled by reading Sir [[John Franklin]]'s narratives of his overland Arctic expeditions. Amundsen wrote \"I read them with a fervid fascination which has shaped the whole course of my life\".<ref name=\"Life\">{{cite book | title=My Life as an Explorer | publisher=Doubleday, Page & company | author=Amundsen, Roald | year=1927 | location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\n== Polar treks ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Belgian Antarctic Expedition ===\n[[File:Belgica schiff.jpg|thumb|{{RV|Belgica|1884|6}} frozen in the ice, 1898]]\nAmundsen joined the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] as first mate. This expedition, led by [[Adrien de Gerlache]] using the ship the RV ''Belgica'', became the first expedition to overwinter in Antarctica.<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /> The ''Belgica'', whether by mistake or design, became locked in the sea ice at 70\u00b030\u2032S off [[Alexander Island]], west of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The crew endured a winter for which they were poorly prepared.\n\nBy Amundsen's own estimation, the doctor for the expedition, the American [[Frederick Cook]], probably saved the crew from [[scurvy]] by hunting for animals and feeding the crew fresh meat. In cases where citrus fruits are lacking, fresh meat from animals that make their own [[vitamin C]] contains enough of the vitamin to prevent scurvy, and even partly treat it. This was an important lesson for Amundsen's future expeditions.\n\n=== Northwest Passage ===\n[[File:Nlc amundsen.jpg|thumb|left|Roald Amundsen, around 1908.]]\nIn 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to successfully traverse Canada's [[Northwest Passage]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. He planned a small expedition of six men in a {{nowr|45-ton}} fishing vessel, {{ship||Gj\u00f8a||2}}, in order to have flexibility. His ship had relatively shallow draft. His technique was to use a small ship and hug the coast. Amundsen had the ship outfitted with a small 13&nbsp;horsepower single-screw paraffin engine.<ref name=\"Derry\" />\n\nThey traveled via [[Baffin Bay]], the [[Parry Channel]] and then south through [[Peel Sound]], [[James Ross Strait]], [[Simpson Strait]] and [[Rae Strait]]. They spent two winters at [[King William Island]], in the harbor of what is today [[Gjoa Haven, Nunavut|Gjoa Haven]].<ref name=\"Mifflin\" /><ref name=\"Derry\" /> During this time, Amundsen and the crew learned from the local [[Netsilik Inuit]] people about [[Arctic]] survival skills, which he found invaluable in his later expedition to the South Pole. For example, he learned to use sled dogs for transportation of goods and to wear animal skins in lieu of heavy, woolen parkas, which could not keep out the cold when wet.\n\nLeaving Gjoa Haven, he sailed west and passed [[Cambridge Bay]], which had been reached from the west by [[Richard Collinson]] in 1852. Continuing to the south of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], the ship cleared the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] on {{nowr|17 August 1905}}. It had to stop for the winter before going on to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] on Alaska's Pacific coast. The nearest telegraph station was {{convert|500|mi}} away in [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]]. Amundsen traveled there overland to wire a success message on 5 December, then returned to Nome in 1906. Later that year he was elected to the [[American Antiquarian Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlista|title=MemberListA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAt this time, Amundsen learned of the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], and that he had a new king. The explorer sent the new king, [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]], news that his traversing the Northwest Passage \"was a great achievement for Norway\".<ref name=\"explore\"/> He said he hoped to do more and signed it \"Your loyal subject, Roald Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"explore\"/> The crew returned to Oslo in November 1906, after almost three-and-a-half years abroad. ''Gj\u00f8a'' was returned to Norway in 1972. After a {{nowr|45-day}} trip from San Francisco on a bulk carrier, she was placed on land outside the [[Fram Museum]] in Oslo<ref name=\"explore\">{{cite book|title=''Roald Amundsen and the Exploration of the Northwest Passage''|publisher=[[Fram Museum]]|location=Oslo|year=2008|isbn=9788282350013|pages=63\u201365}}</ref>, where she is now situated inside her own dedicated building at the museum.\n\n=== South Pole Expedition ===\n{{seemain|Amundsen's South Pole expedition}}\n\n[[File:Aan de Zuidpool - p1913-160.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Norwegian flag at the South Pole]]\nAmundsen next planned to take an expedition to the North Pole and explore the [[Arctic Basin]]. Finding it difficult to raise funds, when he heard in 1909 that the Americans Frederick Cook and [[Robert Peary]] had claimed to reach the North Pole as a result of two different expeditions, he decided to reroute to Antarctica.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> He was not clear about his intentions, and [[Robert F. Scott]] and the Norwegian supporters felt misled.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /> Scott was planning his own expedition to the South Pole that year. Using the ship {{ship||Fram||2}}, earlier used by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], Amundsen left Oslo for the south on 3 June 1910.<ref name=\"Simpson\" /><ref name=\"Amundsen\" /> At [[Madeira]], Amundsen alerted his men that they would be heading to Antarctica, and sent a telegram to Scott: \"Beg to inform you ''Fram'' proceeding Antarctic\u2014Amundsen.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\" />\n\nNearly six months later, the expedition arrived at the eastern edge of the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] (then known as \"the Great Ice Barrier\"), at a large inlet called the [[Bay of Whales]], on 14 January 1911. Amundsen established his base camp there, calling it {{ship||Framheim||2}}. Amundsen eschewed the heavy wool clothing worn on earlier Antarctic attempts in favour of adopting [[Inuit]]-style furred skins.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\nUsing skis and dog sleds for transportation, Amundsen and his men created supply depots at 80\u00b0, 81\u00b0 and 82\u00b0&nbsp;South on the Barrier, along a line directly south to the Pole.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> Amundsen also planned to kill some of his dogs on the way and use them as a source for fresh meat. A small group, including [[Hjalmar Johansen]], [[Kristian Prestrud]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Stubberud]], set out on 8 September, but had to abandon their trek due to extreme temperatures. The painful retreat caused a quarrel within the group, and Amundsen sent Johansen and the other two men to explore [[Edward VII Peninsula|King Edward VII Land]].\n\nA second attempt, with a team of five made up of [[Olav Bjaaland]], [[Helmer Hanssen]], [[Sverre Hassel]], [[Oscar Wisting]], and Amundsen, departed base camp on 19 October. They took four sledges and 52&nbsp;dogs. Using a route along the previously unknown [[Axel Heiberg Glacier]], they arrived at the edge of the Polar Plateau on 21 November after a four-day climb. The team  and 16&nbsp;dogs arrived at the pole on 14 December, a month before Scott's group.{{refn | name = polar date | group = n | Some sources give the date as 15 December. ''Fram'' crossed the [[International Date Line]] shortly before arriving at the [[Bay of Whales]], and thereby \"lost\" a day. Since the western and eastern hemispheres are conjoined at the South Pole, either date can be considered as correct, though Amundsen gives 14 December, both in his first telegraphed report on arrival in Hobart, and in his fuller account ''The South Pole''.{{sfn|Amundsen | loc=Vol. I, p. xvii}} }} Amundsen named their South Pole camp [[Polheim]]. Amundsen renamed the [[Antarctic Plateau]] as King Haakon VII's Plateau. They left a small tent and letter stating their accomplishment, in case they did not return safely to Framheim.\n\nThe team arrived at Framheim on 25 January 1912, with 11&nbsp;surviving dogs. They made their way off the continent and to [[Hobart]], [[Australia]], where Amundsen publicly announced his success on 7 March. He telegraphed news to backers.\n\nAmundsen's expedition benefited from his careful preparation, good equipment, appropriate clothing, a simple primary task, an understanding of dogs and their handling, and the effective use of skis. In contrast to the misfortunes of Scott's team, Amundsen's trek proved relatively smooth and uneventful.\n\n== North Polar Expeditions and Northeast Passage ==\n=== Northeast Passage ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Polarskipet Maud.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Maud|ship|2}} in June 1918]]\nIn 1918, an expedition Amundsen began with a new ship, {{ship||Maud|ship|2}}, lasted until 1925. ''Maud'' was carefully navigated through the ice west to east through the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]]. With him on this expedition were Oscar Wisting and Helmer Hanssen, both of whom had been part of the team to reach the South Pole. In addition, Henrik Lindstr\u00f8m was included as a cook. He suffered a stroke and was so physically reduced that he could not participate.\n\nThe goal of the expedition was to explore the unknown areas of the Arctic Ocean, strongly inspired by Fridtjof Nansen's earlier expedition with ''Fram''. The plan was to sail along the coast of [[Siberia]] and go into the ice farther to the north and east than Nansen had. In contrast to Amundsen's earlier expeditions, this was expected to yield more material for academic research, and he carried the geophysicist [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] on board.\n\nThe voyage was to the northeasterly direction over the [[Kara Sea]]. Amundsen planned to freeze the ''Maud'' into the [[Arctic ice pack|polar ice cap]] and drift towards the North Pole\u2014as Nansen had done with the ''Fram''\u2014and he did so off [[Cape Chelyuskin]]. But, the ice became so thick that the ship was unable to break free, although it was designed for such a journey in heavy ice. In September 1919, the crew got the ship loose from the ice, but it froze again after eleven days somewhere between the [[New Siberian Islands]] and [[Wrangel Island]].\n\nDuring this time, Amundsen suffered a broken arm and was attacked by polar bears.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520123322/http://faculty.washington.edu/karpoff/Research/Amundsen.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2013  }}</ref> As a result, he participated little in the work outdoors, such as sleigh rides and hunting. He, Hanssen, and Wisting, along with two other men, embarked on an expedition by dog sled to Nome, Alaska, more than {{convert|1000|km}} away. But they found that the ice was not frozen solid in the [[Bering Strait]], and it could not be crossed. They sent a telegram from [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]] to signal their location.\n\nAfter two winters frozen in the ice, without having achieved the goal of drifting over the North Pole, Amundsen decided to go to Nome to repair the ship and buy provisions. Several of the crew ashore there, including Hanssen, did not return on time to the ship. Amundsen considered Hanssen to be in breach of contract, and dismissed him from the crew.\n\nDuring the third winter, ''Maud'' was frozen in the western Bering Strait. She finally became free and the expedition sailed south, reaching [[Seattle]], in the American Pacific Northwest in 1921 for repairs. Amundsen returned to Norway, needing to put his finances in order. He took with him two young indigenous girls, a four-year-old he adopted, Kakonita, and her companion Camilla. When Amundsen went bankrupt two years later, however, he sent the girls to be cared for by Camilla's father, who lived in eastern Russia.<ref name=\"Amundsen adoption\" />\n\nIn June 1922, Amundsen returned to ''Maud'', which had been sailed to Nome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sewardpeninsula.com/s/roald-amundsen.pdf|title=The Northern Explorer Roald Amundsen|last=|first=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}</ref> He decided to shift from the planned naval expedition to aerial ones, and arranged to charter a plane. He divided the expedition team in two: one part, led by him, was to winter over and prepare for an attempt to fly over the pole in 1923. The second team on ''Maud'', under the command of Wisting, was to resume the original plan to drift over the North Pole in the ice. The ship drifted in the ice for three years east of the New Siberian Islands, never reaching the North Pole. It was finally seized by Amundsen's creditors as  collateral for his mounting debt.\n\n=== Aerial Expeditions to the North Pole ===\n[[File:Roald Amundsen Svalbard 1925.jpg|thumb|Roald Amundsen in Svalbard (1925)]]\n\nThe 1923 attempt to fly over the Pole failed. Amundsen and [[Oskar Omdal]], of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], tried to fly from [[Wainwright, Alaska]], to [[Spitsbergen]] across the North Pole. When their aircraft was damaged, they abandoned the journey. To raise additional funds, Amundsen traveled around the United States in 1924 on a lecture tour. Although he was unable to reach the North Pole, the scientific results of the expedition, mainly the work of Sverdrup, have proven to be of considerable value. Much of the carefully collected scientific data was lost during the ill-fated journey of [[Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen]], two crew members sent on a mission by Amundsen. The scientific materials were later retrieved by Russian scientist [[Nikolay Urvantsev]] from where they had been abandoned on the shores of the Kara Sea.<ref name=\"Barr1919\" />\n\nIn 1925, accompanied by [[Lincoln Ellsworth]], pilot [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]], flight mechanic [[Karl Feucht]] and two other team members, Amundsen took two [[Dornier Do J]] [[flying boat]]s, the N-24 and N-25, to 87\u00b0&nbsp;44\u2032&nbsp;north. It was the northernmost latitude reached by plane up to that time. The aircraft landed a few miles apart without radio contact, yet the crews managed to reunite. The N-24 was damaged. Amundsen and his crew worked for more than three weeks to clean up an airstrip to take off from ice.<ref name=\"historynet\" /> They shovelled 600 tons of ice while consuming only one pound (400&nbsp;g) of daily food rations. In the end, the six crew members were packed into the N-25. In a remarkable feat, Riiser-Larsen took off, and they barely became airborne over the cracking ice. They returned triumphant when everyone thought they had been lost forever.\n\nIn 1926, Amundsen and 15 other men (including Ellsworth, Riiser-Larsen, Oscar Wisting, and the Italian air crew led by aeronautical engineer [[Umberto Nobile]]) made the first crossing of the Arctic in the [[airship]] ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]],'' designed by Nobile.<ref name=\"PBSorg\" /> They left [[Spitsbergen]] on 11 May 1926, flew over the North Pole on 12 May,<ref name=\"dailytelegraph\">{{cite web\n| title = South Pole conqueror Roald Amundsen won air race to the North Pole |author= Troy Lennon |publisher=  The Daily Telegraph| url = https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/today-in-history/south-pole-conqueror-roald-amundsen-won-air-race-to-the-north-pole/news-story/37de4bb45a376ce3ff4c25c9d1b828ec| accessdate = 22 November 2019| date = 12 May 2016}}</ref> and landed in Alaska the following day.\n\n===Controversy over Polar Priority===\nThe three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole: [[Frederick Cook]] in 1908; [[Robert Peary]] in 1909; and [[Richard E. Byrd]] in 1926 (just a few days before the ''Norge'') are disputed by some, as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraud.<ref name=\"Henderson2005\" /><ref name=\"Rawlins2000\" /> If these other claims are false, the crew of the ''Norge'' would be the first explorers verified to have reached the North Pole, floated over it in the Norge in 1926.<ref name=\"whowasfirstatthenorthpole\" /><ref name=\"dailytelegraph\" /> If the ''Norge'' expedition was the first to the North Pole, Amundsen and Oscar Wisting were the first men to have reached both geographical poles, by ground or by air.\n\n== Disappearance and death ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Latham 47 Roald Amundsen 1928.jpg|thumb|Amundsen's [[Latham 47]] flying boat]]\nAmundsen disappeared on 18 June 1928 while flying on a rescue mission in the Arctic. His team included Norwegian pilot [[Leif Dietrichson]], French pilot [[Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud]], and three more Frenchmen. They were seeking missing members of Nobile's crew, whose new airship {{ship|Airship|Italia||2}} had crashed while returning from the North Pole.

It is believed{{by whom|date=February 2019}} that the plane crashed in fog in the [[Barents Sea]], and that Amundsen and his crew were killed in the wreck, or died shortly afterward. The search for Amundsen and team was called off in September 1928 by the Norwegian government, and the bodies were never found.\n\nIn 2004 and in late August 2009, the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] used the [[AUV|unmanned submarine]] ''Hugin 1000'' to search for the wreckage of Amundsen's plane. The searches focused on a {{convert|40|sqmi|adj=on}} area of the sea floor, and were documented by the German production company ContextTV.<ref name=\"Rincon\" /><ref name=\"searchforamundsen\" /> They found nothing from the Amundsen flight.\n\n==Honours==\nIn 1925, Amundsen was awarded the [[Hans Egede Medal]] by the [[Royal Danish Geographical Society]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|title=Geografisk Tidsskrift|via=tidsskrift.dk|journal=\u2014|access-date=9 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210042432/https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/geografisktidsskrift/article/view/4567/8563|archive-date=10 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|List of things named after Roald Amundsen}}\n[[File:Amundsen-scott-south pole station 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]]]]\n\nOwing to Amundsen's numerous significant accomplishments in polar exploration, many places in both the Arctic and Antarctic are named after him. The [[Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station]], operated by the [[United States Antarctic Program]], was jointly named in honour of Amundsen and his rival. British novelist [[Roald Dahl]] was named after Amundsen, as was Nobel Prize laureate [[Roald Hoffmann]].\n\nThe 1969 film ''[[The Red Tent (film)|The Red Tent]]'' tells the story of the Nobile expedition and Amundsen's disappearance.

Hispanization of a person might be illustrated by speaking Spanish, making and eating Hispanic American food, listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Hispanics into theirs.\n\nOne reason that some people believe the assimilation of Hispanics in the U.S. is not comparable to that of other cultural groups is that [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have been living in parts of North America for centuries, in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant. For example, [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]] (1598), [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]] and [[Puerto Rico]] have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. existed. (The language of the Native Americans existed before this, until the invasion and forced assimilation by the Spanish.) These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], and later [[Mexico]] (with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848(Puerto Rico was in 1898). Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior to the creation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. For example, San Miguel de Gualdape, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida]] were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] was founded in 1604, and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] was established in 1660. [[El Paso]] was founded in 1659, [[San Antonio]] in 1691, [[Laredo, Texas]] in 1755, [[San Diego]] in 1769, [[San Francisco]] in 1776, [[San Jose, California]] in 1777, [[New Iberia, Louisiana]] in 1779, and [[Los Angeles]] in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and [[Spanish language]] well before the United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nLanguage retention is a common index to assimilation; according to the 2000 census, about 75% of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home. Spanish language retention rates vary geographically; parts of Texas and New Mexico have language retention rates over 90%, whereas in parts of Colorado and California, retention rates are lower than 30%. The degree of retention of Spanish as the native language is based on recent arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken. As is true of other immigrants, those who were born in other countries still speak their native language. Later generations are increasingly less likely to speak the language spoken in the country of their ancestors, as is true of other immigrant groups.\n\n==Spanish-speaking countries and regions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" line-height=\"0.87em\"\n|-valign=\"top\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:#FFFF00;\"\n| align=\"center\" |'''[[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]]'''\n|-\n|[[File:Map of the spanish language uses.png|320x220px|Map showing usage of the Spanish language]]\n|-\n|{{legend|Red|<small>''Spanish identified as sole official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#000080|<small>''Spanish identified as co-official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#00ff55|<small>''Former Spanish co-official, now identified as auxiliary <br>language''</small>}}\n|}\n\n{{See also|Hispanophone|Hispanic America|List of countries where Spanish is an official language}}\nToday, Spanish is among the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most commonly spoken first languages]] of the world.

For instance, the music from Spain is a lot different from the [[Hispanic America]]n, although there is a high grade of exchange between both continents. In addition, due to the high national development of the diverse [[nationalities and regions of Spain]], there is a lot of music in the [[Languages of Spain|different languages of the Peninsula]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]], mainly). See, for instance, [[Music of Catalonia]] or [[Rock catal\u00e0]], [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]], and [[Basque music]]. [[Flamenco]] is also a very popular music style in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]]. Spanish ballads \"romances\" can be traced in Argentina as \"milongas\", same structure but different scenarios.\n\nOn the other side of the ocean, Hispanic America is also home to a wide variety of music, even though \"Latin\" music is often erroneously thought of, as a single genre. Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex polyrhythms of African origin. [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]] shows combined influences of mostly European and Native American origin, while traditional Northern Mexican music \u2014 [[norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]] and [[banda music|banda]] \u2014  [[polka]], has influence from polka music brought by [[Central Europe]]an settlers to [[Mexico]] which later influenced western music.  The music of Hispanic Americans \u2014 such as [[tejano music]] \u2014 has influences in [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Latin pop|pop]], and [[country music]] as well as traditional Mexican music such as [[Mariachi]]. Meanwhile, native [[Andes|Andean]] sounds and melodies are the backbone of Peruvian and Bolivian music, but also play a significant role in the popular music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia, and again in Chile where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed [[nueva canci\u00f3n]]. In U.S. communities of immigrants from these countries it is common to hear these styles. [[Latin pop]], [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol]], [[Hip-hop|Latin hip-hop]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]], [[Cumbia]] and [[Reggaeton]] styles tend to appeal to the broader Hispanic population, and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many Hispanics of all backgrounds.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Hispanic literature}}\n\n[[File:Medal of the Miguel de Cervantes Prize.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], most prestigious literary award in the Spanish language]]\n\nSpanish-language literature and folklore is very rich and is influenced by a variety of countries. There are thousands of writers from many places, and dating from the Middle Ages to the present. Some of the most recognized writers are [[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]] (Spain), [[Lope de Vega]] (Spain), [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] (Spain), [[Jose Rizal]] (Philippines), [[Carlos Fuentes]] (Mexico), [[Octavio Paz]] (Mexico), [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]] (Guatemala), [[George Santayana]] (US), [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] (Cuba), [[Sabine Ulibarri]] (US), [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] (Spain), [[Miguel de Unamuno]] (Spain), [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (Colombia), [[Rafael Pombo]] (Colombia), [[Horacio Quiroga]] (Uruguay), [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]] (Venezuela), [[Luis Rodriguez Varela]] (Philippines), [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] (Nicaragua), [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peru), [[Giannina Braschi]] (Puerto Rico), [[Cristina Peri Rossi]] (Uruguay), [[Luisa Valenzuela]] (Argentina), [[Roberto Quesada]] (Honduras), [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] (Argentina), [[Pablo Neruda]] (Chile), [[Gabriela Mistral]] (Chile), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (Argentina), [[Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a]] (Dominican Republic), [[Ernesto Sabato]] (Argentina), [[Juan Tom\u00e1s \u00c1vila Laurel]] (Equatorial Guinea), [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]] (Peru), [[Joaquin Garcia Monge]] (Costa Rica), and [[Jesus Balmori]] (Philippines).\n\n===Sports===\nIn the majority of the Hispanic countries, [[association football]] is the most popular sport. The men's national teams of Argentina, Uruguay and Spain have won the [[FIFA World Cup]] a total five times. The Spanish [[La Liga]] is one of the most popular in the world, known for [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid]]. Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] and [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] are two of the strongest leagues in the Americas.\n\nHowever, [[baseball]] is the most popular sport in some Central American and Caribbean countries (especially Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela), as well as in the diaspora in the United States. Notable Hispanic teams in early baseball are the [[All Cubans]], [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]] and [[New York Cubans]]. The [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] recognizes Hispanic baseball personalities. Nearly 30 percent (22 percent foreign-born Latinos) of [[MLB]] players today have Hispanic heritage.\n\nSeveral Hispanic sportspeople have been successful worldwide, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Alfredo di Stefano]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] (association football), [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Fernando Alonso]], [[Marc Gen\u00e9]], [[Carlos Sainz]] (auto racing), [[\u00c1ngel Nieto]], [[Dani Pedrosa]], [[Jorge Lorenzo]], [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]], [[Marc Coma]], [[Nani Roma]] (motorcycle racing), [[Emanuel Gin\u00f3bili]], [[Pau Gasol]], [[Marc Gasol]] (basketball), [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]] (boxing), [[Miguel Indurain]], [[Alberto Contador]], [[Santiago Botero]], [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]], [[Nairo Quintana]] (cycling), [[Roberto de Vicenzo]], [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera]], [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]], [[Severiano Ballesteros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal]] (golf), [[Luciana Aymar]] (field hockey), [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Marcelo R\u00edos]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]] (tennis).\n\nNotable Hispanic sports television networks are [[ESPN Latin America]], [[Fox Sports Latin America]] and [[TyC Sports]].\n\n===Religion===\nThe Spaniards and the Portuguese took the [[Roman Catholic]] faith to Ibero-America and the Philippines, and Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics. A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination.\n{{Unbalanced section|date=December 2009}}\nThere are also Spanish-speaking [[Jew]]s, most of whom are the descendants of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who migrated from Europe (German Jews, Russian Jews, Polish Jews, etc.) to Hispanic America, particularly [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Cuba]] (Argentina is host to the third largest Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States and Canada)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/JPPI_2014-2015_Annual_Assessment-English.pdf |title=Annual Assessment: The Situation and Dynamics of the Jewish People |year=2015 |page=18 |work=The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |title=Global Jewish Populations |work=United Jewish Federations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531003148/http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |archivedate=2008-05-31 }}</ref> in the 19th century and following World War II. Many Spanish-speaking Jews also originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of [[anusim]] \u2014 those whose Spanish [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] ancestors long ago hid their Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and Ibero-America. The Spanish Inquisition led to many forced conversions of Spanish Jews.\n\nGenetic studies on the (male) [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] conducted by the [[University of Leeds]] in 2008 appear to support the idea that the number of forced conversions have been previously underestimated significantly. They found that twenty percent of Spanish males have Y-chromosomes associated with Sephardic Jewish ancestry.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Gene Test Shows Spain's Jewish and Muslim Mix |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 December 2008 |page=A12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/science/05genes.html |url-access=subscription }}</ref> This may imply that there were more forced conversions than was previously thought.\n\nThere are also thought to be many Catholic-professing descendants of [[marrano]]s and Spanish-speaking [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] and scattered through Hispanic America. Additionally, there are Sephardic Jews who are descendants of those Jews who fled Spain to Turkey, [[Syria]], and North Africa, some of whom have now migrated to Hispanic America, holding on to some Spanish/Sephardic customs, such as the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, which mixes Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and others, though written with Hebrew and Latin characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Ladino |title=Ladino |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Slavery|Ladinos]] were also African slaves captive in Spain held prior to the colonial period in the Americas. (See also [[History of the Jews in Latin America|History of the Jews in Hispanic America]] and [[List of Latin American Jews|List of Hispanic American Jews]].)\n\nAmong the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most communities celebrate their homeland's [[patron saint]], dedicating a day for this purpose with festivals and religious services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs.

Hispanization of a person might be illustrated by speaking Spanish, making and eating Hispanic American food, listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Hispanics into theirs.\n\nOne reason that some people believe the assimilation of Hispanics in the U.S. is not comparable to that of other cultural groups is that [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have been living in parts of North America for centuries, in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant. For example, [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]] (1598), [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]] and [[Puerto Rico]] have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. existed. (The language of the Native Americans existed before this, until the invasion and forced assimilation by the Spanish.) These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], and later [[Mexico]] (with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848(Puerto Rico was in 1898). Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior to the creation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. For example, San Miguel de Gualdape, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida]] were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] was founded in 1604, and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] was established in 1660. [[El Paso]] was founded in 1659, [[San Antonio]] in 1691, [[Laredo, Texas]] in 1755, [[San Diego]] in 1769, [[San Francisco]] in 1776, [[San Jose, California]] in 1777, [[New Iberia, Louisiana]] in 1779, and [[Los Angeles]] in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and [[Spanish language]] well before the United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nLanguage retention is a common index to assimilation; according to the 2000 census, about 75% of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home. Spanish language retention rates vary geographically; parts of Texas and New Mexico have language retention rates over 90%, whereas in parts of Colorado and California, retention rates are lower than 30%. The degree of retention of Spanish as the native language is based on recent arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken. As is true of other immigrants, those who were born in other countries still speak their native language. Later generations are increasingly less likely to speak the language spoken in the country of their ancestors, as is true of other immigrant groups.\n\n==Spanish-speaking countries and regions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" line-height=\"0.87em\"\n|-valign=\"top\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:#FFFF00;\"\n| align=\"center\" |'''[[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]]'''\n|-\n|[[File:Map of the spanish language uses.png|320x220px|Map showing usage of the Spanish language]]\n|-\n|{{legend|Red|<small>''Spanish identified as sole official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#000080|<small>''Spanish identified as co-official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#00ff55|<small>''Former Spanish co-official, now identified as auxiliary <br>language''</small>}}\n|}\n\n{{See also|Hispanophone|Hispanic America|List of countries where Spanish is an official language}}\nToday, Spanish is among the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most commonly spoken first languages]] of the world.

For instance, the music from Spain is a lot different from the [[Hispanic America]]n, although there is a high grade of exchange between both continents. In addition, due to the high national development of the diverse [[nationalities and regions of Spain]], there is a lot of music in the [[Languages of Spain|different languages of the Peninsula]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]], mainly). See, for instance, [[Music of Catalonia]] or [[Rock catal\u00e0]], [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]], and [[Basque music]]. [[Flamenco]] is also a very popular music style in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]]. Spanish ballads \"romances\" can be traced in Argentina as \"milongas\", same structure but different scenarios.\n\nOn the other side of the ocean, Hispanic America is also home to a wide variety of music, even though \"Latin\" music is often erroneously thought of, as a single genre. Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex polyrhythms of African origin. [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]] shows combined influences of mostly European and Native American origin, while traditional Northern Mexican music \u2014 [[norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]] and [[banda music|banda]] \u2014  [[polka]], has influence from polka music brought by [[Central Europe]]an settlers to [[Mexico]] which later influenced western music.  The music of Hispanic Americans \u2014 such as [[tejano music]] \u2014 has influences in [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Latin pop|pop]], and [[country music]] as well as traditional Mexican music such as [[Mariachi]]. Meanwhile, native [[Andes|Andean]] sounds and melodies are the backbone of Peruvian and Bolivian music, but also play a significant role in the popular music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia, and again in Chile where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed [[nueva canci\u00f3n]]. In U.S. communities of immigrants from these countries it is common to hear these styles. [[Latin pop]], [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol]], [[Hip-hop|Latin hip-hop]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]], [[Cumbia]] and [[Reggaeton]] styles tend to appeal to the broader Hispanic population, and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many Hispanics of all backgrounds.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Hispanic literature}}\n\n[[File:Medal of the Miguel de Cervantes Prize.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], most prestigious literary award in the Spanish language]]\n\nSpanish-language literature and folklore is very rich and is influenced by a variety of countries. There are thousands of writers from many places, and dating from the Middle Ages to the present. Some of the most recognized writers are [[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]] (Spain), [[Lope de Vega]] (Spain), [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] (Spain), [[Jose Rizal]] (Philippines), [[Carlos Fuentes]] (Mexico), [[Octavio Paz]] (Mexico), [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]] (Guatemala), [[George Santayana]] (US), [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] (Cuba), [[Sabine Ulibarri]] (US), [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] (Spain), [[Miguel de Unamuno]] (Spain), [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (Colombia), [[Rafael Pombo]] (Colombia), [[Horacio Quiroga]] (Uruguay), [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]] (Venezuela), [[Luis Rodriguez Varela]] (Philippines), [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] (Nicaragua), [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peru), [[Giannina Braschi]] (Puerto Rico), [[Cristina Peri Rossi]] (Uruguay), [[Luisa Valenzuela]] (Argentina), [[Roberto Quesada]] (Honduras), [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] (Argentina), [[Pablo Neruda]] (Chile), [[Gabriela Mistral]] (Chile), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (Argentina), [[Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a]] (Dominican Republic), [[Ernesto Sabato]] (Argentina), [[Juan Tom\u00e1s \u00c1vila Laurel]] (Equatorial Guinea), [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]] (Peru), [[Joaquin Garcia Monge]] (Costa Rica), and [[Jesus Balmori]] (Philippines).\n\n===Sports===\nIn the majority of the Hispanic countries, [[association football]] is the most popular sport. The men's national teams of Argentina, Uruguay and Spain have won the [[FIFA World Cup]] a total five times. The Spanish [[La Liga]] is one of the most popular in the world, known for [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid]]. Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] and [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] are two of the strongest leagues in the Americas.\n\nHowever, [[baseball]] is the most popular sport in some Central American and Caribbean countries (especially Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela), as well as in the diaspora in the United States. Notable Hispanic teams in early baseball are the [[All Cubans]], [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]] and [[New York Cubans]]. The [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] recognizes Hispanic baseball personalities. Nearly 30 percent (22 percent foreign-born Latinos) of [[MLB]] players today have Hispanic heritage.\n\nSeveral Hispanic sportspeople have been successful worldwide, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Alfredo di Stefano]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] (association football), [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Fernando Alonso]], [[Marc Gen\u00e9]], [[Carlos Sainz]] (auto racing), [[\u00c1ngel Nieto]], [[Dani Pedrosa]], [[Jorge Lorenzo]], [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]], [[Marc Coma]], [[Nani Roma]] (motorcycle racing), [[Emanuel Gin\u00f3bili]], [[Pau Gasol]], [[Marc Gasol]] (basketball), [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]] (boxing), [[Miguel Indurain]], [[Alberto Contador]], [[Santiago Botero]], [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]], [[Nairo Quintana]] (cycling), [[Roberto de Vicenzo]], [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera]], [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]], [[Severiano Ballesteros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal]] (golf), [[Luciana Aymar]] (field hockey), [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Marcelo R\u00edos]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]] (tennis).\n\nNotable Hispanic sports television networks are [[ESPN Latin America]], [[Fox Sports Latin America]] and [[TyC Sports]].\n\n===Religion===\nThe Spaniards and the Portuguese took the [[Roman Catholic]] faith to Ibero-America and the Philippines, and Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics. A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination.\n{{Unbalanced section|date=December 2009}}\nThere are also Spanish-speaking [[Jew]]s, most of whom are the descendants of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who migrated from Europe (German Jews, Russian Jews, Polish Jews, etc.) to Hispanic America, particularly [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Cuba]] (Argentina is host to the third largest Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States and Canada)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/JPPI_2014-2015_Annual_Assessment-English.pdf |title=Annual Assessment: The Situation and Dynamics of the Jewish People |year=2015 |page=18 |work=The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |title=Global Jewish Populations |work=United Jewish Federations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531003148/http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |archivedate=2008-05-31 }}</ref> in the 19th century and following World War II. Many Spanish-speaking Jews also originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of [[anusim]] \u2014 those whose Spanish [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] ancestors long ago hid their Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and Ibero-America. The Spanish Inquisition led to many forced conversions of Spanish Jews.\n\nGenetic studies on the (male) [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] conducted by the [[University of Leeds]] in 2008 appear to support the idea that the number of forced conversions have been previously underestimated significantly. They found that twenty percent of Spanish males have Y-chromosomes associated with Sephardic Jewish ancestry.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Gene Test Shows Spain's Jewish and Muslim Mix |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 December 2008 |page=A12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/science/05genes.html |url-access=subscription }}</ref> This may imply that there were more forced conversions than was previously thought.\n\nThere are also thought to be many Catholic-professing descendants of [[marrano]]s and Spanish-speaking [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] and scattered through Hispanic America. Additionally, there are Sephardic Jews who are descendants of those Jews who fled Spain to Turkey, [[Syria]], and North Africa, some of whom have now migrated to Hispanic America, holding on to some Spanish/Sephardic customs, such as the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, which mixes Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and others, though written with Hebrew and Latin characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Ladino |title=Ladino |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Slavery|Ladinos]] were also African slaves captive in Spain held prior to the colonial period in the Americas. (See also [[History of the Jews in Latin America|History of the Jews in Hispanic America]] and [[List of Latin American Jews|List of Hispanic American Jews]].)\n\nAmong the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most communities celebrate their homeland's [[patron saint]], dedicating a day for this purpose with festivals and religious services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs. Such is the case of [[Santer\u00eda]], popular with [[Afro-Cuban]]s, which combines old African beliefs in the form of Roman Catholic saints and rituals. Other syncretistic beliefs include [[Spiritism]] and [[Curandero|Curanderismo]].\n\nWhile a tiny minority, there are some Muslims in Latin America, in the US, and in the Philippines. Those in the Philippines live predominantly in the province forming the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]].\n\nIn the United States, some 65% of Hispanics and Latinos report themselves Catholic and 21% Protestant, with 13% having no affiliation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |title=Hispanic Churches in American Public Life: Summary of Findings |accessdate=27 December 2006 |date=January 2003 |last1=Espinosa |first1=Gast\u00f3n |last2=Elizondo |first2=Virgilio |last3=Miranda |first3=Jesse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101044854/http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2006}}</ref> A minority among the Roman Catholics, about one in five, are [[charismatic Christianity|charismatics]].
