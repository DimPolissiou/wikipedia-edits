After the [[Introduction (music)|intro]] plays, the two hosts would introduce themselves to a studio audience and explain a possible situation, with the following sketch having a similar situation. The show then follows this pattern, with a number of sketches, each varying in time. Not all the segments are introduced by a studio segment.\n\nIn the last two seasons, the show eschewed a studio audience in favor of a pre-shot narrative, featuring the duo discussing a concept during a car ride, as the introduction to their sketches.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was first announced in June 2011 by [[Comedy Central]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /> In anticipation of the show, Key and Peele launched a [[web series]] in support of the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/key-peele-launch-obama-anger-translator |title=Key & Peele Launch Obama Anger Translator |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118185544/http://www.movieweb.com/news/key-peele-launch-obama-anger-translator |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The series premiered in January 2012 on Comedy Central in the U.S. and on [[The Comedy Network]] in Canada.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/key-and-peele/index.jhtml|title=Key & Peele|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=February 24, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226081102/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/key-and-peele/index.jhtml|archivedate=February 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecomedynetwork.ca/Shows/KeyPeele|title=The Comedy Network Shows \u2013 Watch Full Episodes &#124;

One sketch reveals that Obama's wife and daughters each have their own anger translators as well, whom they request help from to speak with each other. Key appeared briefly in-character as Luther at the Annual White House Correspondents Dinner as an anger translator for the real Barack Obama in early 2015. On January 5, 2017, Key debuted an \"Obama-Luther\" sketch on ''[[The Daily Show]] with Trevor Noah''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-daily-show-key-peele-obama-anger-20170106-htmlstory.html|title=Key & Peele bring back Obama's anger translator, roast Trump on 'The Daily Show'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2017-01-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124225906/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-daily-show-key-peele-obama-anger-20170106-htmlstory.html|archivedate=January 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Wendell Sanders''' \u2013 Played by Peele, Wendell is a nerdy, extremely overweight, friendless man who loves sci-fi and fantasy. He often comes up with elaborate stories to convince others (especially over the phone) that he is not a stereotypical nerd, and that he is calling on the behalf of people other than himself. This includes a very attractive woman named \"Claire\", with whom he claims to have a relationship, and the 15-year-old son named \"Stimpy\" they have. (He was put on the spot when questioned about his nonexistent son, and he was close to a plush doll of the character from ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.) Though his stories are obvious lies, they are elaborate enough that he usually manages to convince the person on the other end of the phone line (usually a gullible man played by Key) that the people in his stories exist. When asked to speak with his fabricated friends and family, Wendell makes up an abrupt event on the spot (usually involving the fabricated person in question being killed) to prevent the person he is talking to from piecing together that his stories are lies, and to end the conversation.\n* '''Mr. Garvey''' \u2013 Played by Key, Mr. Garvey is an angry and intimidating substitute teacher and 20-year veteran of urban education. He distrusts (he refuses to allow students to leave for club photos, as he believes that it is a made-up excuse to leave class, even after a schoolwide announcement over the intercom, which he also believes to be fake) and has trouble pronouncing the common names of his mild-mannered and generally white suburban students, though he vehemently believes his pronunciations are correct, such as pronouncing the name Jacqueline as \"Jay-Quill-Inn\" or Blake as \"Balakay\" or Denise as \"Dee-Nice\" and his most known Aaron as \"A. A. Ron\". Any corrections from the students are seen as highly disrespectful lies meant to make him look foolish. Mr. Garvey forces his students to acknowledge themselves by his incorrect pronunciations, often at the very real threat of being sent to Principal O'Shaughnessy (pronounced \"O-Shag-Hennessy\" by Garvey) for disrespect. The only student Mr. Garvey seems to trust is an African American boy at the back of the class named Timothy (accent on the \"o\") (played by Peele), who is implied to be from the inner city and claims to have a daughter. In March 2015, it was announced that Key will reprise the role of Mr. Garvey in a feature-length film ''Substitute Teacher'' with Jordan portraying a rival teacher.<ref name=\"GarveyFilm\"/>\n* '''{{visible anchor|Meegan}}''' \u2013 Played by Peele, Meegan is a young woman angry at her boyfriend, Andr\u00e9, who always pursues her from a club, but she won't let him near enough to make up. The distance they cover in their pursuit becomes extreme. Meegan is shown to be extremely selfish and unintelligent, and does not seem to acknowledge social norms. She herself rarely ever receives any sort of comeuppance for the flagrant disrespect she shows to others. When not with Andr\u00e9, Meegan is often seen with another woman who acts exactly like her (played by Key), and they often gossip between one other about being shocked by people doing normal acts, and calling them \"crazy\". They also take many [[selfie]]s of themselves, but delete the majority of them because they don't like how they look in them, including a picture that had already just been classified as evidence in a crime that they witnessed.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Andr\u00e9}}''' \u2013 Played by Key, Andr\u00e9 is Meegan's equally loud, but far more intelligent and polite boyfriend who tends to take the fall for the conflicts she starts with others.\n* '''DeVon''' \u2013 Played by Key, DeVon is the shady and weird landlord who's often suspicious of what goes on in his tenants' apartments,\n* '''Rafi Benitez''' \u2013 Played by Peele, Rafi is a baseball player who makes all his teammates uncomfortable in the locker room, because of his \"slap-ass\" addiction.\n* '''Brock Favors''' \u2013 Played by Key, Brock Favors is a news reporter who's always ill-prepared for his assignments such as helicopter traffic reports and reporting on police dog training. He always responds to unexpected and sudden events with loud, excited swearing.\n* '''Col. Hans Muller''' \u2013 A [[Nazi]] [[colonel]] who is ignorant to the truth. He uses \"very scientific\" methods to find black people (offering them [[beets]], measuring their heads, jingling cat toys). He is played by recurring guest star [[Ty Burrell]].\n* '''Levi and Cedric''' \u2013 Two inner-city friends who often get in rifts because of Levi (Peele) constantly joining new trends such as going [[steam-punk]] or getting his own ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. Most sketches end with Cedric (Key) getting fed up with Levi and calling off their friendship.\n* '''Carlito''' \u2013 Played by Peele, Carlito is a Mexican gangster who believes that very normal or minor acts (including sitting in chairs) are \"for pussies\", and believes himself to be above doing such acts. He believes himself to be \"the crazy one\" of the gang, which he will go to embarrassing lengths to prove.\n* '''The Valets''' \u2013 Two valets from the Berkshire Restaurant (who always use unnecessary plurals in names of people, places, or things) who love discussing their favorite movie stars and characters \u2013 despite mangling their names and films \u2013 such as \"[[Liam Neeson]]s\" from ''[[Taken (film)|Tooken]]'', \"[[Peter Dinklage|Peter Dinkels]]\" (who plays \"[[Tyrion Lannister|Taiwan Lannister]]\"), \"[[Bruce Willis|Bruce Willies]],\" \"[[Michelle Pfeiffer|Michelle Pa-feiffer]]s,\" \"[[Timothy Olyphant|Timothy Elephants]]\" and \"[[Mel Gibson|Racist-Ass Melly Gibsons]]\". They end the sketch by saying that something related to the star in question is \"MY SHIT!\", then disappearing, by ways such as flying into the air like a rocket or exploding. In February 2014, a sponsored sketch with the valets titled \"What About ''Non-Stop''?\" \u2013 in which \"Liam Neesons\" himself shows up to collect his car \u2013 was used to promote the film ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Castillo|first1=Michelle|title=Key & Peele Look Back on What Made Their 'Liam Neesons' Spot a Promoted Clip Worth Watching|url=http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/key-peele-still-pumped-about-liam-neesons-ad-159161/|accessdate=May 4, 2017|work=[[Adweek]]|date=July 28, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628232625/http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/key-peele-still-pumped-about-liam-neesons-ad-159161/|archivedate=June 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The 7 Most Essential Key & Peele Sketches|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/key-peele-best-sketches/|accessdate=May 4, 2017|work=TVGuide.com|date=February 10, 2015|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316043337/http://www.tvguide.com/news/key-peele-best-sketches/|archivedate=March 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Key and Peele also appeared in a parody of \"The Valets\" in one of the teaser trailers for ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355 | title = Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip | first= Dan | last = Neilan | date = November 13, 2018 | accessdate = November 13, 2018 | work = [[The A.V.

Though they claim to dislike homosexuals, they often act in a vaguely exaggerated homosexual manner.\n* '''LaShawn and Samuel''' \u2013 A gay couple with very differing personalities and views on marriage. Samuel (Key) is very intelligent and well-mannered and exercises restraint when making important decisions. LaShawn (Peele) is very loud and extremely flamboyant and is constantly thinking up often nonsensical and impossible ideas for their future.\n* '''East/West Bowl Football Players''' \u2013 A series of [[college football]] players (most of them played by Key and Peele) whose names become increasingly ridiculous as the list progresses, such as \"Donkey Teeth\", \"Hingle McCringleberry\", \"Huka'lakanaka Hakanakaheekalucka'hukahakafaka\" and \"Squeeeeeeeps\". The West Team also features players from non-university organizations (such as \"Nevada State &ndash; Penitentiary\" and \"Army &ndash; Navy Surplus Store\"); the last player for the West Team is always a white player not played by Key nor Peele. In the third edition of this sketch, the fictional athletes were joined by actual players with unusual names (such as [[Ha Ha Clinton-Dix]] and [[Ishmaa'ily Kitchen]]); the last player for the West team was played by [[Aaron Rodgers|\"A.A. Ron Rodgers\"]], in reference to the Mr. Garvey sketches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/super-bowl-2015-patriots-seahawks-key-and-peele-east-west-bowl-012815 |work=[[FOX Sports]] |date=January 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |title='Key and Peele' gives us 'East/West Bowl' sketch with NFL players |last=Saraf |first=Sid |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525035652/http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/super-bowl-2015-patriots-seahawks-key-and-peele-east-west-bowl-012815 |archivedate=May 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* '''Metta World News''' \u2013 NBA player [[Metta World Peace]] delivers the \"news,\" which usually takes the form of presenting bizarre hypothetical scenarios to the audience and his imagined approach to them. This is the only recurring sketch that stars neither Key nor Peele.\n* '''The Black Republicans''' \u2013 A group of outside-of-the-box thinking black men (one member is played by recurring guest star [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]]) who try to convert other black voters to join the Republican party. They are all shown to be similarly dressed in outdated fashion styles such as leather jackets, braided belts, [[mom jeans|dad jeans]], and wire-rimmed glasses. Their catchphrase is \"I am pissed, ROYALLY pissed!\"\n*'''Joseph''' \u2013 Played by Key, Joseph is a crude con man who attempts to deceive others into helping him financially by making up facetious hardships. He is misunderstood.\n*'''Dr. Rajeev Gupta''' \u2013 Played by Key, Dr. Gupta is an Indian-American doctor who works at a large hospital.\n*'''The Continental''' \u2013 Played by Peele, a strange, eccentric man who opulently and hedonistically indulges in his hotel's free continental breakfast, and it is implied (in a reference to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') that he supernaturally inhabits the hotel.\n*'''Rhinos''' - The name of sports teams of varying sport, often bearing unusually odd-acting team members. Rafi is a member of the [[baseball]] team Rhinos.\n*'''Power Falcons''' - Often portrayed as a rival to the Rhinos. The Power Falcons is also the name of a fictional team of superheroes in an implied reference to [[Power Rangers]], two members of which are played by Key and Peele.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical===\n[[Image:Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele 2014.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Key (left) and Peele (right) attending the Peabody Awards in 2014]]\nThe first two seasons of ''Key & Peele'' received positive reviews, maintaining a score 74 of 100 by the review aggregator site [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-1/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Key & Peele Season 1 at Metacritic |website=Metacritic |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211103940/http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-1/critic-reviews |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The third season of ''Key & Peele'' received critical acclaim, receiving a score of 82 on Metacritic.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-3 \"Key & Peele : Season 3\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206132918/http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-3 |date=December 6, 2013 }}.

He often comes up with elaborate stories to convince others (especially over the phone) that he is not a stereotypical nerd, and that he is calling on the behalf of people other than himself. This includes a very attractive woman named \"Claire\", with whom he claims to have a relationship, and the 15-year-old son named \"Stimpy\" they have. (He was put on the spot when questioned about his nonexistent son, and he was close to a plush doll of the character from ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.) Though his stories are obvious lies, they are elaborate enough that he usually manages to convince the person on the other end of the phone line (usually a gullible man played by Key) that the people in his stories exist. When asked to speak with his fabricated friends and family, Wendell makes up an abrupt event on the spot (usually involving the fabricated person in question being killed) to prevent the person he is talking to from piecing together that his stories are lies, and to end the conversation.\n* '''Mr. Garvey''' \u2013 Played by Key, Mr. Garvey is an angry and intimidating substitute teacher and 20-year veteran of urban education. He distrusts (he refuses to allow students to leave for club photos, as he believes that it is a made-up excuse to leave class, even after a schoolwide announcement over the intercom, which he also believes to be fake) and has trouble pronouncing the common names of his mild-mannered and generally white suburban students, though he vehemently believes his pronunciations are correct, such as pronouncing the name Jacqueline as \"Jay-Quill-Inn\" or Blake as \"Balakay\" or Denise as \"Dee-Nice\" and his most known Aaron as \"A. A. Ron\". Any corrections from the students are seen as highly disrespectful lies meant to make him look foolish. Mr. Garvey forces his students to acknowledge themselves by his incorrect pronunciations, often at the very real threat of being sent to Principal O'Shaughnessy (pronounced \"O-Shag-Hennessy\" by Garvey) for disrespect. The only student Mr. Garvey seems to trust is an African American boy at the back of the class named Timothy (accent on the \"o\") (played by Peele), who is implied to be from the inner city and claims to have a daughter. In March 2015, it was announced that Key will reprise the role of Mr. Garvey in a feature-length film ''Substitute Teacher'' with Jordan portraying a rival teacher.<ref name=\"GarveyFilm\"/>\n* '''{{visible anchor|Meegan}}''' \u2013 Played by Peele, Meegan is a young woman angry at her boyfriend, Andr\u00e9, who always pursues her from a club, but she won't let him near enough to make up. The distance they cover in their pursuit becomes extreme. Meegan is shown to be extremely selfish and unintelligent, and does not seem to acknowledge social norms. She herself rarely ever receives any sort of comeuppance for the flagrant disrespect she shows to others. When not with Andr\u00e9, Meegan is often seen with another woman who acts exactly like her (played by Key), and they often gossip between one other about being shocked by people doing normal acts, and calling them \"crazy\". They also take many [[selfie]]s of themselves, but delete the majority of them because they don't like how they look in them, including a picture that had already just been classified as evidence in a crime that they witnessed.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Andr\u00e9}}''' \u2013 Played by Key, Andr\u00e9 is Meegan's equally loud, but far more intelligent and polite boyfriend who tends to take the fall for the conflicts she starts with others.\n* '''DeVon''' \u2013 Played by Key, DeVon is the shady and weird landlord who's often suspicious of what goes on in his tenants' apartments,\n* '''Rafi Benitez''' \u2013 Played by Peele, Rafi is a baseball player who makes all his teammates uncomfortable in the locker room, because of his \"slap-ass\" addiction.\n* '''Brock Favors''' \u2013 Played by Key, Brock Favors is a news reporter who's always ill-prepared for his assignments such as helicopter traffic reports and reporting on police dog training. He always responds to unexpected and sudden events with loud, excited swearing.\n* '''Col. Hans Muller''' \u2013 A [[Nazi]] [[colonel]] who is ignorant to the truth. He uses \"very scientific\" methods to find black people (offering them [[beets]], measuring their heads, jingling cat toys). He is played by recurring guest star [[Ty Burrell]].\n* '''Levi and Cedric''' \u2013 Two inner-city friends who often get in rifts because of Levi (Peele) constantly joining new trends such as going [[steam-punk]] or getting his own ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. Most sketches end with Cedric (Key) getting fed up with Levi and calling off their friendship.\n* '''Carlito''' \u2013 Played by Peele, Carlito is a Mexican gangster who believes that very normal or minor acts (including sitting in chairs) are \"for pussies\", and believes himself to be above doing such acts. He believes himself to be \"the crazy one\" of the gang, which he will go to embarrassing lengths to prove.\n* '''The Valets''' \u2013 Two valets from the Berkshire Restaurant (who always use unnecessary plurals in names of people, places, or things) who love discussing their favorite movie stars and characters \u2013 despite mangling their names and films \u2013 such as \"[[Liam Neeson]]s\" from ''[[Taken (film)|Tooken]]'', \"[[Peter Dinklage|Peter Dinkels]]\" (who plays \"[[Tyrion Lannister|Taiwan Lannister]]\"), \"[[Bruce Willis|Bruce Willies]],\" \"[[Michelle Pfeiffer|Michelle Pa-feiffer]]s,\" \"[[Timothy Olyphant|Timothy Elephants]]\" and \"[[Mel Gibson|Racist-Ass Melly Gibsons]]\". They end the sketch by saying that something related to the star in question is \"MY SHIT!\", then disappearing, by ways such as flying into the air like a rocket or exploding. In February 2014, a sponsored sketch with the valets titled \"What About ''Non-Stop''?\" \u2013 in which \"Liam Neesons\" himself shows up to collect his car \u2013 was used to promote the film ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Castillo|first1=Michelle|title=Key & Peele Look Back on What Made Their 'Liam Neesons' Spot a Promoted Clip Worth Watching|url=http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/key-peele-still-pumped-about-liam-neesons-ad-159161/|accessdate=May 4, 2017|work=[[Adweek]]|date=July 28, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628232625/http://www.adweek.com/tv-video/key-peele-still-pumped-about-liam-neesons-ad-159161/|archivedate=June 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The 7 Most Essential Key & Peele Sketches|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/key-peele-best-sketches/|accessdate=May 4, 2017|work=TVGuide.com|date=February 10, 2015|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316043337/http://www.tvguide.com/news/key-peele-best-sketches/|archivedate=March 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Key and Peele also appeared in a parody of \"The Valets\" in one of the teaser trailers for ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355 | title = Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip | first= Dan | last = Neilan | date = November 13, 2018 | accessdate = November 13, 2018 | work = [[The A.V.

Though they claim to dislike homosexuals, they often act in a vaguely exaggerated homosexual manner.\n* '''LaShawn and Samuel''' \u2013 A gay couple with very differing personalities and views on marriage. Samuel (Key) is very intelligent and well-mannered and exercises restraint when making important decisions. LaShawn (Peele) is very loud and extremely flamboyant and is constantly thinking up often nonsensical and impossible ideas for their future.\n* '''East/West Bowl Football Players''' \u2013 A series of [[college football]] players (most of them played by Key and Peele) whose names become increasingly ridiculous as the list progresses, such as \"Donkey Teeth\", \"Hingle McCringleberry\", \"Huka'lakanaka Hakanakaheekalucka'hukahakafaka\" and \"Squeeeeeeeps\". The West Team also features players from non-university organizations (such as \"Nevada State &ndash; Penitentiary\" and \"Army &ndash; Navy Surplus Store\"); the last player for the West Team is always a white player not played by Key nor Peele. In the third edition of this sketch, the fictional athletes were joined by actual players with unusual names (such as [[Ha Ha Clinton-Dix]] and [[Ishmaa'ily Kitchen]]); the last player for the West team was played by [[Aaron Rodgers|\"A.A. Ron Rodgers\"]], in reference to the Mr. Garvey sketches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/super-bowl-2015-patriots-seahawks-key-and-peele-east-west-bowl-012815 |work=[[FOX Sports]] |date=January 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |title='Key and Peele' gives us 'East/West Bowl' sketch with NFL players |last=Saraf |first=Sid |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525035652/http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/super-bowl-2015-patriots-seahawks-key-and-peele-east-west-bowl-012815 |archivedate=May 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* '''Metta World News''' \u2013 NBA player [[Metta World Peace]] delivers the \"news,\" which usually takes the form of presenting bizarre hypothetical scenarios to the audience and his imagined approach to them. This is the only recurring sketch that stars neither Key nor Peele.\n* '''The Black Republicans''' \u2013 A group of outside-of-the-box thinking black men (one member is played by recurring guest star [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]]) who try to convert other black voters to join the Republican party. They are all shown to be similarly dressed in outdated fashion styles such as leather jackets, braided belts, [[mom jeans|dad jeans]], and wire-rimmed glasses. Their catchphrase is \"I am pissed, ROYALLY pissed!\"\n*'''Joseph''' \u2013 Played by Key, Joseph is a crude con man who attempts to deceive others into helping him financially by making up facetious hardships. He is misunderstood.\n*'''Dr. Rajeev Gupta''' \u2013 Played by Key, Dr. Gupta is an Indian-American doctor who works at a large hospital.\n*'''The Continental''' \u2013 Played by Peele, a strange, eccentric man who opulently and hedonistically indulges in his hotel's free continental breakfast, and it is implied (in a reference to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') that he supernaturally inhabits the hotel.\n*'''Rhinos''' - The name of sports teams of varying sport, often bearing unusually odd-acting team members. Rafi is a member of the [[baseball]] team Rhinos.\n*'''Power Falcons''' - Often portrayed as a rival to the Rhinos. The Power Falcons is also the name of a fictional team of superheroes in an implied reference to [[Power Rangers]], two members of which are played by Key and Peele.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical===\n[[Image:Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele 2014.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Key (left) and Peele (right) attending the Peabody Awards in 2014]]\nThe first two seasons of ''Key & Peele'' received positive reviews, maintaining a score 74 of 100 by the review aggregator site [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-1/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Key & Peele Season 1 at Metacritic |website=Metacritic |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211103940/http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-1/critic-reviews |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The third season of ''Key & Peele'' received critical acclaim, receiving a score of 82 on Metacritic.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-3 \"Key & Peele : Season 3\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206132918/http://www.metacritic.com/tv/key-peele/season-3 |date=December 6, 2013 }}.

It was the first of three Pacific voyages of which Cook was the commander. The aims of this first expedition were to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun (3\u20134 of June  that year), and to seek evidence of the postulated ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'' or \"undiscovered southern land\".\n\nThe history of Australia began with a captain named Captain Tom Jos who sailed the sea and found Australia. Tom's first voyage, Jos was a combined expedition of the Royal Navy and the Royal Society to the South Pacific Ocean aboard the HMS Endeavor, from 1768 to 1771. It was the first of three voyages to the Pacific of which Jos was the commander. Captain Tom Jos crashed HMS Charolette against a rock face and killed 400 people on board.\n\n\nThe voyage was commissioned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and commanded by Lieutenant [[James Cook]], a junior naval officer with good skills in [[cartography]] and mathematics. Departing from [[Plymouth Dockyard]] in August 1768, the expedition crossed the Atlantic, rounded [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the transit of Venus. Cook then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of [[Huahine]], [[Borabora]] and [[Raiatea]] to claim them for Great Britain,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and unsuccessfully attempting to land at [[Rurutu (Austral Islands)|Rurutu]]. In September 1769 the expedition reached [[New Zealand]], being the second Europeans to visit there, following the first European discovery by [[Abel Tasman]] 127 years earlier. Cook and his crew spent the following six months charting the New Zealand coast, before resuming their voyage westward across open sea. In April 1770 they became the first known Europeans to reach the east coast of [[Australia]], making landfall near present-day [[Point Hicks]], and then proceeding north to [[Botany Bay]].\n\nThe expedition continued northward along the Australian coastline, narrowly avoiding shipwreck on the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. In October 1770 the badly damaged ''Endeavour'' came into the port of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. They resumed their journey on 26 December, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] on 12 July. The voyage lasted almost three years.\n\nThe year following his return Cook set out on a [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] of the Pacific, which lasted from 1772 to 1775. His [[Third voyage of James Cook|third and final voyage]] lasted from 1776 to 1779.\n\n==Conception==\nOn 16 February 1768 the [[Royal Society]] petitioned [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun to enable the measurement of the distance from the Earth to the Sun.<ref>{{harvnb|Rigby|van der Merwe|2002|p=24}}</ref> Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the [[Admiralty]] elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or \"unknown southern land\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30&nbsp;July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721065703/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |archivedate=21 July 2008  }}</ref> The aims of the expedition were revealed in the press: \"To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano [sic], with Mr. Green, the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt.

The primary purpose of the observation was to obtain measurements that could be used to calculate more accurately the distance of [[Venus]] from the Sun. If this could be achieved, then the distances of the other planets could be worked out, based on their orbits. On the day of the transit observation, Cook recorded:\n\n<blockquote>Saturday {{not a typo|3<sup>rd</sup>}} This day prov'd as favourable to our purpose as we could wish, not a Clowd was to be seen the Whole day and the Air was perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in Observing the whole of the passage of the Planet Venus over the Suns disk: we very distinctly saw an Atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the Planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones.

Their instrumentation was adequate by the standards of the time, but the resolution still could not eliminate the errors. When their results were later compared to those of the other observations of the same event made elsewhere for the exercise, the net result was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped.

Furthermore, Cook did not adjust his nautical date to account for circumnavigation of the globe until he had travelled a full 360\u00b0 relative to the [[longitude]] of his home British port, either toward the east or west. Because he travelled west on his first voyage, this a.m. nautical date was the morning of a civil date 14 hours slow relative to his home port (port\u221214h). Because the south-east coast of Australia is now regarded as being 10 hours ahead relative to Britain, that date is now called Friday, 20 April.<ref>Arthur R. Hinks, \"Nautical time and civil date\", ''The Geographical Journal'', '''86''' (1935) 153\u2013157.</ref>\n\nThe landmark of this sighting is generally reckoned to be a point lying about half-way between the present-day towns of [[Orbost, Victoria|Orbost]] and [[Mallacoota, Victoria|Mallacoota]] on the south-eastern coast of the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. A survey done in 1843 ignored or overlooked Cook's earlier naming of the point, giving it the name Cape Everard. On the 200th anniversary of the sighting, the name was officially changed back to Point Hicks.\n\n===Botany Bay===\n[[File:Emanuel Phillips Fox Captain Cook Botany Bay.jpg|thumb|left|[[E. Phillips Fox]], ''Landing of Captain Cook at Botany Bay, 1770'', 1902]]\n''Endeavour'' continued northwards along the coastline, keeping the land in sight with Cook charting and naming landmarks as he went. A little over a week later, they came across an extensive but shallow inlet, and upon entering it moored off a low headland fronted by sand dunes. James Cook and crew made their first landing on the continent, at a place now known as [[Botany Bay]], on [[Silver Beach (Kurnell)|Kurnell Peninsula]] and made contact of a hostile nature with the [[Gweagal]] Aborigines, on 29 April.{{Ref|date|[b]}} At first Cook bestowed the name \"Sting-Ray Harbour\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url= http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700506.html |title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 6 May 1770 |accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> to the inlet after the many such creatures found there; this was later changed to \"Botanist Bay\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and finally ''[[Botany Bay]]'' after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists [[Joseph Banks]], [[Daniel Solander]] and [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]].\n\n[[File:Kurnell Cook Landing Plaque.JPG|thumb|upright|Captain Cook [[Kurnell, New South Wales|landing place plaque]]]]\nThis first landing site was later to be promoted (particularly by Joseph Banks) as a suitable candidate for situating a settlement and [[British colony|British colonial]] outpost. However, almost 18 years later, when Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] and the [[First Fleet]] arrived in early 1788 to establish an outpost and [[penal colony]], they found that the bay and surrounds did not live up to the promising picture that had been painted. Instead, Phillip gave orders to relocate to a harbour a few kilometres to the north, which Cook had named [[Port Jackson]] but had not further explored. It was in this harbour, at a place Phillip named [[Sydney Cove]], that the settlement of [[Sydney]] was established. The settlement was for some time afterwards still referred to generally as Botany Bay. The expedition's scientific members commenced the first European scientific documentation of [[Australian fauna]] and [[Australian flora|flora]].\n\nAt Cook's original landing contact was made with the local [[Australian Aboriginal]] inhabitants. As the ship sailed into the harbour, they noticed Aborigines on both of the headlands. At about 2 pm they put the anchor down near a group of six to eight huts. Two Aborigines, a younger and an older man, came down to the boat.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700429.html|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 29 April 1770|first=|last=|publisher=South Seas|website=southseas.nla.gov.au|accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref> They did not accept the offer of gifts from Cook, whose lack of knowledge of Aboriginal custom may have prevented him from behaving acceptably in such exchanges. A musket was fired over their heads, which wounded the older man slightly, and he ran towards the huts. He came back with other men and threw spears at Cook's men, although they did no harm. They were chased off after two more rounds were fired.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The adults had left, but Cook found several Aboriginal children in the huts, and left some beads with them as a gesture of friendship.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Port Jackson===\n\nOn 6 May 1770, the Endeavour left Botany Bay and sailed north past an inlet \"wherein there appeared to be safe anchorage\". Cook named it [[Port Jackson]], today generally known as Sydney Harbour.<ref>Beaglehole (1968), pp 312-13</ref> No-one on the ship recorded seeing any of the Harbour's many islands, because their line of sight was blocked by the high promontories of [[Sydney Heads|South Head]] and [[Bradleys Head]] that shape its dog-leg entrance. However, these islands were possibly known to [[Arthur Phillip|Captain Arthur Phillip]], the [[First Fleet]] commander, before he departed England in 1787.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillip|first1=Arthur|title=Comments on a draft of his instructions|date=11 April 1787|publisher=TNA CO 201/2, f.128-131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kangourou Sydney Parkinson.jpg|thumb|This kangaroo was seen at [[Endeavour River]] on 23 June 1770, painted by [[Sydney Parkinson]]]]\n===Seventeen Seventy===\nCook continued northwards, charting along the coastline. He stopped at Bustard Bay (now known as [[Seventeen Seventy, Queensland|Seventeen Seventy]]) at 8 o'clock on 23 May 1770 in 5 fathoms water on a sandy bottom at the South point of the Bay. Cook recounted that his clerk, Orton, had been molested while dead drunk that night, the perpetrators cutting off not only his clothes but also parts of his ears. Cook suspended and sent below the suspect Magra.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700522.html|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 22 May 1770|last=|first=|publisher =South Seas|website=southseas.nla.gov.au|accessdate=13 December 2017}}</ref> On 24 May Cook and Banks and others went ashore. He sounded the channel (now known as Round Hill Creek) and found a freshwater stream, noting there was room for a few ships to safely anchor. He noted a great deal of smoke on the hills and inspected one of the closest group of 10 fires around which were scattered cockle shells and other evidence of aboriginal occupation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Endeavour River===\n[[File:Captain Cook statue.jpg|thumb|Photo taken in Cooktown in 2007|thumb|left|[[Captain James Cook]] Commander, H.M.B. \"Endeavour\" which was beached and repaired near this site 17 June \u2013 4 August 1770]]\nA mishap occurred when ''Endeavour'' ran aground on a shoal of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], on 11 June 1770. The ship was seriously damaged and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach (near the docks of modern [[Cooktown]], at the mouth of the [[Endeavour River]]). While there, [[Joseph Banks]], [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]] and [[Daniel Solander]] made their first major collections of Australian flora. \n\nThe crew's encounters with the local Aboriginal people were mainly peaceable; from the group encountered here the name \"[[kangaroo]]\" entered the [[English language]], coming from the local [[Guugu Yimidhirr language|Guugu Yimidhirr]] word for a kind of [[Eastern grey kangaroo|grey kangaroo]], ''gangurru'' (pronounced {{IPA-aus|\u0261\u030aa\u014buru|}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Robson |2004|p=81}}</ref>\n\n===Possession Island===\nOnce repairs were completed, the voyage continued and at about midday on 22 August 1770, Cook reached the northernmost tip of the coast. Without leaving the ship, he named it Cape York and departed the east coast. Turning west, he nursed the battered ship through the dangerously shallow waters of [[Torres Strait]], earlier navigated by [[Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]] in 1606. Searching for a high vantage point, Cook saw a steep hill on a nearby island from the top of which he hoped to see \"a passage into the Indian Seas\". Cook named the island [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]], where he claimed the entire eastern coastline that he had just explored as British territory.<ref>Cook, James, Journal of the HMS Endeavour, 1768-1771, National Library of Australia, Manuscripts Collection, MS 1, 22 August 1770</ref>\n\nIn negotiating the [[Torres Strait]] past [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], Cook also put an end to the speculation that New Holland and [[New Guinea]] were part of the same land mass.<ref name=\"three\">G. Williams (2002){{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Scurvy prevention===\nAt that point in the voyage Cook had lost not a single man to [[scurvy]], a remarkable and practically unheard-of achievement in 18th-century long-distance seafaring. Adhering to Royal Navy policy introduced in 1747, <!-- Note. See our Scurvy article regarding this. --> Cook persuaded his men to eat foods such as [[citrus]] [[fruit]]s and [[sauerkraut]]. At that time it was known that poor diet caused scurvy but not specifically that a [[vitamin C]] deficiency was the culprit.\n\nSailors of the day were notoriously against innovation, and at first the men would not eat the sauerkraut. Cook used a \"method I never once knew to fail with seamen.\"<ref name=\"Beaglehole74\">{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1968|p=74}}</ref> He ordered it served to himself and the officers, and left an option for crew who wanted some. Within a week of seeing their superiors set a value on it the demand was so great a ration had to be instituted.<ref name=\"Beaglehole74\"/> In other cases, however, Cook resorted to traditional naval discipline. \"Punished Henry Stephens, Seaman, and Thomas Dunster, Marine, with twelve lashes each for refusing to take their allowance of fresh beef.\"<ref>Wilcox, Ten Who Dared at 97 (Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 1977).</ref>\n\nCook's general approach was essentially empirical, encouraging as broad a diet as circumstances permitted, and collecting such [[Tetragonia tetragonoides|greens]] as could be had when making landfall. All onboard ate the same food, with Cook specifically dividing equally anything that could be divided (and indeed recommending that practice to any commander \u2013 journal 4 August 1770).\n\nTwo cases of scurvy did occur on board, astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]] and a [[Tahiti]] navigator [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]] were treated, but Cook was able to proudly record that upon reaching [[Jakarta|Batavia]] he had \"not one man upon the sick list\" (journal 15 October 1770), unlike so many voyages that reached that port with much of the crew suffering illness.\n\n==Homeward voyage==\n[[File:Track of Endeavour.jpg|thumb|Route of ''Endeavour'' from the Torres Strait to Java, August and September 1770]]\n''Endeavour'' then visited the island of [[Savu]], staying for three days before continuing on to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], the capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]], to put in for repairs. Batavia was known for its outbreaks of [[malaria]], and before they returned home in 1771 many in Cook's company succumbed to the disease and other ailments such as [[dysentery]], including the Tahitian [[Tupaia (priest)|Tupaia]], Banks' [[Finland|Finnish]] secretary and fellow scientist [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]], astronomer Charles Green, and the illustrator [[Sydney Parkinson]]. Cook named [[Sp\u00f6ring Island]] off the coast of [[New Zealand]] to honour Herman Sp\u00f6ring and his work on the voyage.\n\nCook then rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and stopped at [[Saint Helena]]. On 10 July 1771 [[Nicholas Young (sailor)|Nicholas Young]], the boy who had first seen New Zealand, sighted England (specifically [[the Lizard]]) again for the first time, and ''Endeavour'' sailed up the [[English Channel]], passing [[Beachy Head]] at 6&nbsp;am on 12 July; that afternoon ''Endeavour'' anchored in [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]], and Cook went ashore at [[Deal, Kent]]. His return was unexpected, as newspapers and journals had long since reported fears that ''Endeavour'' had been lost at sea or destroyed in combat against the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1968|p=clxvi}}</ref>\n\n==Publication of journals==\n[[File:JohnHawkesworth.png|thumb|right|200px|John Hawkesworth]]\nCook's [[Diary|journals]], along with those of Banks, were handed over to the Admiralty to be published upon his return. [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]] contracted, for \u00a36,000, [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] a literary critic, essayist, and editor of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' to publish a comprehensive account of exploration in the Pacific: not just Cook's ventures but also those of [[Samuel Wallis|Wallis]], [[John Byron|Byron]] and [[Philip Carteret|Carteret]]. Hawkesworth edited the journals of Byron, Wallis and Carteret into separate accounts as volume I and then blended Cook's and Joseph Banks' journals with some of his own sentiments and produced a single first-person narrative that appeared to be the words of Cook, as Volume II.<ref>{{harvnb|Villiers |1967|p=151}}</ref> The book appeared in 1773 as three volumes with the title:\n\n{{quote|AN ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGES undertaken by Order of His Present Majesty for making Discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere, and successively performed by Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, Captain Carteret and Captain Cook, in the Dolphin, the Swallow and the Endeavour: Drawn up from the Journals which were kept by the several Commanders, and from the Papers of Joseph Banks, Esq.; by John Hawkesworth, LL.D.

Reviewers complained that the reader had no way to tell which part of the account was Cook, which part Banks and which part Hawkesworth and others were offended by the books'\ndescriptions of the voyagers' sexual encounters with the Tahitians.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ravneberg|first=Ronald L|title=The Hawkesworth Copy|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu4148.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Anne |last=Salmond |title=Aphrodite's Island: The European Discovery of Tahiti|url=https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm |url-access=registration |publisher=University of California Press|date= 2009}}</ref> \nCook was at sea again before the book was published and was later much disturbed by some of the sentiments that Hawkesworth has ascribed to him.

It was the first of three Pacific voyages of which Cook was the commander. The aims of this first expedition were to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun (3\u20134 of June  that year), and to seek evidence of the postulated ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'' or \"undiscovered southern land\".\n\nThe voyage was commissioned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and commanded by Lieutenant [[James Cook]], a junior naval officer with good skills in [[cartography]] and mathematics. Departing from [[Plymouth Dockyard]] in August 1768, the expedition crossed the Atlantic, rounded [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the transit of Venus. Cook then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of [[Huahine]], [[Borabora]] and [[Raiatea]] to claim them for Great Britain,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and unsuccessfully attempting to land at [[Rurutu (Austral Islands)|Rurutu]]. In September 1769 the expedition reached [[New Zealand]], being the second Europeans to visit there, following the first European discovery by [[Abel Tasman]] 127 years earlier. Cook and his crew spent the following six months charting the New Zealand coast, before resuming their voyage westward across open sea. In April 1770 they became the first known Europeans to reach the east coast of [[Australia]], making landfall near present-day [[Point Hicks]], and then proceeding north to [[Botany Bay]].\n\nThe expedition continued northward along the Australian coastline, narrowly avoiding shipwreck on the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. In October 1770 the badly damaged ''Endeavour'' came into the port of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]], her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. They resumed their journey on 26 December, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] on 12 July. The voyage lasted almost three years.\n\nThe year following his return Cook set out on a [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] of the Pacific, which lasted from 1772 to 1775.

The primary purpose of the observation was to obtain measurements that could be used to calculate more accurately the distance of [[Venus]] from the Sun. If this could be achieved, then the distances of the other planets could be worked out, based on their orbits. On the day of the transit observation, Cook recorded:\n\n<blockquote>Saturday {{not a typo|3<sup>rd</sup>}} This day prov'd as favourable to our purpose as we could wish, not a Clowd was to be seen the Whole day and the Air was perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in Observing the whole of the passage of the Planet Venus over the Suns disk: we very distinctly saw an Atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the Planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones.

Their instrumentation was adequate by the standards of the time, but the resolution still could not eliminate the errors. When their results were later compared to those of the other observations of the same event made elsewhere for the exercise, the net result was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped.

However, they were [[Blown off course|forced to maintain a more northerly course owing to prevailing gales]], and sailed on until 19 April 1770 when land was sighted at 6&nbsp;a.m. The first land sighted near Present-day Point Hicks, was not, Cook's [[Point Hicks]]. Cook calculated that Van Diemen's Land ought to lie due south of their position, but having found the coastline trending to the south-west, recorded his doubt that this landmass was connected to it. This point was on the south-eastern coast of the [[Australia]]n continent, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline. In his journal, Cook recorded the event thus:\n\n<blockquote>the Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us W<small>1/4</small>S I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38\u00b0..0' S\u00b0 and in the Longitude of 211\u00b0..07' W<sup>&nbsp;t</sup> from the Meridian of Greenwich.

Cook's log used the nautical date, which, during the 18th&nbsp;century, assigned the same date to all ship's events from noon to noon, first p.m. and then a.m. That nautical date began twelve hours before the midnight beginning of the like-named civil date. Furthermore, Cook did not adjust his nautical date to account for circumnavigation of the globe until he had travelled a full 360\u00b0 relative to the [[longitude]] of his home British port, either toward the east or west. Because he travelled west on his first voyage, this a.m. nautical date was the morning of a civil date 14 hours slow relative to his home port (port\u221214h). Because the south-east coast of Australia is now regarded as being 10 hours ahead relative to Britain, that date is now called Friday, 20 April.<ref>Arthur R. Hinks, \"Nautical time and civil date\", ''The Geographical Journal'', '''86''' (1935) 153\u2013157.</ref>\n\nThe landmark of this sighting is generally reckoned to be a point lying about half-way between the present-day towns of [[Orbost, Victoria|Orbost]] and [[Mallacoota, Victoria|Mallacoota]] on the south-eastern coast of the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

James Cook and crew made their first landing on the continent, at a place now known as [[Botany Bay]], on [[Silver Beach (Kurnell)|Kurnell Peninsula]] and made contact of a hostile nature with the [[Gweagal]] Aborigines, on 29 April.{{Ref|date|[b]}} At first Cook bestowed the name \"Sting-Ray Harbour\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url= http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700506.html |title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 6 May 1770 |accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> to the inlet after the many such creatures found there; this was later changed to \"Botanist Bay\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and finally ''[[Botany Bay]]'' after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists [[Joseph Banks]], [[Daniel Solander]] and [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]].\n\n[[File:Kurnell Cook Landing Plaque.JPG|thumb|upright|Captain Cook [[Kurnell, New South Wales|landing place plaque]]]]\nThis first landing site was later to be promoted (particularly by Joseph Banks) as a suitable candidate for situating a settlement and [[British colony|British colonial]] outpost. However, almost 18 years later, when Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] and the [[First Fleet]] arrived in early 1788 to establish an outpost and [[penal colony]], they found that the bay and surrounds did not live up to the promising picture that had been painted. Instead, Phillip gave orders to relocate to a harbour a few kilometres to the north, which Cook had named [[Port Jackson]] but had not further explored. It was in this harbour, at a place Phillip named [[Sydney Cove]], that the settlement of [[Sydney]] was established. The settlement was for some time afterwards still referred to generally as Botany Bay. The expedition's scientific members commenced the first European scientific documentation of [[Australian fauna]] and [[Australian flora|flora]].\n\nAt Cook's original landing contact was made with the local [[Australian Aboriginal]] inhabitants. As the ship sailed into the harbour, they noticed Aborigines on both of the headlands. At about 2 pm they put the anchor down near a group of six to eight huts. Two Aborigines, a younger and an older man, came down to the boat.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700429.html|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 29 April 1770|first=|last=|publisher=South Seas|website=southseas.nla.gov.au|accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref> They did not accept the offer of gifts from Cook, whose lack of knowledge of Aboriginal custom may have prevented him from behaving acceptably in such exchanges. A musket was fired over their heads, which wounded the older man slightly, and he ran towards the huts. He came back with other men and threw spears at Cook's men, although they did no harm. They were chased off after two more rounds were fired.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The adults had left, but Cook found several Aboriginal children in the huts, and left some beads with them as a gesture of friendship.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Port Jackson===\n\nOn 6 May 1770, the Endeavour left Botany Bay and sailed north past an inlet \"wherein there appeared to be safe anchorage\". Cook named it [[Port Jackson]], today generally known as Sydney Harbour.<ref>Beaglehole (1968), pp 312-13</ref> No-one on the ship recorded seeing any of the Harbour's many islands, because their line of sight was blocked by the high promontories of [[Sydney Heads|South Head]] and [[Bradleys Head]] that shape its dog-leg entrance. However, these islands were possibly known to [[Arthur Phillip|Captain Arthur Phillip]], the [[First Fleet]] commander, before he departed England in 1787.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillip|first1=Arthur|title=Comments on a draft of his instructions|date=11 April 1787|publisher=TNA CO 201/2, f.128-131}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kangourou Sydney Parkinson.jpg|thumb|This kangaroo was seen at [[Endeavour River]] on 23 June 1770, painted by [[Sydney Parkinson]]]]\n===Seventeen Seventy===\nCook continued northwards, charting along the coastline. He stopped at Bustard Bay (now known as [[Seventeen Seventy, Queensland|Seventeen Seventy]]) at 8 o'clock on 23 May 1770 in 5 fathoms water on a sandy bottom at the South point of the Bay. Cook recounted that his clerk, Orton, had been molested while dead drunk that night, the perpetrators cutting off not only his clothes but also parts of his ears. Cook suspended and sent below the suspect Magra.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700522.html|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 22 May 1770|last=|first=|publisher =South Seas|website=southseas.nla.gov.au|accessdate=13 December 2017}}</ref> On 24 May Cook and Banks and others went ashore. He sounded the channel (now known as Round Hill Creek) and found a freshwater stream, noting there was room for a few ships to safely anchor. He noted a great deal of smoke on the hills and inspected one of the closest group of 10 fires around which were scattered cockle shells and other evidence of aboriginal occupation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Endeavour River===\n[[File:Captain Cook statue.jpg|thumb|Photo taken in Cooktown in 2007|thumb|left|[[Captain James Cook]] Commander, H.M.B. \"Endeavour\" which was beached and repaired near this site 17 June \u2013 4 August 1770]]\nA mishap occurred when ''Endeavour'' ran aground on a shoal of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], on 11 June 1770. The ship was seriously damaged and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach (near the docks of modern [[Cooktown]], at the mouth of the [[Endeavour River]]). While there, [[Joseph Banks]], [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]] and [[Daniel Solander]] made their first major collections of Australian flora. \n\nThe crew's encounters with the local Aboriginal people were mainly peaceable; from the group encountered here the name \"[[kangaroo]]\" entered the [[English language]], coming from the local [[Guugu Yimidhirr language|Guugu Yimidhirr]] word for a kind of [[Eastern grey kangaroo|grey kangaroo]], ''gangurru'' (pronounced {{IPA-aus|\u0261\u030aa\u014buru|}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Robson |2004|p=81}}</ref>\n\n===Possession Island===\nOnce repairs were completed, the voyage continued and at about midday on 22 August 1770, Cook reached the northernmost tip of the coast. Without leaving the ship, he named it Cape York and departed the east coast. Turning west, he nursed the battered ship through the dangerously shallow waters of [[Torres Strait]], earlier navigated by [[Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres]] in 1606. Searching for a high vantage point, Cook saw a steep hill on a nearby island from the top of which he hoped to see \"a passage into the Indian Seas\". Cook named the island [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]], where he claimed the entire eastern coastline that he had just explored as British territory.<ref>Cook, James, Journal of the HMS Endeavour, 1768-1771, National Library of Australia, Manuscripts Collection, MS 1, 22 August 1770</ref>\n\nIn negotiating the [[Torres Strait]] past [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], Cook also put an end to the speculation that New Holland and [[New Guinea]] were part of the same land mass.<ref name=\"three\">G. Williams (2002){{full citation needed|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Scurvy prevention===\nAt that point in the voyage Cook had lost not a single man to [[scurvy]], a remarkable and practically unheard-of achievement in 18th-century long-distance seafaring. Adhering to Royal Navy policy introduced in 1747, <!-- Note. See our Scurvy article regarding this. --> Cook persuaded his men to eat foods such as [[citrus]] [[fruit]]s and [[sauerkraut]]. At that time it was known that poor diet caused scurvy but not specifically that a [[vitamin C]] deficiency was the culprit.\n\nSailors of the day were notoriously against innovation, and at first the men would not eat the sauerkraut. Cook used a \"method I never once knew to fail with seamen.\"<ref name=\"Beaglehole74\">{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1968|p=74}}</ref> He ordered it served to himself and the officers, and left an option for crew who wanted some. Within a week of seeing their superiors set a value on it the demand was so great a ration had to be instituted.<ref name=\"Beaglehole74\"/> In other cases, however, Cook resorted to traditional naval discipline. \"Punished Henry Stephens, Seaman, and Thomas Dunster, Marine, with twelve lashes each for refusing to take their allowance of fresh beef.\"<ref>Wilcox, Ten Who Dared at 97 (Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 1977).</ref>\n\nCook's general approach was essentially empirical, encouraging as broad a diet as circumstances permitted, and collecting such [[Tetragonia tetragonoides|greens]] as could be had when making landfall. All onboard ate the same food, with Cook specifically dividing equally anything that could be divided (and indeed recommending that practice to any commander \u2013 journal 4 August 1770).\n\nTwo cases of scurvy did occur on board, astronomer [[Charles Green (astronomer)|Charles Green]] and a [[Tahiti]] navigator [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]] were treated, but Cook was able to proudly record that upon reaching [[Jakarta|Batavia]] he had \"not one man upon the sick list\" (journal 15 October 1770), unlike so many voyages that reached that port with much of the crew suffering illness.\n\n==Homeward voyage==\n[[File:Track of Endeavour.jpg|thumb|Route of ''Endeavour'' from the Torres Strait to Java, August and September 1770]]\n''Endeavour'' then visited the island of [[Savu]], staying for three days before continuing on to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], the capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]], to put in for repairs. Batavia was known for its outbreaks of [[malaria]], and before they returned home in 1771 many in Cook's company succumbed to the disease and other ailments such as [[dysentery]], including the Tahitian [[Tupaia (priest)|Tupaia]], Banks' [[Finland|Finnish]] secretary and fellow scientist [[Herman Sp\u00f6ring]], astronomer Charles Green, and the illustrator [[Sydney Parkinson]]. Cook named [[Sp\u00f6ring Island]] off the coast of [[New Zealand]] to honour Herman Sp\u00f6ring and his work on the voyage.\n\nCook then rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and stopped at [[Saint Helena]]. On 10 July 1771 [[Nicholas Young (sailor)|Nicholas Young]], the boy who had first seen New Zealand, sighted England (specifically [[the Lizard]]) again for the first time, and ''Endeavour'' sailed up the [[English Channel]], passing [[Beachy Head]] at 6&nbsp;am on 12 July; that afternoon ''Endeavour'' anchored in [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]], and Cook went ashore at [[Deal, Kent]]. His return was unexpected, as newspapers and journals had long since reported fears that ''Endeavour'' had been lost at sea or destroyed in combat against the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Beaglehole|1968|p=clxvi}}</ref>\n\n==Publication of journals==\n[[File:JohnHawkesworth.png|thumb|right|200px|John Hawkesworth]]\nCook's [[Diary|journals]], along with those of Banks, were handed over to the Admiralty to be published upon his return. [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]] contracted, for \u00a36,000, [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] a literary critic, essayist, and editor of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' to publish a comprehensive account of exploration in the Pacific: not just Cook's ventures but also those of [[Samuel Wallis|Wallis]], [[John Byron|Byron]] and [[Philip Carteret|Carteret]]. Hawkesworth edited the journals of Byron, Wallis and Carteret into separate accounts as volume I and then blended Cook's and Joseph Banks' journals with some of his own sentiments and produced a single first-person narrative that appeared to be the words of Cook, as Volume II.<ref>{{harvnb|Villiers |1967|p=151}}</ref> The book appeared in 1773 as three volumes with the title:\n\n{{quote|AN ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGES undertaken by Order of His Present Majesty for making Discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere, and successively performed by Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, Captain Carteret and Captain Cook, in the Dolphin, the Swallow and the Endeavour: Drawn up from the Journals which were kept by the several Commanders, and from the Papers of Joseph Banks, Esq.; by John Hawkesworth, LL.D.

Cadell in the Strand. London: MDCCLXXIII}}\n\nThe book went on sale on 9 June 1773 but widespread criticism in the press made the publication a personal disaster for Hawkesworth. Reviewers complained that the reader had no way to tell which part of the account was Cook, which part Banks and which part Hawkesworth and others were offended by the books'\ndescriptions of the voyagers' sexual encounters with the Tahitians.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ravneberg|first=Ronald L|title=The Hawkesworth Copy|url=http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu4148.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Anne |last=Salmond |title=Aphrodite's Island: The European Discovery of Tahiti|url=https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm |url-access=registration |publisher=University of California Press|date= 2009}}</ref> \nCook was at sea again before the book was published and was later much disturbed by some of the sentiments that Hawkesworth has ascribed to him. He determined to edit his own journals in future.\n\n==Re-enactment==\nIn 2001, the BBC set about making a documentary which involved a film crew, volunteers and historians retracing the voyage made by Captain Cook.
