(also known simply as '''''King's Quest V''''') is a 1990 [[graphic adventure game]] by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]]. Originally released in November 1990, it featured a significant improvement in graphics (achieved through the introduction of [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] into the series). It was also the first ''[[King's Quest]]'' installment to replace the typing user interface with a point-and-click user interface. The title is a spoof on the proverb \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"\n\n''King's Quest V'' sold over half million copies and won several awards. It was later released as a fully voiced \"talkie\" [[CD-ROM]], done by members of the Sierra staff. By summer a [[Sega CD]] port of the game was announced, but was never released.<ref name=\"KQ5-SegaCD\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Mega Play - Coming Attractions |url=https://archive.org/details/Mega_Play_Issue_11_August_1992/page/n31 |magazine=[[Mega (magazine)#Mega Play|Mega Play]] |volume=3 |issue=11 |publisher=Sendai Publishing |date=August 1992 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the introduction to the game, a view of Castle Daventry is shown, when suddenly, a mysterious cloaked figure appears. He enchants the castle, causing a whirlwind to appear, which soon engulfs the castle and lifts it out of sight. Because he is out walking when this happens, [[King Graham]] is the only member of the royal family to be left behind. He returns to the castle to find that it has disappeared, and is soon confronted by a talking owl named Cedric.\n\nCedric witnessed the cloaked figure's attack, and tells Graham that it was a powerful, evil wizard named Mordack who stole the castle. Cedric then brings Graham to the land of Serenia, where his master Crispin resides. Crispin is also a wizard, but a good one, who gives Graham some advice, his old wand, and a piece of white snake which allows Graham to speak with animals. Graham then starts on his journey.\n\nLater, Graham learns that Mordack is the brother of the wizard Manannan, whom Graham's son, Prince Alexander, turned into a cat in ''[[King's Quest III]]''. Mordack has imprisoned the castle and royal family of Daventry out of revenge, and threatens to feed the royal family to Manannan unless Prince Alexander agrees to restore him to his true form as the spell's nature means that only Prince Alexander as the caster can reverse it. King Graham travels through the land of Serenia, gathering helpful items and information, and eventually makes his way to Mordack's island, and to his castle lair, to save his family from their impending doom.\n\nThe owl Cedric accompanies the protagonist King Graham through the entire game to provide commentary and advice. He has to be rescued from danger at several points. The only useful thing the owl does is inadvertently saving Graham's life from a spell near the end of the game.\n\nAt the end of the game, with the help of another of Mordack's prisoners, Princess Cassima, Graham is able to confront Mordack in a magical duel, using spells he learns from Mordack's own spell book against him. After Mordack transforms himself into a ring of fire, Graham slays the evil wizard by conjuring a rain storm to put the fire out. The good wizard Crispin arrives soon after and transforms the castle and royal family back to normal. At Graham's request, Crispin teleports Cassima back to her home in the Land of the Green Isles and sends the royal family back to Daventry.\n\n===Connections to other ''King's Quest'' games===\nThough still largely standalone, ''King's Quest V'' is one of the few where the elements of the plot itself are directly connected to events or individuals in both previous and future games. The location the game is set in, Serenia, was first visited in the earlier game ''[[Wizard and the Princess]]''. During the game, King Graham discovers the skeleton of a man in the Serenia desert which is identified as the body of the Wanderer, the protagonist from ''Wizard and the Princess'' in the King's Quest Companion. The transformation of Manannan into a cat is a necessary task to completing ''[[King's Quest III]]''. And this act has profound consequences for Alexander (and his family), as it is the impetus for the ''KQV'' storyline.\n\nThe game's ending ties into its sequel, ''[[King's Quest VI]]''. Cassima was introduced as a slave to the wizard Mordack. Before she is sent home at the end, Alexander mentions wanting to visit her in the Land of the Green Isles, which happens at the beginning of ''KQVI''. And Cassima mentions her [[Vizier]], who first introduced Mordack to her. In ''KQVI'', we find out that Mordack and the Vizier (who is the primary antagonist of ''KQVI'') are both part of an organization known as the Society of the Black Cloak (technically only the Vizier is confirmed to be a member, but members of the organization know of Mordack). Even the music for Cassima in Mordack's castle is enhanced and used for the love theme for Alexander and Cassima. At the end of that game, the Vizier is defeated by Alexander and Cassima and the two marry.\n\n==Versions==\n''King's Quest V'' was the last in the series to feature [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and [[Tandy graphics]] at 320\u00d7200: a separate EGA release contained 16-color 320\u00d7200 versions of the graphics, whereas the VGA release featured 320\u00d7200 256-color VGA graphics (and, unlike later [[Sierra's Creative Interpreter|SCI]] games, did not support rendering these into 16 colors at 640\u00d7200 resolution on EGA cards).\n\n===Floppy disk===\nThe diskette version (EGA and VGA) requires Graham to cast spells throughout the game, requiring the user to refer to the manual as a form of copy protection. This was omitted in the CD-ROM version. The disk version has a slightly different game interface, similar to the version later used in the NES version, the main difference being that there is an additional walk option. Several of the animated characters including the rat, the ant, and the bee, have large closeup pictures of their upper torsos, that are fully animated, including arms and, for the insects, antennae. The ant, for example, even raises up the golden needle. These closeups and animations were modified or mostly cut from the CD-ROM version (which only shows closeups on the characters' faces).\n\n===CD-ROM===\nReleased in 1992, the CD-ROM version is mastered in the [[High Sierra Format]], unrelated to the [[Sierra Entertainment|publisher's name]]. This version added voice acting. There are also many script differences between the floppy and CD-ROM versions. Many of the narrative descriptions were modified, and lines were added to characters that did not have speaking roles. For example, the snake and some of the villagers are given a few quotes, whereas they did not speak at all, and ignored Graham in the floppy version. Many of the characters have close up pictures (taken from the floppy) that were given various colored backgrounds behind them, and a frame around them (though the frame cuts off some details). The snake is even given a close up picture for its new speaking parts and a few of the characters are given more lines.\n\n===NES===\nIn order to make the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] adaptation more family-friendly and release it to stores everywhere, Nintendo of America had to follow its Video Game Content Guidelines requiring it to tone down violence, nudity, language, and religious themes in the games it released and it was published by [[Konami]], rather than [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]].<ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php Nintendo's Era of Censorship]</ref> One example is Graham's water-drinking scene in the desert: where the narrator's words say, \"Ah, life-giving water. Nectar of the Gods. Graham can now feel strength and renewal flowing through him\" in the PC version, in the NES adaptation it says, \"Ah! The cool water felt wonderful on Graham's parched lips and his body now feels rejuvenated.\" This was edited due to religious themes.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Another example has Queen Icebella ordering the wolves to take Graham and Cedric to the dungeons for ever, instead of actually killing them. Cedric is turned to 'stone', rather than Mordack actually killing him. In the Konami release, this obviously was to censor out the threatened violence, but the threatened violence was shown in the Sierra On-Line release.\n\n===Atari ST===\nAn [[Atari ST]] version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine: Sierra News Magazine for a Spring 1991 release but was later canceled.<ref name=\"Staff (Spring 1991).

At Graham's request, Crispin teleports Cassima back to her home in the Land of the Green Isles and sends the royal family back to Daventry.\n\n===Connections to other ''King's Quest'' games===\nThough still largely standalone, ''King's Quest V'' is one of the few where the elements of the plot itself are directly connected to events or individuals in both previous and future games. The location the game is set in, Serenia, was first visited in the earlier game ''[[Wizard and the Princess]]''. During the game, King Graham discovers the skeleton of a man in the Serenia desert which is identified as the body of the Wanderer, the protagonist from ''Wizard and the Princess'' in the King's Quest Companion. The transformation of Manannan into a cat is a necessary task to completing ''[[King's Quest III]]''. And this act has profound consequences for Alexander (and his family), as it is the impetus for the ''KQV'' storyline.\n\nThe game's ending ties into its sequel, ''[[King's Quest VI]]''. Cassima was introduced as a slave to the wizard Mordack. Before she is sent home at the end, Alexander mentions wanting to visit her in the Land of the Green Isles, which happens at the beginning of ''KQVI''. And Cassima mentions her [[Vizier]], who first introduced Mordack to her. In ''KQVI'', we find out that Mordack and the Vizier (who is the primary antagonist of ''KQVI'') are both part of an organization known as the Society of the Black Cloak (technically only the Vizier is confirmed to be a member, but members of the organization know of Mordack). Even the music for Cassima in Mordack's castle is enhanced and used for the love theme for Alexander and Cassima. At the end of that game, the Vizier is defeated by Alexander and Cassima and the two marry.\n\n==Versions==\n''King's Quest V'' was the last in the series to feature [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and [[Tandy graphics]] at 320\u00d7200: a separate EGA release contained 16-color 320\u00d7200 versions of the graphics, whereas the VGA release featured 320\u00d7200 256-color VGA graphics (and, unlike later [[Sierra's Creative Interpreter|SCI]] games, did not support rendering these into 16 colors at 640\u00d7200 resolution on EGA cards).\n\n===Floppy disk===\nThe diskette version (EGA and VGA) requires Graham to cast spells throughout the game, requiring the user to refer to the manual as a form of copy protection. This was omitted in the CD-ROM version. The disk version has a slightly different game interface, similar to the version later used in the NES version, the main difference being that there is an additional walk option. Several of the animated characters including the rat, the ant, and the bee, have large closeup pictures of their upper torsos, that are fully animated, including arms and, for the insects, antennae. The ant, for example, even raises up the golden needle. These closeups and animations were modified or mostly cut from the CD-ROM version (which only shows closeups on the characters' faces).\n\n===CD-ROM===\nReleased in 1992, the CD-ROM version is mastered in the [[High Sierra Format]], unrelated to the [[Sierra Entertainment|publisher's name]]. This version added voice acting. There are also many script differences between the floppy and CD-ROM versions. Many of the narrative descriptions were modified, and lines were added to characters that did not have speaking roles. For example, the snake and some of the villagers are given a few quotes, whereas they did not speak at all, and ignored Graham in the floppy version. Many of the characters have close up pictures (taken from the floppy) that were given various colored backgrounds behind them, and a frame around them (though the frame cuts off some details). The snake is even given a close up picture for its new speaking parts and a few of the characters are given more lines.\n\n===NES===\nIn order to make the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] adaptation more family-friendly and release it to stores everywhere, Nintendo of America had to follow its Video Game Content Guidelines requiring it to tone down violence, nudity, language, and religious themes in the games it released and it was published by [[Konami]], rather than [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]].<ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php Nintendo's Era of Censorship]</ref> One example is Graham's water-drinking scene in the desert: where the narrator's words say, \"Ah, life-giving water. Nectar of the Gods. Graham can now feel strength and renewal flowing through him\" in the PC version, in the NES adaptation it says, \"Ah! The cool water felt wonderful on Graham's parched lips and his body now feels rejuvenated.\" This was edited due to religious themes.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Another example has Queen Icebella ordering the wolves to take Graham and Cedric to the dungeons for ever, instead of actually killing them. Cedric is turned to 'stone', rather than Mordack actually killing him. In the Konami release, this obviously was to censor out the threatened violence, but the threatened violence was shown in the Sierra On-Line release.\n\n===Atari ST===\nAn [[Atari ST]] version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine: Sierra News Magazine for a Spring 1991 release but was later canceled.<ref name=\"Staff (Spring 1991).

{"title_page": "Lady Franklin Bay Expedition", "text_new": "* {{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Lady Franklin Bay Expedition personnel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Expedition personnel prior to embarkment]]\nThe '''Lady Franklin Bay Expedition''' of 1881\u20131884 to [[Lady Franklin Bay]] in the [[Canadian Arctic]] was led by Lieutenant [[Adolphus Greely]] and was promoted by the [[United States Army Signal Corps]].\n\nIts purpose was to establish a meteorological-observation station as part of the First [[International Polar Year]], and to collect astronomical and magnetic data. During the expedition, two members of the crew reached a new [[Farthest North]] record, but of the original 25&nbsp;men, only seven survived to return.\n\nThe expedition was under the auspices of the Signal Corps at a time when the Corps' Chief Disbursements officer, [[Henry W. Howgate]], was arrested for [[embezzlement]]. However, that did not deter the planning and execution of the voyage.\n\n== Expedition ==\n\n=== First year, 1881 ===\n[[File:Lady Franklin Bay expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Proteus'' at [[Qeqertarsuaq]] harbor]]\nThe expedition was led by Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]] of the Fifth United States Cavalry, with astronomer [[Edward Israel]] and photographer [[George W. Rice (photographer)|George W. Rice]] among the crew of 21&nbsp;officers and men. They sailed on the ship ''Proteus'' and reached [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], in early July 1881.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=438}} At [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]], Greenland, they picked up two [[Inuit]] dogsled drivers, as well as physician Octave Pierre Pavy and Mr. Clay who had continued scientific studies instead of returning on ''Florence'' with the remainder of the 1880 Howgate Expedition.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=439}}<ref>{{cite journal |pages=103 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oRoCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=howgate+expedition+1880+-wiki |last=Shrady, G.

L. |title=Medical Record |date= 5 July \u2013 27 December 1884|publisher=William Wood & Co. |location=New York |volume=26 |oclc=1757009}}</ref>\n\n''Proteus'' arrived without problems at [[Lady Franklin Bay]] by August&nbsp;11, dropped off men and provisions, and left.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=440}} In the following months, Lieutenant [[James Booth Lockwood]] and Sergeant [[David Legge Brainard]] achieved a new [[Farthest North]] record at {{coord|83|24||N|40|46||W|type:event}}, off the north coast of Greenland.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=444}} Unbeknownst to Greely, the summer had been extraordinarily warm, which led to an underestimation of the difficulties which their relief expeditions would face in reaching Lady Franklin Bay in subsequent years.\n\n=== Second year, 1882 ===\nBy summer of 1882, the men were expecting a supply ship from the south. ''Neptune'', laden with relief supplies, set out in July 1882 but, cut off by ice and weather, Captain Beebe was forced to turn around prematurely. All he could do was leave some supplies at [[Smith Sound]] in August, and the remaining provisions in Newfoundland, with plans for their delivery the following year.\n\nOn July 20, Pavy's contract ended, and Pavy announced that he would not renew it, but would continue to attend to the expedition's medical needs. Greely was incensed, and ordered the doctor to turn over all his records and journals. Pavy refused, and Greely placed him under arrest. Pavy was not confined, however Greely claimed he intended to [[court-martial]] him when they returned to the United States.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=447\u2013448}}\n\n=== Third year, 1883 ===\nIn 1883, new rescue attempts by ''Proteus'', commanded by Lieutenant [[Ernest Albert Garlington]], and ''Yantic'', commanded by Commander Frank Wildes, failed, with ''Proteus'' being crushed by pack ice.\n\n[[File:111-SC-96236 (21832311119).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The six survivors: Private Francis Long, Sergeant Julius R. Frederick, Private Maurice Connell, Steward Henry Bierderbick, Sergeant [[David L. Brainard]], Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]]]]\nIn the summer of 1883, in accordance with his instructions for the case of two consecutive relief expeditions not reaching [[Fort Conger]], Greely decided to head South with his crew. It had been planned that the relief ships should depot supplies along the [[Nares Strait]], around [[Cape Sabine]] and at [[Littleton Island (Arctic)|Littleton Island]], if they were unable to reach Fort Conger, which should have made for a comfortable wintering of Greely's men. But with ''Neptune'' not even getting that far and ''Proteus'' sunk, in reality only a small emergency cache with 40 days worth of supplies had been laid at Cape Sabine by ''Proteus''.\n\nWhen arriving there in October 1883, the season was too advanced for Greely to either try to brave the [[Baffin Bay]] to reach Greenland with his small boats, or to retire to Fort Conger, so he had to winter on the spot.\n\n=== Fourth year, 1884 ===\nIn 1884, Secretary of the Navy, [[William E. Chandler]], was credited with planning the ensuing rescue effort, commanded by Cdr. [[Winfield Scott Schley]]. While four vessels\u2014{{USS|Bear|1874|6}}, {{USS|Thetis|1881|6}}, {{HMS|Alert|1856|6}}, and [[Loch Line|''Loch Garry'']]\u2014made it to Greely's camp on June&nbsp;22, only seven men had survived the winter.<ref>Stein, Stephen K (December 2006). \"The Greely Relief Expedition and the New Navy\", ''International Journal of Naval History''</ref> The rest had succumbed to starvation, [[hypothermia]], and drowning, and one man, Private Henry, had been shot on Greely's order for repeated theft of food rations.<ref name=NYTimesAug14Greely>{{cite news|title=Lieut.

During the expedition, two members of the crew reached a new [[Farthest North]] record, but of the original 25&nbsp;men, only seven survived to return.\n\nThe expedition was under the auspices of the Signal Corps at a time when the Corps' Chief Disbursements officer, [[Henry W. Howgate]], was arrested for [[embezzlement]]. However, that did not deter the planning and execution of the voyage.\n\n== Expedition ==\n\n=== First year, 1881 ===\n[[File:Lady Franklin Bay expedition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Proteus'' at [[Qeqertarsuaq]] harbor]]\nThe expedition was led by Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]] of the Fifth United States Cavalry, with astronomer [[Edward Israel]] and photographer [[George W. Rice (photographer)|George W. Rice]] among the crew of 21&nbsp;officers and men. They sailed on the ship ''Proteus'' and reached [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], in early July 1881.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=438}} At [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]], Greenland, they picked up two [[Inuit]] dogsled drivers, as well as physician Octave Pierre Pavy and Mr. Clay who had continued scientific studies instead of returning on ''Florence'' with the remainder of the 1880 Howgate Expedition.{{sfn|Berton|1988|p=439}}<ref>{{cite journal |pages=103 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oRoCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=howgate+expedition+1880+-wiki |last=Shrady, G.

''Neptune'', laden with relief supplies, set out in July 1882 but, cut off by ice and weather, Captain Beebe was forced to turn around prematurely. All he could do was leave some supplies at [[Smith Sound]] in August, and the remaining provisions in Newfoundland, with plans for their delivery the following year.\n\nOn July 20, Pavy's contract ended, and Pavy announced that he would not renew it, but would continue to attend to the expedition's medical needs. Greely was incensed, and ordered the doctor to turn over all his records and journals. Pavy refused, and Greely placed him under arrest. Pavy was not confined, however Greely claimed he intended to [[court-martial]] him when they returned to the United States.{{sfn|Berton|1988|pp=447\u2013448}}\n\n=== Third year, 1883 ===\nIn 1883, new rescue attempts by ''Proteus'', commanded by Lieutenant [[Ernest Albert Garlington]], and ''Yantic'', commanded by Commander Frank Wildes, failed, with ''Proteus'' being crushed by pack ice.\n\n[[File:111-SC-96236 (21832311119).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The six survivors: Private Francis Long, Sergeant Julius R. Frederick, Private Maurice Connell, Steward Henry Bierderbick, Sergeant [[David L. Brainard]], Lieutenant [[Adolphus W. Greely]]]]\nIn the summer of 1883, in accordance with his instructions for the case of two consecutive relief expeditions not reaching [[Fort Conger]], Greely decided to head South with his crew. It had been planned that the relief ships should depot supplies along the [[Nares Strait]], around [[Cape Sabine]] and at [[Littleton Island (Arctic)|Littleton Island]], if they were unable to reach Fort Conger, which should have made for a comfortable wintering of Greely's men. But with ''Neptune'' not even getting that far and ''Proteus'' sunk, in reality only a small emergency cache with 40 days worth of supplies had been laid at Cape Sabine by ''Proteus''.\n\nWhen arriving there in October 1883, the season was too advanced for Greely to either try to brave the [[Baffin Bay]] to reach Greenland with his small boats, or to retire to Fort Conger, so he had to winter on the spot.\n\n=== Fourth year, 1884 ===\nIn 1884, Secretary of the Navy, [[William E. Chandler]], was credited with planning the ensuing rescue effort, commanded by Cdr. [[Winfield Scott Schley]]. While four vessels\u2014{{USS|Bear|1874|6}}, {{USS|Thetis|1881|6}}, {{HMS|Alert|1856|6}}, and [[Loch Line|''Loch Garry'']]\u2014made it to Greely's camp on June&nbsp;22, only seven men had survived the winter.<ref>Stein, Stephen K (December 2006). \"The Greely Relief Expedition and the New Navy\", ''International Journal of Naval History''</ref> The rest had succumbed to starvation, [[hypothermia]], and drowning, and one man, Private Henry, had been shot on Greely's order for repeated theft of food rations.<ref name=NYTimesAug14Greely>{{cite news|title=Lieut.

It has enjoyed  self-government since the division of the Duchy of Normandy in 1204.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:Dolmen Faldouet Jersey.jpg|thumb|La Pouquelaye de Faldouet was constructed on a site on the east coast looking across to the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].]]\n{{See also|Archaeology of the Channel Islands|Jersey Dolmens}}\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in Jersey dates to about 250,000 years ago (before Jersey became an island) when bands of nomadic hunters used the caves at [[La Cotte de St Brelade]] as a base for hunting [[mammoth]] and [[woolly rhinoceros]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cunliffe |first=Barry |title=The Oxford Illustrated Prehistory of Europe |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1994 |isbn=0198143850 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198143857 }}</ref>\n\nRising sea levels resulted in it has been an island for approximately 6,000 years and at its current extremes it measures 10 miles east to west and six miles north to south.

The number, size, and visible locations of these megalithic monuments (especially [[La Hougue Bie]]) have suggested that social organisation over a wide area, including surrounding coasts, was required for the construction.  Archaeological evidence also shows that trading links with [[Brittany]] and the south coast of England existed during this time.\n\n===Hoards===\n\n{{see also|List of hoards in the Channel Islands}}\nEvidence of occupation and wealth has been discovered in the form of [[hoards]]. In 1889, during construction of a house in Saint Helier, a 746-g gold [[torc]] of Irish origin was unearthed. A [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] hoard consisting of 110 implements, mostly spears and swords, was discovered in Saint Lawrence in 1976 - probably a smith's stock. Hoards of coins were discovered at La Marquanderie, in Saint Brelade, Le C\u00e2tel, in Trinity, and Le C\u00e2tillon, in Grouville (1957).<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">Balleine's History of Jersey, Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, two [[metal detectorist]]s announced that they had uncovered what could be Europe's largest [[Grouville Hoard|hoard]] of [[Iron Age]] [[Celtic coinage|Celtic coins]]. 70,000 late Iron Age and Roman coins.

The tradition that the island was called ''Caesarea'' by the Romans appears to have no basis in fact. The Roman name for the Channel Islands was ''I. Lenuri'' (Lenur Islands)<ref name=\"GRTV\">{{cite book |last=Rule |first=Margaret |title=A Gallo-Roman Trading Vessel from Guernsey |publisher=Guernsey Museums & Galleries |ISBN=978-1871560039}}</ref>{{rp|4}} and were occupied by the [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] during their migration to Brittany (5th-6th century).\n\nVarious saints such as the [[Celts]] [[Samson of Dol]] and [[Branwalator]] (Brelade) were active in the region. Tradition has it that [[Helier|Saint Helier]] from [[Tongeren]] in modern-day Belgium first brought Christianity to the island in the 6th century, part of the walls of the [[Fishermen's Chapel]] dates from this period and [[Charlemagne]] sent his emissary to the island (at that time called ''Angia'', also spelt ''Agna'')<ref>{{cite web | title = History of stamps | publisher = [[Jersey Post]] | url = http://www.jerseypost.com/jppage.aspx?id=170 | accessdate = 2006-10-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022131444/http://www.jerseypost.com/jppage.aspx?id=170 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-22}}</ref> in 803. A chapel built around 911, now forms part of the nave of the [[Parish Church of St Clement]].\n\n==Normans==\nThe island took the name Jersey as a result of [[Viking]] activity in the area between the 9th and 10th centuries. The Channel Islands remained politically linked to [[Brittany]] until 933, when [[William I of Normandy|William Longsword]], [[Duke of Normandy]] seized the [[Cotentin peninsula|Cotentin]] and the islands and added them to his domain; in 1066, Duke [[William I of England|William II]] of [[Normandy]] defeated [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] at [[Battle of Hastings|Hastings]] to become king of England; however, he continued to rule his French possessions as a separate entity,<ref>{{cite web | title = A Short Constitutional History of Jersey | publisher = Voisin & Co | date = 1999-05-18 | url = http://www.voisinlaw.com/default.asp?contentID=368 | accessdate = 2009-06-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206062513/http://www.voisinlaw.com/default.asp?contentID=368 | archive-date = 2010-12-06 | url-status = dead }}</ref> as [[fealty]] was owed as a Duke, to the King of France.\n\nAccording to the Rolls of the Norman Exchequer, in 1180 Jersey was divided for administrative purposes into three ministeria:<ref>{{cite book |last=Stapleton |first=Thomas |title=Magni rotuli scaccarii Normanni\u00e6 sub regibus Angli\u00e6 |date=1840}}</ref> ''de Gorroic'', ''de Groceio'' and ''de Crapau Doit'' (possibly containing four parishes each).<ref name=\"BHJ\">{{cite book |last=Syvret |first=Marguerite |title=Balleine\u2019s History of Jersey |publisher= The History Press  |date=2011 |ISBN= 978-1860776502 }}</ref>{{rp|23}} This was a time of building or extending churches with most parish churches in the island being built/rebuilt in a Norman style chosen by the abbey or priory to which each church had been granted.

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] (1259), the King of France gave up claim to the Channel Islands. The claim was based upon his position as feudal overlord of the Duke of Normandy. The King of England gave up claim to mainland Normandy and appointed a Warden, a position now termed [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]] and a [[bailiff]] to govern in his stead. The Channel Islands were never absorbed into the Kingdom of England. However the churches in Jersey were left under the control of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances|Diocese of Coutances]] for another 300 years.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe existing Norman customs and laws were allowed to continue, with the exception that the ultimate head of the legal system was the King of England rather than the Duke of Normandy. There was no attempt to introduce English law. The law was conducted through 12 jurats, constables (''conn\u00e9table'') and a bailiff (''Baill\u00e9''). These titles have different meanings and duties to those in England.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|27\u20138}}\n\n[[Mont Orgueil]] castle was built at this time to serve as a royal fortress and military base. This was needed as the Island had few defences and had previously been suppressed by a fleet commanded by a French exile, [[Eustace the Monk]] working with the English King until in 1212 he changed sides and raided the Channel Islands on behalf of the French King.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|25\u20138}} A \"warden\" was appointed to represent the King in the island, this title sometimes called \"Captain\" and later became \"Governor\" of the island, the duties were primarily military with the power to represent the King to appoint a bailiff who was normally an islander.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|32}} Any oppression by a bailiff or a warden was to be resolved locally or failing that, by appeal to the King who appointed commissioners to report on disputes.\n\nDuring the [[Hundred Years' War]], the island was attacked many times <ref>Including twice in the [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|1338-39 Channel campaign]]</ref> resulting in the formal creation of the [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey|Island Militia]] in 1337, which was compulsory for the next 600 years for all men of military age. In March 1338, a French force landed on Jersey, intent on capturing the island.<ref>Watts (2007), pp. 8-17</ref> Although the island was overrun, Mont Orgueil remained in English hands.<ref>Ford (2004), pp. 18\u201325</ref> The French remained until September, when they sailed off to conquer Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark. In 1339, the French returned, allegedly with 8,000 men in 17 [[Genoa|Genoese]] galleys and 35 French ships. Again, they failed to take the castle and, after causing damage, withdrew.<ref>Ford (2004), p. 22</ref>\n\nIt was 1348 when the [[Black Death]] reached the Island, ravaging the population. The change in England to a written language in \"English\" was not taken up in Jersey, where Norman-French continued until the 20th-century.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|44}} In July 1373, [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] overran Jersey and besieged Mont Orgueil. His troops succeeded in breaching the outer defences, forcing the garrison back to the keep. The garrison came to an agreement that they would surrender if not relieved by [[Michaelmas]] and du Guesclin sailed back to Brittany, leaving a small force to carry on the siege. An English relief fleet arrived in time.<ref>Ford (2004), p. 23</ref> On 7 October 1406, 1,000 French men at arms led by Pero Nino, a Castilian nobleman turned corsair, invaded Jersey, landing at St Aubin's Bay and defeated the 3,000 defenders but failed to capture the island.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|50\u20131}}\n\nThe rise of [[Joan of Arc]] inspired France to evict the English from mainland France, with the exception of Calais, putting Jersey back in the front line.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|54}} The French did not succeed in capturing Jersey during the Hundred Years' War, but by taking advantage of the split in England during the [[Wars of the Roses]] captured Mont Orgueil in the summer of 1461, allegedly as part of a secret deal between [[Margaret of Anjou]] and [[Pierre de Br\u00e9z\u00e9]] to gain French support for the Lancastrian cause. The island was held by the French until 1468, when Yorkist forces and [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey|local militia]] were able to recapture the castle.<ref>Watts (2004), pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nDue to the island's strategic importance to the English crown, the islanders were able to negotiate, over a number of centuries, the right to retain privileges and improve on certain benefits, such as trade rights, from the King.\n\n==Reformation to the civil war==\nDuring the 16th century, ideas of the reformation of the church coupled with the split with the Catholic Faith by [[Henry VIII of England]], resulted in the islanders adopting the [[Protestant]] religion, in 1569 the churches moved under the control of the [[Diocese of Winchester]].<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|81}} [[Calvinism]] in Jersey meant that life became very austere. Laws were strictly enforced, punishment for wrong doers was severe, but education was improved.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|83\u20136}}\n\nThe excommunication of [[Elizabeth I of England]] by the Pope increased the military threat to the island and the increasing use of gunpowder on the battlefield meant that the fortifications on the island had to be adapted. A new fortress was built to defend [[Saint Aubin, Jersey|St Aubin's Bay]], the new [[Elizabeth Castle]] was named after the queen by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] when he was governor. The island militia was reorganised on a parish basis and each parish had two cannon which were usually housed in the church - one of the [[Saint Peter, Jersey|St Peter]] cannon can still be seen at the bottom of Beaumont Hill.\n\n[[Image:Map of Jersey by G Mercator 1639..JPG|thumb|250px|This map of Jersey, published in 1639, shows interior details such as Le Mont \u00e8s Pendus (the gallows hill, now called Westmount).

The civil war also divided Jersey, and while the sympathy of islanders lay with Parliament, the de Carterets (see Sir [[George Carteret]] and Sir [[Philippe de Carteret II]]) held the island for the king.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] visited the island in 1646 and again in October 1649 following the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|trial]] and [[execution of Charles I|execution]] of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. In the Royal Square in [[Saint Helier|St. Helier]] on 17 February 1649, Charles was publicly proclaimed king after his father's death (following the first public proclamation in Edinburgh on 5 February 1649).<ref>{{cite book |first=Maija |last=Jansso |title=Art and Diplomacy: Seventeenth-Century English Decorated Royal Letters to Russia and the Far East |publisher=BRILL, 2015 |ISBN=9789004300453 |page=204}}</ref> Parliamentarian forces eventually captured the island in 1651 and Elizabeth Castle seven weeks later.

The Jersey merchants built up a thriving business empire in the Newfoundland and [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula|Gasp\u00e9]] fisheries. Companies such as Robins and the Le Boutilliers set up thriving businesses.\n\n==18th century==\n[[Image:Jersey round tower.jpg|thumb|left|Round towers were built along the coasts to protect the Island from French attack.]]\nBy the 1720s, a discrepancy in coinage values between Jersey and France was threatening economic stability. The States of Jersey therefore resolved to [[Devaluation|devalue]] the [[Liard (coin)|liard]] to six to the [[Sou (coin)|sou]]. The legislation to that effect implemented in 1729 caused popular riots that shook the establishment.<ref>*''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}</ref> The devaluation was therefore cancelled.\n\nThe [[Chamber of Commerce]] founded 24 February 1768 is the oldest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nThe ''Code'' of 1771 laid down for the first time in one place the extant laws of Jersey, and from this time, the functions of the Royal Court and the States of Jersey were delimited, with sole legislative power vested in the States.\n\n[[Methodism]] arrived in Jersey in 1774, brought by fishermen returning from [[Newfoundland]]. Conflict with the authorities ensued when men refused to attend militia drill when that coincided with chapel meetings. The Royal Court attempted to proscribe Methodist meetings, but King George III refused to countenance such interference with liberty of religion. The first Methodist minister in Jersey was appointed in 1783, and [[John Wesley]] preached in Jersey in August 1789, his words being interpreted into the vernacular for the benefit of those from the country parishes. The first building constructed specifically for Methodist worship was erected in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St. Ouen]] in 1809.\n\n[[Image:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'', [[John Singleton Copley]], 1782-1784.]]\n\nThe 18th century was a period of political tension between Britain and France, as the two nations clashed all over the world as their ambitions grew. Because of its position, Jersey was more or less on a continuous war footing.\n\nDuring the [[American Wars of Independence]], two attempted invasions of the island were made. In 1779, the Prince of Orange [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] was prevented from landing at St Ouen's Bay; on 6 January 1781, a force led by [[Baron de Rullecourt]] captured St Helier in a daring dawn raid, but was defeated by a British army led by Major [[Francis Peirson]] in  the [[Battle of Jersey]]. A short-lived peace was followed by the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] which, when they had ended, had changed Jersey forever. In 1799-1800, over 6000 Russian troops under the command of [[Charles du Houx de Viom\u00e9nil]] were quartered in Jersey after an evacuation of Holland.\n\nThe first printing press was introduced to Jersey in 1784.\n\n==19th century==\n[[Image:Jersey cattle judging-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jersey cattle]] were developed as a breed during the 19th century. Judging the quality of cows remains a feature of rural life.]]\n\nThe number of English-speaking soldiers stationed on the island and the number of retired officers and English-speaking labourers who came to the islands in the 1820s led to the island gradually moving towards an English-speaking culture in the town.\n\nThe ''[[livre tournois]]'' had been used as the legal [[currency]] for centuries. However, it was abolished during the [[French Revolution]]ary period. Although the coins were no longer minted, they remained the legal currency in Jersey until 1837, when dwindling supplies and consequent difficulties in trade and payment obliged the adoption of the [[Jersey pound|pound sterling]] as [[legal tender]].\n\nThe military roads constructed (on occasion at gunpoint in the face of opposition from landowners) by the governor, [[George Don (British Army officer)|General George Don]], to link coastal fortifications with St. Helier harbour had an unexpected effect on agriculture once peace restored reliable trade links. Farmers in previously isolated valleys were able to swiftly transport crops grown in the island's [[microclimate]] to waiting ships and then on to the markets of London and Paris ahead of the competition. In conjunction with the introduction of [[steamship]]s and the development of the French and British [[railway]] systems, Jersey's agriculture was no longer as isolated as before.\n\nThe population of Jersey rose rapidly, from 47,544 in 1841 to 56,078 20 years later, despite a 20% mortality rate amongst new born children. Life expectancy was 35 years. Both immigration and emigration increased.<ref name=\"RL\"/>{{rp|186}}\n\nThe town expanded with many new streets and houses in a Georgian style, in 1843 it was agreed to erect street names. The Theatre Royal was built, as were [[Victoria College, Jersey]] in 1852 and extensions to the harbour, which were called Victoria Harbour.<ref name=RL/>{{rp|181\u20135}} Jersey issued its first coins in 1841, and exhibited 34 items at [[The Great Exhibition]] in 1851, the world's first ever [[Pillar box]] was installed in 1852 and a paid police force was created in 1854.<ref name=RL/>{{rp|178\u2013185}}\n\n[[File:Jersey Railway map.png|thumb|250px|Map of the former railway lines of Jersey]]\nTwo railways, the [[Jersey Railway|Jersey Western Railway]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Jersey_Western_Railway|title=Jersey Western Railway - theislandwiki|website=www.theislandwiki.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> in 1870, and the [[Jersey Eastern Railway]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Jersey_Eastern_Railway|title=Jersey Eastern Railway - theislandwiki|website=www.theislandwiki.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> in 1874, were opened.

The population fell slightly in the 20 years to 1881.\n\nIn the late 19th century, as the former thriving [[cider]] and wool industries declined, island farmers benefited from the development of two luxury products - [[Jersey cattle]] and [[Jersey Royal]] potatoes. The former was the product of careful and selective breeding programmes; the latter was a total fluke.\n\nThe anarchist philosopher, [[Peter Kropotkin]], who visited the Channel Islands in 1890, 1896, and 1903, described the agriculture of Jersey in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]''.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the rise of [[tourism]] as an important industry (linked with the improvement in passenger ships)<ref name=RL/>{{rp|196}} which reached its climax in the period from the end of the Second World War to the 1980s.\n\n==20th century==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[New World Tapestry]].

Jersey men served in the British and French armed forces. Numbers of German prisoners of war were interned in Jersey. The influenza epidemic of 1918 added to the toll of war.\n\nIn 1919, [[imperial measurements]] replaced, for the most part, the tradition Jersey system of weights and measures; women aged over 30 were given the vote;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jerseyheritage.org//whats-on/what-s-her-street-s-story-|title=What's Her Street's Story?|last=Heritage|first=Jersey|date=2018-01-31|website=JerseyHeritage.org|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> and the endowments of the ancient grammar schools were repurposed as scholarships for Victoria College.\n\nIn 1921, the visit of King [[George V]] was the occasion for the design of the parish crests.\n\nIn 1923, the British government asked Jersey to contribute an annual sum towards the costs of the Empire.

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] (1259), the King of France gave up claim to the Channel Islands. The claim was based upon his position as feudal overlord of the Duke of Normandy. The King of England gave up claim to mainland Normandy and appointed a Warden, a position now termed [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]] and a [[bailiff]] to govern in his stead.

The Jersey merchants built up a thriving business empire in the Newfoundland and [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula|Gasp\u00e9]] fisheries. Companies such as Robins and the Le Boutilliers set up thriving businesses.\n\n==18th century==\n[[Image:Jersey round tower.jpg|thumb|left|Round towers were built along the coasts to protect the Island from French attack.]]\nBy the 1720s, a discrepancy in coinage values between Jersey and France was threatening economic stability. The States of Jersey therefore resolved to [[Devaluation|devalue]] the [[Liard (coin)|liard]] to six to the [[Sou (coin)|sou]]. The legislation to that effect implemented in 1729 caused popular riots that shook the establishment.<ref>*''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}</ref> The devaluation was therefore cancelled.\n\nThe [[Chamber of Commerce]] founded 24 February 1768 is the oldest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nThe ''Code'' of 1771 laid down for the first time in one place the extant laws of Jersey, and from this time, the functions of the Royal Court and the States of Jersey were delimited, with sole legislative power vested in the States.\n\n[[Methodism]] arrived in Jersey in 1774, brought by fishermen returning from [[Newfoundland]]. Conflict with the authorities ensued when men refused to attend militia drill when that coincided with chapel meetings. The Royal Court attempted to proscribe Methodist meetings, but King George III refused to countenance such interference with liberty of religion. The first Methodist minister in Jersey was appointed in 1783, and [[John Wesley]] preached in Jersey in August 1789, his words being interpreted into the vernacular for the benefit of those from the country parishes. The first building constructed specifically for Methodist worship was erected in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St. Ouen]] in 1809.\n\n[[Image:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'', [[John Singleton Copley]], 1782-1784.]]\n\nThe 18th century was a period of political tension between Britain and France, as the two nations clashed all over the world as their ambitions grew. Because of its position, Jersey was more or less on a continuous war footing.\n\nDuring the [[American Wars of Independence]], two attempted invasions of the island were made. In 1779, the Prince of Orange [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] was prevented from landing at St Ouen's Bay; on 6 January 1781, a force led by [[Baron de Rullecourt]] captured St Helier in a daring dawn raid, but was defeated by a British army led by Major [[Francis Peirson]] in  the [[Battle of Jersey]]. A short-lived peace was followed by the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] which, when they had ended, had changed Jersey forever. In 1799-1800, over 6000 Russian troops under the command of [[Charles du Houx de Viom\u00e9nil]] were quartered in Jersey after an evacuation of Holland.\n\nThe first printing press was introduced to Jersey in 1784.\n\n==19th century==\n[[Image:Jersey cattle judging-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jersey cattle]] were developed as a breed during the 19th century.

However, it was abolished during the [[French Revolution]]ary period. Although the coins were no longer minted, they remained the legal currency in Jersey until 1837, when dwindling supplies and consequent difficulties in trade and payment obliged the adoption of the [[Jersey pound|pound sterling]] as [[legal tender]].\n\nThe military roads constructed (on occasion at gunpoint in the face of opposition from landowners) by the governor, [[George Don (British Army officer)|General George Don]], to link coastal fortifications with St. Helier harbour had an unexpected effect on agriculture once peace restored reliable trade links. Farmers in previously isolated valleys were able to swiftly transport crops grown in the island's [[microclimate]] to waiting ships and then on to the markets of London and Paris ahead of the competition. In conjunction with the introduction of [[steamship]]s and the development of the French and British [[railway]] systems, Jersey's agriculture was no longer as isolated as before.\n\nThe population of Jersey rose rapidly, from 47,544 in 1841 to 56,078 20 years later, despite a 20% mortality rate amongst new born children. Life expectancy was 35 years.

A number of banks on Jersey, guarantors of an industry both onshore and off, failed in 1873<ref name=RL/>{{rp|193}} and 1886, even causing strife and discord in far-flung societies. The population fell slightly in the 20 years to 1881.\n\nIn the late 19th century, as the former thriving [[cider]] and wool industries declined, island farmers benefited from the development of two luxury products - [[Jersey cattle]] and [[Jersey Royal]] potatoes. The former was the product of careful and selective breeding programmes; the latter was a total fluke.\n\nThe anarchist philosopher, [[Peter Kropotkin]], who visited the Channel Islands in 1890, 1896, and 1903, described the agriculture of Jersey in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]''.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the rise of [[tourism]] as an important industry (linked with the improvement in passenger ships)<ref name=RL/>{{rp|196}} which reached its climax in the period from the end of the Second World War to the 1980s.\n\n==20th century==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[New World Tapestry]].

The years before the First World War saw the foundation of cultural institutions, the Battle of Flowers and the Jersey Eisteddfod. The first aeroplanes arrived in Jersey in 1912.\n\nIn 1914, the British garrison was withdrawn at the start of the war and the militia were mobilised. Jersey men served in the British and French armed forces. Numbers of German prisoners of war were interned in Jersey. The influenza epidemic of 1918 added to the toll of war.\n\nIn 1919, [[imperial measurements]] replaced, for the most part, the tradition Jersey system of weights and measures; women aged over 30 were given the vote;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jerseyheritage.org//whats-on/what-s-her-street-s-story-|title=What's Her Street's Story?|last=Heritage|first=Jersey|date=2018-01-31|website=JerseyHeritage.org|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> and the endowments of the ancient grammar schools were repurposed as scholarships for Victoria College.\n\nIn 1921, the visit of King [[George V]] was the occasion for the design of the parish crests.\n\nIn 1923, the British government asked Jersey to contribute an annual sum towards the costs of the Empire. The States of Jersey refused and offered instead a one-off contribution to war costs. After negotiations, Jersey's one-off contribution was accepted.\n\nThe first motor car had arrived in 1899, and by the 1930s, competition from motor buses had rendered the railways unprofitable, with final closure coming in 1935 (except for the later German reintroduction of rail during the military occupation).

Twenty died as a result. The islanders endured near-starvation in the winter of 1944-45, after the Channel Islands had been cut off from German-occupied Europe by Allied forces advancing from the Normandy beachheads, avoided only by the arrival of the [[Red Cross]] supply ship ''Vega'' in December 1944.
