In 1966, Cole won the [[British Amateur]] at [[Carnoustie]], [[Scotland]], at age 18, the youngest winner to that stage.

During the event Cole shot back-to-back rounds of 66, setting and then matching the course record at [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]].\n\nCole held the record at age 18 for youngest winner of the [[British Amateur]], until [[Matteo Manassero]] won the Amateur in 2009, at age 16.
