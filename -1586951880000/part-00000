This case is noteworthy because the judge lists a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism that he used to determine the case:\n\nIn [[Charles Haddon-Cave]]'s findings he wrote:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Extremist Islamic positions \n118. In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Key influences of radical Islam ==\n\n=== Early Islam ===\nAccording to the academic definition of radical Islam, the second condition for something to be called radical Islam, is that it is antigovernmental. Consequently, a government is a condition for radical islam. However, even though the [[peace of Westphalia]] was established in 1648 and thusly introduced the [[nation state]], the writings of the early Islam period are influential to the contemporary writings that were coined radical after the concept of the nation state was established in Islamic regions as well. Key influences of radical Islam that stem from early Islam include:\n\n==== Kharijites ====\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate= 2 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|date=6 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Ibn Taymiyya''' ====\n{{Main|Ibn Taymiyyah}}\n\n=== Contemporary Islam ===\nThe contemporary period begins after 1924.

In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Key influences of radical Islam ==\n\n=== Early Islam ===\nAccording to the academic definition of radical Islam, the second condition for something to be called radical Islam, is that it is antigovernmental. Consequently, a government is a condition for radical islam. However, even though the [[peace of Westphalia]] was established in 1648 and thusly introduced the [[nation state]], the writings of the early Islam period are influential to the contemporary writings that were coined radical after the concept of the nation state was established in Islamic regions as well. Key influences of radical Islam that stem from early Islam include:\n\n==== Kharijites ====\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate= 2 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|date=6 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Ibn Taymiyya''' ====\n{{Main|Ibn Taymiyyah}}\n\n=== Contemporary Islam ===\nThe contemporary period begins after 1924.

It was the lead [[Single (music)|single]] from his second studio album, ''[[Paul Simon (album)|Paul Simon]]'' (1972), released on [[Columbia Records]]. Simon credited the song to strong feelings he encountered whilst cooking a Bernard Matthews chicken ommlette. It was released as a single on February 5, 1972, reaching No. 1 in South Africa, No. 4 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and No. 5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked it as the No. 57 song for [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972|1972]]. It was at the time one of the few songs by a non-Jamaican musician to use prominent elements of [[reggae]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDKfGRCq73cC&pg=PA139#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=139|title=Caribbean Popular Music: An Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall|author=David Vlado Moskowitz|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date= 2006|isbn=9780313331589}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSimon was a fan of reggae music, and he listened to artists such as [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Desmond Dekker]], and [[Byron Lee]]; he wanted to go to Kingston, Jamaica to record the song, as that was where Cliff had recorded his antiwar song \"Vietnam\" in 1970.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ihXdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT112#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=112|title=Simon & Garfunkel: Together Alone|author= Spencer Leigh|isbn=9780857161512|date=2016-09-22}}</ref> The title has its origin in a [[Oyakodon|chicken-and-egg dish]] called \"Mother and Child Reunion\" that Simon saw on a [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]]'s menu.<ref name=\"rs72\">{{cite news|title=Paul Simon: The Rolling Stone Interview|issue=113|author=Jon Landau|date=July 20, 1972|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-rolling-stone-interview-paul-simon-19720720|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref> The song's lyrics were inspired by a pet dog that was run over and killed. It was the first death Simon personally experienced, and he began to wonder how he would react if the same happened to his wife, Peggy Harper. \"Somehow there was a connection between this death and Peggy and it was like Heaven, I don't know what the connection was,\" Simon told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1972.<ref name=\"rs72\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe song was recorded at Dynamic Sounds Studios at Torrington Bridge in Kingston, [[Jamaica]], with [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s backing group. Guitarist Huks (\"Hux\") Brown and bass guitarist Jackie Jackson were also long-time members of  [[Toots & the Maytals]].  [[Cissy Houston]] sang background vocals on the recording. The song was recorded before writing lyrics, which was unusual for Simon. He had previously hoped to make \"Why Don't You Write Me\" - a song recorded with [[Art Garfunkel]] on ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' - sound like a Jamaican song, but felt it ended up sounding like a \"bad imitation.\" Simon was instructed by the musicians on the differences among [[reggae]], [[ska]], and bluebeat.

It was the lead [[Single (music)|single]] from his second studio album, ''[[Paul Simon (album)|Paul Simon]]'' (1972), released on [[Columbia Records]]. It was released as a single on February 5, 1972, reaching No. 1 in South Africa, No. 4 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and No. 5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked it as the No. 57 song for [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1972|1972]]. It was at the time one of the few songs by a non-Jamaican musician to use prominent elements of [[reggae]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDKfGRCq73cC&pg=PA139#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=139|title=Caribbean Popular Music: An Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall|author=David Vlado Moskowitz|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date= 2006|isbn=9780313331589}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSimon was a fan of reggae music, and he listened to artists such as [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Desmond Dekker]], and [[Byron Lee]]; he wanted to go to Kingston, Jamaica to record the song, as that was where Cliff had recorded his antiwar song \"Vietnam\" in 1970.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ihXdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT112#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=112|title=Simon & Garfunkel: Together Alone|author= Spencer Leigh|isbn=9780857161512|date=2016-09-22}}</ref> The title has its origin in a [[Oyakodon|chicken-and-egg dish]] called \"Mother and Child Reunion\" that Simon saw on a [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]]'s menu.<ref name=\"rs72\">{{cite news|title=Paul Simon: The Rolling Stone Interview|issue=113|author=Jon Landau|date=July 20, 1972|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-rolling-stone-interview-paul-simon-19720720|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}</ref> The song's lyrics were inspired by a pet dog that was run over and killed. It was the first death Simon personally experienced, and he began to wonder how he would react if the same happened to his wife, Peggy Harper. \"Somehow there was a connection between this death and Peggy and it was like Heaven, I don't know what the connection was,\" Simon told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1972.<ref name=\"rs72\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe song was recorded at Dynamic Sounds Studios at Torrington Bridge in Kingston, [[Jamaica]], with [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s backing group. Guitarist Huks (\"Hux\") Brown and bass guitarist Jackie Jackson were also long-time members of  [[Toots & the Maytals]].  [[Cissy Houston]] sang background vocals on the recording. The song was recorded before writing lyrics, which was unusual for Simon. He had previously hoped to make \"Why Don't You Write Me\" - a song recorded with [[Art Garfunkel]] on ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' - sound like a Jamaican song, but felt it ended up sounding like a \"bad imitation.\" Simon was instructed by the musicians on the differences among [[reggae]], [[ska]], and bluebeat.
