Peggy was initially played by [[Jo Warne]] when she first appeared in the episode broadcast on 30 April 1991, featuring in 10 episodes. Peggy was reintroduced in 1994, recast to [[Barbara Windsor]], who made her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 7 November 1994. Peggy became a regular character, and Windsor played the role until she was forced to take a long break due to poor health and departed on 23 May 2003. She returned for two episodes broadcast on 16 and 17 September 2004, before rejoining as a regular character on 8 September 2005. Windsor announced in October 2009 that she would be leaving the show and departed on 10 September 2010. Windsor returned to the show for guest appearances on 20 September 2013, 25 September 2014, 17 February 2015 (as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations; see [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]]) and 15 January 2016. She then appeared in six episodes between 9 and 17 May 2016 and the character was killed-off. Her voice is last heard in the following episode, on 19 May 2016. Peggy's funeral aired on 4 July 2016.\n\nPeggy is fiercely protective of her family and the Mitchell name, and has become famous for her catchphrase \"Get outta my pub!\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article685854.ece|title=Washed out diva |last=Teeman|first=Tim|date=12 July 2006|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International#Times Newspapers|Times Newspapers Limited]]|accessdate=2 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> used when ejecting people from [[The Queen Victoria]], of which she is the landlady. Her storylines have seen her embark on a series of failed romances, including marriages to colleague [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and then brother-in-law [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She has been central to several plot strands revolving around health issues, launching a hate campaign against the [[HIV positive]] character [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), and going on to make amends with him when she is later diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Though she recovers from her cancer, it later returns and leads to her suicide. ''[[Inside Soap]]'' named Peggy the UK's top soap matriarch in 2009.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Backstory===\nPeggy married Eric Mitchell because she was pregnant with their son [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). By then Eric grew to be a keen boxer, he worked for a gangland boss: [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]). This impacted the marriage as Johnny constantly taunted Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric fell in love with a glamorous woman called Maureen Loftus and planned to elope with her, but he changed his mind at the last minute - unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a [[Post Office]] robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), who he also intended to run away with, but he changed his mind again, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother [[Archie Mitchell|Archie]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) because he was there for Peggy when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 \u2013 her only daughter [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Samantha]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]; [[Kim Medcalf]]). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when [[Kevin Masters (EastEnders)|Kevin Masters]] ([[Colin McCormack]]) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, where they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n===1991===\nPeggy makes her first appearance in Albert Square when her son, Grant, decides to reenlist with the army and returns when her daughter Sam's desire to escape from her family causes her to elope with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), at the age of sixteen. Peggy, along with Kevin, tries to persuade Sam that getting married at the age of sixteen will ruin her life, but she is unsuccessful. Peggy later accepts Sam and Ricky's relationship and leaves, after giving the couple her blessing.\n\n===1994{{ndash}}2010===\nPeggy is not seen for three years, during which time her relationship with Kevin ends. She returns to [[Walford]] when her sons fall out after Phil's affair with Grant's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), is revealed. Peggy becomes acting [[landlady]] of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] and blames Sharon for the affair. Peggy tries to force her out of Walford, resulting in Sharon signing over her share of the pub and leaving the [[Mitchell family]] as the sole owners, with Peggy in charge.\n\nPeggy starts dating businessman [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]]), unaware that he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) when she discovers he is [[HIV|HIV positive]] and begins a feud with his mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he will not be able to handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a [[lumpectomy]]. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a [[mastectomy]], but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for [[Rio de Janeiro]] after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently argue over the running of The Queen Vic, ending with Dan insulting Frank's daughter [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), resulting in Frank punching Dan across the face. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), so she shames them by reading Frank's [[Dear John letter|Dear Jane letter]] to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes [[clinical depression|depressed]] and begins to rely heavily on [[tranquilliser]]s. When Janine taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a [[baseball bat]]. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover the new owner is Sharon.\n\nPeggy begins dating [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), who owns a bar in Spain and convinces her to move there with him. They become engaged but break up when it is revealed that Harry is guilty of sexually abusing his niece [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and is therefore the father of Kat's teenage daughter, [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]). When Phil begins dating Sharon again and becomes joint owner of The Queen Vic, Peggy moves back in. She later becomes sole licensee again when Sharon sells her half of the pub back to her. Peggy is briefly reunited with Frank when she travels to Spain to attend his funeral. She discovers he faked his own death to avoid creditors. While she's in Spain, she shockingly finds Sam working as a lap dancer and takes her home. Peggy later decides to move to [[Brazil]] to be with Grant but visits Walford for Sam's wedding to [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) before returning to Brazil.\n\nWhen Peggy returns to Walford in 2005, she is furious to discover Sam has lost possession of The Queen Vic, and that the new licensee [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) has framed Sam for her husband [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) murder. While trying to exonerate Sam and reclaim ownership of the pub, Peggy ignites a feud with Johnny, who also wishes to buy The Queen Vic. Johnny hires a mobster to assault Peggy, but she is saved by her sons, Phil and Grant. They are able to deal with Johnny, secure Sam's release from prison, and return Peggy to The Queen Vic. Peggy begins a romance with [[Jack Edwards (EastEnders)|Jack Edwards]] ([[Nicky Henson]]), the father-in-law of Peggy's relative [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]). However, when Peggy discovers Billy's newborn daughter, [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace), has [[Down's syndrome]], she declares that the baby should be put up for [[adoption]], causing friction in her relationship with Jack. Although Peggy comes to accept the baby, Jack breaks up with her and leaves Walford.\n\nPeggy begins a relationship with her brother-in-law, Archie, father of [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]). They get engaged and Archie begins subtly controlling Peggy. They marry, but it ends a few hours later when it is revealed that Archie lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter's death. Peggy has Archie evicted from The Queen Vic, and tries unsuccessfully to coerce Phil into murdering him. Peggy files for divorce and Archie plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam (who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from Archie), the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Vic to gain a collateral loan from [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Archie uses Janine to blackmail Ian into selling him the loan, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet the loan repayment, Archie evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, Archie is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]). Peggy grieves for Archie, but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknown to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley's wife, [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), after Archie raped her. In his will, Archie leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.\n\nAfter being disgusted with the state of the Square and learning that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist [[Harvey Freeman (EastEnders)|Harvey Freeman]] ([[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]]). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter [[Louise Mitchell]] (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother, [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub (see [[Queen Vic Fire Week]]). Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes one last look at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.\n\n===2013\u20132016===\nIn January 2012, Peggy misses Pat's funeral as she is on a cruise, and in 2013, Phil visits Peggy in Cornwall with Ben's baby daughter, [[Lexi Pearce]] (Dotti-Beau Cotterill). Three months later, Peggy flies into London to visit Phil in hospital, and encourages him to get rid of [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) - an ex-conman who seeks to take over the Mitchell business empire. After, she visits Pat's old house, and leaves a bottle of gin on the doorstep as a way of saying goodbye. In September 2014, Peggy appears in Portugal, telling Ronnie to go back to Walford and stop Phil from marrying Sharon. In February 2015, Peggy returns to the square to confront [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), after her son [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) cut the brakes on a car and falsely incriminated Phil. She is also in on the secret that Ben's mother and Phil's ex-wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), faked her own death ten years ago and wants to return to Walford. Before returning to Portugal, Peggy visits The Queen Vic and meets its new landlord, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), who tells her to \"get out of my pub\" (which Peggy was known for saying as landlady).\n\nIn January 2016, Phil calls Peggy's older sister, [[Aunt Sal|Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]), wanting Louise's (now played by [[Tilly Keeper]]) address, and when he goes to her house, Peggy is there, having returned a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of the liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try to make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.\n\nSharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She tells them both she will not kill herself, and after settling old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend, Pat. She decides she wants to be remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, so takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016. Phil is due to give a eulogy to her there, but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.\n\n==Creation==\nPeggy was introduced as a guest character in April 1991, by executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]]. The character was brought in as the mother of the already established Mitchell clan: [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Specifically, she played a key role in a storyline about the elopement of her daughter Sam with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Peggy was played by actress Jo Warne for a period of three months, but was written out upon the completion of the storyline. Two other actresses had been cast in the part before Warne. The first quit before she could film any scenes, and the second filmed eight episodes, though all of her scenes were scrapped before broadcast.<ref name=RT>{{cite news|author= ''Radio Times'' staff|date= 2\u20138 January 2010|title= 10 For 2010|work= Radio Times|publisher= BBC Magazines|page= 19}}</ref>\n\nThe character did not make another appearance until 7 November 1994, when she was reintroduced by series producer [[Barbara Emile]] as a regular character. The actress was recast, the role being taken over by Barbara Windsor, already well known to viewers as a comic actress, notably appearing in the long-running [[Carry On films|''Carry On'' films]]. Scott Matthewman of ''[[The Stage]]'' commented on the recast in 2006: \"Quite the biggest \u2013 and most inexplicable \u2013 transformation is that of Peggy Mitchell in ''EastEnders''. While Barbara Windsor has dominated the role...first appearing in [1994], the character had appeared briefly [three] years earlier, played by Jo Warne, a lady who physically is as different from our Babs as it's possible to get.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |title=The changing face of soap acting |work=[[The Stage]] |publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited |first=Scott |last=Matthewman |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611120102/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSteve McFadden and Ross Kemp had attempted to persuade ''EastEnders'' writer [[Tony Jordan]] to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her.<ref name=RT/> Windsor had previously expressed a desire to join the cast of ''EastEnders''. Chat show host [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial.<ref name=\"WG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wgazette.com/int-windsor.html|title=Carry On Babs|first=Tim|last=Wilson|work=Walford Gazette|accessdate=22 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405215947/http://www.wgazette.com/int-windsor.html|archive-date=5 April 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> June Deitch, the ''EastEnders'' casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would \"like to play my own age for a change\".<ref name=\"WG\"/> At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too \"well-known\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/barbara-windsor-the-comeback-queen-505446.html|title= Barbara Windsor: The comeback Queen|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]] | first= Neil |last=Norman| date = 4 September 2005| accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> Windsor has spoken of her \"terrified\" reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: \"I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time.

Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>  In an interview with the ''Walford Gazette'', a US-based newspaper dedicated to ''EastEnders'', Windsor commented on her casting: \"I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [of] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/>\n\nWindsor has been described as the biggest \"name\" that ''EastEnders'' has ever added to its cast, and her arrival came at a time in the show's history that has been branded its \"worst creative period\".<ref name=\"WG\"/> Mark Lawson for ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that Windsor's casting was intended to combat low ratings, commenting: \"The Windsor initiative seems to be a direct response to suggestions that ''EastEnders'' has become too gloomy: a view heavily advanced by [[Roy Hattersley]], former deputy leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and fan of the BBC series' rival on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Certainly, Miss Windsor has been associated throughout her career with the lighter touch.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/struggling-eastenders-to-carry-on-with-windsor-1446306.html|title=Struggling 'Eastenders' to carry on with Windsor |last=Lawson|first=Mark|date=3 September 1994|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> According to Windsor, 27 million viewers watched her first appearance as Peggy on-screen.<ref name=\"WG\"/> Mark Lawson for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' has stated that five million extra viewers watched her first scenes, reporting that initially: \"The critics said that she lacked the 'brassiness and vulnerability' for soap acting and that, stripped of her bubbly image, 'nothing much of interest was revealed'. Ironically, viewers complained that she was too upmarket.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> Windsor has commented of the impact of her pre-existing celebrity status:\n\n{{cquote|[[Wendy Richard]] [who played [[Pauline Fowler]]] certainly had name value but I suppose it was regarded differently because she was part of the original cast. When I was brought on [to ''EastEnders''] the press made such a big deal. They made it seem like I was brought on to 'save' ''EastEnders'' or something, which was ridiculous...the show decided to move into the \"[[Sharongate]]\" storyline, which gave it an enormous push, creatively and ratings-wise. Peggy was brought on as an extension of the Sharongate story because she was Phil and Grant's mum. I understand why the show was uneasy about bringing on any really well known actors because they want the audience [to] believe in and identify with the character without having any of the actor's baggage in their heads...<ref name=\"WG\"/>}}\n\n===Characterisation===\n{{listen\n | filename     = Get outta my pub!.ogg\n | title        = \"Get outta my pub!\"\n | description  = Peggy's famous catchphrase, from the 1 April 2008 episode of ''EastEnders''.\n | format       = Ogg\n}}\nHilary Kingsley, author of ''The EastEnders Handbook'' (1991), has described Peggy as tough, with a \"knack for getting her own way\". She adds, \"Peggy likes to think she looks much younger [than she is]. She's flash, fast-talking and nobody's fool. She has always done things her own way, and heaven help anyone who crosses her, though her bark's usually worse than her bite.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |date=31 October 1991|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=978-0563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windsor took over the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, \"a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely superficial level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> However, early in 1995, ''EastEnders'' acquired a new executive producer, [[Corinne Hollingworth]], who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was \"not going to be allowed to just sit in some flat polishing her nails\".<ref name=\"WG\"/> Windsor has said: \"It was like a dream. [Hollingworth] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed to be a lot more flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...\".<ref name=\"WG\"/>\n\nWindsor has described Peggy as \"from the old school, the generation which doesn't put up with rubbish from anybody...She can get through practically anything because she's tough, tough, tough.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> The character has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of ''EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square'', as a matriarch, assuming \"papal infallibility.

I drew on all of those experiences.\"<ref name=\"transcript\"/> In a 2009 radio interview with [[Dale Winton]], Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]], who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.<ref>{{cite interview |title= Barbara Windsor Interview |last=  |first=  |interviewer= [[Dale Winton]] |work=[[Steve Wright in the Afternoon]] |publisher= [[BBC Radio 2]] |date= 24 July 2009 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nPeggy has been central to numerous high-profile storylines, including a battle with [[breast cancer]], a failed marriage to Frank Butcher, and various business and family upsets.<ref name=\"break\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2352193.stm|title=Windsor plans EastEnders break|publisher=BBC News | date = 23 October 2002| accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Breast cancer===\nIn 1996, Peggy featured in a storyline about [[breast cancer]]. It was the first time that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though the issue was covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting [[Mammography|breast cancer screening]], when [[Sue Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]]) discovered a lump on her breast, which turned out to be benign.\n\nPeggy's breast cancer storyline was devised at the suggestion of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea \"that had been knocking about for a long time.\"<ref name=\"social\">{{cite book |first= Lesley|last=Henderson|title= Social Issues in Television Fiction|year=2001|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|isbn=978-0-7486-2532-1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8l_TcZfmuDoC&pg=PA80&dq=eastenders+breast+cancer#PPA80,M1|chapter=A Woman's Disease: Breast Cancer|pages=76\u201392|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref> In Lesley Henderson's book, ''Social Issues in Television Fiction'', an ''EastEnders'' researcher explains that: \"A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material\", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with.<ref name=\"social\"/> The programme sought expert advice on \"storyline visuals\" from a variety of sources including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals.<ref name=\"social\"/> There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: \"''EastEnders'' is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've got to be careful to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development.\"<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\nProducers decided to use Peggy in the breast cancer storyline, conforming to a soap opera tradition of reserving strong roles for a firmly established middle-aged matriarch.<ref name=\"social\"/> The audience were familiar with Peggy's history, knew that her first husband had died from cancer, consequently making her fear hospitals, and she had: \"the right mentality for [the story theme], which was about 'a woman who discovers a lump and then refuses to accept that anything's wrong'. An added factor was that in choosing Peggy the programme could avoid appearing too issue driven, and [the] storyline could be used as a device to expand and develop her characterisation.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, as the causes of breast cancer are not attributable to risky behaviour, the disease was deemed \"more attractive\" in storyline terms. A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explains:\n\n{{cquote|If you take a character who smokes and they get [[lung cancer]] that would seem too issue-driven. The great thing about a character like Peggy is [her breast cancer was] quite unexpected. At the time there were lots of other issues in her life. She was a character who audiences had only seen pulling pints behind the bar. Suddenly she was in a new environment in a hospital and had a huge medical crisis to go through, so that allowed the character to grow and expand in many ways...There was also fairly major moments [...] with Peggy and [her boyfriend [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]])]. She thought George wouldn't love her any more after she'd had the operation. We were able to use the illness to take them on a new journey.<ref name=\"social\"/>}}\n\nIn the view of the production team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer.<ref name=\"social\"/> In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised ''EastEnders'' for this.<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\n[[File:Ross Kemp.jpg|thumb|[[Ross Kemp]] plays Peggy's son [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]]. The issue of whether Peggy's children would discover her breast cancer was used to build tension and create suspense in the viewing audience.]]\n\nThe storyline used elements of suspense, created by the use of \"shared secrets\" between Peggy and her daughter-in-law [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and whether she would die, but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: \"such devises [added] pathos to Peggy's treatment path. Audiences [knew] that she [was] terrified and about to discover her biopsy results, but must watch as she is casually castigated by her son Grant for pestering his wife Tiffany to accompany her to 'the dentist'.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Hospital scenes were also played for narrative pace to build tension and drama.<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\nBecause \"radical, body-altering\" surgery on a long-running character would cause the production team ongoing problems with continuity, it was decided that Peggy would have a \"less visible\" [[lumpectomy]], rather than a [[mastectomy]]. A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explained: \"We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases.<ref name=\"social\"/> However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the \"all-clear\" at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction.<ref name=\"social\"/> It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy.<ref name=\"mastectomy\">{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,335926,00.html|title=An everyday story of... cancer|first=Sue|last=Arnold|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=26 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> BBC Production chief executive [[Matthew Bannister]] praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: \"It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us and a lot of other people.\"<ref name=\"wedding\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/308079.stm|title=Wedding knees-up in the Square |publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 1999| accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOncology nurses and consultants were involved in the development of the storyline, which was based on a real life case study. In [[Clive Seale]]'s book, ''Health and the Media'', ''EastEnders'' was praised for putting its message across without being \"gruelling\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Clive|last=Seale|title=Health and the Media|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-1244-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-ijQPGT0GcC&pg=PA152&dq=peggy+eastenders#PPA152,M1|page=152|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref> It has also been praised for showing \"potent scenes\" of a woman coming to terms with her diagnosis, scenes that also provided \"rare opportunities\" to portray a cancer patient \"behaving badly\" and depicting \"ambivalent feelings (such as denial or anger)\" \u2014 as it had been noted that cancer patients are typically portrayed in the media as \"beatific, serene figures\".<ref name=\"social\"/> When Peggy had a mastectomy, hundreds of viewers wrote to the BBC to thank producer, [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] for tackling \"a difficult subject so sensitively\".<ref name=\"mastectomy\"/> However, not all viewers were impressed with the storyline. Felicity Smart, who had undergone a mastectomy, wrote to the BBC on behalf of the Breast Carer Support Group at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London to say that emotionally the storyline \"hit the spot\", but medically it was \"hopelessly inaccurate\" as according to Smart: \"No one pulls pints and wisecracks with customers three days after having a mastectomy.\"<ref name=\"mastectomy\"/>\n\n===Marriage to Frank Butcher===\nIn 1998, Peggy was romantically paired on-screen with the character [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]). Their coupling was part of producer Matthew Robinson's plan to place the focus of the soap back on to the Butcher and [[Mitchell family|Mitchell families]], while various other long-running characters were axed following a decline in ratings. The soap was attracting 15.74 million viewers in May 1998, as opposed to rival soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'s'' 16 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980524/ai_n14476271?tag=content;col1|first=Doug|last=Kempster|title=It's Axe-Enders|work=[[The Sunday Pictorial|Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=24 May 1998|accessdate=14 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nPlayed by [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]], Frank had been a regular character in the serial from 1987 to 1994, and had appeared in a recurring role until 1998, when Reid agreed to return full-time. Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special [[two-hander]] episode aired in November 1998, [[List of EastEnders two-hander episodes#Pat and Peggy (27 October 1998)|featuring only Pat and Peggy]] for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy]] ([[Tony Caunter]]), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity. The episode, written by [[Tony Jordan]], featured what the ''[[The Sunday Pictorial|Sunday Mirror]]'' described as one of \"the most vicious fights ever filmed by a soap\",<ref name=\"fight\">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19981025/ai_n14484514?tag=content;col1|title=Take that, Pat \u2013 and hands off Frank|work=[[The Sunday Pictorial|Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=25 October 1998| accessdate=14 August 2008}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> with both throwing glasses at one another and Pat slapping Peggy across the face exclaiming \"You bitch!\" and Peggy responding by slapping Pat exclaiming \"You cow!\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60611962.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021064447/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60611962.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 October 2012|title=Pegged out|first=Charlie|last= Catchpole|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]| date =3 November 1998| accessdate=14 August 2008}}</ref> According to press reports, the fight scene between the characters was \"so powerful that it had to have scenes and dialogue cut so it could be screened before the 9&nbsp;pm watershed.\" Barbara Windsor was reportedly bruised during the filming. Windsor commented, \"The writer didn't want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. When I saw the programme I couldn't believe how good it was. Pam and I were really proud.\" The ''Sunday Mirror'' described it as: \"one of the most impressive episodes of all time\".<ref name=\"fight\"/> In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.\n\nPeggy and Frank were married on-screen on 1 April 1999. A \"hen night\" was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a \"massive\" party in the show's [[Albert Square]] to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in [[Elstree Studios|Elstree]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Windsor admitted she had been so nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, \"I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous \u2013 we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care.\"<ref name=\"wedding\"/> The soap wedding was filmed in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[NW postcode area|North West London]] in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: \"It is one of the best weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married \u2013 Grant being one of them \u2013 and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset.

Windsor has since revealed that she was initially opposed to the storyline:\n\n{{cquote|[Peggy] was vicious to [Mark]. She was so na\u00efve about the whole thing. When I got the script and it said some awful things, I couldn't believe it. It's the only time I've questioned the writers and said 'I can't believe it, people aren't like that today'. Then they sent me a survey and proved that people are actually like that. When it came to doing the scenes, I just got hold of Todd [Carty] and said, 'sorry this is Peggy!' I got the most appalling [hate] mail because of it. I had a very dear friend of mine who was dying of AIDS so it was very personal to me. The last scene I did I went straight out and got terribly drunk.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> }}\n\nActress and writer [[Jacquetta May]], who played the character [[Rachel Kominski]] between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline and the role of women in an article about ''EastEnders''. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, \"a key figure of the community\", was shown to exhibit such \"pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice\". In order for Peggy to be redeemed, she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, \"Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she now knows what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we are all the same, human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although ''EastEnders'' endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied.\"<ref name=\"kominski\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archivedate=29 December 2006|title=Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|first=Jacquetta|last=May|authorlink=Jacquetta May|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has received praise for the handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, it was reported that media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as \"more tragic\" or \"more sexy\" in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50.<ref name=\"social\"/> Source organisations working with ''EastEnders'' on the storyline have commented: \"[The team] decided it was going to be [Peggy] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented \"particularly positive messages\" concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline \"didactic\".<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theanswerbank.co.uk/Article1254.html|title=What other medical issues have been raised by soaps?|first=Katharine|last=MacColl|publisher=Answer Bank|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, [[Bupa]] doctors criticised UK soaps for presenting unhealthy [[role model]]s to viewing audiences.

Peggy was initially played by [[Jo Warne]] when she first appeared in the episode broadcast on 30 April 1991, featuring in 10 episodes. Peggy was reintroduced in 1994, recast to [[Barbara Windsor]], who made her first appearance in the episode broadcast on 7 November 1994. Peggy became a regular character, and Windsor played the role until she was forced to take a long break due to poor health and departed on 23 May 2003. She returned for two episodes broadcast on 16 and 17 September 2004, before rejoining as a regular character on 8 September 2005. Windsor announced in October 2009 that she would be leaving the show and departed on 10 September 2010. Windsor returned to the show for guest appearances on 20 September 2013, 25 September 2014, 17 February 2015 (as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations; see [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]]) and 15 January 2016. She then appeared in six episodes between 9 and 17 May 2016 and the character was killed-off. Her voice is last heard in the following episode, on 19 May 2016. Peggy's funeral aired on 4 July 2016.\n\nPeggy is fiercely protective of her family and the Mitchell name, and has become famous for her catchphrase \"Get outta my pub!\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article685854.ece|title=Washed out diva |last=Teeman|first=Tim|date=12 July 2006|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News International#Times Newspapers|Times Newspapers Limited]]|accessdate=2 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> used when ejecting people from [[The Queen Victoria]], of which she is the landlady. Her storylines have seen her embark on a series of failed romances, including marriages to colleague [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and then brother-in-law [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She has been central to several plot strands revolving around health issues, launching a hate campaign against the [[HIV positive]] character [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), and going on to make amends with him when she is later diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Though she recovers from her cancer, it later returns and leads to her suicide. ''[[Inside Soap]]'' named Peggy the UK's top soap matriarch in 2009.\n\n==Storylines==\n===Backstory===\nPeggy married Eric Mitchell because she was pregnant with their son [[Phil Mitchell]]([[Steve McFadden]]). By then Eric grew to be a keen boxer, he worked for a gangland boss: [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]). This impacted the marriage as Johnny constantly taunted Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric fell in love with a glamorous woman called Maureen Loftus and planned to elope with her, but he changed his mind at the last minute - unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a [[Post Office]] robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), who he also intended to run away with, but he changed his mind again, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother [[Archie Mitchell|Archie]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) because he was there for Peggy when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 \u2013 her only daughter [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Samantha]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]; [[Kim Medcalf]]). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when [[Kevin Masters (EastEnders)|Kevin Masters]] ([[Colin McCormack]]) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, where they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n===1991===\nPeggy makes her first appearance in Albert Square when her son, Grant, decides to reenlist with the army and returns when her daughter Sam's desire to escape from her family causes her to elope with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), at the age of sixteen. Peggy, along with Kevin, tries to persuade Sam that getting married at the age of sixteen will ruin her life, but she is unsuccessful. Peggy later accepts Sam and Ricky's relationship and leaves, after giving the couple her blessing.\n\n===1994{{ndash}}2010===\nPeggy is not seen for three years, during which time her relationship with Kevin ends. She returns to [[Walford]] when her sons fall out after Phil's affair with Grant's wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), is revealed. Peggy becomes acting [[landlady]] of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] and blames Sharon for the affair. Peggy tries to force her out of Walford, resulting in Sharon signing over her share of the pub and leaving the [[Mitchell family]] as the sole owners, with Peggy in charge.\n\nPeggy starts dating businessman [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]]), unaware that he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) when she discovers he is [[HIV|HIV positive]] and begins a feud with his mother [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he will not be able to handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a [[lumpectomy]]. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have a [[mastectomy]], but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for [[Rio de Janeiro]] after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently argue over the running of The Queen Vic, ending with Dan insulting Frank's daughter [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), resulting in Frank punching Dan across the face. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), so she shames them by reading Frank's [[Dear John letter|Dear Jane letter]] to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes [[clinical depression|depressed]] and begins to rely heavily on [[tranquilliser]]s. When Janine taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a [[baseball bat]]. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover the new owner is Sharon.\n\nPeggy begins dating [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), who owns a bar in Spain and convinces her to move there with him. They become engaged but break up when it is revealed that Harry is guilty of sexually abusing his niece [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and is therefore the father of Kat's teenage daughter, [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]). When Phil begins dating Sharon again and becomes joint owner of The Queen Vic, Peggy moves back in. She later becomes sole licensee again when Sharon sells her half of the pub back to her. Peggy is briefly reunited with Frank when she travels to Spain to attend his funeral. She discovers he faked his own death to avoid creditors. While she's in Spain, she shockingly finds Sam working as a lap dancer and takes her home. Peggy later decides to move to [[Brazil]] to be with Grant but visits Walford for Sam's wedding to [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) before returning to Brazil.\n\nWhen Peggy returns to Walford in 2005, she is furious to discover Sam has lost possession of The Queen Vic, and that the new licensee [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) has framed Sam for her husband [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) murder. While trying to exonerate Sam and reclaim ownership of the pub, Peggy ignites a feud with Johnny, who also wishes to buy The Queen Vic. Johnny hires a mobster to assault Peggy, but she is saved by her sons, Phil and Grant. They are able to deal with Johnny, secure Sam's release from prison, and return Peggy to The Queen Vic. Peggy begins a romance with [[Jack Edwards (EastEnders)|Jack Edwards]] ([[Nicky Henson]]), the father-in-law of Peggy's relative [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]). However, when Peggy discovers Billy's newborn daughter, [[Janet Mitchell]] (Grace), has [[Down's syndrome]], she declares that the baby should be put up for [[adoption]], causing friction in her relationship with Jack. Although Peggy comes to accept the baby, Jack breaks up with her and leaves Walford.\n\nPeggy begins a relationship with her brother-in-law, Archie, father of [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]). They get engaged and Archie begins subtly controlling Peggy. They marry, but it ends a few hours later when it is revealed that Archie lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter's death. Peggy has Archie evicted from The Queen Vic, and tries unsuccessfully to coerce Phil into murdering him. Peggy files for divorce and Archie plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam (who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from Archie), the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Vic to gain a collateral loan from [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). Archie uses Janine to blackmail Ian into selling him the loan, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet the loan repayment, Archie evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, Archie is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]). Peggy grieves for Archie, but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknown to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley's wife, [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), after Archie raped her. In his will, Archie leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.\n\nAfter being disgusted with the state of the Square and learning that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist [[Harvey Freeman (EastEnders)|Harvey Freeman]] ([[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]]). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter [[Louise Mitchell]] (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother, [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub (see [[Queen Vic Fire Week]]). Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes one last look at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.\n\n===2013\u20132016===\nIn January 2012, Peggy misses Pat's funeral as she is on a cruise, and in 2013, Phil visits Peggy in Cornwall with Ben's baby daughter, [[Lexi Pearce]] (Dotti-Beau Cotterill). Three months later, Peggy flies into London to visit Phil in hospital, and encourages him to get rid of [[Carl White]] ([[Daniel Coonan]]) - an ex-conman who seeks to take over the Mitchell business empire. After, she visits Pat's old house, and leaves a bottle of gin on the doorstep as a way of saying goodbye. In September 2014, Peggy appears in Portugal, telling Ronnie to go back to Walford and stop Phil from marrying Sharon. In February 2015, Peggy returns to the square to confront [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]), after her son [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) cut the brakes on a car and falsely incriminated Phil. She is also in on the secret that Ben's mother and Phil's ex-wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), faked her own death ten years ago and wants to return to Walford. Before returning to Portugal, Peggy visits The Queen Vic and meets its new landlord, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]), who tells her to \"get out of my pub\" (which Peggy was known for saying as landlady).\n\nIn January 2016, Phil calls Peggy's older sister, [[Aunt Sal|Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]), wanting Louise's (now played by [[Tilly Keeper]]) address, and when he goes to her house, Peggy is there, having returned a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of the liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try to make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.\n\nSharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She tells them both she will not kill herself, and after settling old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend, Pat. She decides she wants to be remembered as a strong woman, not as weak in her bed, so takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016. Phil is due to give a eulogy to her there, but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy was the one who sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.\n\n==Creation==\nPeggy was introduced as a guest character in April 1991, by executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]]. The character was brought in as the mother of the already established Mitchell clan: [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]). Specifically, she played a key role in a storyline about the elopement of her daughter Sam with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Peggy was played by actress Jo Warne for a period of three months, but was written out upon the completion of the storyline. Two other actresses had been cast in the part before Warne. The first quit before she could film any scenes, and the second filmed eight episodes, though all of her scenes were scrapped before broadcast.<ref name=RT>{{cite news|author= ''Radio Times'' staff|date= 2\u20138 January 2010|title= 10 For 2010|work= Radio Times|publisher= BBC Magazines|page= 19}}</ref>\n\nThe character did not make another appearance until 7 November 1994, when she was reintroduced by series producer [[Barbara Emile]] as a regular character. The actress was recast, the role being taken over by Barbara Windsor, already well known to viewers as a comic actress, notably appearing in the long-running [[Carry On films|''Carry On'' films]]. Scott Matthewman of ''[[The Stage]]'' commented on the recast in 2006: \"Quite the biggest \u2013 and most inexplicable \u2013 transformation is that of Peggy Mitchell in ''EastEnders''. While Barbara Windsor has dominated the role...first appearing in [1994], the character had appeared briefly [three] years earlier, played by Jo Warne, a lady who physically is as different from our Babs as it's possible to get.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |title=The changing face of soap acting |work=[[The Stage]] |publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited |first=Scott |last=Matthewman |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611120102/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2006/10/the-changing-face-of-soap-acting/ |archivedate=11 June 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSteve McFadden and Ross Kemp had attempted to persuade ''EastEnders'' writer [[Tony Jordan]] to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her.<ref name=RT/> Windsor had previously expressed a desire to join the cast of ''EastEnders''. Chat show host [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Big Breakfast]]'' made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement.

Ironically, viewers complained that she was too upmarket.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> Windsor has commented of the impact of her pre-existing celebrity status:\n\n{{cquote|[[Wendy Richard]] [who played [[Pauline Fowler]]] certainly had name value but I suppose it was regarded differently because she was part of the original cast. When I was brought on [to ''EastEnders''] the press made such a big deal. They made it seem like I was brought on to 'save' ''EastEnders'' or something, which was ridiculous...the show decided to move into the \"[[Sharongate]]\" storyline, which gave it an enormous push, creatively and ratings-wise. Peggy was brought on as an extension of the Sharongate story because she was Phil and Grant's mum.

She adds, \"Peggy likes to think she looks much younger [than she is]. She's flash, fast-talking and nobody's fool. She has always done things her own way, and heaven help anyone who crosses her, though her bark's usually worse than her bite.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |date=31 October 1991|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|isbn=978-0563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nWhen Windsor took over the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, \"a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely superficial level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> However, early in 1995, ''EastEnders'' acquired a new executive producer, [[Corinne Hollingworth]], who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was \"not going to be allowed to just sit in some flat polishing her nails\".<ref name=\"WG\"/> Windsor has said: \"It was like a dream. [Hollingworth] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed to be a lot more flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...\".<ref name=\"WG\"/>\n\nWindsor has described Peggy as \"from the old school, the generation which doesn't put up with rubbish from anybody...She can get through practically anything because she's tough, tough, tough.\"<ref name=\"WG\"/> The character has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of ''EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square'', as a matriarch, assuming \"papal infallibility.

It was the first time that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though the issue was covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting [[Mammography|breast cancer screening]], when [[Sue Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]]) discovered a lump on her breast, which turned out to be benign.\n\nPeggy's breast cancer storyline was devised at the suggestion of a scriptwriter in a story conference session and, according to the production staff, was an idea \"that had been knocking about for a long time.\"<ref name=\"social\">{{cite book |first= Lesley|last=Henderson|title= Social Issues in Television Fiction|year=2001|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|isbn=978-0-7486-2532-1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8l_TcZfmuDoC&pg=PA80&dq=eastenders+breast+cancer#PPA80,M1|chapter=A Woman's Disease: Breast Cancer|pages=76\u201392|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref> In Lesley Henderson's book, ''Social Issues in Television Fiction'', an ''EastEnders'' researcher explains that: \"A lot of illnesses [...] translate quite readily into strong dramatic material\", and the experience of being hospitalised or waiting on test results is something everyone can identify with.<ref name=\"social\"/> The programme sought expert advice on \"storyline visuals\" from a variety of sources including cancer organisations, breast cancer charities and medical professionals.<ref name=\"social\"/> There were anticipated problems with running a breast cancer story, such as timing, characterisation, casting, and interweaving the plot with other ongoing storylines. A story editor has explained: \"''EastEnders'' is perceived as being an issue-led show, but it isn't, it's character and story-led [...] If you haven't got the character to fulfill that storyline then it won't work. You've got to be careful to make sure that the illness actually impacts on the family dynamics and the character development.\"<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\nProducers decided to use Peggy in the breast cancer storyline, conforming to a soap opera tradition of reserving strong roles for a firmly established middle-aged matriarch.<ref name=\"social\"/> The audience were familiar with Peggy's history, knew that her first husband had died from cancer, consequently making her fear hospitals, and she had: \"the right mentality for [the story theme], which was about 'a woman who discovers a lump and then refuses to accept that anything's wrong'. An added factor was that in choosing Peggy the programme could avoid appearing too issue driven, and [the] storyline could be used as a device to expand and develop her characterisation.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, as the causes of breast cancer are not attributable to risky behaviour, the disease was deemed \"more attractive\" in storyline terms. A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explains:\n\n{{cquote|If you take a character who smokes and they get [[lung cancer]] that would seem too issue-driven. The great thing about a character like Peggy is [her breast cancer was] quite unexpected. At the time there were lots of other issues in her life. She was a character who audiences had only seen pulling pints behind the bar. Suddenly she was in a new environment in a hospital and had a huge medical crisis to go through, so that allowed the character to grow and expand in many ways...There was also fairly major moments [...] with Peggy and [her boyfriend [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] ([[Paul Moriarty (actor)|Paul Moriarty]])]. She thought George wouldn't love her any more after she'd had the operation. We were able to use the illness to take them on a new journey.<ref name=\"social\"/>}}\n\nIn the view of the production team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer.<ref name=\"social\"/> In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised ''EastEnders'' for this.<ref name=\"social\"/>\n\n[[File:Ross Kemp.jpg|thumb|[[Ross Kemp]] plays Peggy's son [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]]. The issue of whether Peggy's children would discover her breast cancer was used to build tension and create suspense in the viewing audience.]]\n\nThe storyline used elements of suspense, created by the use of \"shared secrets\" between Peggy and her daughter-in-law [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), who invented elaborate cover stories to mask Peggy's trips to hospital from her sons and partner. Tension was deliberately built for viewing pleasure, posing the questions of whether Peggy's lump was benign or malignant and whether she would die, but also in terms of Peggy's relationships, whether her children would discover the truth or if George would end their relationship. Henderson has suggested that: \"such devises [added] pathos to Peggy's treatment path.

A member of the ''EastEnders'' production team explained: \"We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases.<ref name=\"social\"/> However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the \"all-clear\" at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction.<ref name=\"social\"/> It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy.<ref name=\"mastectomy\">{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,335926,00.html|title=An everyday story of... cancer|first=Sue|last=Arnold|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=26 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> BBC Production chief executive [[Matthew Bannister]] praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: \"It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us and a lot of other people.\"<ref name=\"wedding\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/308079.stm|title=Wedding knees-up in the Square |publisher=BBC News|date=30 March 1999| accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nOncology nurses and consultants were involved in the development of the storyline, which was based on a real life case study.

Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special [[two-hander]] episode aired in November 1998, [[List of EastEnders two-hander episodes#Pat and Peggy (27 October 1998)|featuring only Pat and Peggy]] for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy]] ([[Tony Caunter]]), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity.

Pam and I were really proud.\" The ''Sunday Mirror'' described it as: \"one of the most impressive episodes of all time\".<ref name=\"fight\"/> In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.\n\nPeggy and Frank were married on-screen on 1 April 1999.

She said: \"Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst [executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]]], who I adore, is still in charge I want him to be the one to oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy\u2019s last scenes.\"<ref name=\"Final departure\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/entries/79a5cac3-b183-46ce-810e-502564566f3a|title=BBC Blogs \u2013 EastEnders News & Spoilers \u2013 Dame Barbara Windsor to return to EastEnders for the very last time...|date=16 January 2016|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-16/eastenders-peggy-mitchell-to-be-killed-off---barbara-windsors-final-scenes-to-air-this-spring|title=EastEnders: Peggy Mitchell to be killed off \u2013 Barbara Windsor's final scenes to air this spring|work=[[Radio Times]]|first=David|last=Brown|date=16 January 2016}}</ref> Treadwell-Collins said, \"when [Windsor] told me her decision back in the summer [2015], we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square.

Windsor has since revealed that she was initially opposed to the storyline:\n\n{{cquote|[Peggy] was vicious to [Mark]. She was so na\u00efve about the whole thing. When I got the script and it said some awful things, I couldn't believe it. It's the only time I've questioned the writers and said 'I can't believe it, people aren't like that today'. Then they sent me a survey and proved that people are actually like that. When it came to doing the scenes, I just got hold of Todd [Carty] and said, 'sorry this is Peggy!' I got the most appalling [hate] mail because of it. I had a very dear friend of mine who was dying of AIDS so it was very personal to me. The last scene I did I went straight out and got terribly drunk.<ref name=\"transcript\"/> }}\n\nActress and writer [[Jacquetta May]], who played the character [[Rachel Kominski]] between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline and the role of women in an article about ''EastEnders''. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, \"a key figure of the community\", was shown to exhibit such \"pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice\". In order for Peggy to be redeemed, she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, \"Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she now knows what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we are all the same, human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although ''EastEnders'' endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied.\"<ref name=\"kominski\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229113716/http://www.redpepper.org.uk/cularch/xeastend.html|archivedate=29 December 2006|title=Square deal|publisher=redpepper.org|first=Jacquetta|last=May|authorlink=Jacquetta May|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n''EastEnders'' has received praise for the handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, it was reported that media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as \"more tragic\" or \"more sexy\" in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50.<ref name=\"social\"/> Source organisations working with ''EastEnders'' on the storyline have commented: \"[The team] decided it was going to be [Peggy] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person.\"<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented \"particularly positive messages\" concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline \"didactic\".<ref name=\"social\"/> The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theanswerbank.co.uk/Article1254.html|title=What other medical issues have been raised by soaps?|first=Katharine|last=MacColl|publisher=Answer Bank|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2008, [[Bupa]] doctors criticised UK soaps for presenting unhealthy [[role model]]s to viewing audiences.

The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nThe development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time have themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese symbol \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\". The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.\n\n''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels. Levels are indicated by the fruit icon at the bottom of the screen. In-between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations. The game becomes unplayable at the 256th level due to an [[integer overflow]] that affects the game's memory, rendering this level unbeatable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nAfter acquiring the struggling Japanese division of [[Atari]] in 1976, video game developer [[Namco]] had begun producing their own video games in-house, as opposed to simply licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan.<ref name=\"nytimes nakamura\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/business/pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Masaya Nakamura, Whose Company Created Pac-Man, Dies at 91 |first=Jonathan |last=Sobel |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/> Company president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several [[NEC]]-produced microcomputers to potentially create new games with.<ref name=\"AAN\">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"Supercade\">{{cite book |title=Supercade |last=Burnham |first=Van |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-262-02492-6 |page=181}}</ref> One of the first people assigned to this division was a young 24-year-old employee named [[Toru Iwatani]].<ref name=\"Programmers At Work\"/> He created Namco's first video game ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' in 1978, which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly-growing video game industry.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a9e\u308a\u90e8\u305f\u3061 \u7b2c4\u90e8\uff1a\u77f3\u6751\u7e41\u4e00\u6c0f\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5275\u696d\u8005\u30fb\u4e2d\u6751\u96c5\u54c9\u6c0f\u306e\u9b45\u529b |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=Japanese |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |accessdate=2 August 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archivedate=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Akagi\">{{cite book|last=Masumi|first= Akagi |title=It Started With Pong |publisher=Amusement News Agency |year=2005 |page=183-184}}</ref> He also assisted in the production of two sequels, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]'', both released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bomb Bee - Videogame by Namco |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802063946/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |archivedate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cutie Q - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016144809/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |archivedate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man, at GDC 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Creator [[Toru Iwatani]] at the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]].]]\nThe Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', which lead to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/><ref name=\"Iwatani\">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2005 |page=33}}</ref> Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments.<ref name=\"Time\"/> For his next project, Iwatani chose to create a non-violent, cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women,<ref>{{cite book| first=Chris | last=Kohler |year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|pages=51\u201352|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref> as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much-more family friendly in tone.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time;

The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nThe development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time have themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese symbol \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\". The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.\n\n''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.

These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted [[Naval artillery|guns]] on a single [[deck (ship)|deck]] or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel). The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the [[line of battle]], although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed.\n\nIn the 18th century, frigates were [[full-rigged ship]]s, that is [[square rig|square-rigged]] on all three masts, they were built for speed and handiness, had a lighter armament than a [[ship of the line]], and were used for patrolling and escort. In the definition adopted by the [[British Admiralty]], they were [[Rating system of the Royal Navy|rated ships]] of at least 28 guns, carrying their principal armaments upon a single continuous deck \u2013 the upper deck \u2013 while ships of the line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns.\n\nIn the late 19th century (beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies), the '''armoured frigate''' was a type of [[ironclad warship]] that for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat. The term \"frigate\" was used because such ships still mounted their principal armaments on a single continuous upper deck.\n\nIn modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and [[merchant-marine]] ships, especially as [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant [[convoy]]s. Ship classes dubbed \"frigates\" have also more closely resembled [[corvette]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[cruiser]]s and even battleships. Some European navies such as the Dutch, French, German or Spanish ones use the term \"frigate\" for both their destroyers and frigates.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The rank \"[[frigate captain]]\" derives from the name of this type of ship.\n\n==Age of sail==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Frc3a9gate-c3a0-la-voile1.jpg|thumb|Light frigate, circa 1675\u20131680]]\n\nThe term \"frigate\" (Italian: ''fregata''; Spanish/Catalan/Portuguese/Sicilian: ''fragata''; Dutch: ''fregat''; French: ''fr\u00e9gate'') originated in the [[Mediterranean]] in the late 15th century, referring to a lighter [[galley]]-type warship with oars, sails and a light armament, built for speed and maneuverability.<ref name=\"Henderson\">Henderson, James: ''Frigates Sloops & Brigs''. Pen & Sword Books, London, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84415-301-0}}.</ref> The etymology of the word remains uncertain, although it may have originated as a [[corruption (linguistic)|corruption]] of ''[[Wikt:aphractus|aphractus]]'', a [[Latin]] word for an open vessel with no lower deck. ''Aphractus'', in turn, derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] phrase \u1f04\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c2 (''aphraktos naus'') \u2013 \"undefended ship\".\n\nIn 1583, during the [[Eighty Years' War]] of 1568\u20131648, [[Habsburg Spain]] recovered the [[southern Netherlands]] from the Protestant rebels. This soon resulted in the use of the occupied ports as bases for [[privateers]], the \"[[Dunkirker]]s\", to attack the shipping of the Dutch and their allies. To achieve this the Dunkirkers developed small, maneuverable, sailing vessels that came to be referred to as frigates. The success of these Dunkirker vessels influenced the ship design of other navies contending with them, but because most regular navies required ships of greater endurance than the Dunkirker frigates could provide, the term soon came to apply less exclusively to any relatively fast and elegant sail-only warship. In French, the term \"frigate\" gave rise to a verb \u2013 ''fr\u00e9gater'', meaning 'to build long and low', and to an adjective, adding more confusion. Even the huge English {{HMS|Sovereign of the Seas||2}} could be described as \"a delicate frigate\" by a contemporary after her upper decks were reduced in 1651.<ref>Rodger (2004) p. 216</ref>\n\nThe navy of the [[Dutch Republic]] became the first navy to build the larger ocean-going frigates. The Dutch navy had three principal tasks in the struggle against Spain: to protect Dutch merchant ships at sea, to blockade the ports of Spanish-held [[Flanders]] to damage trade and halt enemy [[privateering]], and to fight the Spanish fleet and prevent troop landings. The first two tasks required speed, shallowness of draft for the shallow waters around the Netherlands, and the ability to carry sufficient supplies to maintain a blockade. The third task required heavy armament, sufficient to stand up to the Spanish fleet. The first of the larger battle-capable frigates were built around 1600 at [[Hoorn]] in [[County of Holland|Holland]].<ref>Geofrrey Parker, ''The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West 1500\u20131800'', p. 99</ref> By the later stages of the [[Eighty Years' War]] the Dutch had switched entirely from the heavier ships still used by the English and Spanish to the lighter frigates, carrying around 40&nbsp;guns and weighing around 300&nbsp;tons.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Dutch frigates became most evident in the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639, encouraging most other navies, especially the English, to adopt similar designs.\n\nThe fleets built by the [[Commonwealth of England]] in the 1650s generally consisted of ships described as \"frigates\", the largest of which were two-decker \"great frigates\" of the [[Third-rate|third rate]]. Carrying 60&nbsp;guns, these vessels were as big and capable as \"great ships\" of the time; however, most other frigates at the time were used as \"[[cruiser]]s\": independent fast ships. The term \"frigate\" implied a long hull-design, which relates directly to speed (see [[hull speed]]) and which also, in turn, helped the development of the [[broadside]] tactic in naval warfare.\n\n[[File:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|{{Ship|French frigate|Boudeuse|1766|2}}, of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]]]\n\nAt this time, a further design evolved, reintroducing oars and resulting in galley frigates such as {{HMS|Charles Galley|1676|6}} of 1676, which was rated as a 32-gun [[fifth-rate]] but also had a bank of 40 oars set below the upper deck which could propel the ship in the absence of a favourable wind.\n\nIn Danish, the word \"fregat\" often applies to warships carrying as few as 16 guns, such as {{HMS|Falcon|1802|6}}, which the British classified as a sloop.\n\nUnder the [[rating system of the Royal Navy]], by the middle of the 18th century, the term \"frigate\" was technically restricted to single-decked ships of the [[Fifth-rate|fifth rate]], though small 28-gun frigates classed as [[Sixth-rate|sixth rate]].<ref name=\"Henderson\"/>\n\n===Classic design===\n[[File:Lutine1.jpg|thumb|A {{sclass-|Magicienne|frigate|1}}]]\n[[File:Main batteries of M\u00e9duse-Garneray-IMG 4787-cropped.JPG|thumb|Gun deck of the {{sclass-|Pallas|frigate|0||1808}} frigate {{ship|French frigate|M\u00e9duse|1810|2}}]]\n\nThe classic sailing frigate, well-known today for its role in the [[Napoleonic wars]], can be traced back to French developments in the second quarter of the 18th century. The French-built {{ship|French frigate|M\u00e9d\u00e9e|1741|2}} of 1740 is often regarded as the first example of this type. These ships were square-rigged and carried all their main guns on a single continuous upper deck. The lower deck, known as the \"gun deck\", now carried no armament, and functioned as a \"berth deck\" where the crew lived, and was in fact placed below the waterline of the new frigates. The typical earlier cruiser had a partially armed lower deck, from which it was known as a 'half-battery' or ''demi-batterie'' ship. Removing the guns from this deck allowed the height of the hull upperworks to be lowered, giving the resulting 'true-frigate' much improved sailing qualities. The unarmed deck meant that the frigate's guns were carried comparatively high above the waterline; as a result, when seas were too rough for two-deckers to open their lower deck gun-ports, frigates were still able to fight with all their guns (see the [[Action of 13 January 1797]], for an example when this was decisive).<ref name=\"Breen\">{{cite journal |last=Breen |first=Colin |last2=Forsythe |first2=Wes |year=2007 |title=The French Shipwreck La Surveillante, Lost in Bantry Bay, Ireland, in 1797 |jstor=25617454  |journal=Historical Archaeology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201342}}</ref><ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\nA total of fifty-nine French sailing frigates were built between 1777 and 1790, with a standard design averaging a hull length of {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} and an average draught of {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The new frigates recorded sailing speeds of up to {{convert|14|kn|km/h mph}}, significantly faster than their predecessor vessels.<ref name=\"Breen\"/>\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] captured a number of the new French frigates, including ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e'', during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748) and were impressed by them, particularly for their inshore handling capabilities. They soon built copies (ordered in 1747), based on a French privateer named ''Tygre'', and started to adapt the type to their own needs, setting the standard for other frigates as the leading naval power. The first British frigates carried 28 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-four 9-pounder guns (the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck) but soon developed into fifth-rate ships of 32 or 36 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-six 12-pounder guns, with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle.<ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 37</ref>\n\n===Heavy frigate===\n[[File:HMS Trincomalee.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Trincomalee}} (1817) a restored British 18-pounder, 38-gun heavy frigate]]\nIn 1778, the British Admiralty introduced a larger \"heavy\" frigate, with a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounder guns (with smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle). This move may reflect the naval conditions at the time, with both France and Spain as enemies the usual British preponderance in ship numbers was no longer the case and there was pressure on the British to produce cruisers of individually greater force. In reply, the first French 18-pounder frigates were laid down in 1781. The 18-pounder frigate eventually became the standard frigate of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The British produced larger, 38-gun, and slightly smaller, 36-gun, versions and also a 32-gun design that can be considered an 'economy version'. The 32-gun frigates also had the advantage that they could be built by the many smaller, less-specialised shipbuilders.<ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 39</ref><ref>Gardiner (2000), p. 19</ref>\n\nFrigates could (and usually did) additionally carry smaller carriage-mounted guns on their quarter decks and [[forecastle]]s (the superstructures above the upper deck). Technically, rated ships with fewer than 28&nbsp;guns could not be classed as frigates but as \"[[post ship]]s\"; however, in common parlance most post ships were often described as \"frigates\", the same casual misuse of the term being extended to smaller two-decked ships that were too small to stand in the line of battle. In 1778 the Carron Iron Company of Scotland produced a naval gun which would revolutionise the armament of smaller naval vessels, including the frigate. The [[carronade]] was a large calibre, short-barrelled naval cannon which was light, quick to reload and needed a smaller crew than a conventional long gun. Due to its lightness it could be mounted on the forecastle and quarter deck of frigates. It greatly increased the firepower, measured in weight of metal (the combined weight of all projectiles fired in one broadside), of these vessels. The disadvantages of the carronade were that it had a much shorter range and was less accurate than a long gun. The British quickly saw the advantages of the new weapon and soon employed it on a wide scale. The US Navy also copied the design soon after its appearance. The French and other nations eventually adopted variations of the weapon in succeeding decades. The typical heavy frigate had a main armament of 18-pounder long guns, plus 32-pounder carronades mounted on its upper decks.<ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 153</ref>\n\n===Super-heavy frigates===\n[[File:USS Constitution underway, August 19, 2012 by Castle Island cropped.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}}.]]\nThe first 'super-heavy frigates', armed with 24-pounder long guns, were built by the naval architect [[Fredrik Henrik af Chapman|F H Chapman]] for the Swedish navy in 1782. Because of a shortage of ships-of-the-line, the Swedes wanted these frigates, the ''Bellona'' class, to be able to stand in the battle line in an emergency. In the 1790s the French built a small number of large 24-pounder frigates, such as {{ship|French frigate|Forte|1794|2}} and ''Egyptienne'', they also cut-down (reduced the height of the hull to give only one continuous gun deck) a number of older ships-of-the-line (including {{ship|French ship|Diad\u00e8me|1756|2}}) to produce super-heavy frigates, the resulting ship was known as a [[Razee|''ras\u00e9e'']]. It is not known whether the French were seeking to produce very potent cruisers or merely to address stability problems in old ships. The British, alarmed by the prospect of these powerful heavy frigates, responded by ras\u00e9e-ing three of the smaller 64-gun battleships, including {{HMS|Indefatigable|1784|2}}, which went on to have a very successful career as a frigate. At this time the British also built a few 24-pounder-armed large frigates, the most successful of which was {{HMS|Endymion|1797|6}} (1,277 tons).<ref>Gardiner (200), pp. 40\u201342</ref><ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 40</ref>\n\nIn 1797, three of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[original six frigates of the United States Navy|first six major ships]] were rated as 44-gun frigates, which operationally carried fifty-six to sixty [[24-pounder long gun]]s and 32-pounder or 42-pounder carronades on two decks; they were exceptionally powerful. These ships were so large, at around 1,500 tons, and well-armed that they were often regarded as equal to ships of the line, and after a series of losses at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], Royal Navy fighting instructions ordered British frigates (usually of 38 guns or less) to never engage the large American frigates at any less than a 2:1 advantage. {{USS|Constitution}}, preserved as a [[museum ship]] by the US Navy, is the oldest commissioned warship afloat, and is a surviving example of a frigate from the [[Age of Sail]]. ''Constitution'' and her sister ships {{USS|President|1800|2}} and {{USS|United States|1797|2}} were created in a response to deal with the Barbary Coast pirates and in conjunction with the [[Naval Act of 1794]]. [[Joshua Humphreys]] proposed that only [[live oak]], a tree that grew only in America, should be used to build these ships. The three big frigates, when built, had a distinctive building pattern which minimised \"[[Hogging and sagging|hogging]]\" (in which the centre of the keel rises while both ends drop) and improved hydrodynamic efficiency. Diagonal riders were employed, eight on each side, that sat at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal. These beams were about {{convert|2|ft|cm}} wide and around {{convert|1|ft|cm}} thick and helped to maintain the shape of the hull, serving also to reduce flexibility and to minimize impacts.<ref name=\"Archibald, Roger 1997\">Archibald, Roger. 1997. Six ships that shook the world. American Heritage of Invention & Technology 13, (2): 24.</ref>\n\nThe British, wounded by repeated defeats in single-ship actions, responded to the success of the American 44s in three ways. They built a class of conventional 40-gun, 24-pounder armed frigates on the lines of ''Endymion''. They cut down three old 74-gun battleships into ras\u00e9es, producing frigates with a 32-pounder main armament, supplemented by 42-pounder carronades. These had an armament that far exceeded the power of the American ships. Finally, {{HMS|Leander|1813|2}} and {{HMS|Newcastle|1813|2}}, 1,500-ton spar-decked frigates (with an enclosed waist, giving a continuous line of guns from bow to stern at the level of the quarter deck/forecastle), were built, which were an almost exact match in size and firepower to the American 44-gun frigates.<ref>Gardiner (200), pp. 48\u201356</ref>\n\n===Role===\n[[File:HMS warriorjune20092.jpg|right|upright=1.1|thumb|{{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}, the first iron-hulled armoured steam frigate \u2013 the hull survived as an oil terminal dock and was restored to its original appearance in the late 20th century]]\n\nFrigates were perhaps the hardest-worked of warship types during the [[Age of Sail]]. While smaller than a [[Ship of the line|ship-of-the-line]], they were formidable opponents for the large numbers of [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] and [[gunboat]]s, not to mention [[privateer]]s or merchantmen. Able to carry six months' stores, they had very long range; and vessels larger than frigates were considered too valuable to operate independently.\n\nFrigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, and conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually, frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with ships-of-the-line; even in the midst of a fleet engagement it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lavery |first=Brian |title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organisation 1793\u20131815 |year=1989 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |isbn=978-1-59114-611-7 |pages=49, 298\u2013300}}</ref> Frigates were involved in fleet battles, often as \"repeating frigates\". In the smoke and confusion of battle, [[Naval flag signalling|signals]] made by the fleet commander, whose [[flagship]] might be in the thick of the fighting, might be missed by the other ships of the fleet.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite book |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|volume=17|page=469}}</ref> Frigates were therefore stationed to windward or leeward of the main [[line of battle]], and had to maintain a clear line of sight to the commander's flagship. Signals from the flagship were then repeated by the frigates, which themselves standing out of the line and clear from the smoke and disorder of battle, could be more easily seen by the other ships of the fleet.<ref name=\"EB\"/> If damage or loss of masts prevented the flagship from making clear conventional signals, the repeating frigates could interpret them and hoist their own in the correct manner, passing on the commander's instructions clearly.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nFor officers in the Royal Navy, a frigate was a desirable posting. Frigates often saw action, which meant a greater chance of glory, promotion, and [[prize money]].\n\nUnlike larger ships that were placed [[Reserve Fleet|in ordinary]], frigates were kept in service in peacetime as a cost-saving measure and to provide experience to frigate captains and officers which would be useful in wartime. Frigates could also carry [[marine (military)|marines]] for boarding enemy ships or for operations on shore; in 1832, the frigate {{USS|Potomac|1822|6}} landed a party of 282 sailors and Marines ashore in the US Navy's [[first Sumatran expedition]].\n\nFrigates remained a crucial element of navies until the mid-19th century. The first [[Ironclad warship|ironclads]] were classified as \"frigates\" because of the number of guns they carried. However, terminology changed as iron and steam became the norm, and the role of the frigate was assumed first by the [[protected cruiser]] and then by the [[light cruiser]].\n\nFrigates are often the vessel of choice in historical naval novels due to their relative freedom compared to ships-of-the-line (kept for fleet actions) and smaller vessels (generally assigned to a home port and less widely ranging). For example, the [[Patrick O'Brian]] [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]], [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series and [[Douglas Reeman|Alexander Kent]]'s [[Richard Bolitho]] series. The motion picture ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'' features a reconstructed historic frigate, [[HMS Surprise (replica ship)|HMS ''Rose'']], to depict Aubrey's frigate HMS ''Surprise''.\n\n==Age of steam==\n{{Main|Steam frigate}}\n[[File:Lebreton engraving-26.jpg|thumb|French [[Paddle steamer|paddle]] frigate {{Ship|French frigate|Descartes||2}}]]\n\nVessels classed as frigates continued to play a great role in navies with the adoption of steam power in the 19th century. In the 1830s, navies experimented with large [[paddle steamer]]s equipped with large guns mounted on one deck, which were termed \"paddle frigates\".\n\nFrom the mid-1840s on, frigates which more closely resembled the traditional sailing frigate were built with steam engines and screw [[propeller]]s. These \"[[Steam frigate|screw frigates]]\", built first of wood and later of [[Wrought iron|iron]], continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century.\n\n===Armoured frigate===\nFrom 1859, armour was added to ships based on existing frigate and [[ship of the line]] designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first [[ironclad warship]]s meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role. The phrase \"armoured frigate\" remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped, broadside-firing type of ironclad.\n\nAfter 1875, the term \"frigate\" fell out of use. Vessels with armoured sides were designated as \"[[battleship]]s\" or \"[[Armored cruiser|armoured cruiser]]s\", while \"[[protected cruiser]]s\" only possessed an armoured deck, and unarmoured vessels, including frigates and sloops, were classified as \"unprotected cruisers\".\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|List of frigates of World War II}}\n[[File:Lochmorlich.jpg|thumb|A {{sclass2-|Loch|frigate|1}}]]\n[[File:USS Gallup (PF-47).jpg|thumb|The U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Tacoma|frigate|0}} patrol frigate {{USS|Gallup|PF-47|6}} at [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], [[California]], on 30 May 1944]]\n\nModern frigates are related to earlier frigates only by name. The term \"frigate\" was readopted during the [[World War II|Second World War]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] to describe an [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] escort vessel that was larger than a [[corvette]], while smaller than a [[destroyer]]. Equal in size and capability to the American [[destroyer escort]], frigates are usually less expensive to build and maintain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.military-today.com/navy/top_10_frigates.htm|title=Top 10 Frigates {{!}} Military-Today.com|last=ARG|website=www.military-today.com|access-date=2017-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629102103/http://www.military-today.com/navy/top_10_frigates.htm|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Anti-submarine escorts had previously been classified as [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] by the Royal Navy, and the {{sclass-|Black Swan|sloop|2}}<nowiki/>s of 1939\u20131945 were as large as the new types of frigate, and more heavily armed. Twenty-two of these were reclassified as frigates after the war, as were the remaining 24 smaller {{sclass2-|Castle|corvette|2}}<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe frigate was introduced to remedy some of the shortcomings inherent in the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette|0}} corvette design: limited armament, a hull form not suited to open-ocean work, a single [[driveshaft|shaft]] which limited speed and manoeuvrability, and a lack of range. The frigate was designed and built to the same mercantile construction standards ([[scantling]]s) as the corvette, allowing manufacture by yards unused to warship construction. The first frigates of the {{sclass2-|River|frigate|4}} (1941) were essentially two sets of corvette machinery in one larger hull, armed with the latest [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine weapon.\n\nThe frigate possessed less offensive firepower and speed than a [[destroyer]], but such qualities were not required for anti-submarine warfare. Submarines were slow while submerged, and [[ASDIC]] sets did not operate effectively at speeds of over {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}}. Rather, the frigate was an austere and weatherly vessel suitable for mass-construction and fitted with the latest innovations in anti-submarine warfare. As the frigate was intended purely for convoy duties, and not to deploy with the fleet, it had limited range and speed.\n\nThe contemporary [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[F-class escort ship|Flottenbegleiter]]'' (\"fleet escorts\"), also known as \"F-Boats\", were essentially frigates.<ref>[http://www.prinzeugen.com/FRIND.htm prinzeugen.com \"Frigate: An Online Photo Album\".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421143031/http://www.prinzeugen.com/FRIND.htm |date=21 April 2008 }} Retrieved on: 11 February 2008.</ref> They were based on a pre-war ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' concept of vessels which could fill roles such as fast minesweeper, minelayer, merchant escort and anti-submarine vessel. Because of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] their displacement was officially limited to 600&nbsp;tons, although in reality they exceeded this by about 100&nbsp;tons. F-boats had two stacks and two 105&nbsp;mm gun turrets. The design was flawed because of its narrow beam, sharp bow and unreliable high pressure steam turbines. F-boats were succeeded in operational duties by [[Torpedo boat type 35|Type 35]] and {{sclass2-|Elbing|torpedo boat|1}}s. ''Flottenbegleiter'' remained in service as advanced training vessels.\n\nIt was not until the Royal Navy's {{sclass2-|Bay|frigate|4}} of 1944 that a British design classified as a \"frigate\" was produced for fleet use, although it still suffered from limited speed. These [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] frigates, built on incomplete {{sclass2-|Loch|frigate|2}} hulls, were similar to the [[United States Navy]]'s [[destroyer escort]]s (DE), although the latter had greater speed and offensive armament to better suit them to fleet deployments. The destroyer escort concept came from design studies by the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] in 1940, as modified by requirements established by a British commission in 1941<ref>Gardiner, Robert, ed., ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1922\u20131946'', New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, {{ISBN|0-8317-0303-2}}, p. 149.</ref> prior to the American entry into the war, for deep-water escorts. The American-built destroyer escorts serving in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] were rated as [[Captain-class frigate|Captain-class]] frigates. The U.S. Navy's two [[Canada|Canadian]]-built {{sclass-|Asheville|frigate|0}} and 96 British-influenced, American-built {{sclass-|Tacoma|frigate|0}} frigates that followed originally were classified as \"patrol [[gunboat]]s\" (PG) in the U.S. Navy but on 15 April 1943 were all reclassified as '''patrol frigates (PF)'''.\n\n==Contemporary==\n===Guided-missile role===\n[[File:HMCS Regina (FFH 334) Frigate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|2}} {{HMCS|Regina|FFH 334|6}} escorting the American aircraft carrier {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} across the Pacific Ocean in 2008]]\n[[File:Chilean frigate Almirante Lynch.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ecuadorian Navy]] {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|2}} BAE ''Mor\u00e1n Valverde'', formerly the [[Chilean Navy]]'s {{ship|Chilean frigate|Almirante Lynch|PFG-07|2}}]]\n[[File:USS Leahy (CG-16) at sea off San Diego, in May 1978.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Leahy|DLG-16|6}} departing [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California, in May 1978. She was classified as a guided-missile frigate (DLG-16) until 1975, when she was reclassified as a [[guided-missile cruiser]] (CG-16).]]\n\nThe introduction of the [[surface-to-air missile]] after World War II made relatively small ships effective for anti-aircraft warfare: the \"guided missile frigate\". <!-- removing this sentence, it does not conform to the NPOV, and in any case it is incorrect. \"Designed as cost-efficient surface combatants, they lack the multi-mission capability necessary for modern surface combatants faced with multiple, high-technology threats and offer limited capacity for growth\" --> In the USN, these vessels were called \"[[ocean escort]]s\" and [[hull classification symbol|designated]] \"DE\" or \"DEG\" until 1975 \u2013 a holdover from the World War II [[destroyer escort]] or \"DE\". The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and British [[Royal Navy]] maintained the use of the term \"frigate\"; likewise, the French Navy refers to missile-equipped ship, up to cruiser-sized ships ({{sclass-|Suffren|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Tourville|frigate|5}}, and {{sclass-|Horizon|frigate|4}}es), by the name of \"fr\u00e9gate\", while smaller units are named ''[[aviso]]''. The Soviet Navy used the term \"guard-ship\" (''\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044c'').\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the [[United States Navy]] commissioned ships classed as guided missile frigates ([[hull classification symbol]] DLG or DLGN, literally meaning guided missile [[destroyer leader]]s), which were actually anti-aircraft warfare [[cruiser]]s built on [[destroyer]]-style hulls. These had one or two twin launchers per ship for the [[RIM-2 Terrier]] missile, upgraded to the [[RIM-67 Standard]] ER missile in the 1980s. This type of ship was intended primarily to defend aircraft carriers against anti-ship [[cruise missile]]s, augmenting and eventually replacing converted World War II cruisers (CAG/CLG/CG) in this role. The guided missile frigates also had an anti-submarine capability that most of the World War II cruiser conversions lacked. Some of these ships \u2013 {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}} and {{USS|Truxtun|CGN-35|2}} along with the {{sclass-|California|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|cruiser|4}}es \u2013 were [[United States naval reactors|nuclear-powered]] (DLGN).<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 215\u2013217</ref> These \"frigates\" were roughly mid-way in size between cruisers and destroyers. This was similar to the use of the term \"frigate\" during the age of sail during which it referred to a medium-sized warship, but it was inconsistent with conventions used by other contemporary navies which regarded frigates as being smaller than destroyers. During the [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification|1975 ship reclassification]], the large American frigates were redesignated as guided missile cruisers or destroyers (CG/CGN/DDG), while [[ocean escort]]s (the American classification for ships smaller than destroyers, with hull symbol DE/DEG ([[destroyer escort]])) were reclassified as frigates (FF/FFG), sometimes incorrectly called \"fast frigates\". In the late 1970s the [[US Navy]] introduced the 51-ship [[Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class]] guided missile frigates (FFG), the last of which was decommissioned in 2015, although some serve in other navies.<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 251\u2013252</ref> By 1995 the older guided missile cruisers and destroyers were replaced by the {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s and {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 580\u2013585</ref>\n\nOne of the most successful post-1945 designs was the British {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|2}}, which was used by several navies. Laid down in 1959, the ''Leander''-class was based on the previous [[Whitby-class frigate|Type 12 anti-submarine frigate]] but equipped for anti-aircraft use as well. They were used by the UK into the 1990s, at which point some were sold onto other navies. The ''Leander'' design, or improved versions of it, were licence-built for other navies as well.\n\nNearly all modern frigates are equipped with some form of offensive or defensive missiles, and as such are rated as guided-missile frigates (FFG). Improvements in surface-to-air missiles (e.g., the [[Eurosam]] [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]]) allow modern guided-missile frigates to form the core of many modern navies and to be used as a fleet defence platform, without the need for specialised anti-air warfare frigates.\n\n===Other uses===\nThe Royal Navy [[Salisbury-class frigate|Type 61 ''Salisbury'' class]] were [[radar picket|\"air direction\"]] frigates equipped to track aircraft. To this end they had reduced armament compared to the [[Leopard-class frigate|Type 41 ''Leopard''-class]] air-defence frigates built on the same hull.\n\nMulti-role frigates like the [[MEKO 200]], {{sclass-|Anzac|frigate|5}} and {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|4}}es are designed for navies needing warships deployed in a variety of situations that a general frigate class would not be able to fulfill and not requiring the need for deploying [[destroyer]]s.\n\n===Anti-submarine role===\n[[File:HMS Somerset (F82).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Somerset|F82|6}} of the [[Royal Navy]]. [[Type 23 frigate]]s were built for [[anti-submarine warfare]] but are capable multi-purpose ships.<ref>http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/type-23-frigates/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531045448/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/type-23-frigates/ |date=31 May 2010 }} Type 23 frigates at the Royal Navy website</ref>]]\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, some frigates are specialised for [[anti-submarine warfare]]. Increasing submarine speeds towards the end of World War II (see [[German Type XXI submarine]]) greatly reduced the margin of speed superiority of frigate over submarine. The frigate could no longer be slow and powered by mercantile machinery and consequently postwar frigates, such as the {{sclass-|Whitby|frigate|4}}, were faster.\n\nSuch ships carry improved [[sonar]] equipment, such as the [[Sonar#Anti-submarine warfare|variable depth sonar]] or [[towed array sonar|towed array]], and specialised weapons such as [[torpedo]]es, forward-throwing weapons such as [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] and missile-carried anti-submarine torpedoes such as [[ASROC]] or [[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]]. Surface-to-air missiles such as [[AIM-7 Sparrow#Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] and surface-to-surface missiles such as [[Exocet]] give them defensive and offensive capabilities. The Royal Navy's original [[Type 22 frigate]] is an example of a specialised anti-submarine warfare frigate.\n\nEspecially for anti-submarine warfare, most modern frigates have a [[Helipad|landing deck]] and [[hangar]] aft to operate [[helicopter]]s, eliminating the need for the frigate to close with unknown sub-surface threats, and using fast helicopters to attack nuclear submarines which may be faster than surface warships. For this task the helicopter is equipped with sensors such as [[sonobuoy]]s, wire-mounted dipping sonar and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s to identify possible threats, and torpedoes or [[depth-charge]]s to attack them.\n\nWith their onboard radar helicopters can also be used to reconnoitre over-the-horizon targets and, if equipped with [[anti-ship missile]]s such as [[Penguin missile|Penguin]] or [[Sea Skua]], to attack them. The helicopter is also invaluable for [[search and rescue]] operation and has largely replaced the use of [[dinghy|small boats]] or the [[Underway replenishment|jackstay rig]] for such duties as transferring personnel, mail and cargo between ships or to shore. With helicopters these tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously, and without the need for the frigate to slow down or change course.\n\n===Air defense role===\n[[File:HNLMS De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn (F 802).jpg|thumb|{{HNLMS|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn|F802|6}}]]\nSome frigates are specialised in [[airdefense]], because of the major developments in [[fighter jet]]s and [[ballistic missile]]s.\nAn example is the {{sclass-|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn|frigate|0}} air defense and command frigate of the [[Royal Dutch Navy]]. These ships are armed with [[RIM-66 Standard|VL Standard Missile 2 Block IIIA]], one or two [[Goalkeeper CIWS]] systems, ({{HNLMS|Evertsen|F805|6}} has two Goalkeepers, the rest of the ships have the capacity for another one.) [[RIM-162 ESSM|VL Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile]]s, a special [[SMART-L|SMART-L Radar]] and a [[Active Phased Array Radar|Thales APAR]], all of whom are for air defense. Another example is the {{sclass-|Iver Huitfeldt|frigate|4}} of the [[Danish Navy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marineschepen.nl/schepen/zeprov.html#specs|title=De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn classe (LCF)|publisher=Jaime Karreman|access-date=24 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924185534/https://marineschepen.nl/schepen/zeprov.html#specs|archive-date=24 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:Shivalik Maiden Sortie.jpg|thumb|The stealthy {{sclass-|Shivalik|frigate|2}} of the Indian Navy]]\n[[File:FS_Surcouf.jpg|thumb|The stealthy {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}} of the French Navy that introduced the Stealth Technology in the early 1990s]]\n\n[[Stealth technology]] has been introduced in modern frigate design by the French {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}} design.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/frigates.asp|title=Navy Frigate Warships|access-date=2017-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701095136/http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/frigates.asp|archive-date=1 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Frigate shapes are designed to offer a minimal [[radar cross section]], which also lends them good air penetration; the maneuverability of these frigates has been compared to that of sailing ships. Examples are the Italian and French {{sclass2-|Horizon|frigate|4}} with the [[Aster 15]] and [[Aster 30]] missile for anti-missile capabilities, the [[Germany|German]] {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|5}} and {{sclass-|Sachsen|frigate|2}}<nowiki/>s, the [[Turkey|Turkish]] {{sclass2-|TF2000|frigate|5}} type frigates with the [[MK-41 VLS]] and the [[India]]n {{sclass-|Shivalik|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Talwar|frigate|4}} and {{sclass-|Nilgiri|frigate|5||2019}} classes with the [[Brahmos missile]] system.\n\nThe modern [[French Navy]] applies the term first-class frigate and second-class frigate to both destroyers and frigates in service. Pennant numbers remain divided between F-series numbers for those ships internationally recognised as frigates and D-series pennant numbers for those more traditionally recognised as destroyers. This can result in some confusion as certain classes are referred to as frigates in French service while similar ships in other navies are referred to as destroyers. This also results in some recent classes of French ships such as the {{sclass2-|Horizon|frigate|4}} being among the largest in the world to carry the rating of frigate.\n\n[[File:BADEN-WURTTEMBERG 00257 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg'', an {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|1}} of the [[German Navy]]; currently the biggest frigates worldwide.]]\nIn the [[German Navy]], frigates were used to replace aging destroyers; however in size and role the new German frigates exceed the former class of destroyers. The future German {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|1}}s will be the largest class of frigates worldwide with a displacement of more than 7,200&nbsp;tons. The same was done in the [[Spanish Navy]], which went ahead with the deployment of the first [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]] frigates, the {{sclass-|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n|frigate|2}}s.\n\n===Littoral combat ship (LCS)===\n[[File:USS Independence LCS-2 at pierce (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Independence|LCS-2|6}}, an {{sclass-|Independence|littoral combat ship}} of the United States Navy]]\n\nSome new classes of ships similar to [[corvette]]s are optimized for high-speed deployment and combat with small craft rather than combat between equal opponents; an example is the U.S. [[littoral combat ship]] (LCS). As of 2015, all {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|2}}<nowiki/>s in the United States Navy have been decommissioned, and their role partially being assumed by the new LCS. While the LCS class ships are smaller than the frigate class they will replace, they offer a similar degree of weaponry while requiring less than half the crew complement and offering a top speed of over {{convert|40|kn}}. A major advantage for the LCS ships is that they are designed around specific mission modules allowing them to fulfill a variety of roles. The modular system also allows for most upgrades to be performed ashore and installed later into the ship, keeping the ships available for deployment for the maximum time.\n\nThe latest U.S. deactivation plans means that this is the first time that the U.S. Navy has been without a frigate class of ships since 1943 (technically {{USS|Constitution}} is rated as a frigate and is still in commission, but does not count towards Navy force levels).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140702/NEWS04/307020082/Decommissioning-plan-pulls-all-frigates-from-fleet-by-end-FY-15 |title=Decommissioning plan pulls all frigates from fleet by end of FY '15 |last=Larter |first=David |work=Militarytimes.com |date=2 July 2014 |accessdate=25 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703031337/http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140702/NEWS04/307020082/Decommissioning-plan-pulls-all-frigates-from-fleet-by-end-FY-15 |archive-date=3 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe remaining 20 LCSs to be acquired from 2019 and onwards that will be enhanced will be designated as frigates, and existing ships given modifications may also have their classification changed to ''FF'' as well.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/01/15/sna-modified-littoral-combat-ship-class-changed-fast-frigate SNA: Modified Littoral Combat Ships to be Designated Frigates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806141654/https://news.usni.org/2015/01/15/sna-modified-littoral-combat-ship-class-changed-fast-frigate |date=6 August 2017 }} \u2013 News.USNI.org, 15 January 2015</ref>\n\n==Frigates in preservation==\n\nA few nations have frigates on display as museum ships.

These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted [[Naval artillery|guns]] on a single [[deck (ship)|deck]] or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel). The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the [[line of battle]], although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed.\n\nIn the 18th century, frigates were [[full-rigged ship]]s, that is [[square rig|square-rigged]] on all three masts, they were built for speed and handiness, had a lighter armament than a [[ship of the line]], and were used for patrolling and escort. In the definition adopted by the [[British Admiralty]], they were [[Rating system of the Royal Navy|rated ships]] of at least 28 guns, carrying their principal armaments upon a single continuous deck \u2013 the upper deck \u2013 while ships of the line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns.\n\nIn the late 19th century (beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies), the '''armoured frigate''' was a type of [[ironclad warship]] that for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat. The term \"frigate\" was used because such ships still mounted their principal armaments on a single continuous upper deck.\n\nIn modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and [[merchant-marine]] ships, especially as [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant [[convoy]]s. Ship classes dubbed \"frigates\" have also more closely resembled [[corvette]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[cruiser]]s and even battleships. Some European navies such as the Dutch, French, German or Spanish ones use the term \"frigate\" for both their destroyers and frigates.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The rank \"[[frigate captain]]\" derives from the name of this type of ship.\n\n==Age of sail==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Frc3a9gate-c3a0-la-voile1.jpg|thumb|Light frigate, circa 1675\u20131680]]\n\nThe term \"frigate\" (Italian: ''fregata''; Spanish/Catalan/Portuguese/Sicilian: ''fragata''; Dutch: ''fregat''; French: ''fr\u00e9gate'') originated in the [[Mediterranean]] in the late 15th century, referring to a lighter [[galley]]-type warship with oars, sails and a light armament, built for speed and maneuverability.<ref name=\"Henderson\">Henderson, James: ''Frigates Sloops & Brigs''. Pen & Sword Books, London, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84415-301-0}}.</ref> The etymology of the word remains uncertain, although it may have originated as a [[corruption (linguistic)|corruption]] of ''[[Wikt:aphractus|aphractus]]'', a [[Latin]] word for an open vessel with no lower deck. ''Aphractus'', in turn, derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] phrase \u1f04\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c2 (''aphraktos naus'') \u2013 \"undefended ship\".\n\nIn 1583, during the [[Eighty Years' War]] of 1568\u20131648, [[Habsburg Spain]] recovered the [[southern Netherlands]] from the Protestant rebels. This soon resulted in the use of the occupied ports as bases for [[privateers]], the \"[[Dunkirker]]s\", to attack the shipping of the Dutch and their allies. To achieve this the Dunkirkers developed small, maneuverable, sailing vessels that came to be referred to as frigates. The success of these Dunkirker vessels influenced the ship design of other navies contending with them, but because most regular navies required ships of greater endurance than the Dunkirker frigates could provide, the term soon came to apply less exclusively to any relatively fast and elegant sail-only warship. In French, the term \"frigate\" gave rise to a verb \u2013 ''fr\u00e9gater'', meaning 'to build long and low', and to an adjective, adding more confusion. Even the huge English {{HMS|Sovereign of the Seas||2}} could be described as \"a delicate frigate\" by a contemporary after her upper decks were reduced in 1651.<ref>Rodger (2004) p. 216</ref>\n\nThe navy of the [[Dutch Republic]] became the first navy to build the larger ocean-going frigates. The Dutch navy had three principal tasks in the struggle against Spain: to protect Dutch merchant ships at sea, to blockade the ports of Spanish-held [[Flanders]] to damage trade and halt enemy [[privateering]], and to fight the Spanish fleet and prevent troop landings. The first two tasks required speed, shallowness of draft for the shallow waters around the Netherlands, and the ability to carry sufficient supplies to maintain a blockade. The third task required heavy armament, sufficient to stand up to the Spanish fleet. The first of the larger battle-capable frigates were built around 1600 at [[Hoorn]] in [[County of Holland|Holland]].<ref>Geofrrey Parker, ''The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West 1500\u20131800'', p. 99</ref> By the later stages of the [[Eighty Years' War]] the Dutch had switched entirely from the heavier ships still used by the English and Spanish to the lighter frigates, carrying around 40&nbsp;guns and weighing around 300&nbsp;tons.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Dutch frigates became most evident in the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639, encouraging most other navies, especially the English, to adopt similar designs.\n\nThe fleets built by the [[Commonwealth of England]] in the 1650s generally consisted of ships described as \"frigates\", the largest of which were two-decker \"great frigates\" of the [[Third-rate|third rate]]. Carrying 60&nbsp;guns, these vessels were as big and capable as \"great ships\" of the time; however, most other frigates at the time were used as \"[[cruiser]]s\": independent fast ships. The term \"frigate\" implied a long hull-design, which relates directly to speed (see [[hull speed]]) and which also, in turn, helped the development of the [[broadside]] tactic in naval warfare.\n\n[[File:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|{{Ship|French frigate|Boudeuse|1766|2}}, of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]]]\n\nAt this time, a further design evolved, reintroducing oars and resulting in galley frigates such as {{HMS|Charles Galley|1676|6}} of 1676, which was rated as a 32-gun [[fifth-rate]] but also had a bank of 40 oars set below the upper deck which could propel the ship in the absence of a favourable wind.\n\nIn Danish, the word \"fregat\" often applies to warships carrying as few as 16 guns, such as {{HMS|Falcon|1802|6}}, which the British classified as a sloop.\n\nUnder the [[rating system of the Royal Navy]], by the middle of the 18th century, the term \"frigate\" was technically restricted to single-decked ships of the [[Fifth-rate|fifth rate]], though small 28-gun frigates classed as [[Sixth-rate|sixth rate]].<ref name=\"Henderson\"/>\n\n===Classic design===\n[[File:Lutine1.jpg|thumb|A {{sclass-|Magicienne|frigate|1}}]]\n[[File:Main batteries of M\u00e9duse-Garneray-IMG 4787-cropped.JPG|thumb|Gun deck of the {{sclass-|Pallas|frigate|0||1808}} frigate {{ship|French frigate|M\u00e9duse|1810|2}}]]\n\nThe classic sailing frigate, well-known today for its role in the [[Napoleonic wars]], can be traced back to French developments in the second quarter of the 18th century. The French-built {{ship|French frigate|M\u00e9d\u00e9e|1741|2}} of 1740 is often regarded as the first example of this type. These ships were square-rigged and carried all their main guns on a single continuous upper deck. The lower deck, known as the \"gun deck\", now carried no armament, and functioned as a \"berth deck\" where the crew lived, and was in fact placed below the waterline of the new frigates. The typical earlier cruiser had a partially armed lower deck, from which it was known as a 'half-battery' or ''demi-batterie'' ship. Removing the guns from this deck allowed the height of the hull upperworks to be lowered, giving the resulting 'true-frigate' much improved sailing qualities. The unarmed deck meant that the frigate's guns were carried comparatively high above the waterline; as a result, when seas were too rough for two-deckers to open their lower deck gun-ports, frigates were still able to fight with all their guns (see the [[Action of 13 January 1797]], for an example when this was decisive).<ref name=\"Breen\">{{cite journal |last=Breen |first=Colin |last2=Forsythe |first2=Wes |year=2007 |title=The French Shipwreck La Surveillante, Lost in Bantry Bay, Ireland, in 1797 |jstor=25617454  |journal=Historical Archaeology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201342}}</ref><ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\nA total of fifty-nine French sailing frigates were built between 1777 and 1790, with a standard design averaging a hull length of {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} and an average draught of {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The new frigates recorded sailing speeds of up to {{convert|14|kn|km/h mph}}, significantly faster than their predecessor vessels.<ref name=\"Breen\"/>\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] captured a number of the new French frigates, including ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e'', during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748) and were impressed by them, particularly for their inshore handling capabilities. They soon built copies (ordered in 1747), based on a French privateer named ''Tygre'', and started to adapt the type to their own needs, setting the standard for other frigates as the leading naval power. The first British frigates carried 28 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-four 9-pounder guns (the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck) but soon developed into fifth-rate ships of 32 or 36 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-six 12-pounder guns, with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle.<ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 37</ref>\n\n===Heavy frigate===\n[[File:HMS Trincomalee.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Trincomalee}} (1817) a restored British 18-pounder, 38-gun heavy frigate]]\nIn 1778, the British Admiralty introduced a larger \"heavy\" frigate, with a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounder guns (with smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle). This move may reflect the naval conditions at the time, with both France and Spain as enemies the usual British preponderance in ship numbers was no longer the case and there was pressure on the British to produce cruisers of individually greater force. In reply, the first French 18-pounder frigates were laid down in 1781. The 18-pounder frigate eventually became the standard frigate of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The British produced larger, 38-gun, and slightly smaller, 36-gun, versions and also a 32-gun design that can be considered an 'economy version'. The 32-gun frigates also had the advantage that they could be built by the many smaller, less-specialised shipbuilders.<ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 39</ref><ref>Gardiner (2000), p. 19</ref>\n\nFrigates could (and usually did) additionally carry smaller carriage-mounted guns on their quarter decks and [[forecastle]]s (the superstructures above the upper deck). Technically, rated ships with fewer than 28&nbsp;guns could not be classed as frigates but as \"[[post ship]]s\"; however, in common parlance most post ships were often described as \"frigates\", the same casual misuse of the term being extended to smaller two-decked ships that were too small to stand in the line of battle. In 1778 the Carron Iron Company of Scotland produced a naval gun which would revolutionise the armament of smaller naval vessels, including the frigate. The [[carronade]] was a large calibre, short-barrelled naval cannon which was light, quick to reload and needed a smaller crew than a conventional long gun. Due to its lightness it could be mounted on the forecastle and quarter deck of frigates. It greatly increased the firepower, measured in weight of metal (the combined weight of all projectiles fired in one broadside), of these vessels. The disadvantages of the carronade were that it had a much shorter range and was less accurate than a long gun. The British quickly saw the advantages of the new weapon and soon employed it on a wide scale. The US Navy also copied the design soon after its appearance. The French and other nations eventually adopted variations of the weapon in succeeding decades. The typical heavy frigate had a main armament of 18-pounder long guns, plus 32-pounder carronades mounted on its upper decks.<ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 153</ref>\n\n===Super-heavy frigates===\n[[File:USS Constitution underway, August 19, 2012 by Castle Island cropped.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}}.]]\nThe first 'super-heavy frigates', armed with 24-pounder long guns, were built by the naval architect [[Fredrik Henrik af Chapman|F H Chapman]] for the Swedish navy in 1782. Because of a shortage of ships-of-the-line, the Swedes wanted these frigates, the ''Bellona'' class, to be able to stand in the battle line in an emergency. In the 1790s the French built a small number of large 24-pounder frigates, such as {{ship|French frigate|Forte|1794|2}} and ''Egyptienne'', they also cut-down (reduced the height of the hull to give only one continuous gun deck) a number of older ships-of-the-line (including {{ship|French ship|Diad\u00e8me|1756|2}}) to produce super-heavy frigates, the resulting ship was known as a [[Razee|''ras\u00e9e'']]. It is not known whether the French were seeking to produce very potent cruisers or merely to address stability problems in old ships. The British, alarmed by the prospect of these powerful heavy frigates, responded by ras\u00e9e-ing three of the smaller 64-gun battleships, including {{HMS|Indefatigable|1784|2}}, which went on to have a very successful career as a frigate. At this time the British also built a few 24-pounder-armed large frigates, the most successful of which was {{HMS|Endymion|1797|6}} (1,277 tons).<ref>Gardiner (200), pp. 40\u201342</ref><ref>Gardiner and Lavery (1992), p. 40</ref>\n\nIn 1797, three of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[original six frigates of the United States Navy|first six major ships]] were rated as 44-gun frigates, which operationally carried fifty-six to sixty [[24-pounder long gun]]s and 32-pounder or 42-pounder carronades on two decks; they were exceptionally powerful. These ships were so large, at around 1,500 tons, and well-armed that they were often regarded as equal to ships of the line, and after a series of losses at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], Royal Navy fighting instructions ordered British frigates (usually of 38 guns or less) to never engage the large American frigates at any less than a 2:1 advantage. {{USS|Constitution}}, preserved as a [[museum ship]] by the US Navy, is the oldest commissioned warship afloat, and is a surviving example of a frigate from the [[Age of Sail]]. ''Constitution'' and her sister ships {{USS|President|1800|2}} and {{USS|United States|1797|2}} were created in a response to deal with the Barbary Coast pirates and in conjunction with the [[Naval Act of 1794]]. [[Joshua Humphreys]] proposed that only [[live oak]], a tree that grew only in America, should be used to build these ships. The three big frigates, when built, had a distinctive building pattern which minimised \"[[Hogging and sagging|hogging]]\" (in which the centre of the keel rises while both ends drop) and improved hydrodynamic efficiency. Diagonal riders were employed, eight on each side, that sat at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal. These beams were about {{convert|2|ft|cm}} wide and around {{convert|1|ft|cm}} thick and helped to maintain the shape of the hull, serving also to reduce flexibility and to minimize impacts.<ref name=\"Archibald, Roger 1997\">Archibald, Roger. 1997. Six ships that shook the world. American Heritage of Invention & Technology 13, (2): 24.</ref>\n\nThe British, wounded by repeated defeats in single-ship actions, responded to the success of the American 44s in three ways. They built a class of conventional 40-gun, 24-pounder armed frigates on the lines of ''Endymion''. They cut down three old 74-gun battleships into ras\u00e9es, producing frigates with a 32-pounder main armament, supplemented by 42-pounder carronades. These had an armament that far exceeded the power of the American ships. Finally, {{HMS|Leander|1813|2}} and {{HMS|Newcastle|1813|2}}, 1,500-ton spar-decked frigates (with an enclosed waist, giving a continuous line of guns from bow to stern at the level of the quarter deck/forecastle), were built, which were an almost exact match in size and firepower to the American 44-gun frigates.<ref>Gardiner (200), pp. 48\u201356</ref>\n\n===Role===\n[[File:HMS warriorjune20092.jpg|right|upright=1.1|thumb|{{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}, the first iron-hulled armoured steam frigate \u2013 the hull survived as an oil terminal dock and was restored to its original appearance in the late 20th century]]\n\nFrigates were perhaps the hardest-worked of warship types during the [[Age of Sail]]. While smaller than a [[Ship of the line|ship-of-the-line]], they were formidable opponents for the large numbers of [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] and [[gunboat]]s, not to mention [[privateer]]s or merchantmen. Able to carry six months' stores, they had very long range; and vessels larger than frigates were considered too valuable to operate independently.\n\nFrigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, and conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually, frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with ships-of-the-line; even in the midst of a fleet engagement it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lavery |first=Brian |title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organisation 1793\u20131815 |year=1989 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |isbn=978-1-59114-611-7 |pages=49, 298\u2013300}}</ref> Frigates were involved in fleet battles, often as \"repeating frigates\". In the smoke and confusion of battle, [[Naval flag signalling|signals]] made by the fleet commander, whose [[flagship]] might be in the thick of the fighting, might be missed by the other ships of the fleet.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite book |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|volume=17|page=469}}</ref> Frigates were therefore stationed to windward or leeward of the main [[line of battle]], and had to maintain a clear line of sight to the commander's flagship. Signals from the flagship were then repeated by the frigates, which themselves standing out of the line and clear from the smoke and disorder of battle, could be more easily seen by the other ships of the fleet.<ref name=\"EB\"/> If damage or loss of masts prevented the flagship from making clear conventional signals, the repeating frigates could interpret them and hoist their own in the correct manner, passing on the commander's instructions clearly.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nFor officers in the Royal Navy, a frigate was a desirable posting. Frigates often saw action, which meant a greater chance of glory, promotion, and [[prize money]].\n\nUnlike larger ships that were placed [[Reserve Fleet|in ordinary]], frigates were kept in service in peacetime as a cost-saving measure and to provide experience to frigate captains and officers which would be useful in wartime. Frigates could also carry [[marine (military)|marines]] for boarding enemy ships or for operations on shore; in 1832, the frigate {{USS|Potomac|1822|6}} landed a party of 282 sailors and Marines ashore in the US Navy's [[first Sumatran expedition]].\n\nFrigates remained a crucial element of navies until the mid-19th century. The first [[Ironclad warship|ironclads]] were classified as \"frigates\" because of the number of guns they carried. However, terminology changed as iron and steam became the norm, and the role of the frigate was assumed first by the [[protected cruiser]] and then by the [[light cruiser]].\n\nFrigates are often the vessel of choice in historical naval novels due to their relative freedom compared to ships-of-the-line (kept for fleet actions) and smaller vessels (generally assigned to a home port and less widely ranging). For example, the [[Patrick O'Brian]] [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]], [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series and [[Douglas Reeman|Alexander Kent]]'s [[Richard Bolitho]] series. The motion picture ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'' features a reconstructed historic frigate, [[HMS Surprise (replica ship)|HMS ''Rose'']], to depict Aubrey's frigate HMS ''Surprise''.\n\n==Age of steam==\n{{Main|Steam frigate}}\n[[File:Lebreton engraving-26.jpg|thumb|French [[Paddle steamer|paddle]] frigate {{Ship|French frigate|Descartes||2}}]]\n\nVessels classed as frigates continued to play a great role in navies with the adoption of steam power in the 19th century. In the 1830s, navies experimented with large [[paddle steamer]]s equipped with large guns mounted on one deck, which were termed \"paddle frigates\".\n\nFrom the mid-1840s on, frigates which more closely resembled the traditional sailing frigate were built with steam engines and screw [[propeller]]s. These \"[[Steam frigate|screw frigates]]\", built first of wood and later of [[Wrought iron|iron]], continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century.\n\n===Armoured frigate===\nFrom 1859, armour was added to ships based on existing frigate and [[ship of the line]] designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first [[ironclad warship]]s meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role. The phrase \"armoured frigate\" remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped, broadside-firing type of ironclad.\n\nAfter 1875, the term \"frigate\" fell out of use. Vessels with armoured sides were designated as \"[[battleship]]s\" or \"[[Armored cruiser|armoured cruiser]]s\", while \"[[protected cruiser]]s\" only possessed an armoured deck, and unarmoured vessels, including frigates and sloops, were classified as \"unprotected cruisers\".\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|List of frigates of World War II}}\n[[File:Lochmorlich.jpg|thumb|A {{sclass2-|Loch|frigate|1}}]]\n[[File:USS Gallup (PF-47).jpg|thumb|The U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Tacoma|frigate|0}} patrol frigate {{USS|Gallup|PF-47|6}} at [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], [[California]], on 30 May 1944]]\n\nModern frigates are related to earlier frigates only by name. The term \"frigate\" was readopted during the [[World War II|Second World War]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] to describe an [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] escort vessel that was larger than a [[corvette]], while smaller than a [[destroyer]]. Equal in size and capability to the American [[destroyer escort]], frigates are usually less expensive to build and maintain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.military-today.com/navy/top_10_frigates.htm|title=Top 10 Frigates {{!}} Military-Today.com|last=ARG|website=www.military-today.com|access-date=2017-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629102103/http://www.military-today.com/navy/top_10_frigates.htm|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Anti-submarine escorts had previously been classified as [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] by the Royal Navy, and the {{sclass-|Black Swan|sloop|2}}<nowiki/>s of 1939\u20131945 were as large as the new types of frigate, and more heavily armed. Twenty-two of these were reclassified as frigates after the war, as were the remaining 24 smaller {{sclass2-|Castle|corvette|2}}<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe frigate was introduced to remedy some of the shortcomings inherent in the {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette|0}} corvette design: limited armament, a hull form not suited to open-ocean work, a single [[driveshaft|shaft]] which limited speed and manoeuvrability, and a lack of range. The frigate was designed and built to the same mercantile construction standards ([[scantling]]s) as the corvette, allowing manufacture by yards unused to warship construction. The first frigates of the {{sclass2-|River|frigate|4}} (1941) were essentially two sets of corvette machinery in one larger hull, armed with the latest [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine weapon.\n\nThe frigate possessed less offensive firepower and speed than a [[destroyer]], but such qualities were not required for anti-submarine warfare. Submarines were slow while submerged, and [[ASDIC]] sets did not operate effectively at speeds of over {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}}. Rather, the frigate was an austere and weatherly vessel suitable for mass-construction and fitted with the latest innovations in anti-submarine warfare. As the frigate was intended purely for convoy duties, and not to deploy with the fleet, it had limited range and speed.\n\nThe contemporary [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[F-class escort ship|Flottenbegleiter]]'' (\"fleet escorts\"), also known as \"F-Boats\", were essentially frigates.<ref>[http://www.prinzeugen.com/FRIND.htm prinzeugen.com \"Frigate: An Online Photo Album\".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421143031/http://www.prinzeugen.com/FRIND.htm |date=21 April 2008 }} Retrieved on: 11 February 2008.</ref> They were based on a pre-war ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' concept of vessels which could fill roles such as fast minesweeper, minelayer, merchant escort and anti-submarine vessel. Because of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] their displacement was officially limited to 600&nbsp;tons, although in reality they exceeded this by about 100&nbsp;tons. F-boats had two stacks and two 105&nbsp;mm gun turrets. The design was flawed because of its narrow beam, sharp bow and unreliable high pressure steam turbines. F-boats were succeeded in operational duties by [[Torpedo boat type 35|Type 35]] and {{sclass2-|Elbing|torpedo boat|1}}s. ''Flottenbegleiter'' remained in service as advanced training vessels.\n\nIt was not until the Royal Navy's {{sclass2-|Bay|frigate|4}} of 1944 that a British design classified as a \"frigate\" was produced for fleet use, although it still suffered from limited speed. These [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] frigates, built on incomplete {{sclass2-|Loch|frigate|2}} hulls, were similar to the [[United States Navy]]'s [[destroyer escort]]s (DE), although the latter had greater speed and offensive armament to better suit them to fleet deployments. The destroyer escort concept came from design studies by the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] in 1940, as modified by requirements established by a British commission in 1941<ref>Gardiner, Robert, ed., ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1922\u20131946'', New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, {{ISBN|0-8317-0303-2}}, p. 149.</ref> prior to the American entry into the war, for deep-water escorts. The American-built destroyer escorts serving in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] were rated as [[Captain-class frigate|Captain-class]] frigates. The U.S. Navy's two [[Canada|Canadian]]-built {{sclass-|Asheville|frigate|0}} and 96 British-influenced, American-built {{sclass-|Tacoma|frigate|0}} frigates that followed originally were classified as \"patrol [[gunboat]]s\" (PG) in the U.S. Navy but on 15 April 1943 were all reclassified as '''patrol frigates (PF)'''.\n\n==Contemporary==\n===Guided-missile role===\n[[File:HMCS Regina (FFH 334) Frigate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|2}} {{HMCS|Regina|FFH 334|6}} escorting the American aircraft carrier {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} across the Pacific Ocean in 2008]]\n[[File:Chilean frigate Almirante Lynch.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ecuadorian Navy]] {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|2}} BAE ''Mor\u00e1n Valverde'', formerly the [[Chilean Navy]]'s {{ship|Chilean frigate|Almirante Lynch|PFG-07|2}}]]\n[[File:USS Leahy (CG-16) at sea off San Diego, in May 1978.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Leahy|DLG-16|6}} departing [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California, in May 1978. She was classified as a guided-missile frigate (DLG-16) until 1975, when she was reclassified as a [[guided-missile cruiser]] (CG-16).]]\n\nThe introduction of the [[surface-to-air missile]] after World War II made relatively small ships effective for anti-aircraft warfare: the \"guided missile frigate\". <!-- removing this sentence, it does not conform to the NPOV, and in any case it is incorrect. \"Designed as cost-efficient surface combatants, they lack the multi-mission capability necessary for modern surface combatants faced with multiple, high-technology threats and offer limited capacity for growth\" --> In the USN, these vessels were called \"[[ocean escort]]s\" and [[hull classification symbol|designated]] \"DE\" or \"DEG\" until 1975 \u2013 a holdover from the World War II [[destroyer escort]] or \"DE\". The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and British [[Royal Navy]] maintained the use of the term \"frigate\"; likewise, the French Navy refers to missile-equipped ship, up to cruiser-sized ships ({{sclass-|Suffren|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Tourville|frigate|5}}, and {{sclass-|Horizon|frigate|4}}es), by the name of \"fr\u00e9gate\", while smaller units are named ''[[aviso]]''. The Soviet Navy used the term \"guard-ship\" (''\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044c'').\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the [[United States Navy]] commissioned ships classed as guided missile frigates ([[hull classification symbol]] DLG or DLGN, literally meaning guided missile [[destroyer leader]]s), which were actually anti-aircraft warfare [[cruiser]]s built on [[destroyer]]-style hulls. These had one or two twin launchers per ship for the [[RIM-2 Terrier]] missile, upgraded to the [[RIM-67 Standard]] ER missile in the 1980s. This type of ship was intended primarily to defend aircraft carriers against anti-ship [[cruise missile]]s, augmenting and eventually replacing converted World War II cruisers (CAG/CLG/CG) in this role. The guided missile frigates also had an anti-submarine capability that most of the World War II cruiser conversions lacked. Some of these ships \u2013 {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}} and {{USS|Truxtun|CGN-35|2}} along with the {{sclass-|California|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|cruiser|4}}es \u2013 were [[United States naval reactors|nuclear-powered]] (DLGN).<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 215\u2013217</ref> These \"frigates\" were roughly mid-way in size between cruisers and destroyers. This was similar to the use of the term \"frigate\" during the age of sail during which it referred to a medium-sized warship, but it was inconsistent with conventions used by other contemporary navies which regarded frigates as being smaller than destroyers. During the [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification|1975 ship reclassification]], the large American frigates were redesignated as guided missile cruisers or destroyers (CG/CGN/DDG), while [[ocean escort]]s (the American classification for ships smaller than destroyers, with hull symbol DE/DEG ([[destroyer escort]])) were reclassified as frigates (FF/FFG), sometimes incorrectly called \"fast frigates\". In the late 1970s the [[US Navy]] introduced the 51-ship [[Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class]] guided missile frigates (FFG), the last of which was decommissioned in 2015, although some serve in other navies.<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 251\u2013252</ref> By 1995 the older guided missile cruisers and destroyers were replaced by the {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s and {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 580\u2013585</ref>\n\nOne of the most successful post-1945 designs was the British {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|2}}, which was used by several navies. Laid down in 1959, the ''Leander''-class was based on the previous [[Whitby-class frigate|Type 12 anti-submarine frigate]] but equipped for anti-aircraft use as well. They were used by the UK into the 1990s, at which point some were sold onto other navies. The ''Leander'' design, or improved versions of it, were licence-built for other navies as well.\n\nNearly all modern frigates are equipped with some form of offensive or defensive missiles, and as such are rated as guided-missile frigates (FFG). Improvements in surface-to-air missiles (e.g., the [[Eurosam]] [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]]) allow modern guided-missile frigates to form the core of many modern navies and to be used as a fleet defence platform, without the need for specialised anti-air warfare frigates.\n\n===Other uses===\nThe Royal Navy [[Salisbury-class frigate|Type 61 ''Salisbury'' class]] were [[radar picket|\"air direction\"]] frigates equipped to track aircraft. To this end they had reduced armament compared to the [[Leopard-class frigate|Type 41 ''Leopard''-class]] air-defence frigates built on the same hull.\n\nMulti-role frigates like the [[MEKO 200]], {{sclass-|Anzac|frigate|5}} and {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|4}}es are designed for navies needing warships deployed in a variety of situations that a general frigate class would not be able to fulfill and not requiring the need for deploying [[destroyer]]s.\n\n===Anti-submarine role===\n[[File:HMS Somerset (F82).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Somerset|F82|6}} of the [[Royal Navy]]. [[Type 23 frigate]]s were built for [[anti-submarine warfare]] but are capable multi-purpose ships.<ref>http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/type-23-frigates/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531045448/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/type-23-frigates/ |date=31 May 2010 }} Type 23 frigates at the Royal Navy website</ref>]]\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, some frigates are specialised for [[anti-submarine warfare]]. Increasing submarine speeds towards the end of World War II (see [[German Type XXI submarine]]) greatly reduced the margin of speed superiority of frigate over submarine. The frigate could no longer be slow and powered by mercantile machinery and consequently postwar frigates, such as the {{sclass-|Whitby|frigate|4}}, were faster.\n\nSuch ships carry improved [[sonar]] equipment, such as the [[Sonar#Anti-submarine warfare|variable depth sonar]] or [[towed array sonar|towed array]], and specialised weapons such as [[torpedo]]es, forward-throwing weapons such as [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] and missile-carried anti-submarine torpedoes such as [[ASROC]] or [[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]]. Surface-to-air missiles such as [[AIM-7 Sparrow#Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] and surface-to-surface missiles such as [[Exocet]] give them defensive and offensive capabilities. The Royal Navy's original [[Type 22 frigate]] is an example of a specialised anti-submarine warfare frigate.\n\nEspecially for anti-submarine warfare, most modern frigates have a [[Helipad|landing deck]] and [[hangar]] aft to operate [[helicopter]]s, eliminating the need for the frigate to close with unknown sub-surface threats, and using fast helicopters to attack nuclear submarines which may be faster than surface warships. For this task the helicopter is equipped with sensors such as [[sonobuoy]]s, wire-mounted dipping sonar and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s to identify possible threats, and torpedoes or [[depth-charge]]s to attack them.\n\nWith their onboard radar helicopters can also be used to reconnoitre over-the-horizon targets and, if equipped with [[anti-ship missile]]s such as [[Penguin missile|Penguin]] or [[Sea Skua]], to attack them. The helicopter is also invaluable for [[search and rescue]] operation and has largely replaced the use of [[dinghy|small boats]] or the [[Underway replenishment|jackstay rig]] for such duties as transferring personnel, mail and cargo between ships or to shore. With helicopters these tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously, and without the need for the frigate to slow down or change course.\n\n===Air defense role===\n[[File:HNLMS De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn (F 802).jpg|thumb|{{HNLMS|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn|F802|6}}]]\nSome frigates are specialised in [[airdefense]], because of the major developments in [[fighter jet]]s and [[ballistic missile]]s.\nAn example is the {{sclass-|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn|frigate|0}} air defense and command frigate of the [[Royal Dutch Navy]]. These ships are armed with [[RIM-66 Standard|VL Standard Missile 2 Block IIIA]], one or two [[Goalkeeper CIWS]] systems, ({{HNLMS|Evertsen|F805|6}} has two Goalkeepers, the rest of the ships have the capacity for another one.) [[RIM-162 ESSM|VL Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile]]s, a special [[SMART-L|SMART-L Radar]] and a [[Active Phased Array Radar|Thales APAR]], all of whom are for air defense. Another example is the {{sclass-|Iver Huitfeldt|frigate|4}} of the [[Danish Navy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marineschepen.nl/schepen/zeprov.html#specs|title=De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn classe (LCF)|publisher=Jaime Karreman|access-date=24 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924185534/https://marineschepen.nl/schepen/zeprov.html#specs|archive-date=24 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:Shivalik Maiden Sortie.jpg|thumb|The stealthy {{sclass-|Shivalik|frigate|2}} of the Indian Navy]]\n[[File:FS_Surcouf.jpg|thumb|The stealthy {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}} of the French Navy that introduced the Stealth Technology in the early 1990s]]\n\n[[Stealth technology]] has been introduced in modern frigate design by the French {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}} design.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/frigates.asp|title=Navy Frigate Warships|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701095136/http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/frigates.asp|archive-date=1 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Frigate shapes are designed to offer a minimal [[radar cross section]], which also lends them good air penetration; the maneuverability of these frigates has been compared to that of sailing ships. Examples are the Italian and French {{sclass2-|Horizon|frigate|4}} with the [[Aster 15]] and [[Aster 30]] missile for anti-missile capabilities, the [[Germany|German]] {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|5}} and {{sclass-|Sachsen|frigate|2}}<nowiki/>s, the [[Turkey|Turkish]] {{sclass2-|TF2000|frigate|5}} type frigates with the [[MK-41 VLS]] and the [[India]]n {{sclass-|Shivalik|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Talwar|frigate|4}} and {{sclass-|Nilgiri|frigate|5||2019}} classes with the [[Brahmos missile]] system.\n\nThe modern [[French Navy]] applies the term first-class frigate and second-class frigate to both destroyers and frigates in service. Pennant numbers remain divided between F-series numbers for those ships internationally recognised as frigates and D-series pennant numbers for those more traditionally recognised as destroyers. This can result in some confusion as certain classes are referred to as frigates in French service while similar ships in other navies are referred to as destroyers. This also results in some recent classes of French ships such as the {{sclass2-|Horizon|frigate|4}} being among the largest in the world to carry the rating of frigate.\n\n[[File:BADEN-WURTTEMBERG 00257 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg'', an {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|1}} of the [[German Navy]]; currently the biggest frigates worldwide.]]\nIn the [[German Navy]], frigates were used to replace aging destroyers; however in size and role the new German frigates exceed the former class of destroyers. The future German {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|1}}s will be the largest class of frigates worldwide with a displacement of more than 7,200&nbsp;tons. The same was done in the [[Spanish Navy]], which went ahead with the deployment of the first [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]] frigates, the {{sclass-|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n|frigate|2}}s.\n\n===Littoral combat ship (LCS)===\n[[File:USS Independence LCS-2 at pierce (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Independence|LCS-2|6}}, an {{sclass-|Independence|littoral combat ship}} of the United States Navy]]\n\nSome new classes of ships similar to [[corvette]]s are optimized for high-speed deployment and combat with small craft rather than combat between equal opponents; an example is the U.S. [[littoral combat ship]] (LCS). As of 2015, all {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|2}}<nowiki/>s in the United States Navy have been decommissioned, and their role partially being assumed by the new LCS. While the LCS class ships are smaller than the frigate class they will replace, they offer a similar degree of weaponry while requiring less than half the crew complement and offering a top speed of over {{convert|40|kn}}. A major advantage for the LCS ships is that they are designed around specific mission modules allowing them to fulfill a variety of roles. The modular system also allows for most upgrades to be performed ashore and installed later into the ship, keeping the ships available for deployment for the maximum time.\n\nThe latest U.S. deactivation plans means that this is the first time that the U.S. Navy has been without a frigate class of ships since 1943 (technically {{USS|Constitution}} is rated as a frigate and is still in commission, but does not count towards Navy force levels).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140702/NEWS04/307020082/Decommissioning-plan-pulls-all-frigates-from-fleet-by-end-FY-15 |title=Decommissioning plan pulls all frigates from fleet by end of FY '15 |last=Larter |first=David |work=Militarytimes.com |date=2 July 2014 |accessdate=25 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703031337/http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140702/NEWS04/307020082/Decommissioning-plan-pulls-all-frigates-from-fleet-by-end-FY-15 |archive-date=3 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe remaining 20 LCSs to be acquired from 2019 and onwards that will be enhanced will be designated as frigates, and existing ships given modifications may also have their classification changed to ''FF'' as well.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/01/15/sna-modified-littoral-combat-ship-class-changed-fast-frigate SNA: Modified Littoral Combat Ships to be Designated Frigates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806141654/https://news.usni.org/2015/01/15/sna-modified-littoral-combat-ship-class-changed-fast-frigate |date=6 August 2017 }} \u2013 News.USNI.org, 15 January 2015</ref>\n\n==Frigates in preservation==\n\nA few nations have frigates on display as museum ships.

It is bordered by the Pakistani province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] to the west. The state covers an area of 50,362 square kilometres, 1.53% of India's total geographical area. It is [[List of states and union territories of India by area|the 20th-largest Indian state]] by area. With 27,704,236 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Punjab is [[List of states and union territories of India by population|the 16th-largest state by population]], comprising [[List of districts of Punjab, India|22 districts]]. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. The main ethnic group are the [[Punjabis]], with [[Sikhs]] (58%) and [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] (38%). The state capital is Chandigarh, a [[Union Territory]] and also the capital of the neighbouring state of Haryana. The five tributary rivers of the [[Indus River]] from which the region took its name are [[Sutlej]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Jhelum river|Jhelum]] Rivers; Sutlej, Ravi and Beas are part of the Indian Punjab.\n\nThe [[history of Punjab]] has witnessed the migration and settlement of innumerable races, forming a melting pot of Punjabi civilisation.

The Punjab has had numerous recorded invasions, starting with the [[List of Rigvedic tribes|Vedic tribes]]. Punjab was enriched during the height of the [[Vedic period]], but declined in predominance with the rise of the [[Mahajanapadas]]. The region formed the frontier of initial empires during antiquity including the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]], [[Alexander's empire|Alexander's]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], and [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] Empires. After the fall of the Maurya Empire, the region was splintered into multiple kingdoms and republics. Punjab was subsequently conquered by the [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], and then [[Harsha Empire|Harsha's Empire]]. Punjab continued to be settled by nomadic people; including the [[Huna people|Huna]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. Circa 1000, the Punjab was ruled by [[Muslims]] and was part of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Mughal Empire]], and [[Durrani Empire]]. [[Sikhism]] originated in Punjab and resulted in the formation of the [[Sikh Confederacy]] after the fall of the Mughal Empire and ensuing conflict with the Durrani Empire. This confederacy was united into the [[Sikh Empire]] by Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]].\n\nGreater Punjab region was annexed by the [[British East India Company]] from the [[Sikh Empire]] in [[Anglo-Sikh Wars|1849]]. In 1947, the Punjab Province of British India was divided along religious lines into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]]. The western part was assimilated into [[Pakistan]] while the east became part of [[India]]. The [[East Punjab|Indian Punjab]] as well as [[PEPSU]] was divided into three parts on the basis of language in 1966. Hindi speaking areas (including various dialects) were carved out as Haryana, while the hilly regions and Pahari-speaking areas formed Himachal Pradesh, alongside the current state of Punjab. Punjab's government has three branches \u2013 executive, [[Judiciary of India|judiciary]] and [[Punjab Legislative Assembly|legislative]]. Punjab follows the parliamentary system of government with the Chief Minister as the head of the state.\n\nThe [[Economy of Punjab, India|economy of Punjab]] is the [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP|14th-largest state economy]] in India with {{INRConvert|5.18|lc}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GDP of {{INRConvert|153|k}}.<ref name=\"MOSPI\"/><ref name=\"esopb\"/> Punjab has the [[List of Indian states and territories by Human Development Index|ninth highest ranking]] among Indian states and union territories in [[human development index]] as of 2018.<ref name=\"snhdi-gdl\" /> Punjab is primarily agriculture-based due to the presence of abundant water sources and fertile soils.<ref>{{cite web|title=Punjab|url=http://m.oifc.in/Our-Partners/State-Partners/Punjab|publisher=Overseas Indian Facilitation Centre|accessdate=8 September 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010150641/http://m.oifc.in/Our-Partners/State-Partners/Punjab|archivedate=10 October 2011}}</ref> Other major industries include the manufacturing of [[scientific instruments]], agricultural goods, electrical goods, [[financial services]], [[machine tools]], [[textiles]], [[sewing machines]], [[sports goods]], [[starch]], [[tourism]], [[fertilisers]], [[bicycles]], [[garments]], and the processing of [[pine oil]] and [[sugar]].

Approximately 75% of the total Sikh population of the world lives in Punjab. Sikhism began at the time of the conquest of northern India by [[Babur]]. His grandson, [[Akbar]], supported religious freedom and after visiting the [[langar (Sikhism)|langar]] of [[Guru Amar Das]] had a favourable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and had a positive relationship with the [[Sikh Gurus]] until his death in 1605.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalsi|2005|pages=106\u2013107}}</ref> His successor, [[Jahangir]], saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He arrested [[Guru Arjun Dev]] because of Sikh support for [[Khusrau Mirza]]<ref>{{harvnb|Markovits|2004|page=98}}</ref> and ordered him put to death by torture. Guru Arjan Dev's [[martyrdom]] led to the sixth Guru, [[Guru Hargobind]], declaring Sikh [[sovereignty]] in the creation of the [[Akal Takht]] and the establishment of a fort to defend [[Amritsar]].<ref name=\"Jestice 2004 pages=345\u2013346\">{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=345\u2013346}}</ref>\n\nJahangir attempted to assert authority over the Sikhs by imprisoning Guru Hargobind at [[Gwalior]]. He felt compelled to release him when he began to suffer premonitions of an early and gruesome death. The Guru refused to be released unless the dozens of Hindu princes imprisoned with him were also granted freedom, to which Jahangir agreed. Sikhism did not have any further issues with the [[Mughal Empire]] until Jahangir's death in 1627. His successor, [[Shah Jahan]], \"took offense\" at Guru Hargobind's sovereignty and after a series of assaults on Amritsar forced the Sikhs to retreat to the [[Sivalik Hills]].<ref name=\"Jestice 2004 pages=345\u2013346\"/> Guru Hargobind's successor, [[Guru Har Rai]], maintained the guruship in the Sivalik Hills by defeating local attempts to seize Sikh land and taking a neutral role in the power struggle between [[Aurangzeb]] and [[Dara Shikoh]] for control of the [[Timurid dynasty]].\n\nThe ninth Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], moved the Sikh community to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] and travelled extensively to visit and preach in Sikh communities in defiance of Mughal rule. He aided [[Kashmiri Pandits]] in avoiding [[conversion to Islam]] and was arrested and confronted by Aurangzeb. When offered [[forced conversion|a choice between conversion or death]], he chose to die and was executed.<ref>{{harvnb|Johar|1975|pages=192\u2013210}}</ref>\n\n[[Guru Gobind Singh]] assumed the guruship in 1675 and to avoid battles with Sivalik Hill Rajas moved the guruship to [[Paonta Sahib|Paunta]]. He built a large fort to protect the city and garrisoned an army to protect it. The Sikh community's growing power alarmed Sivalik Hill Rajas, who attempted to attack the city, but the Guru's forces routed them at the [[Battle of Bhangani]]. He moved on to Anandpur and established the [[Khalsa]], a collective army of baptised Sikhs, on 13 April 1699. The establishment of the Khalsa united the Sikh community against various Mughal-backed claimants to the guruship.<ref>{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=312\u201313}}</ref>\n\nIn 1701, a combined army composed of the Sivalik Hill Rajas and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] army under Wazir Khan attacked Anandpur and, following a retreat by the Khalsa, was defeated by the Khalsa at the Battle of Muktsar. [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] was an [[ascetic]] who converted to Sikhism after meeting Guru Gobind Singh at [[Nanded]]. Shortly before his death, Guru Gobind Singh ordered him to uproot Mughal rule in Punjab and gave him a letter that commanded all Sikhs to join him. After two years of gaining supporters, Banda Singh Bahadur initiated an agrarian uprising by breaking up the large estates of [[Zamindar#Mughal Era|Zamindar families]] and distributing the land to the poor Sikh and Hindu peasants who farmed the land.<ref name=\"Singh 2008 pages=25\u201326\">{{harvnb|Singh|2008|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nBanda Singh Bahadur started his rebellion with the defeat of Mughal armies at [[Samana, India|Samana]] and [[Sadhaura]] and it culminated in the defeat of Sirhind. During the rebellion, Banda Singh Bahadur made a point of destroying the cities in which Mughals had been cruel to Sikhs, and executed Wazir Khan in revenge for the deaths of Guru Gobind Singh's sons, Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh, after the Sikh victory at Sirhind.<ref>{{harvnb|Nesbitt |2005 |page=61}}</ref> He ruled the territory between the [[Sutlej|Sutlej River]] and the [[Yamuna|Yamuna River]], established a capital in the [[Himalayas]] at [[Lohgarh]], and struck coinage in the names of [[Guru Nanak]] and Guru Gobind Singh.<ref name=\"Singh 2008 pages=25\u201326\"/>\n\nIn 1762, there were persistent conflicts with the Sikhs.

Forming part of the larger [[Punjab region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the state is bordered by the Indian union territory of [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] to the north, and the Indian states of [[Himachal Pradesh]] to the east, [[Haryana]] to the south and southeast, and [[Rajasthan]] to the southwest. It is bordered by the Pakistani province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] to the west. The state covers an area of 50,362 square kilometres, 1.53% of India's total geographical area. It is [[List of states and union territories of India by area|the 20th-largest Indian state]] by area. With 27,704,236 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Punjab is [[List of states and union territories of India by population|the 16th-largest state by population]], comprising [[List of districts of Punjab, India|22 districts]]. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. The main ethnic group are the [[Punjabis]], with [[Sikhs]] (58%) and [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]] (38%). The state capital is Chandigarh, a [[Union Territory]] and also the capital of the neighbouring state of Haryana. The five tributary rivers of the [[Indus River]] from which the region took its name are [[Sutlej]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Beas River|Beas]], [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Jhelum river|Jhelum]] Rivers; Sutlej, Ravi and Beas are part of the Indian Punjab.\n\nThe [[history of Punjab]] has witnessed the migration and settlement of innumerable races, forming a melting pot of Punjabi civilisation. The first traces of human habitation in India were found in the Punjab region.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W95iulFxS6gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=History and Culture of Panjab|last=Singh|first=Mohinder|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|language=en}}</ref> The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] flourished in antiquity before recorded history until their decline around 1900 BCE. The Punjab has had numerous recorded invasions, starting with the [[List of Rigvedic tribes|Vedic tribes]]. Punjab was enriched during the height of the [[Vedic period]], but declined in predominance with the rise of the [[Mahajanapadas]]. The region formed the frontier of initial empires during antiquity including the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]], [[Alexander's empire|Alexander's]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], and [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] Empires. After the fall of the Maurya Empire, the region was splintered into multiple kingdoms and republics. Punjab was subsequently conquered by the [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], and then [[Harsha Empire|Harsha's Empire]]. Punjab continued to be settled by nomadic people; including the [[Huna people|Huna]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. Circa 1000, the Punjab was ruled by [[Muslims]] and was part of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Mughal Empire]], and [[Durrani Empire]]. [[Sikhism]] originated in Punjab and resulted in the formation of the [[Sikh Confederacy]] after the fall of the Mughal Empire and ensuing conflict with the Durrani Empire. This confederacy was united into the [[Sikh Empire]] by Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]].\n\nGreater Punjab region was annexed by the [[British East India Company]] from the [[Sikh Empire]] in [[Anglo-Sikh Wars|1849]]. In 1947, the Punjab Province of British India was divided along religious lines into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]]. The western part was assimilated into [[Pakistan]] while the east became part of [[India]]. The [[East Punjab|Indian Punjab]] as well as [[PEPSU]] was divided into three parts on the basis of language in 1966. Hindi speaking areas (including various dialects) were carved out as Haryana, while the hilly regions and Pahari-speaking areas formed Himachal Pradesh, alongside the current state of Punjab. Punjab's government has three branches \u2013 executive, [[Judiciary of India|judiciary]] and [[Punjab Legislative Assembly|legislative]]. Punjab follows the parliamentary system of government with the Chief Minister as the head of the state.\n\nThe [[Economy of Punjab, India|economy of Punjab]] is the [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP|14th-largest state economy]] in India with {{INRConvert|5.18|lc}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GDP of {{INRConvert|153|k}}.<ref name=\"MOSPI\"/><ref name=\"esopb\"/> Punjab has the [[List of Indian states and territories by Human Development Index|ninth highest ranking]] among Indian states and union territories in [[human development index]] as of 2018.<ref name=\"snhdi-gdl\" /> Punjab is primarily agriculture-based due to the presence of abundant water sources and fertile soils.<ref>{{cite web|title=Punjab|url=http://m.oifc.in/Our-Partners/State-Partners/Punjab|publisher=Overseas Indian Facilitation Centre|accessdate=8 September 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010150641/http://m.oifc.in/Our-Partners/State-Partners/Punjab|archivedate=10 October 2011}}</ref> Other major industries include the manufacturing of [[scientific instruments]], agricultural goods, electrical goods, [[financial services]], [[machine tools]], [[textiles]], [[sewing machines]], [[sports goods]], [[starch]], [[tourism]], [[fertilisers]], [[bicycles]], [[garments]], and the processing of [[pine oil]] and [[sugar]].

The [[Vedic Civilization]] spread along the length of the [[Sarasvati River]] to cover most of [[Hindustan|northern India]] including Punjab.\n\n===Sikhs in Punjab===\nSikhism originated in the [[Punjab Region]] during the 15th century. Approximately 75% of the total Sikh population of the world lives in Punjab. Sikhism began at the time of the conquest of northern India by [[Babur]]. His grandson, [[Akbar]], supported religious freedom and after visiting the [[langar (Sikhism)|langar]] of [[Guru Amar Das]] had a favourable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and had a positive relationship with the [[Sikh Gurus]] until his death in 1605.<ref>{{harvnb|Kalsi|2005|pages=106\u2013107}}</ref> His successor, [[Jahangir]], saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He arrested [[Guru Arjun Dev]] because of Sikh support for [[Khusrau Mirza]]<ref>{{harvnb|Markovits|2004|page=98}}</ref> and ordered him put to death by torture. Guru Arjan Dev's [[martyrdom]] led to the sixth Guru, [[Guru Hargobind]], declaring Sikh [[sovereignty]] in the creation of the [[Akal Takht]] and the establishment of a fort to defend [[Amritsar]].<ref name=\"Jestice 2004 pages=345\u2013346\">{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=345\u2013346}}</ref>\n\nJahangir attempted to assert authority over the Sikhs by imprisoning Guru Hargobind at [[Gwalior]]. He felt compelled to release him when he began to suffer premonitions of an early and gruesome death. The Guru refused to be released unless the dozens of Hindu princes imprisoned with him were also granted freedom, to which Jahangir agreed. Sikhism did not have any further issues with the [[Mughal Empire]] until Jahangir's death in 1627.
