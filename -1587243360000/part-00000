Her birth name is different from her legal name. It must be in the lead and bolded.--> November 26, 1939) is a singer and actress, originally from the United States and now a Swiss citizen. Turner rose to prominence as part of the [[Ike & Tina Turner|Ike & Tina Turner Revue]] before launching a successful career as a solo performer. One of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling recording artists of all time]], she has been referred to as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll]] and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Turner is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity.\n3 rip \nTurner began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's [[Kings of Rhythm]], recording under the name \"Little Ann\" on \"[[Boxtop (song)|Boxtop]]\". Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began with the hit single \"[[A Fool in Love]]\" (1960), released by the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She married Ike Turner in 1962. Success followed with a string of notable hits, including \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" (1966), the Grammy-winning \"[[Proud Mary]]\" (1971), and \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\" (1973). Raised a [[Baptists|Baptist]], she became an adherent of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] in 1973, crediting the spiritual [[Buddhist chant|chant]] of ''[[Nam(u) My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d|Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]]'' rip with helping her to endure during difficult times. Turner separated from Ike Turner in 1976, ending both their personal relationship and their musical partnership; the couple divorced in 1978. In her autobiography, ''[[I,&nbsp;Tina|I, Tina: My Life Story]]'' (1986), Turner revealed that Ike Turner had subjected her to [[domestic violence]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback as a solo artist. The 1983 single \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\" was followed by the release of her fifth solo album, ''[[Private Dancer]]'' (1984), which became a worldwide success. The album contained the hit song \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\" (1984). Turner won the [[Grammy Award for Record Of The Year]] for the single, and it became her first (and only) No. 1 hit in the United States. Turner's solo success continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s with multi-platinum albums and hit singles. Her U.S. Top 10 hits from this period include \"[[Better Be Good to Me]]\" (1984), \"[[Private Dancer]]\" (1984), \"[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\" (1985), \"[[Typical Male]]\" (1986), and \"[[I Don't Wanna Fight]]\" (1993). In 1993, ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', a [[biographical film]] adapted from Turner's autobiography, was released along with an ripaccompanying [[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|soundtrack album]]. Turner also achieved success as an actress in films such as the 1975 [[rock musical]] ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', the 1985 action film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', and the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.\n\nTurner has won 12 [[Grammy Award]]s; those awards include eight competitive awards, three [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] awards, and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Turner 63rd on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and 17th on its list of the 100 greatest singers of all time. Turner has her own stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]]. She was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] with Ike Turner in 1991 and is a 2005 recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]].

Her birth name is different from her legal name. It must be in the lead and bolded.--> November 26, 1939) is a singer and actress, originally from the United States and now a Swiss citizen. Turner rose to prominence as part of the [[Ike & Tina Turner|Ike & Tina Turner Revue]] before launching a successful career as a solo performer. One of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling recording artists of all time]], she has been referred to as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll]] and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. Turner is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity.\n\nTurner began her career in 1958 as a featured singer with Ike Turner's [[Kings of Rhythm]], recording under the name \"Little Ann\" on \"[[Boxtop (song)|Boxtop]]\". Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began with the hit single \"[[A Fool in Love]]\" (1960), released by the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She married Ike Turner in 1962. Success followed with a string of notable hits, including \"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\" (1966), the Grammy-winning \"[[Proud Mary]]\" (1971), and \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\" (1973). Raised a [[Baptists|Baptist]], she became an adherent of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] in 1973, crediting the spiritual [[Buddhist chant|chant]] of ''[[Nam(u) My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d|Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]]'' with helping her to endure during difficult times. Turner separated from Ike Turner in 1976, ending both their personal relationship and their musical partnership; the couple divorced in 1978. In her autobiography, ''[[I,&nbsp;Tina|I, Tina: My Life Story]]'' (1986), Turner revealed that Ike Turner had subjected her to [[domestic violence]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Turner launched a major comeback as a solo artist. The 1983 single \"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\" was followed by the release of her fifth solo album, ''[[Private Dancer]]'' (1984), which became a worldwide success. The album contained the hit song \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\" (1984). Turner won the [[Grammy Award for Record Of The Year]] for the single, and it became her first (and only) No. 1 hit in the United States. Turner's solo success continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s with multi-platinum albums and hit singles. Her U.S. Top 10 hits from this period include \"[[Better Be Good to Me]]\" (1984), \"[[Private Dancer]]\" (1984), \"[[We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)]]\" (1985), \"[[Typical Male]]\" (1986), and \"[[I Don't Wanna Fight]]\" (1993). In 1993, ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', a [[biographical film]] adapted from Turner's autobiography, was released along with an accompanying [[What's Love Got to Do with It (album)|soundtrack album]]. Turner also achieved success as an actress in films such as the 1975 [[rock musical]] ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'', the 1985 action film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', and the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]''.\n\nTurner has won 12 [[Grammy Award]]s; those awards include eight competitive awards, three [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] awards, and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Turner 63rd on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and 17th on its list of the 100 greatest singers of all time. Turner has her own stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]]. She was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] with Ike Turner in 1991 and is a 2005 recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]].\n\n==Early life==\nTina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939,<ref group=lower-alpha name=Contract>Turner signed her legal name as Martha Nell Turner on a 1977 contract.</ref><ref name=HA>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/music-memorabilia/autographs-and-signed-items/tina-turner-signed-contract-1977-/a/696-52395.s|title=Tina Turner Signed Contract (1977)....

He won the [[Fields Medal]] and was a [[MacArthur Fellow]]. In 2010 he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]]. He is currently a University Professor Emeritus in the Division of Applied Mathematics at [[Brown University]].\n\n==Early life==\nMumford was born in [[Worth, West Sussex]] in [[England]], of an English father and American mother. His father William started an experimental school in [[Tanzania]] and worked for the then newly created [[United Nations]].<ref name=fml>{{cite book|title=Fields Medallists' Lectures, World Scientific Series in 20th Century Mathematics, Vol 5|date=1997|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9810231170|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6eSjV-0egUC&pg=PA225}}</ref>\n\nIn high school, he was a finalist in the prestigious [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]]. After attending the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], Mumford went to Harvard, where he became a student of [[Oscar Zariski]]. At Harvard, he became a [[Putnam Fellow]] in 1955 and 1956. He completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1961, with a thesis entitled ''Existence of the moduli scheme for curves of any genus''.\n\n==Work in algebraic geometry==\nMumford's work in geometry combined traditional geometric insights with the latest algebraic techniques. He published on [[moduli space]]s, with a theory summed up in his book ''[[Geometric Invariant Theory]]'', on the equations defining an [[abelian variety]], and on [[algebraic surface]]s.\n\nHis books ''Abelian Varieties'' (with [[C. P. Ramanujam]]) and ''Curves on an Algebraic Surface'' combined the old and new theories. His lecture notes on [[scheme theory]] circulated for years in unpublished form, at a time when they were, beside the treatise [[\u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique]], the only accessible introduction. They are now available as ''The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes'' ({{isbn|3-540-63293-X}}).\n\nOther work that was less thoroughly written up were lectures on varieties defined by [[quadric]]s, and a study of [[Goro Shimura]]'s papers from the 1960s.\n\nMumford's research did much to revive the classical theory of [[theta function]]s, by showing that its algebraic content was large, and enough to support the main parts of the theory by reference to finite analogues of the [[Heisenberg group]]. This work on the [[equations defining abelian varieties]] appeared in 1966\u20137. He published some further books of lectures on the theory.\n\nHe also was one of the founders of the [[Toric geometry|toroidal embedding]] theory; and sought to apply the theory to [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] techniques, through students who worked in algebraic computation.\n\n==Work on pathologies in algebraic geometry==\nIn a sequence of four papers published in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'' between 1961 and 1975, Mumford explored pathological behavior in [[algebraic geometry]], that is, phenomena that would not arise if the world of algebraic geometry were as well-behaved as one might expect from looking at the simplest examples.  These pathologies fall into two types: (a) bad behavior in characteristic p and (b) bad behavior in moduli spaces.\n\n===Characteristic-''p'' pathologies===\nMumford's philosophy in characteristic ''p'' was as follows:\n\n<blockquote>A nonsingular characteristic ''p'' variety is analogous to a general non-K\u00e4hler complex manifold;  in particular, a projective embedding of such a variety is not as strong as a [[K\u00e4hler metric]] on a complex manifold, and the Hodge\u2013Lefschetz\u2013Dolbeault theorems on [[sheaf cohomology]] break down in every possible way.</blockquote>\n\nIn the first Pathologies paper, Mumford finds an everywhere regular differential form on a smooth projective surface that is not closed, and shows that Hodge symmetry fails for classical [[Enriques surface]]s in characteristic two.  This second example is developed further in Mumford's third paper on classification of surfaces in characteristic ''p'' (written in collaboration with [[E. Bombieri]]).  This pathology can now be explained in terms of the [[Picard scheme]] of the surface, and in particular, its failure to be a [[reduced scheme]], which is a theme developed in Mumford's book \"Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface\".  Worse pathologies related to p-torsion in [[crystalline cohomology]] were explored by [[Luc Illusie]] (Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm. Sup. (4) 12 (1979), 501\u2013661).\n\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford gives a simple example of a surface in characteristic ''p'' where the [[geometric genus]] is non-zero, but the second Betti number is equal to the rank of the [[N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group]]. Further such examples arise in [[Zariski surface]] theory.  He also conjectures that the [[Kodaira vanishing theorem]] is false for surfaces in characteristic ''p''.  In the third paper, he gives an example of a [[Normal variety|normal]] surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails.  The first example of a smooth surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails was given by [[Michel Raynaud]] in 1978.\n\n===Pathologies of moduli spaces===\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford finds that the [[Hilbert scheme]] parametrizing space curves of degree 14 and genus 24 has a multiple component.  In the fourth Pathologies paper, he finds reduced and irreducible complete curves which are not specializations of non-singular curves.\n\nThese sorts of pathologies were considered to be fairly scarce when they first appeared.  But recently, [[Ravi Vakil]] in a paper called \"Murphy's law in algebraic geometry\" has shown that Hilbert schemes of nice geometric objects can be arbitrarily \"bad\", with unlimited numbers of components and with arbitrarily large multiplicities (Invent. Math. 164 (2006), 569\u2013590).\n\n==Classification of surfaces==\n\nIn three papers written between 1969 and 1976 (the last two in collaboration with [[Enrico Bombieri]]), Mumford extended the [[Enriques\u2013Kodaira classification]] of smooth [[projective surface]]s from the case of the complex [[ground field]] to the case of an [[algebraically closed]] ground field of characteristic ''p''.  The final answer turns out to be essentially as the answer in the complex case (though the methods employed are sometimes quite different), once two important adjustments are made.  The first is that one may get \"non-classical\" surfaces, which come about when ''p''-torsion in the [[Picard scheme]] degenerates to a non-reduced group scheme.  The second is the possibility of obtaining [[quasi-elliptic surface]]s in characteristics two and three.  These are surfaces fibred over a curve where the general fibre is a curve of [[arithmetic genus]] one with a cusp.\n\nOnce these adjustments are made, the surfaces are divided into four classes by their [[Kodaira dimension]], as in the complex case.  The four classes are:\na) Kodaira dimension minus infinity.  These are the [[ruled surface]]s.\nb) Kodaira dimension 0.  These are the [[K3 surface]]s, [[abelian surface]]s, hyperelliptic and [[quasi-hyperelliptic surface]]s, and [[Enriques surface]]s.

He won the [[Fields Medal]] and was a [[MacArthur Fellow]]. In 2010 he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]]. He is currently a University Professor Emeritus in the Division of Applied Mathematics at [[Brown University]].\n\n==Early life==\nMumford was born in [[Worth, West Sussex]] in [[England]], of an English father and American mother. His father William started an experimental school in [[Tanzania]] and worked for the then newly created [[United Nations]].<ref name=fml>{{cite book|title=Fields Medallists' Lectures, World Scientific Series in 20th Century Mathematics, Vol 5|date=1997|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9810231170|page=225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6eSjV-0egUC&pg=PA225}}</ref>\n\nIn high school, he was a finalist in the prestigious [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]]. After attending the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], Mumford went to Harvard, where he became a student of [[Oscar Zariski]]. At Harvard, he became a [[Putnam Fellow]] in 1955 and 1956. He completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1961, with a thesis entitled ''Existence of the moduli scheme for curves of any genus''.\n\n==Work in algebraic geometry==\nMumford's work in geometry combined traditional geometric insights with the latest algebraic techniques. He published on [[moduli space]]s, with a theory summed up in his book ''[[Geometric Invariant Theory]]'', on the equations defining an [[abelian variety]], and on [[algebraic surface]]s.\n\nHis books ''Abelian Varieties'' (with [[C. P. Ramanujam]]) and ''Curves on an Algebraic Surface'' combined the old and new theories. His lecture notes on [[scheme theory]] circulated for years in unpublished form, at a time when they were, beside the treatise [[\u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique]], the only accessible introduction. They are now available as ''The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes'' ({{isbn|3-540-63293-X}}).\n\nOther work that was less thoroughly written up were lectures on varieties defined by [[quadric]]s, and a study of [[Goro Shimura]]'s papers from the 1960s.\n\nMumford's research did much to revive the classical theory of [[theta function]]s, by showing that its algebraic content was large, and enough to support the main parts of the theory by reference to finite analogues of the [[Heisenberg group]]. This work on the [[equations defining abelian varieties]] appeared in 1966\u20137. He published some further books of lectures on the theory.\n\nHe also was one of the founders of the [[Toric geometry|toroidal embedding]] theory; and sought to apply the theory to [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] techniques, through students who worked in algebraic computation.\n\n==Work on pathologies in algebraic geometry==\nIn a sequence of four papers published in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'' between 1961 and 1975, Mumford explored pathological behavior in [[algebraic geometry]], that is, phenomena that would not arise if the world of algebraic geometry were as well-behaved as one might expect from looking at the simplest examples.  These pathologies fall into two types: (a) bad behavior in characteristic p and (b) bad behavior in moduli spaces.\n\n===Characteristic-''p'' pathologies===\nMumford's philosophy in characteristic ''p'' was as follows:\n\n<blockquote>A nonsingular characteristic ''p'' variety is analogous to a general non-K\u00e4hler complex manifold;  in particular, a projective embedding of such a variety is not as strong as a [[K\u00e4hler metric]] on a complex manifold, and the Hodge\u2013Lefschetz\u2013Dolbeault theorems on [[sheaf cohomology]] break down in every possible way.</blockquote>\n\nIn the first Pathologies paper, Mumford finds an everywhere regular differential form on a smooth projective surface that is not closed, and shows that Hodge symmetry fails for classical [[Enriques surface]]s in characteristic two.  This second example is developed further in Mumford's third paper on classification of surfaces in characteristic ''p'' (written in collaboration with [[E. Bombieri]]).  This pathology can now be explained in terms of the [[Picard scheme]] of the surface, and in particular, its failure to be a [[reduced scheme]], which is a theme developed in Mumford's book \"Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface\".  Worse pathologies related to p-torsion in [[crystalline cohomology]] were explored by [[Luc Illusie]] (Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm. Sup. (4) 12 (1979), 501\u2013661).\n\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford gives a simple example of a surface in characteristic ''p'' where the [[geometric genus]] is non-zero, but the second Betti number is equal to the rank of the [[N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group]]. Further such examples arise in [[Zariski surface]] theory.  He also conjectures that the [[Kodaira vanishing theorem]] is false for surfaces in characteristic ''p''.  In the third paper, he gives an example of a [[Normal variety|normal]] surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails.  The first example of a smooth surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails was given by [[Michel Raynaud]] in 1978.\n\n===Pathologies of moduli spaces===\nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford finds that the [[Hilbert scheme]] parametrizing space curves of degree 14 and genus 24 has a multiple component.  In the fourth Pathologies paper, he finds reduced and irreducible complete curves which are not specializations of non-singular curves.\n\nThese sorts of pathologies were considered to be fairly scarce when they first appeared.  But recently, [[Ravi Vakil]] in a paper called \"Murphy's law in algebraic geometry\" has shown that Hilbert schemes of nice geometric objects can be arbitrarily \"bad\", with unlimited numbers of components and with arbitrarily large multiplicities (Invent. Math. 164 (2006), 569\u2013590).\n\n==Classification of surfaces==\n\nIn three papers written between 1969 and 1976 (the last two in collaboration with [[Enrico Bombieri]]), Mumford extended the [[Enriques\u2013Kodaira classification]] of smooth [[projective surface]]s from the case of the complex [[ground field]] to the case of an [[algebraically closed]] ground field of characteristic ''p''.  The final answer turns out to be essentially as the answer in the complex case (though the methods employed are sometimes quite different), once two important adjustments are made.  The first is that one may get \"non-classical\" surfaces, which come about when ''p''-torsion in the [[Picard scheme]] degenerates to a non-reduced group scheme.  The second is the possibility of obtaining [[quasi-elliptic surface]]s in characteristics two and three.  These are surfaces fibred over a curve where the general fibre is a curve of [[arithmetic genus]] one with a cusp.\n\nOnce these adjustments are made, the surfaces are divided into four classes by their [[Kodaira dimension]], as in the complex case.  The four classes are:\na) Kodaira dimension minus infinity.  These are the [[ruled surface]]s.\nb) Kodaira dimension 0.  These are the [[K3 surface]]s, [[abelian surface]]s, hyperelliptic and [[quasi-hyperelliptic surface]]s, and [[Enriques surface]]s.  There are classical and non-classical examples in the last two Kodaira dimension zero cases.\nc) Kodaira dimension 1. These are the elliptic and [[quasi-elliptic surface]]s not contained in the last two groups.\nd) Kodaira dimension 2. These are the [[surfaces of general type]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n[[File:Mumford2.jpg|thumb|220px|David Mumford in 1975]]\nMumford was awarded a [[Fields medal|Fields Medal]] in 1974.

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]].

The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

The resulting 44 letterbooks contain copies of all documents dating from May, 1775 to June, 1785. Categories of papers, records, and correspondence are organized as follows;\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n|''Continental Congress''\n|''Continental and State Military Personnel''\n|''Civil Officials and Private Citizens''\n|''Foreign Officers and Subjects of Foreign Nations''\n|''Enemy Officers and British Subjects''\n|''Continental Army Council Proceedings (War Council Proceedings)''\n|''General Orders''\n|''Personal Correspondence''\n}}\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\n{{Main|Society of the Cincinnati}}\n{{see also|List of original members of the Society of the Cincinnati}}\nIn 1783 the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] was founded of which Varick was an original member and president of the New York chapter from 1783 until his death in 1831. Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Pre-Mayor===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]]]] In 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River. The property was landscaped with lawns and gardens to the waterfront. Varick would become the figurehead of the continuing development of Jersey City, inviting luminary friends such as  Major General [[Marquis de Lafayette]] to visit while touring America in 1824 for special Fourth of July celebrations.

Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

The resulting 44 letterbooks contain copies of all documents dating from May, 1775 to June, 1785. Categories of papers, records, and correspondence are organized as follows;\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n|''Continental Congress''\n|''Continental and State Military Personnel''\n|''Civil Officials and Private Citizens''\n|''Foreign Officers and Subjects of Foreign Nations''\n|''Enemy Officers and British Subjects''\n|''Continental Army Council Proceedings (War Council Proceedings)''\n|''General Orders''\n|''Personal Correspondence''\n}}\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\n{{Main|Society of the Cincinnati}}\n{{see also|List of original members of the Society of the Cincinnati}}\nIn 1783 the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] was founded of which Varick was an original member and president of the New York chapter from 1783 until his death in 1831. Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Pre-Mayor===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River. The property was landscaped with lawns and gardens to the waterfront. Varick would become the figurehead of the continuing development of Jersey City, inviting luminary friends such as  Major General [[Marquis de Lafayette]] to visit while touring America in 1824 for special Fourth of July celebrations.
