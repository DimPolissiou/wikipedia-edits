She has not met the man prior to the wedding. Howvever, on the wedding night, Kajal discovers that the man is actually a mentally challenged person who has the mind of an eight year old. She realises that she has been tricked into marrying him by her in-laws. This makes her furious. Kajal wants to tell her mother, but she cannot because her mother is a heart patient. Kajal is unwilling to accept this marriage and blames her in-laws for ruining her life. Neeraj is innocent and childlike. Kajal finds it hard to tolerate his behaviour, because of which their relationship has quite a turbulent start. After spending some time together, however, Kajal and Neeraj become close. Kajal's mother finds out about the situation and forces Kajal to come back home. Neeraj panics since he can't stay without Kajal, who also doesn't want to leave him. Kajal's mother files a case against Neeraj's family. But, Kajal refuses to leave Neeraj. This strengthens their bond. Kajal comes back and starts her mission to cure Neeraj. She consults a specialist doctor who assists her in treating Neeraj. Gradually, Kajal becomes suspicious that someone in the family doesn't want Neeraj to get cured, but she isn't sure who the person is since everyone seems to love Neeraj a lot. Neeraj's doctor advises Kajal to take Neeraj to a medical camp which could help cure him. Kajal and Neeraj go, although Neeraj's father opposes the idea. When they come back, everyone is surprised at how much Neeraj has improved. All is going well, until on Neeraj's birthday, someone attacks him and he gets hurt on his head. This causes him to regress back into his earlier condition. Kajal is shattered, yet, she refuses to give up hope. She takes Neeraj to the United States for treatment. When they return, Neeraj is fully recovered. He is able to attend office, make his own decisions and understand everything. Kajal and Neeraj are able to live their marital life properly, and express their love to each other. Kajal becomes pregnant, because of which everyone is overjoyed. However, some misunderstandings occur between Kajal and Neeraj, which leads to them having an argument. Kajal has an accident and loses her child. She also loses her memory partially. Soon, it is revealed that Kajal was only pretending to have lost her memory to protect herself from the person who was responsible for Neeraj's condition. That person is Neeraj's mother, who is actually his stepmother. She was the person who killed Neeraj's grandfather, and made him mentally unstable. The reason behind all of this was the fact that Neeraj is the heir to all of his grandfather's property, which his stepmother wanted for herself and her real children. Neeraj's stepmother dies as a result of poisoning, and so does his father. A few years later, Kajal and Neeraj are shown talking to each other about their lives. Neeraj thanks Kajal for supporting him and never giving up on him. They also have a daughter, who they named Asha. The show concludes on a happy note that everything is fine now, all because of Kajal's efforts (koshish).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandhya Mridul]] as Kaajal\n* [[Varun Badola]] as Neeraj\n* [[Jaya Bhattacharya]] as Suniti\n* [[Anupam Bhattacharya]] as Sudhir\n* [[Savita Prabhune]] as Rekha\n* [[Prachi Shah]] as Bhavana\n* [[Shubhangi Gokhale]] as Kaajal's mother\n* Rajesh Tandon as Ishaan\n* [[Uday Tikekar]] as Niraj's father\n* [[Shital Thakkar]] as Kaajal's sister\n* [[Aditi Pratap]] as Niraj's sister\n* [[Shweta Kawatra]]\n* Sai Ballal\n* Mirza Zohaib Alam\n* [[Suchita Trivedi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[http://www.rajshri.com/zee/koshish/index.asp?Page=12 Watch online]\n\n{{Zee TV Programmes}}\n{{Balaji Telefilms}}\n\n[[Category:Balaji Telefilms television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Zee TV television series]]\n[[Category:2000 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2002 Indian television series endings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Koshish - Ek Aashaa\n| image                = Koshish (TV series).jpg\n| picture_format       = [[480i]] \n| runtime              = approx. 22 minutes\n| creator              = [[Balaji Telefilms]]<br />[[Endemol India]]\n| writer               = '''Story & Screenplay'''<br />R M Joshi, Vipul Mehta, Bhavin Patel & Mahesh Pandey<br />'''Dialogues'''<br />Sunjoy Shekhar \n| director             = [[Anurag Basu]]<br/>Hemant Prabhu\n| editor               = Dharmesh Shah, Vinay Malu, Sandeep Dharne\n| cinematography       = Sanjay Memane\n| producer             = [[Ekta Kapoor]]<br/>[[Shobha Kapoor]]\n| starring             = Sandhya Mridul, Varun Badola\n| opentheme            = \"Woh Aashaa Hai\"\n| composer          = Lalit Sen\n| country              = India\n| network              = [[Zee TV]]\n| first_aired          = February 2000\n| last_aired           = April 2002\n| num_episodes         = 117\n}}\n\n'''''Koshish - Ek Aashaa''''' is an [[India]]n [[soap opera]] that aired on [[Zee TV]] from 2000-2002.

Gameplay largely involves exploring a vast underground mine, coming up against enemy creatures while finding various resources as the player digs their way downwards. As the game progresses, Dorothy can gain abilities and weapons such as pressure bombs, a hookshot, and a pneumatic arm that can punch through rock. Any resources found can be traded in for cash in the game's hub world, where the player can upgrade their health, weapons, and abilities. Each of the weapons have perks that can be activated by installing Upgrade Cogs found in secret areas. More blueprints for upgrades become available to the player by either increasing their level by killing enemies or completing quests, or by finding artifacts hidden in the mines. \n\n==Plot==\nThe story takes place in between the events of ''[[SteamWorld Dig]]'' and ''[[SteamWorld Heist]]''.<ref>https://www.destructoid.com/steamworld-dig-2-will-take-place-between-the-first-game-and-steamworld-heist-457454.phtml</ref> Following Rusty's disappearance at the end of ''SteamWorld Dig'', Dorothy, a robot who he had befriended, travels to the mining town of El Machino in order to search for him. Along the way, she comes across Fen, a remnant of the Vectron that Rusty had previously fought, who joins Dorothy as a navigator. While searching the mines for Rusty while also hearing rumors of him turning into a monstrous machine, Dorothy comes across a group of humans led by Rosie, who claims that mysterious machines are triggering earthquakes. Dorothy goes to destroy these machines, only to discover that Rosie had lied to her. In actuality, the machines were built by Rusty to prevent Rosie from harnessing a powerful energy source to get rid of all robots.

Gameplay largely involves exploring a vast underground mine, coming up against enemy creatures while finding various resources as the player digs their way downwards. As the game progresses, Dorothy can gain abilities and weapons such as pressure bombs, a hookshot, and a pneumatic arm that can punch through rock. Any resources found can be traded in for cash in the game's hub world, where the player can upgrade their health, weapons, and abilities. Each of the weapons have perks that can be activated by installing Upgrade Cogs found in secret areas. More blueprints for upgrades become available to the player by either increasing their level by killing enemies or completing quests, or by finding artifacts hidden in the mines. \n\n==Plot==\nThe story takes place in between the events of ''[[SteamWorld Dig]]'' and ''[[SteamWorld Heist]]''.<ref>https://www.destructoid.com/steamworld-dig-2-will-take-place-between-the-first-game-and-steamworld-heist-457454.phtml</ref> Following Rusty's disappearance at the end of ''SteamWorld Dig'', Dorothy, a robot who he had befriended, travels to the mining town of El Machino in order to search for him. Along the way, she comes across Fen, a remnant of the Vectron that Rusty had previously fought, who joins Dorothy as a navigator. While searching the mines for Rusty while also hearing rumors of him turning into a monstrous machine, Dorothy comes across a group of humans led by Rosie, who claims that mysterious machines are triggering earthquakes. Dorothy goes to destroy these machines, only to discover that Rosie had lied to her. In actuality, the machines were built by Rusty to prevent Rosie from harnessing a powerful energy source to get rid of all robots. Dorothy manages to defeat Rosie and rescue Rusty, only for the energy source to become unstable, prompting Fen to stay behind while she warps the two to safety, allowing them to escape on a rocket with the other El Machino residents before the planet explodes. As the robots explore space in order to set up a new civilization, Dorothy remains hopeful that she will one day be reunited with Fen.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = NS: 88/100<ref name=\"MCNS\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/steamworld-dig-2 |title=SteamWorld Dig 2 for Switch Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}</ref><br />PC: 85/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/steamworld-dig-2 |title=SteamWorld Dig 2 for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}</ref><br />PS4: 85/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/steamworld-dig-2 |title=SteamWorld Dig 2 for PlayStation 4 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game released to positive reviews, with a score of 88 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCNS\" /> Critics praised its improvements upon the original, as well as its world and gameplay.\n\nThe game was nominated for \"Best Portable Game\" in ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'s}} Game of the Year Awards 2017,<ref>{{cite web |last=Moyse |first=Chris |title=Nominees for Destructoid's Best Portable Game of 2017 |url=https://www.destructoid.com/nominees-for-destructoid-s-best-portable-game-of-2017-476453.phtml |work=[[Destructoid]] |date=December 13, 2017 |accessdate=February 17, 2018}}</ref> for \"Best Switch Game\" and \"Best Action-Adventure Game\" in [[IGN]]'s Best of 2017 Awards,<ref>{{cite web |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best Switch Game |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_Switch_Game |work=[[IGN]] |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best Action-Adventure Game |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_Action-Adventure_Game |work=IGN |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref> for \"Game Engineering\" at the 17th Annual [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers]] Awards,<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominee List for 2017 |url=http://navgtr.org/archives/3351/ |work=[[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers]] |date=February 9, 2018 |accessdate=February 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://navgtr.org/archives/3365/ |title=Horizon wins 7; Mario GOTY |work=National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers |date=March 13, 2018 |accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref> and for \"Best Indie Game\" at the 2018 [[Golden Joystick Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Hoggins |first=Tom |title=Golden Joysticks 2018 nominees announced, voting open now |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/golden-joysticks-2018-nominees-announced-voting-open-now/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=September 24, 2018 |accessdate=October 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Sheridan |first=Connor |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/golden-joystick-awards-2018-winners/ |title=Golden Joystick Awards 2018 winners: God of War wins big but Fortnite gets Victory Royale |work=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=November 16, 2018 |accessdate=November 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://imageform.se/game/steamworld-dig-2/ Official website]\n\n{{SteamWorld}}\n\n[[Category:2017 video games]]\n[[Category:Action-adventure games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Metroidvania games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch games]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Vita games]]\n[[Category:Video games about robots]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Steampunk video games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female protagonists]]\n[[Category:SteamWorld]]\n", "name_user": "Atul Kedia", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected Stadia date", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteamWorld_Dig_2"}
