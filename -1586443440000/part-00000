Formerly an independent municipality, Sonnenberg was incorporated into Wiesbaden on 28 October 1926. The borough has approximately 8,000 residents.\n\nSonnenberg is located in the northeast of the city.  Its historic center is located in the foothills of the [[Taunus]] in the narrow valley of Rambach.\n\n''Burg Sonnenberg'' (Sonnenberg Castle) is situated on a mountain spur above the town. While the castle is now in ruins, the castle tower and parts of the fortifications and the city walls are preserved to a large extent.\n\n==History of Sonnenberg Castle==\n[[Image:Wiesbaden burg sonnenberg 1.jpg|thumb|left|Sonnenberg Castle|290px]]Sonnenberg Castle was built around 1201-1203 by the brothers [[Henry II of Nassau|Henry II]] (German: ''Heinrich'') and [[Robert IV of Nassau|Robert IV]] (German: ''Ruprecht''), Counts of the [[House of Nassau]], for the protection of Wiesbaden against the neighboring [[Lords of Eppstein]], with whom a permanent border dispute existed. [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich I]] had awarded the Royal City of Wiesbaden to the House of Nassau in 1154 as a reward for their support. Wiesbaden had been a royal city since the reign of [[Charlemagne]], first mentioned in 829 as an administrative headquarters of a [[K\u00f6nigssondergau]] (Imperial special district). However, the court system for the region came under the dominion of Eppstein. This complicated arrangement, where both houses claimed jurisdiction, gave rise to constant strife between them.\n\nThe first written mention of Sonnenberg dates from 1208 or 1209 in the name of the first ''[[Burgmann]]'' (\"castellan\") Ulbert of Idstein-Sonnenberg as ''Sonnenburch'' and ''Sunnenberc''. It was first called ''Sonnenberc'' in 1221.  Ownership of the land was initially disputed by the Saint Martin's [[Domstift]] (cathedral endowment) of [[Mainz]].  This dependence to Mainz had been generally unfavorable to Sonnenberg a long time, because four [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishops of Mainz]] in the 13th century alone were from Eppstein, the enemies of Nassau. The dispute over Sonnenberg was settled by a treaty in 1221, in which Nassau obtained the land on which the castle is built as a fief for 30 Marks.<ref>[http://www.wiesbaden.de/leben_wi/stadtteile/sonnenberg/geschichte.php History of Sonnenberg] (in German)</ref> Sonnenberg Castle was one of nine castles ruled by the House of Nassau.\n\nIn 1240, Henry II became the sole ruler of the Nassau possessions. After his death, the inheritance was divided among Henry's sons, [[Walram II of Nassau|Walram]] and [[Otto I of Nassau|Otto]]. Sonnenberg became the possession of Walram's [[House of Nassau-Weilburg|Countship of Nassau-Weilburg]].\n\nIn 1283, Walram's son Count [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf of Nassau]] rebuilt the castle (it had been heavily damaged in conflict with Eppstein). The castle was Adolf's seat when he was crowned [[King of the Romans]] on 5 May 1292. After Adolf's death in 1298, Eppstein, with the help of Archbishop of Mainz, Gerhard II, again occupied and destroyed the castle. Adolf's son, Gerlach I, still a child, was saved.\n\n[[Image:Tombleson Sonnenberg.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of Sonnenberg, steel engraving from \"Views of the Rhine\" by [[William Tombleson]] (c. 1840)|285px]]Later, under Gerlach's rule, peace was reached between Nassau and Eppstein and the Castle of Sonnenberg was expanded. In 1338, Emperor [[Ludwig the Bavarian]] visited the castle, a testimony to its size and security in those years. On 29 July 1351 the King of [[Bohemia]], and later [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] awarded the town of Sonnenberg rights to its own jurisdiction.  As a result, houses at the foot of the castle could now be surrounded by a wall in an overall integrated complex, providing the residents some security.\n\nWhen Count Gerlach died in 1361, his son Ruprecht (from his second marriage), since 1355 Count of the newly established dominion of Nassau-Sonnenberg, inherited the castle. When Ruprecht died childless in 1390, his wife Anna continued to live there. After her death in 1405, the castle returned to the joint rule of the Counts of Nassau-Idstein and Nassau-Weilburg and  deteriorated over the next 200 years. However, under Count Philipp von Nassau-Idstein (1558 to 1566), the castle again became a residence. He, too, died childless and the end of the 16th century the castle was uninhabited.\n\nSonnenberg experienced major damage in 1625 during the [[Thirty Years' War]], so that only a dozen houses were habitable. The castle served as a quarry for the reconstruction of the houses in the valley. In 1672, the city was again devastated by troops of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].\n\n==Thalkirche==\n[[Image:Thalkirche Sonnenberg.jpg|thumb|right|Sonnenberg Thalkirche|290px]]The ''Thalkirche'' (Valley Church) of Sonnenberg dates to 1429, when Werner Hut, Lord of the Castle, endowed the chapel of Saint Mary in the Valley.  In 1529, Johann von Nassau-[[Sporkenburg]], heir to the Hut family, opened the former private chapel to the residents of Sonnenberg.  The church was expanded in 1535 and became Protestant in 1540.\n\nDue to damage incurred during the Thirty Years' War in 1625, the church was unusable. Services were held in the Holy Cross Chapel in the Sonnenberg Cemetery for decades afterward. The church was looted by the soldiers of Brandenburg in 1672.\n\nA gallery was added in 1733.  In 1883, there was a thorough renovation of the church.

The first is an attempt to develop a model of crowd action that accounts for both social determination and social change.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The second concerns the construction of social categories through language and action. The third concerns political rhetoric and mass mobilisation \u2013 especially around the issue of national identity.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} His research has been funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC).<ref name=stand/> His former doctoral students include [[Fabio Sani]].<ref name=fabio/>\n\n===Crowd psychology theory===\nReicher's work on [[crowd psychology]] has been path-breaking.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He challenged the dominant notion of crowd as site of [[irrationality]] and [[deindividuation]]. His social identity model (SIM, 1982, 1984, 1987) of crowd behaviour suggests that people are able to act as one in crowd events not because of 'contagion' or [[social facilitation]] but because they share a common social identity. This common identity specifies what counts as normative conduct.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Unlike the 'classic' theories, which tended to presume that collectivity was associated with uncontrolled violence (due to a regression to instinctive drives or a pre-existing 'racial unconscious'), the social identity model explicitly acknowledges variety by suggesting that different identities have different norms \u2013 some peaceful, some conflictual \u2013 and that, even where crowds are conflictual, the targets will be only those specified by the social identity of the crowd.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===The St Pauls' Study===\nReicher's (1984) St Pauls' study was a powerful riposte to the whole 'irrationalist' tradition, from [[Gustav Le Bon]] to deindividuation. But the study and the social identity model left a number of unanswered questions and hence possible explanatory problems.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The emphasis on social identity as the determinant of collective behaviour potentially led to a rather unidimensional reading of the nature of crowd conflict: conflict was 'read off' from the St Pauls' social identity, as if the participants were already 'violent'; yet this left unexplained how such conflict emerged and escalated over time during the riot.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} An unanswered question was therefore how an otherwise peaceful crowd might become conflictual.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Without further specification, the model risked being read, like Allport's account,{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} as seeing conflict as a product of fixed and pre-given identities that were simply acted out. How could behavioural change in the crowd be grasped without falling back into something like the LeBonian account in which the peaceful, rational individual is simply subsumed by the (malign) influence of the crowd?{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe analysis of the St Pauls' riot was like a snap-shot, examining the nature of the crowd targets, without examining in detail how conflict actually emerged from relations with the police, and without including the perspective of the police as a possible contribution to the events.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Subsequent studies of crowd events by Reicher, Clifford Stott and [[John Drury (social psychologist)|John Drury]] therefore began to address these absences.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In each of a number of different type of crowd events, a similar pattern of interaction between crowd and police was identified. The observation of this pattern of interaction across these collaborative studies led to the elaborated social identity model (ESIM) of crowd conflict, which focuses on the emergence and development of crowd conflict.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nMoreover, the ESIM provides the conceptual resources for understanding the possible articulation between social and psychological change. Thus the ESIM suggests that identity change is a function of changed context, brought about through the [[unintended consequences]] of one's own actions.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The consequences are often unintended and unanticipated because crowd members' actions may be interpreted in contrasting ways by outgroups such as the police.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The wider significance of such change is in terms of future action. A limited 'local' protest becomes understood as part of a wider struggle against national or even global 'injustice' where participants are cast as part of a wider oppositional group, where such opposition becomes legitimised by illegitimate outgroup (police, state) action and where there is a perception of wider support and that the collective is indeed capable of translating its ideas into reality.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Particular experiences in collective action can therefore be significant in their role of encouraging people to get involved in further actions, which might themselves be forces for social change. Put simply, crowd conflict is argued to be meaningful, but can be a locus of social and psychological change because that meaning may be contested.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===BBC Prison study===\nReicher collaborated with [[Alex Haslam]] of the [[University of Exeter]] on the [[BBC]] television programme ''[[The Experiment]]'',<ref name=thexp/> which examined conflict, order, rebellion and tyranny in the behaviour of a group of individuals held in a simulated prison environment. The experiment (which became known as the BBC Prison Study) re-examined issues raised by the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]] (SPE) and led to a number of publications in leading psychology journals. Amongst other things, these challenged the role account of tyranny associated with the SPE as well as broader ideas surrounding the [[Banality of evil]], and advanced a social identity-based understanding of the dynamics of resistance.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Publications===\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*Turner, J.

A water tower also serves as a reservoir to help with water needs during peak usage times. The water level in the tower typically falls during the peak usage hours of the day, and then a pump fills it back up during the night. This process also keeps the water from freezing in cold weather, since the tower is constantly being drained and refilled.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== History ==\n\n{{see also|History of water supply and sanitation}}\n[[File:Beaumont Kansas Water Tower.jpg|thumb|[[Beaumont St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad Water Tank]] (1875, restored 2012), [[Beaumont, Kansas]], US]]\nAlthough the use of elevated water storage tanks has existed since ancient times in various forms, the modern use of water towers for pressurized public water systems developed during the mid-19th century, as steam-pumping became more common, and better [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] that could handle higher pressures were developed. In the United Kingdom, standpipes consisted of tall, exposed, n-shaped pipes, used for pressure relief and to provide a fixed elevation for steam-driven pumping engines which tended to produce a pulsing flow, while the pressurized water distribution system required constant pressure. Standpipes also provided a convenient fixed location to measure flow rates. Designers typically enclosed the riser pipes in decorative masonry or wooden structures. By the late 19th-Century, standpipes grew to include storage tanks to meet the ever-increasing demands of growing cities.<ref name=\"mwra.com\"/>\n\nMany early water towers are now considered historically significant and have been included in various [[List of heritage registers|heritage listings]] around the world.

In [[California]] and some other states, domestic water towers enclosed by siding ([[tankhouse]]s) were once built (1850s\u20131930s) to supply individual homes; [[Wind mill|windmills]] pumped water from hand-dug wells up into the tank in New York.\n\nWater towers were used to supply [[water stop]]s for [[steam locomotives]] on railroad lines.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Early steam locomotives required water stops every {{convert|7|to|10|mi}}.\n\n== Design and construction ==\n[[File:Shooters Hill.JPG|thumb|[[Shooter's Hill]] water tower is a local landmark in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. Water towers are common around London suburbs.]]\nA variety of materials can be used to construct a typical water tower; steel and [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] or [[prestressed concrete]] are most often used (with wood, [[fiberglass]], or brick also in use), incorporating an interior coating to protect the water from any effects from the lining material. The reservoir in the tower may be [[sphere|spherical]], [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], or an [[ellipsoid]], with a minimum height of approximately {{convert|6|m|ft}} and a minimum of {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} A standard water tower typically has a height of approximately {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. <!-- and has an average of 2 million gallons. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The largest wt in the world holds 1.2 million gallons, how can the average be 2 million??? -->\n\n[[File:Ross Barnett Reservoir water tower.jpg|thumb|Ross Barnett Reservoir water tower in Mississippi]]\nPressurization occurs through the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the elevation of water; for every {{convert|10.20|cm|in|3}} of elevation, it produces {{convert|1|kPa|psi|3|lk=on}} of pressure. {{convert|30|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} of elevation produces roughly {{convert|300|kPa|psi|3|abbr=on}}, which is enough pressure to operate and provide for most domestic water pressure and distribution system requirements.\n\nThe height of the tower provides the pressure for the water supply system, and it may be supplemented with a [[pump]]. The volume of the [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] and [[diameter]] of the piping provide and sustain flow rate. However, relying on a pump to provide pressure is expensive; to keep up with varying demand, the pump would have to be sized to meet peak demands. During periods of low demand, [[jockey pump]]s are used to meet these lower water flow requirements. The water tower reduces the need for electrical consumption of cycling pumps and thus the need for an expensive pump control system, as this system would have to be sized sufficiently to give the same pressure at high flow rates.\n\nVery high volumes and flow rates are needed when fighting fires. With a water tower present, pumps can be sized for average demand, not peak demand; the water tower can provide water pressure during the day and pumps will refill the water tower when demands are lower.\n\nUsing [[wireless sensor networks]] to monitor water levels inside the tower allows municipalities to automatically monitor and control pumps without installing and maintaining expensive data cables.<ref name=\"Banner\" >\n{{citation\n | url = http://www.bannerengineering.com/en-US/wireless/surecross_web_appnotes\n | title = Application Notes\n | date = November 2009\n | last = Banner Engineering\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\nWater towers can be surrounded by ornate coverings including fancy [[brickwork]], a large [[ivy]]-covered [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] or they can be simply painted. Some city water towers have the name of the city painted in large letters on the roof, as a [[navigation]]al aid to [[aviator]]s and [[motorists]]. Sometimes the decoration can be humorous. An example of this are water towers built side by side, labeled ''HOT'' and ''COLD''. Cities in the United States possessing side-by-side water towers labeled HOT and COLD include [[Granger, Iowa]]; [[Canton, Kansas]]; [[Pratt, Kansas]], and [[St. Clair, Missouri]]; [[Eveleth, Minnesota]] at one time had two such towers, but no longer does.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiobarns.com/othersites/watertowers/mn/23-69hotcold.html |title=Hot and Cold Water Tower |publisher=Ohiobarns.com |date= |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> When a third water tower was built next to the [[Okemah, Oklahoma]] set of Hot and Cold towers, the town briefly considered naming it \"Running\", but eventually decided to use \"Home of [[Woody Guthrie]]\". The [[House in the Clouds]] in [[Thorpeness]], located in the English county of [[Suffolk]], was built to resemble a house in order to disguise the eyesore, whilst the lower floors were used for accommodation.

On many large commercial buildings, water towers are completely hidden behind an extension of the facade of the building. For cosmetic reasons, apartment buildings often enclose their tanks in rooftop structures, either simple unadorned rooftop boxes, or ornately decorated structures intended to enhance the visual appeal of the building. Many buildings, however, leave their water towers in plain view atop utilitarian framework structures.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nWater towers are common in [[India]], where the electricity supply is erratic in most places.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIf the pumps fail (such as during a power outage), then water pressure will be lost, causing potential public health concerns.

A water tower also serves as a reservoir to help with water needs during peak usage times. The water level in the tower typically falls during the peak usage hours of the day, and then a pump fills it back up during the night. This process also keeps the water from freezing in cold weather, since the tower is constantly being drained and refilled.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== History ==\n\n{{see also|History of water supply and sanitation}}\n[[File:Beaumont Kansas Water Tower.jpg|thumb|[[Beaumont St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad Water Tank]] (1875, restored 2012), [[Beaumont, Kansas]], US]]\nAlthough the use of elevated water storage tanks has existed since ancient times in various forms, the modern use of water towers for pressurized public water systems developed during the mid-19th century, as steam-pumping became more common, and better [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] that could handle higher pressures were developed. In the United Kingdom, standpipes consisted of tall, exposed, n-shaped pipes, used for pressure relief and to provide a fixed elevation for steam-driven pumping engines which tended to produce a pulsing flow, while the pressurized water distribution system required constant pressure. Standpipes also provided a convenient fixed location to measure flow rates. Designers typically enclosed the riser pipes in decorative masonry or wooden structures. By the late 19th-Century, standpipes grew to include storage tanks to meet the ever-increasing demands of growing cities.<ref name=\"mwra.com\"/>\n\nMany early water towers are now considered historically significant and have been included in various [[List of heritage registers|heritage listings]] around the world.

Water towers are common around London suburbs.]]\nA variety of materials can be used to construct a typical water tower; steel and [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] or [[prestressed concrete]] are most often used (with wood, [[fiberglass]], or brick also in use), incorporating an interior coating to protect the water from any effects from the lining material. The reservoir in the tower may be [[sphere|spherical]], [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], or an [[ellipsoid]], with a minimum height of approximately {{convert|6|m|ft}} and a minimum of {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} A standard water tower typically has a height of approximately {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. <!-- and has an average of 2 million gallons. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The largest wt in the world holds 1.2 million gallons, how can the average be 2 million??? -->\n\n[[File:Ross Barnett Reservoir water tower.jpg|thumb|Ross Barnett Reservoir water tower in Mississippi]]\nPressurization occurs through the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the elevation of water; for every {{convert|10.20|cm|in|3}} of elevation, it produces {{convert|1|kPa|psi|3|lk=on}} of pressure. {{convert|30|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} of elevation produces roughly {{convert|300|kPa|psi|3|abbr=on}}, which is enough pressure to operate and provide for most domestic water pressure and distribution system requirements.\n\nThe height of the tower provides the pressure for the water supply system, and it may be supplemented with a [[pump]]. The volume of the [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] and [[diameter]] of the piping provide and sustain flow rate. However, relying on a pump to provide pressure is expensive; to keep up with varying demand, the pump would have to be sized to meet peak demands. During periods of low demand, [[jockey pump]]s are used to meet these lower water flow requirements. The water tower reduces the need for electrical consumption of cycling pumps and thus the need for an expensive pump control system, as this system would have to be sized sufficiently to give the same pressure at high flow rates.\n\nVery high volumes and flow rates are needed when fighting fires. With a water tower present, pumps can be sized for average demand, not peak demand; the water tower can provide water pressure during the day and pumps will refill the water tower when demands are lower.\n\nUsing [[wireless sensor networks]] to monitor water levels inside the tower allows municipalities to automatically monitor and control pumps without installing and maintaining expensive data cables.<ref name=\"Banner\" >\n{{citation\n | url = http://www.bannerengineering.com/en-US/wireless/surecross_web_appnotes\n | title = Application Notes\n | date = November 2009\n | last = Banner Engineering\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\nWater towers can be surrounded by ornate coverings including fancy [[brickwork]], a large [[ivy]]-covered [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] or they can be simply painted. Some city water towers have the name of the city painted in large letters on the roof, as a [[navigation]]al aid to [[aviator]]s and [[motorists]]. Sometimes the decoration can be humorous. An example of this are water towers built side by side, labeled ''HOT'' and ''COLD''. Cities in the United States possessing side-by-side water towers labeled HOT and COLD include [[Granger, Iowa]]; [[Canton, Kansas]]; [[Pratt, Kansas]], and [[St. Clair, Missouri]]; [[Eveleth, Minnesota]] at one time had two such towers, but no longer does.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiobarns.com/othersites/watertowers/mn/23-69hotcold.html |title=Hot and Cold Water Tower |publisher=Ohiobarns.com |date= |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> When a third water tower was built next to the [[Okemah, Oklahoma]] set of Hot and Cold towers, the town briefly considered naming it \"Running\", but eventually decided to use \"Home of [[Woody Guthrie]]\".

From left to right, a fully enclosed and ornately decorated brick structure, a simple unadorned roofless brick structure hiding most of the tank but revealing the top of the tank, and a simple utilitarian structure that makes no effort to hide the tanks or otherwise incorporate them into the design of the building.]]\nThe technology dates to at least the 19th century, and for a long time New York City required that all buildings higher than six stories be equipped with a rooftop water tower.<ref name=\"npr2006\" /> Two companies in New York build water towers, both of which are [[family business]]es in operation since the 19th century.<ref name=\"npr2006\">{{cite news|title=Wondering About Water Towers |first=Debbie |last=Elliott |work=[[All Things Considered]] |date=2 December 2006 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6567297}}</ref>\n\nThe original water tower builders were barrel makers who expanded their craft to meet a modern need as buildings in the city grew taller in height. Even today, no sealant is used to hold the water in. The wooden walls of the water tower are held together with steel cables or straps, but water leaks through the gaps when first filled. As the water saturates the wood, it swells, the gaps close and become impermeable.<ref name=\"Times article\">{{cite news|title=Longtime Emblems of City Roofs, Still Going Strong|author=Charles, Jacoba|work=The New York Times|date=3 June 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/nyregion/thecity/03wate.html?_r=1&ref=thecity&oref=login}}</ref>{{stack|[[File:Roihuvuori water tower - Helsinki Finland.jpg|thumb|The mushroom-shaped concrete water tower of [[Roihuvuori]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland was built in the 1970s.

The upper portion of water is skimmed off the top for everyday use while the water in the bottom of the tower is held in reserve to fight fire. When the water drops below a certain level, a pressure switch, level switch or float valve will activate a pump or open a public water line to refill the water tower.<ref name=\"Times article\" />\n\nArchitects and builders have taken varied approaches to incorporating water towers into the design of their buildings. On many large commercial buildings, water towers are completely hidden behind an extension of the facade of the building. For cosmetic reasons, apartment buildings often enclose their tanks in rooftop structures, either simple unadorned rooftop boxes, or ornately decorated structures intended to enhance the visual appeal of the building. Many buildings, however, leave their water towers in plain view atop utilitarian framework structures.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nWater towers are common in [[India]], where the electricity supply is erratic in most places.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIf the pumps fail (such as during a power outage), then water pressure will be lost, causing potential public health concerns. Many U.S. states require a \"[[boil-water advisory]]\" to be issued if water pressure drops below {{convert|20|psi}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This advisory presumes that the lower pressure might allow pathogens to enter the system.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nWater towers are often regarded as monuments of [[civil engineering]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Some have been converted to serve modern purposes, as for example, the Wie\u017ca Ci\u015bnie\u0144 ([[Wroc\u0142aw water tower]]) in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland which is today a restaurant complex. Others have been converted to residential use.<ref name=\"residential use\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/greathomesanddestinations/a-water-tower-near-brussels.html|title=A Water Tower Near Brussels|first=Nick|last=Amies|date=10 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, railroads that used [[steam locomotive]]s required a means of replenishing the locomotive's tenders. Water towers were common along the railroad. The tenders were usually replenished by [[water crane]]s, which were fed by a water tower.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nSome water towers are also used as observation towers, and some restaurants, such as the [[Goldbergturm]] in [[Sindelfingen]], Germany, or the second of the three [[Kuwait Towers]], in the State of [[Kuwait]]. It is also common to use water towers as the location of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] mechanisms in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] range with small power, for instance for closed rural broadcasting service, [[amateur radio]], or [[cellular telephone]] service.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn hilly regions, local topography can be substituted for structures to elevate the tanks. These tanks are often nothing more than concrete [[cistern]]s terraced into the sides of local hills or mountains, but function identically to the traditional water tower. The tops of these tanks can be landscaped or used as park space, if desired.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Spheres and spheroids ==\n{{stack|[[File:Waterbollen Eindhoven-02.jpg|thumb|Eindhoven Water Towers]]}}\nThe [[Chicago Bridge and Iron Company]] has built many of the water spheres and spheroids found in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title = Waterspheroid | publisher = CBI | url = http://www.cbi.com/images/uploads/2011%20Watershpheroid.pdf | accessdate = 24 February 2012}}</ref> The website ''World's Tallest Water Sphere'' describes the distinction between a water sphere and water [[spheroid]] thus:\n \n{{quote|A water sphere is a type of water tower that has a large sphere at the top of its post.

A water spheroid looks like a water sphere, but the top is wider than it is tall. A spheroid looks like a round pillow that is somewhat flattened. A cross section of a spheroid in two directions (east-west or north-south) is an ellipse, but in only one direction (top-bottom) is it a perfect circle.

It consisted of various commercials of the gang and their adventures on the feast.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Super Bowl XLI commercial===\nOn February 4, 2007, during [[Super Bowl XLI]], Snickers commercials aired. This resulted in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, Masterfoods USA of [[Hackettstown, New Jersey]], a division of [[Mars, Incorporated]]. The commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally touching lips while sharing a Snickers bar. After quickly pulling away, one mechanic says, \"I think we just accidentally kissed.\", and another mechanic exclaims, \"Quick! Do something manly!\" and in three of the four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with a very large [[pipe wrench]], and drinking [[motor oil]] and [[windshield washer fluid]]. In the fourth version, however, a third mechanic shows up and asks \"Is there room for three in this [[The Love Boat|Love Boat]]?\"\n\nComplaints were lodged against Masterfoods that the ads were [[homophobia|homophobic]]. [[Human Rights Campaign]] president [[Joe Solmonese]] is quoted as saying<blockquote>\"This type of jeering from professional sports figures at the sight of two men kissing fuels the kind of anti-gay bullying that haunts countless gay and lesbian school children on playgrounds all across the country.\"<ref name=\"playground\">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,250575,00.html Snickers Ad of Men Accidentally Kissing Pulled After Complaints From Gay Groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208023039/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C250575%2C00.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}, FOX Business.

Another advertisement featured Mr. T launching bars at a swimmer who appeared to refuse to get in a swimming pool because of the cold temperature of the water. In 2008, a European Snickers commercial in which Mr. T uses a [[Jeep]]-mounted [[Minigun]] to fire Snickers bars at a speedwalker for being a \"disgrace to the man race\" was pulled after complaints from a US pressure group that the advertisement was homophobic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/advertising |title=Don't give us none of that jibba jabba |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 4, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2009 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}</ref> These advertisements usually ended with Mr. T saying \"Snickers: Get Some Nuts!\"\n\n===NASCAR===\nIn [[NASCAR]] racing, Snickers (and the rest of the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] affiliated brands) sponsor [[Kyle Busch]]'s #18 Toyota for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]]. Prior to that the brand served as a primary sponsor for [[Ricky Rudd]]'s #88 [[Yates Racing|Robert Yates Racing]] Ford as well as an associate sponsor for the team's #38 car driven first by [[Elliott Sadler]] and then by [[David Gilliland]], and an associate sponsor for the [[Ginn Racing|MB2 Motorsports]] #36 Pontiac driven by [[Derrike Cope]], [[Ernie Irvan]], [[Ken Schrader]], and others. In 1990, [[Bobby Hillin]] drove for [[Stavola Brothers Racing]] in the #8 Snickers Buick, marking the candy's first appearance as a sponsor; it had since been driven by [[Rick Wilson (racing driver)|Rick Wilson]] and [[Dick Trickle]].\n\n===FIFA World Cup & UEFA Euro Sponsorship===\nSnickers was the Official Sponsor of the [[FIFA World Cup]] from [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] until [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] editions and the [[UEFA European Championship]] from [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]] until [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]].\n\n===You're Not You When You're Hungry===\nIn 2010, a new advertising campaign was launched, usually based around people turning into different people (usually celebrities) as a result of hunger (taking the new campaign's name \"You're Not You When You're Hungry\" quite literally). The tagline varied depending on the commercial's location or what variety the commercial is showing.\n\nIn 2010, [[Betty White]] and [[Abe Vigoda]] appeared in the first Snickers commercial in this campaign, playing [[American football]]. The commercial was ranked by [[ADBOWL]] as the best advertisement of the year. This commercial was also briefly spoofed in an episode of ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]'' on [[ESPN2]] with [[Michelle Beadle]] playing the role instead of [[Betty White]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mankindunplugged.com/2011/02/02/super-bowl-ad-fail-by-espn-sportsnations-michelle-beadle/ | title=Super Bowl Ad FAIL by ESPN2 SportsNation's Michelle Beadle | date=February 2, 2011 | accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref> Later that year, Snickers commercials featured singers [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Liza Minnelli]], and comedians [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] and [[Roseanne Barr]].

In March 2014, a commercial featuring [[Godzilla]] was released to promote the [[Godzilla (2014 film)|2014 Godzilla film]].

It consisted of various commercials of the gang and their adventures on the feast.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Super Bowl XLI commercial===\nOn February 4, 2007, during [[Super Bowl XLI]], Snickers commercials aired. This resulted in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, Masterfoods USA of [[Hackettstown, New Jersey]], a division of [[Mars, Incorporated]]. The commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally touching lips while sharing a Snickers bar. After quickly pulling away, one mechanic says, \"I think we just accidentally kissed.\", and another mechanic exclaims, \"Quick! Do something manly!\" and in three of the four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with a very large [[pipe wrench]], and drinking [[motor oil]] and [[windshield washer fluid]]. In the fourth version, however, a third mechanic shows up and asks \"Is there room for three in this [[The Love Boat|Love Boat]]?\"\n\nComplaints were lodged against Masterfoods that the ads were [[homophobia|homophobic]].

In 2008, a European Snickers commercial in which Mr. T uses a [[Jeep]]-mounted [[Minigun]] to fire Snickers bars at a speedwalker for being a \"disgrace to the man race\" was pulled after complaints from a US pressure group that the advertisement was homophobic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/04/advertising |title=Don't give us none of that jibba jabba |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 4, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2009 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney}}</ref> These advertisements usually ended with Mr. T saying \"Snickers: Get Some Nuts!\"\n\n===NASCAR===\nIn [[NASCAR]] racing, Snickers (and the rest of the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] affiliated brands) sponsor [[Kyle Busch]]'s #18 Toyota for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]].

The commercial was ranked by [[ADBOWL]] as the best advertisement of the year.

Writing during the [[Progressive Era]], Sinclair describes the world of industrialized America from both the working man's and the industrialist's points of view. Novels such as ''[[King Coal]]'' (1917), ''[[The Coal War]]'' (published posthumously), ''[[Oil!]]'' (1927), and ''[[The Flivver King]]'' (1937) describe the working conditions of the coal, oil, and auto industries at the time.\n\n''The Flivver King'' describes the rise of [[Henry Ford]], his \"wage reform\" and his company's Sociological Department, to his decline into antisemitism as publisher of ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. ''King Coal'' confronts [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], and his role in the 1913 [[Ludlow Massacre]] in the coal fields of Colorado.\n\nSinclair was an outspoken socialist and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a nominee from the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]]. He was also the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate for [[Governor of California]] during the [[Great Depression]], running under the banner of the [[End Poverty in California movement|End Poverty in California]] campaign, but was defeated in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1934|1934 elections]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{American socialism|Activists}}\nSinclair was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], to Upton Beall Sinclair Sr. and Priscilla Harden Sinclair. His father was a liquor salesman whose [[alcoholism]] shadowed his son's childhood. Priscilla Harden Sinclair was a strict Episcopalian who disliked alcohol, tea, and coffee.  Both of Upton Sinclair's parents were of English ancestry, and all of his ancestors emigrated to America from England during the late 1600s and early 1700s.<ref>Living Authors: A Book of Biographies by Stanley Kunitz, pg. 376</ref> As a child, Sinclair slept either on sofas or cross-ways on his parents' bed.

Sinclair later told his son, David, that around Sinclair's 16th year, he decided not to have anything to do with his mother, staying away from her for 35 years because an argument would start if they met.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Bloom | editor-first = Harold | title = Upton Sinclair's The Jungle | publisher = Infobase | year = 2002 | last = Derrick | first = Scott | chapter = What a Beating Feels Like: Authorship Dissolution, and Masculinity in Sinclair's The Jungle | pages = 131\u201332}}.</ref> His mother's family was very affluent: her parents were very prosperous in Baltimore, and her sister married a millionaire. Sinclair had wealthy maternal grandparents with whom he often stayed. This gave him insight into how both the rich and the poor lived during the late 19th century. Living in two social settings affected him and greatly influenced his books. Upton Beall Sinclair, Sr., was from a highly respected family in the South, but the family was financially ruined by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], disruptions of the labor system during the [[Reconstruction era]], and an extended agricultural depression.\n\nAs he was growing up, Upton's family moved frequently, as his father was not successful in his career. He developed a love for reading when he was five years old. He read every book his mother owned for a deeper understanding of the world. He did not start school until he was 10 years old. He was deficient in math and worked hard to catch up quickly because of his embarrassment.<ref name=\"Harris, Leon 1975\"/> In 1888, the Sinclair family moved to [[Queens]], New York, where his father sold shoes.

By the 1920s, however, he had returned to the party.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Sinclairs moved to [[Monrovia, California]], near Los Angeles, where Sinclair founded the state's chapter of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].

Sinclair's work was well known and popular in the first half of the 20th century, and he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1943.\n\nIn 1906, Sinclair acquired particular fame for his classic [[Muckraker|muck-raking]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', which exposed labor and sanitary conditions in the U.S. [[meatpacking industry]], causing a public uproar that contributed in part to the passage a few months later of the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] and the [[Meat Inspection Act]].<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Humane Society of the United States |url=http://www.hsus.org/farm/news/ournews/the_jungle_roar.html |title=The Jungle: Upton Sinclair's Roar Is Even Louder to Animal Advocates Today |date=March 10, 2006 |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106223608/http://www.hsus.org/farm/news/ournews/the_jungle_roar.html |archivedate=January 6, 2010 }}</ref> In 1919, he published ''[[The Brass Check]]'', a muck-raking [[Expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]] of American journalism that publicized the issue of [[yellow journalism]] and the limitations of the \"free press\" in the United States.

Writing during the [[Progressive Era]], Sinclair describes the world of industrialized America from both the working man's and the industrialist's points of view. Novels such as ''[[King Coal]]'' (1917), ''[[The Coal War]]'' (published posthumously), ''[[Oil!]]'' (1927), and ''[[The Flivver King]]'' (1937) describe the working conditions of the coal, oil, and auto industries at the time.\n\n''The Flivver King'' describes the rise of [[Henry Ford]], his \"wage reform\" and his company's Sociological Department, to his decline into antisemitism as publisher of ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. ''King Coal'' confronts [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], and his role in the 1913 [[Ludlow Massacre]] in the coal fields of Colorado.\n\nSinclair was an outspoken socialist and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a nominee from the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]]. He was also the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate for [[Governor of California]] during the [[Great Depression]], running under the banner of the [[End Poverty in California movement|End Poverty in California]] campaign, but was defeated in the [[California gubernatorial election, 1934|1934 elections]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{American socialism|Activists}}\nSinclair was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], to Upton Beall Sinclair Sr. and Priscilla Harden Sinclair. His father was a liquor salesman whose [[alcoholism]] shadowed his son's childhood. Priscilla Harden Sinclair was a strict Episcopalian who disliked alcohol, tea, and coffee.  Both of Upton Sinclair's parents were of English ancestry, and all of his ancestors emigrated to America from England during the late 1600s and early 1700s.<ref>Living Authors: A Book of Biographies by Stanley Kunitz, pg. 376</ref> As a child, Sinclair slept either on sofas or cross-ways on his parents' bed. When his father was out for the night, he would sleep alone in the bed with his mother.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Harris, Leon. (1975) \"Upton Sinclair: American Rebel.\" Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York.</ref> Sinclair did not get along with her when he became older because of her strict rules and refusal to allow him independence. Sinclair later told his son, David, that around Sinclair's 16th year, he decided not to have anything to do with his mother, staying away from her for 35 years because an argument would start if they met.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Bloom | editor-first = Harold | title = Upton Sinclair's The Jungle | publisher = Infobase | year = 2002 | last = Derrick | first = Scott | chapter = What a Beating Feels Like: Authorship Dissolution, and Masculinity in Sinclair's The Jungle | pages = 131\u201332}}.</ref> His mother's family was very affluent: her parents were very prosperous in Baltimore, and her sister married a millionaire. Sinclair had wealthy maternal grandparents with whom he often stayed. This gave him insight into how both the rich and the poor lived during the late 19th century. Living in two social settings affected him and greatly influenced his books. Upton Beall Sinclair, Sr., was from a highly respected family in the South, but the family was financially ruined by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], disruptions of the labor system during the [[Reconstruction era]], and an extended agricultural depression.\n\nAs he was growing up, Upton's family moved frequently, as his father was not successful in his career.

The son of an American arms manufacturer, Budd is portrayed as holding in the confidence of world leaders, and not simply witnessing events, but often propelling them. As a sophisticated socialite who mingles easily with people from all cultures and [[socioeconomic]] classes, Budd has been characterized as the antithesis of the stereotyped \"[[Ugly American (epithet)|Ugly American]]\".<ref>{{Cite news| title = Upton Sinclair: Revisit to Old Hero Finds He's Still Lively | first = Julie | last = Salamon | authorlink = Julie Salamon | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/22/books/22sala.html | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 22 July 2005 | at = Books | accessdate = 21 January 2010 | ref = Salamon }}</ref>\n\nSinclair placed Budd within the important political events in the United States and Europe in the first half of the 20th century.

He experimented with various diets, and with fasting. He wrote about this in his book, ''The Fasting Cure'' (1911), another bestseller.<ref>[http://www.soilandhealth.org/02/0201hyglibcat/020106/02010600frame.html \"'The Fasting Cure', by Upton Sinclair\"], ''Soil and Health''</ref> He believed that periodic fasting was important for health, saying, \"I had taken several fasts of ten or twelve days' duration, with the result of a complete making over of my health\".<ref>[http://www.soilandhealth.org/02/0201hyglibcat/020106/020106perfecthealth.html \"Perfect Health!\" (chapter)], ''The Fasting Cure,'' at ''Soil and Health''</ref>\n\nSinclair favored a raw food diet of predominantly vegetables and nuts. For long periods of time, he was a complete vegetarian, but he also experimented with eating meat. His attitude to these matters was fully explained in the chapter, \"The Use of Meat\", in the above-mentioned book.<ref>[http://www.soilandhealth.org/02/0201hyglibcat/020106/020106useofmeat.html \"The Use of Meat\" (chapter)].

Repeatedly, Sinclair is resurrected after his death and assassinated again, a \"personification of the contemporary failings of the American left\". He is portrayed as a [[Don Quixote|quixotic]] reformer attempting to stir an apathetic American public to implement socialism in America.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=L'Official |first=Peter |title=Left Behind |journal=The Village Voice |issue=14 February 2006 |page= |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/books/0608,lofficial,72231,10.html |accessdate=17 November 2011 }}</ref>\n* [[Sinclair Lewis]] refers to Sinclair and his EPIC plan in Lewis' novel, ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935).\n* [[Joyce Carol Oates]] refers to Sinclair and his first wife, Meta, in her novel ''[[The Accursed (Joyce Carol Oates novel)|The Accursed]]'' (2013).\n* Sinclair is extensively featured as a figure in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[American Empire (Harry Turtledove)|American Empire]] trilogy (2001\u20132003) as part of the [[Southern Victory Series]], an alternate history in which the [[American Socialist Party]] succeeds in becoming a major force in U.S. politics. This follows two humiliating military defeats to the [[Confederate States]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and [[France]] and the post-1882 collapse of the Republican Party, with former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] leading a large number of Liberal Republicans into the Socialist Party. Sinclair wins the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] and [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential elections]] and becomes the first Socialist [[President of the United States]]. He was also the 28th president in the timeline. On March 4, 1921, his inauguration attended by crowds of jubilant militants waving red flags. However, his policies as portrayed by Turtledove are not particularly radical. Sinclair served as president until 1929, when his Vice President [[Hosea Blackford]] is elected in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]] and becomes the 30th president.\n* Sinclair appears in [[T.C.Boyle]]'s novel ''[[The Road to Wellville]]'' (1993), which is built around a historical fictionalization of [[John Harvey Kellogg]], the inventor of [[Corn Flakes]] and the founder of the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]].  In the book, Sinclair and his first wife, Meta, appear as patients at the Sanitarium. Later, Kellogg is outraged when he discovers that another of his patients has been fasting after reading a typescript of Sinclair's ''The Fasting Cure''.\n\n==Films==\n* ''[[The Jungle (1914 film)|The Jungle]]'' (1914) is a silent film adaptation of the 1906 novel, with George Nash playing Jurgis Rudkus and Gail Kane playing Ona Lukozsaite.

This family belonged to the order [[Perissodactyla]], the order that includes [[horse]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, and [[tapir]]s. Although brontotheres were extremely similar in size, appearance, and probably behavior to [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]], and are frequently described as rhinos when featured in popular media about prehistoric mammals, they were actually more closely related to horses; Equidae and Brontotheriidae make up the suborder '''Hippomorpha'''. They lived around 56\u201334 million years ago, until the very close of the [[Eocene]].\n\n==Characteristics and evolution==\n{{multiple image\n|align = left\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|image1 = Megacerops BW.jpg\n|alt1 = Megacerops reconstruction\n|caption1 = Life reconstruction of ''[[Megacerops]]''\n|image2 = Protitanops NT small.jpg\n|alt2 = ''Protitanops curryi'' reconstruction\n|caption2 = Life reconstruction of ''Protitanops curryi''\n|image3 = RhinotitanMongoliensis(Skull)-PaleozoologicalMuseumOfChina-May23-08.jpg\n|alt3 = Rhinotitan skull\n|caption3 = Skull of ''[[Rhinotitan]]''\n}}\n\nBrontotheres retain four toes on their front feet and three toes on their hind feet. Their teeth are adapted to shearing (cutting) relatively nonabrasive vegetation. Their [[molar (tooth)|molars]] have a characteristic W-shaped [[ectoloph]] (outer shearing blade).\n\nThe evolutionary history of this group is well known due to an excellent fossil record in [[North America]].<ref name=\"Titanotherium keltationsart\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080615041043/http://www.keltationsart.com/Titanotherium.htm Titanotherium]</ref> The earliest brontotheres, such as ''[[Eotitanops]]'', were rather small, no more than a meter in height, and hornless.\n\nBrontotheres evolved massive bodies, although some small species such as ''[[Nanotitanops]]'' did persist through the Eocene. Some genera, such as ''[[Dolichorhinus]]'', [[Evolution|evolved]] highly elongated skulls. Later brontotheres were massive, up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with horn-like skull appendages. The [[North America]]n brontothere ''[[Megacerops]]'', for example, evolved large [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] paired horns above their noses. The sexually dimorphic horns suggest that brontotheres were highly [[gregarious]] (social) and males may have performed some sort of head-clashing behavior in competition for mates. Unlike rhinoceros, in which the horns are made of [[keratin]], however, the horns of brontotheres are composed of bone (the [[frontal bone]] and [[nasal bone]]) and were placed side-to-side rather than front-to-back.\n\nBrontotheres probably became extinct because they could not adapt to drier conditions and tougher vegetation (such as grasses) that spread during the [[Oligocene]].<ref name=\"Titanotherium keltationsart\" />\n\n==Classification of Brontotheres==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|-\n|+ Classification for Brontotheriidae after Mihlbachler 2008<ref name=\"Mihlbachler 2008\">{{cite journal|url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/5913 |title=Species taxonomy, phylogeny and biogeography of the Brontotheriidae (Mammalia, Perissodactyla)|work=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|issue=311 | first=Matthew C | last=Mihlbachler |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> and Mader 2010<ref name=\"Mader 2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/zt02339p043.pdf |title=A species-level revision of the North American brontotheres ''Eotitanops'' and ''Palaeosyops'' (Mammalia, Perissodactyla) | first=Bryn J | last=Mader |publisher=Department of Biological Sciences and Geology, Queensborough Community College |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Clade|style=white-space:nowrap;font-size:75%;line-height:100%\n|label1=&nbsp;Brontotheriidae&nbsp;\n|1={{Clade\n   |1=&nbsp;[[Eotitanopinae]]\n   |2={{Clade\n      |1=&nbsp;[[Palaeosyopinae]]\n      |label2=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriinae]]\n      |2={{Clade\n         |label1=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriini]]\n         |1={{Clade\n            |1=&nbsp;[[Rhadinorhinina]]\n            |2={{Clade\n               |1=&nbsp;[[Telmatheriina]]\n               |label2=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriina]]\n               |2={{Clade\n                     |1=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriita]]\n                     |2=&nbsp;[[Embolotheriita]]\n                  }}\n               }}\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n|}\nTwo classification systems for Brontotheriidae are presented below. The first contains 43 genera and 8 subfamilies, and although it is based on a 1997 publication by McKenna and Bell, it summarizes research that was conducted before 1920 and is badly outdated. The second classification is based on 2004 and 2005 research by Mihlbachler et al., which indicates that many of the previous subfamily names are invalid. Several more recently discovered brontotheres are included in the newer classification.\n\nAlthough ''[[Lambdotherium]]'' and ''[[Xenicohippus]]'' were previously included in Brontotheriidae, they are no longer considered members of this family. ''Lambdotherium'', though excluded, may be the closest known relative to brontotheres. ''Xenicohippus'' is now thought to be an early member of the horse family, [[Equidae]].\n{{Br}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|Old Classification (summarized by [[Malcolm

(biology)|family]] of extinct mammals belonging to the order [[Perissodactyla]], the order that includes [[horse]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, and [[tapir]]s. Superficially, they looked rather like [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]], although they were actually more closely related to horses; Equidae and Brontotheriidae make up the suborder '''Hippomorpha'''. They lived around 56\u201334 million years ago, until the very close of the [[Eocene]].\n\n==Characteristics and evolution==\n{{multiple image\n|align = left\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 200\n|image1 = Megacerops BW.jpg\n|alt1 = Megacerops reconstruction\n|caption1 = Life reconstruction of ''[[Megacerops]]''\n|image2 = Protitanops NT small.jpg\n|alt2 = ''Protitanops curryi'' reconstruction\n|caption2 = Life reconstruction of ''Protitanops curryi''\n|image3 = RhinotitanMongoliensis(Skull)-PaleozoologicalMuseumOfChina-May23-08.jpg\n|alt3 = Rhinotitan skull\n|caption3 = Skull of ''[[Rhinotitan]]''\n}}\n\nBrontotheres retain four toes on their front feet and three toes on their hind feet. Their teeth are adapted to shearing (cutting) relatively nonabrasive vegetation. Their [[molar (tooth)|molars]] have a characteristic W-shaped [[ectoloph]] (outer shearing blade).\n\nThe evolutionary history of this group is well known due to an excellent fossil record in [[North America]].<ref name=\"Titanotherium keltationsart\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080615041043/http://www.keltationsart.com/Titanotherium.htm Titanotherium]</ref> The earliest brontotheres, such as ''[[Eotitanops]]'', were rather small, no more than a meter in height, and hornless.\n\nBrontotheres evolved massive bodies, although some small species such as ''[[Nanotitanops]]'' did persist through the Eocene. Some genera, such as ''[[Dolichorhinus]]'', [[Evolution|evolved]] highly elongated skulls. Later brontotheres were massive, up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with horn-like skull appendages. The [[North America]]n brontothere ''[[Megacerops]]'', for example, evolved large [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] paired horns above their noses. The sexually dimorphic horns suggest that brontotheres were highly [[gregarious]] (social) and males may have performed some sort of head-clashing behavior in competition for mates. Unlike rhinoceros, in which the horns are made of [[keratin]], however, the horns of brontotheres are composed of bone (the [[frontal bone]] and [[nasal bone]]) and were placed side-to-side rather than front-to-back.\n\nBrontotheres probably became extinct because they could not adapt to drier conditions and tougher vegetation (such as grasses) that spread during the [[Oligocene]].<ref name=\"Titanotherium keltationsart\" />\n\n==Classification of Brontotheres==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|-\n|+ Classification for Brontotheriidae after Mihlbachler 2008<ref name=\"Mihlbachler 2008\">{{cite journal|url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/5913 |title=Species taxonomy, phylogeny and biogeography of the Brontotheriidae (Mammalia, Perissodactyla)|work=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|issue=311 | first=Matthew C | last=Mihlbachler |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> and Mader 2010<ref name=\"Mader 2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/zt02339p043.pdf |title=A species-level revision of the North American brontotheres ''Eotitanops'' and ''Palaeosyops'' (Mammalia, Perissodactyla) | first=Bryn J | last=Mader |publisher=Department of Biological Sciences and Geology, Queensborough Community College |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Clade|style=white-space:nowrap;font-size:75%;line-height:100%\n|label1=&nbsp;Brontotheriidae&nbsp;\n|1={{Clade\n   |1=&nbsp;[[Eotitanopinae]]\n   |2={{Clade\n      |1=&nbsp;[[Palaeosyopinae]]\n      |label2=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriinae]]\n      |2={{Clade\n         |label1=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriini]]\n         |1={{Clade\n            |1=&nbsp;[[Rhadinorhinina]]\n            |2={{Clade\n               |1=&nbsp;[[Telmatheriina]]\n               |label2=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriina]]\n               |2={{Clade\n                     |1=&nbsp;[[Brontotheriita]]\n                     |2=&nbsp;[[Embolotheriita]]\n                  }}\n               }}\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n|}\nTwo classification systems for Brontotheriidae are presented below. The first contains 43 genera and 8 subfamilies, and although it is based on a 1997 publication by McKenna and Bell, it summarizes research that was conducted before 1920 and is badly outdated. The second classification is based on 2004 and 2005 research by Mihlbachler et al., which indicates that many of the previous subfamily names are invalid. Several more recently discovered brontotheres are included in the newer classification.\n\nAlthough ''[[Lambdotherium]]'' and ''[[Xenicohippus]]'' were previously included in Brontotheriidae, they are no longer considered members of this family. ''Lambdotherium'', though excluded, may be the closest known relative to brontotheres. ''Xenicohippus'' is now thought to be an early member of the horse family, [[Equidae]].\n{{Br}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|Old Classification (summarized by [[Malcolm

The borough has a population of approximately 2,400. The formerly independent village was incorporated into Wiesbaden in 1928.\n\nThe historic village center is located in the south of the borough. In the center of it are the ruins of a medieval [[castle]], of which the [[keep]] still stands. Known as the \"Gateway to the [[Rheingau]]\", the historic village is surrounded by vineyards and fruit orchards.  Around late April and early May, its blooming cherry trees make Frauenstein a popular destination.\n\n==Geographical setting==\nFrauenstein borders the Wiesbaden boroughs of [[Wiesbaden-Dotzheim|Dotzheim]] to the north and northeast and [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]] to the southeast. The town of [[Schlangenbad]] lies to the west. The Schlangenbad borough of [[Georgenborn]] is almost an enclave, bordered to the north, east, and south by Frauenstein.\n\nThe historic village center of Frauenstein is situated in a narrow valley formed by two streams, the ''Lippbach'' and ''Katzbach''. These are joined by the ''Erlenbach'' south of the village center to form the ''Grorother Bach''. The ''Grorother Bach'' flows southeast, reaching the [[Rhine]] at [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]].\n\nA hill called the ''Spitzen Stein'' stands just east of the village center. Other nearby high points include ''Grauerstein'' (elevation 339 m) to the northwest and ''Leierkopf'' (207 m) to the east.

Later, the castle was extended by a fore-castle with pond, as could be confirmed by excavations in the year 1943.<ref name=\"Castle\" />\n\nAround 1300, Siegfried IV von Frauenstein sold part of the castle, along with surrounding property and its serfs, to Gerhard, the [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. Gerhard wanted the castle in order to protect the eastern border of his possessions in the [[Rheingau]] against his rival, the Count of [[Nassau (state)|Nassau]]. In May 1301, forces of [[Albert I of Germany|King Albert of Austria]] fought against Mainz. They captured all of the fortresses, including Frauenstein, and devastated the Rheingau. The castle was soon restored, however.<ref name=\"Verein\" />\n\nIn 1310 Johann von Limburg also sold his shares of the castle to the Mainz bishopric so that it had gained full control over the castle by the year 1319. Mainz, however, once again sold parts of the castle so that, by 1390, it possessed only half of the castle. The noble co-owners often settled in Frauenstein and built beautiful half-timbered houses which still stand in the village to the present day.<ref name=\"Castle\" />\n\nOver the following centuries, the disputes between Mainz and Nassau continued. Nassau was able to prevent Mainz's possessions in the area from growing by encircling the castle with a chain of five fortified farms: Sommerberg, Rosenkoeppel, N\u00fcrnberg, Groroth, and Armada. All of these estates, with the exception of Rosenkoeppel, are still preserved today.<ref name=\"Castle\" />\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, the castle lost its significance as border security and was no longer maintained.

The borough has a population of approximately 2,400. The formerly independent village was incorporated into Wiesbaden in 1928.\n\nThe historic village center is located in the south of the borough. In the center of it are the ruins of a medieval [[castle]], of which the [[keep]] still stands. Known as the \"Gateway to the [[Rheingau]]\", the historic village is surrounded by vineyards and fruit orchards.  Around late April and early May, its blooming cherry trees make Frauenstein a popular destination.\n\n==Geographical setting==\nFrauenstein borders the Wiesbaden boroughs of [[Wiesbaden-Dotzheim|Dotzheim]] to the north and northeast and [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]] to the southeast. The town of [[Schlangenbad]] lies to the west. The Schlangenbad borough of [[Georgenborn]] is almost an enclave, bordered to the north, east, and south by Frauenstein.\n\nThe historic village center of Frauenstein is situated in a narrow valley formed by two streams, the ''Lippbach'' and ''Katzbach''. These are joined by the ''Erlenbach'' south of the village center to form the ''Grorother Bach''. The ''Grorother Bach'' flows southeast, reaching the [[Rhine]] at [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]].\n\nA hill called the ''Spitzen Stein'' stands just east of the village center. Other nearby high points include ''Grauerstein'' (elevation 339 m) to the northwest and ''Leierkopf'' (207 m) to the east. The highest point in Frauenstein is Rotekrauzkopf (elevation 509 m) in the far northwest of the borough. The Frauenstein area is home to a population of the [[Aesculapian Snake]], a large, non-venomous snake rare to this area of Europe.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Wiesbaden burgruine frauenstein 1.jpg|thumb|left|Frauenstein Castle|200px]]While the German name ''Frauen-Stein'' can be translated \"women's stone\", it actually derives from ''Vrowenstein'', a name which first appears in the historical record in 1221.

This cycle occurs in [[ureotelic]] organisms. The urea cycle converts highly toxic ammonia to urea for excretion.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|last=Cox |first=Michael|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Freeman|isbn=9781429234146|oclc=901647690}}</ref> This cycle was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered ([[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] and [[Kurt Henseleit]], 1932), five years before the discovery of the [[TCA cycle]]. This cycle was described in more detail later on by Ratner and Cohen. The urea cycle takes place primarily in the [[liver]] and, to a lesser extent, in the [[kidney]]s.\n\n==Function==\n[[Amino acid catabolism]] results in waste ammonia. All animals need a way to excrete this product. Most aquatic organisms, or ammonotelic organisms, excrete ammonia without converting it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Organisms that cannot easily and safely remove nitrogen as ammonia convert it to a less toxic substance such as [[urea]] or [[uric acid]] via the urea cycle, which occurs  mainly in the liver. Urea produced by the liver is then released into the bloodstream where it travels to the kidneys and is ultimately excreted in urine. The urea cycle is essential to these organisms, because if the nitrogen or ammonia are not eliminated from the organism it can be very detrimental.<ref name=\":122\" />  In species including birds and most insects, the ammonia is converted into uric acid or its urate salt, which is excreted in solid form.\n\n==Reactions==\nThe entire process converts two amino groups, one from {{chem|NH|4|+}} and one from [[Aspartic acid|Aspartate]], and a carbon atom from {{chem|HCO|3|-}}, to the relatively nontoxic excretion product [[urea]] at the cost of four \"high-energy\" phosphate bonds (3 ATP hydrolyzed to 2 ADP and one AMP). The conversion from ammonia to urea happens in five main steps. The first is needed for ammonia to enter the cycle and the following four are all a part of the cycle itself.

The reaction is catalyzed by [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I]] and requires the use of two [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules.<ref name=\":0\" /> The carbamoyl phosphate then enters the urea cycle.\n\n=== Steps of the urea cycle ===\n#Carbamoyl phosphate is converted to [[citrulline]]. With catalysis by [[Ornithine transcarbamylase|ornithine transcarbamoylase]], the carbamoyl phosphate group is donated to ornithine and releases a phosphate group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n#A [[condensation reaction]] occurs between the amino group of aspartate and the carbonyl group of citrulline to form [[argininosuccinic acid|argininosuccinate]].

The NADH is produced in two ways:\n* One NADH molecule is produced by the enzyme [[glutamate dehydrogenase]] in the conversion of glutamate to ammonium and [[\u03b1-ketoglutarate]]. [[Glutamate]]<nowiki/> is the non-toxic carrier of amine groups. This provides the ammonium ion used in the initial synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate.\n* The fumarate released in the cytosol is hydrated to [[malate]] by cytosolic [[fumarase]]. This malate is then oxidized to [[oxaloacetate]] by cytosolic [[malate dehydrogenase]], generating a reduced NADH in the cytosol. [[Oxaloacetate]] is one of the keto acids preferred by [[transaminase]]s, and so will be recycled to [[aspartate]], maintaining the flow of nitrogen into the urea cycle.\nWe can summarize this by combining the reactions:\n* CO<sub>2</sub> + [[glutamate]] + [[aspartate]] + 3 ATP + 2 NAD<sup>+</sup>+ 3 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 [[urea]] + [[\u03b1-ketoglutarate]] + [[oxaloacetate]] + 2 ADP + 2 P<sub>i</sub> + AMP + PP<sub>i</sub> + 2 NADH\nThe two NADH produced can provide energy for the formation of 5 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (cytosolic NADH provides 2.5 ATP with the malate-aspartate shuttle in human liver cell), a net production of two high-energy phosphate bond for the urea cycle. However, if [[gluconeogenesis]] is underway in the cytosol, the latter reducing equivalent is used to drive the reversal of the [[GAPDH]] step instead of generating ATP.\n\nThe fate of oxaloacetate is either to produce aspartate via transamination or to be converted to [[Phosphoenolpyruvic acid|phosphoenolpyruvate]], which is a substrate for [[gluconeogenesis]].<!--\nAn excellent way to memorize the Urea Cycle is to remember the [[mnemonic]] phrase \"Ordinarily Careless Crappers Are Also Frivolous About Urination.\" The first letter of each word corresponds to the first letter of each of the main reactants or products that are combined with each other or produced as one progresses through the five reactions of the cycle (Ornithine, Carbamoyl phosphate, Citrulline, Aspartate, Argininosuccinate, Fumarate, Arginine, Urea).-->\n\n<br />\n\n== Products of The Urea Cycle ==\nAs stated above many vertebrates use the urea cycle to create urea out of ammonium so that the ammonium does not damage the body. Though this is helpful, there are other effects of the urea cycle. For example: consumption of two ATP, production of urea, generation of H+, the combining of HCO3-  and NH4+ to forms where it can be regenerated, and finally the consumption of NH4+.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=30158252|title=Functional Roles of Urea in Vertebrates|journal=Physiological Zoology|volume=65|issue=2|last1=Atkinson|first1=Daniel|date=September 20, 1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|edition=2|location=Los Angeles|pages=243\u2013267|doi=10.1086/physzool.65.2.30158252}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n\n===''N''-Acetylglutamic acid===\nThe synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate and the urea cycle are dependent on the presence of [[N-Acetylglutamic acid|''N''-acetylglutamic acid]] (NAcGlu), which [[allosterically]] activates [[Carbamoyl phosphate synthase|CPS1]].

So Glu not only is a substrate for NAGS but also serves as an activator for the urea cycle.\n\n===Substrate concentrations===\nThe remaining enzymes of the cycle are controlled by the concentrations of their substrates. Thus, inherited deficiencies in cycle enzymes other than [[Protein:ARG1|ARG1]] do not result in significant decreases in urea production (if any cycle enzyme is entirely missing, death occurs shortly after birth). Rather, the deficient enzyme's substrate builds up, increasing the rate of the deficient reaction to normal.\n\nThe anomalous substrate buildup is not without cost, however. The substrate concentrations become elevated all the way back up the cycle to {{chem|NH|4|+}}, resulting in [[hyperammonemia]] (elevated [{{chem|NH|4|+}}]<sub>P</sub>).\n\nAlthough the root cause of {{chem|NH|4|+}} toxicity is not completely understood, a high [{{chem|NH|4|+}}] puts an enormous strain on the {{chem|NH|4|+}}-clearing system, especially in the [[Human brain|brain]] (symptoms of urea cycle enzyme deficiencies include [[intellectual disability]] and [[lethargy]]). This clearing system involves [[Protein:GLUD1|GLUD1]] and [[Protein:GLUL|GLUL]], which decrease the [[2-oxoglutarate]] (2OG) and Glu pools. The brain is most sensitive to the depletion of these pools.

The urea cycle is essential to these organisms, because if the nitrogen or ammonia are not eliminated from the organism it can be very detrimental.<ref name=\":122\" />  In species including birds and most insects, the ammonia is converted into uric acid or its urate salt, which is excreted in solid form.\n\n==Reactions==\nThe entire process converts two amino groups, one from {{chem|NH|4|+}} and one from [[Aspartic acid|Aspartate]], and a carbon atom from {{chem|HCO|3|-}}, to the relatively nontoxic excretion product [[urea]] at the cost of four \"high-energy\" phosphate bonds (3 ATP hydrolyzed to 2 ADP and one AMP). The conversion from ammonia to urea happens in five main steps. The first is needed for ammonia to enter the cycle and the following four are all a part of the cycle itself.
