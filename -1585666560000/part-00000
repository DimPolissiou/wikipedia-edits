The two companies consolidated in November 1856.<ref name=curry />{{rp|27\u201328}}\n\nAt the time of its initial settling, the land Columbus occupied still belonged to the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].

In that year, construction began in Omaha on the transcontinental railroad. The [[Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]], passed the previous year, attracted a host of settlers to the Plains and gave rise to increased emigrant traffic business.

During the decade, the population of the county grew threefold, and Columbus became the trade center for an eight-county area. The [[Black Hills Gold Rush]] in 1875 led the city's merchants to promote it as a staging and outfitting area for gold seekers, who could ride the railroad to Columbus and then travel overland to the gold fields.<ref name=columbuscommercialreg />\n\nIn 1879, Columbus became the focus of a war between railroad companies. The [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad|Burlington and Missouri]] proposed to develop a line from [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] through Columbus and into northwestern Nebraska, and urged the citizens of Platte County to vote a bond of $100,000 for construction expenses. [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] financier [[Jay Gould]], displeased at the prospect of competition, informed the voters of the county that if the measure passed, he would do his best to ruin Columbus. After a heated campaign, the measure passed despite Gould's threats. The Burlington and Missouri built a line from Lincoln to Columbus, but stopped there; for their diagonal route across Nebraska, they chose one that crossed the Union Pacific at [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]] rather than Columbus.<ref name=curry />{{rp|324}}\n\nGould sought to make good on his threat. When the Union Pacific developed its subsidiary [[Omaha, Niobrara and Black Hills Railroad]], he directed that it cross the Loup River at Lost Creek, then run south to join the Union Pacific's main line at Jackson (since renamed [[Duncan, Nebraska|Duncan]]), bypassing Columbus.  Fortunately for Columbus, an ice jam destroyed the Lost Creek bridge in the spring of 1881.  Railroad officials agreed to reroute the line down the north bank of the Loup to Columbus in exchange for a $25,000 contribution from the city.<ref name=curry />{{rp|325}}\n\n===Automobile age===\n[[File:Columbus, Nebraska 2304 13th St from SE.JPG|thumb|alt=One-story building on street corner with garage entrances on south and east sides|Lincoln Highway Garage, built in downtown Columbus in 1915]]\n\nIn 1911, the [[Meridian Highway]] project was launched with the formation of a Meridian Road association in Kansas.  Later that same year, John Nicholson, originator of the highway, spoke at a meeting in Columbus, at which the Nebraska Meridian Road Association was organized.  The proposed north-south transcontinental highway crossed the Platte and the Loup rivers at the Columbus bridges.  In 1922, it was designated a state highway.  The completion of the [[Meridian Highway Bridge|Meridian Bridge]] in 1924, replacing a seasonal ferry across the [[Missouri River]] at the Nebraska-South Dakota border, made the highway a year-round route from Canada to Mexico.

In that year, construction began in Omaha on the transcontinental railroad.

During the decade, the population of the county grew threefold, and Columbus became the trade center for an eight-county area. The [[Black Hills Gold Rush]] in 1875 led the city's merchants to promote it as a staging and outfitting area for gold seekers, who could ride the railroad to Columbus and then travel overland to the gold fields.<ref name=columbuscommercialreg />\n\nIn 1879, Columbus became the focus of a war between railroad companies. The [[Burlington and Missouri River Railroad|Burlington and Missouri]] proposed to develop a line from [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] through Columbus and into northwestern Nebraska, and urged the citizens of Platte County to vote a bond of $100,000 for construction expenses. [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]] financier [[Jay Gould]], displeased at the prospect of competition, informed the voters of the county that if the measure passed, he would do his best to ruin Columbus. After a heated campaign, the measure passed despite Gould's threats. The Burlington and Missouri built a line from Lincoln to Columbus, but stopped there; for their diagonal route across Nebraska, they chose one that crossed the Union Pacific at [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]] rather than Columbus.<ref name=curry />{{rp|324}}\n\nGould sought to make good on his threat. When the Union Pacific developed its subsidiary [[Omaha, Niobrara and Black Hills Railroad]], he directed that it cross the Loup River at Lost Creek, then run south to join the Union Pacific's main line at Jackson (since renamed [[Duncan, Nebraska|Duncan]]), bypassing Columbus.  Fortunately for Columbus, an ice jam destroyed the Lost Creek bridge in the spring of 1881.  Railroad officials agreed to reroute the line down the north bank of the Loup to Columbus in exchange for a $25,000 contribution from the city.<ref name=curry />{{rp|325}}\n\n===Automobile age===\n[[File:Columbus, Nebraska 2304 13th St from SE.JPG|thumb|alt=One-story building on street corner with garage entrances on south and east sides|Lincoln Highway Garage, built in downtown Columbus in 1915]]\n\nIn 1911, the [[Meridian Highway]] project was launched with the formation of a Meridian Road association in Kansas.  Later that same year, John Nicholson, originator of the highway, spoke at a meeting in Columbus, at which the Nebraska Meridian Road Association was organized.  The proposed north-south transcontinental highway crossed the Platte and the Loup rivers at the Columbus bridges.  In 1922, it was designated a state highway.  The completion of the [[Meridian Highway Bridge|Meridian Bridge]] in 1924, replacing a seasonal ferry across the [[Missouri River]] at the Nebraska-South Dakota border, made the highway a year-round route from Canada to Mexico.

Nero's mother, [[Agrippina the Younger]], dominated Nero's early life and decisions until he cast her off and had her killed five years into his reign.<ref name=\"Jarus\" />\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, Nero was content to be guided by his mother, his tutor [[Seneca the younger|Lucius Annaeus Seneca]], and his [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]]. As time passed, he started to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy. During his reign, the redoubtable general [[Corbulo]] conducted a [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363|successful war]] and negotiated peace with the [[Parthian Empire]]. His general [[Suetonius Paulinus]] crushed a major revolt in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], led by the [[Iceni]] Queen [[Boudica]]. The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] was briefly annexed to the empire, and the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] began. Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and the cultural life of the empire, ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician and charioteer. In the eyes of traditionalists, this undermined the dignity and authority of his person, status, and office. His extravagant, empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes that was much resented by the upper classes. In contrast, his populist style of rule remained very popular among the lower classes of Rome and the provinces until his death and beyond. Various plots against his life were revealed; the ringleaders, most of them Nero's own courtiers, were executed (at least until his final demise).\n\nIn 68 AD [[Vindex]], governor of the [[Gaul]]ish territory [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], rebelled.

Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for him.\n\nWhile Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy (\"hostis publicus\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Garzetti, Albino |title=From Tiberius to the Antonines (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Roman Empire AD 14\u2013192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk3XAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT220|date=2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69843-2|pages=220\u2013}}</ref>). The prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Nymphidius Sabinus|Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus]], also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support of Galba.\n\nIn response, Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and, from there, to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius, Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands, responding with a line from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': \"Is it so dreadful a thing then to die?\" Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba, or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences \"and if he could not soften their hearts, to entreat them at least to allow him the [[Egypt (Roman province)|prefecture of Egypt]]\". Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero's writing desk, but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum.<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#47 47].</ref>\n\nNero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping, he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends' palace chambers for them to come, he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally, he found them all abandoned. When he called for a [[gladiator]] or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him, no one appeared. He cried, \"Have I neither friend nor foe?\" and ran out as if to throw himself into the [[Tiber]].<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nReturning, Nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman, [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], offered his villa, located {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} outside the city. Travelling in disguise, Nero and four loyal [[freedman|freedmen]], [[Epaphroditos]], [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], [[Neophytus (freedman)|Neophytus]], and [[Sporus]], reached the villa, where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.\n\nAt this time, a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy, that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death, and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the [[Roman Forum]]. The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action, as Nero was the last member of the Julio-Claudian Family. Indeed, most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline, if not to Nero himself. The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate, where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero's life, so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#72|XV.72]].</ref>\n\nNero, however, did not know this, and at the news brought by the courier, he prepared himself for [[forced suicide|suicide]], pacing up and down muttering ''Qualis artifex pereo'' (\"What an artist dies in me\").<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Buckley | first1 = Emma | last2 = Dinter | first2 = Martin T. | title = A Companion to the Neronian Age | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2013 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | isbn = 978-1-118-31659-7 | access-date = 2015-12-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160507051146/https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | archive-date = 2016-05-07 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> Losing his nerve, he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first.

Around 57{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} and 58{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} [[Domitius Corbulo]] and his legions advanced on Tiridates and captured the Armenian capital [[Artaxata]]. [[Tigranes VI of Armenia|Tigranes]] was chosen to replace Tiridates on the Armenian throne. When Tigranes attacked [[Adiabene]], Nero had to send further legions to defend Armenia and Syria from Parthia.\n\nThe Roman victory came at a time when the Parthians were troubled by revolts; when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the Armenian situation. A Roman army under Paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both Roman and Parthian forces withdrew from Armenia, it was under Parthian control. The triumphal arch for Corbulo's earlier victory was part-built when Parthian envoys arrived in 63 AD to discuss treaties.    \nGiven ''imperium'' over the eastern regions, Corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this Parthian delegation. An agreement was thereafter reached with the Parthians: Rome would recognize Tiridates as king of Armenia, only if he agreed to receive his [[diadem]] from Nero. A coronation ceremony was held in Italy 66{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}}. Dio reports that Tiridates said \"I have come to you, my God, worshiping you as [[Mithras]].\" Shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to Nero in the East including \"The New [[Apollo]]\" and \"The New Sun.\" After the coronation, friendly relations were established between Rome and the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Armenia.

He both sang and played the ''[[cithara]]'' (a type of [[lyre]]). Many of these disciplines were standard education for the Roman elite, but Nero's devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a Roman of his class.<ref name=\"griffin\"/>{{rp|41\u201342}} Ancient sources were critical of Nero's emphasis on the arts, chariot-racing and athletics. Pliny described Nero as an \"actor-emperor\" (''scaenici imperatoris'') and Suetonius wrote that he was \"carried away by a craze for popularity...since he was acclaimed as the equal of Apollo in music and of the Sun in driving a chariot, he had planned to emulate the exploits of Hercules as well.\"<ref name=champlin/>{{rp|53}}\n\nIn 67 {{sc|AD}} Nero participated in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympics]].

Nero won every contest in which he was a competitor.  During the games Nero sang and played his lyre on stage, acted in tragedies and raced chariots. He won a 10-horse chariot race, despite being thrown from the chariot and leaving the race. He was crowned on the basis that he would have won if he had completed the race.

These first histories, while they still existed, were described as biased and fantastical, either overly critical or praising of Nero.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 8|XX.8.3]]; Tacitus, ''Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#10|10]]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]].</ref> The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#2|XIV.2]].</ref> Nonetheless, these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 13#20|XIII.20]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.13]].</ref> A few of the contemporary historians are known by name.

Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero's death. These sources contradict one another on a number of events in Nero's life including the death of [[Claudius]], the death of [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], and the Roman fire of 64, but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero.\n\nA handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favourable light. Some sources, though, portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people, especially in the east.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n;Cassius Dio\n[[Cassius Dio]] (c. 155\u2013229) was the son of [[Cassius Apronianus]], a Roman senator.

Tacitus described the rule of the Julio-Claudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced:\n\n{{quote|The histories of Tiberius, Caius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]].</ref>}}\n\nTacitus was the son of a [[Promagistrate|procurator]], who married into the elite family of Agricola.

The child responded, \"I will lay my vengeance upon [[Edom]] by the hand of my people Israel\" ([[Ezekiel 25]] [http://av1611.com/kjbp/kjv-bible-text/Eze-25.html 25,14]). Nero became terrified, believing that God wanted the [[Second Temple]] to be destroyed, but that he would punish the one to carry it out. Nero said, \"He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me,\" whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such retribution.<ref>Talmud, [[Treatise|tractate]] [[Gittin|Gitin]] 56a-b</ref> [[Vespasian]] was then dispatched to put down the rebellion.\n\nThe Talmud adds that the sage [[Rabbi Meir|Reb Meir Baal HaNess]] lived in the time of the [[Mishna]], and was a prominent supporter of the [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]] [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|rebellion]] against Roman rule.

Nero's mother, [[Agrippina the Younger]], dominated Nero's early life and decisions until he cast her off and had her killed five years into his reign.<ref name=\"Jarus\" />\n\nDuring the early years of his reign, Nero was content to be guided by his mother, his tutor [[Seneca the younger|Lucius Annaeus Seneca]], and his [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]]. As time passed, he started to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy. During his reign, the redoubtable general [[Corbulo]] conducted a [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363|successful war]] and negotiated peace with the [[Parthian Empire]]. His general [[Suetonius Paulinus]] crushed a major revolt in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], led by the [[Iceni]] Queen [[Boudica]]. The [[Bosporan Kingdom]] was briefly annexed to the empire, and the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] began. Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and the cultural life of the empire, ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician and charioteer. In the eyes of traditionalists, this undermined the dignity and authority of his person, status, and office. His extravagant, empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes that was much resented by the upper classes. In contrast, his populist style of rule remained very popular among the lower classes of Rome and the provinces until his death and beyond. Various plots against his life were revealed; the ringleaders, most of them Nero's own courtiers, were executed (at least until his final demise).\n\nIn 68 AD [[Vindex]], governor of the [[Gaul]]ish territory [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], rebelled. He was supported by [[Galba]], the governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. Vindex's revolt failed in its immediate aim, but Nero fled Rome when Rome's discontented civil and military authorities chose Galba as emperor. He committed suicide on June 9, 68 AD, when he learned that he had been [[Trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] and condemned to death as a public enemy, making him the first Roman Emperor to commit suicide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#49|title=Suetonius \u2022 Life of Nero|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Barnes, T.D. |title=The Fragments of Tacitus' Histories|volume=72|issue=3|jstor=268314|journal=Classical Philology|year=1977|pages= 224\u201331 [228]|doi=10.1086/366355}}</ref> His death ended the Julio-Claudian dynasty, sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].\n\nNero's rule is usually associated with [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and extravagance.<ref>[[Galba]] criticized the excesses (''luxuria'') of Nero's public and private spending.

Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for him.\n\nWhile Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy (\"hostis publicus\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Garzetti, Albino |title=From Tiberius to the Antonines (Routledge Revivals): A History of the Roman Empire AD 14\u2013192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk3XAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT220|date=2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69843-2|pages=220\u2013}}</ref>). The prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Nymphidius Sabinus|Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus]], also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support of Galba.\n\nIn response, Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] and, from there, to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius, Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands, responding with a line from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': \"Is it so dreadful a thing then to die?\" Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba, or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences \"and if he could not soften their hearts, to entreat them at least to allow him the [[Egypt (Roman province)|prefecture of Egypt]]\". Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero's writing desk, but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum.<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#47 47].</ref>\n\nNero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping, he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends' palace chambers for them to come, he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally, he found them all abandoned. When he called for a [[gladiator]] or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him, no one appeared. He cried, \"Have I neither friend nor foe?\" and ran out as if to throw himself into the [[Tiber]].<ref name=\"penelope.uchicago.edu\"/>\n\nReturning, Nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman, [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], offered his villa, located {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on}} outside the city. Travelling in disguise, Nero and four loyal [[freedman|freedmen]], [[Epaphroditos]], [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], [[Neophytus (freedman)|Neophytus]], and [[Sporus]], reached the villa, where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.\n\nAt this time, a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy, that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death, and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the [[Roman Forum]]. The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action, as Nero was the last member of the Julio-Claudian Family. Indeed, most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline, if not to Nero himself. The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate, where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero's life, so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#72|XV.72]].</ref>\n\nNero, however, did not know this, and at the news brought by the courier, he prepared himself for [[forced suicide|suicide]], pacing up and down muttering ''Qualis artifex pereo'' (\"What an artist dies in me\").<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Buckley | first1 = Emma | last2 = Dinter | first2 = Martin T. | title = A Companion to the Neronian Age | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2013 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | isbn = 978-1-118-31659-7 | access-date = 2015-12-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160507051146/https://books.google.com/books?id=qYb3JCWUNnkC&dq | archive-date = 2016-05-07 | url-status=live | df =  }}</ref> Losing his nerve, he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first.

Around 57{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} and 58{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}} [[Domitius Corbulo]] and his legions advanced on Tiridates and captured the Armenian capital [[Artaxata]]. [[Tigranes VI of Armenia|Tigranes]] was chosen to replace Tiridates on the Armenian throne. When Tigranes attacked [[Adiabene]], Nero had to send further legions to defend Armenia and Syria from Parthia.\n\nThe Roman victory came at a time when the Parthians were troubled by revolts; when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the Armenian situation. A Roman army under Paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both Roman and Parthian forces withdrew from Armenia, it was under Parthian control. The triumphal arch for Corbulo's earlier victory was part-built when Parthian envoys arrived in 63 AD to discuss treaties.    \nGiven ''imperium'' over the eastern regions, Corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this Parthian delegation. An agreement was thereafter reached with the Parthians: Rome would recognize Tiridates as king of Armenia, only if he agreed to receive his [[diadem]] from Nero. A coronation ceremony was held in Italy 66{{nbsp}}{{sc|AD}}. Dio reports that Tiridates said \"I have come to you, my God, worshiping you as [[Mithras]].\" Shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to Nero in the East including \"The New [[Apollo]]\" and \"The New Sun.\" After the coronation, friendly relations were established between Rome and the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Armenia.

Many of these disciplines were standard education for the Roman elite, but Nero's devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a Roman of his class.<ref name=\"griffin\"/>{{rp|41\u201342}} Ancient sources were critical of Nero's emphasis on the arts, chariot-racing and athletics.

These sources contradict one another on a number of events in Nero's life including the death of [[Claudius]], the death of [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], and the Roman fire of 64, but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero.\n\nA handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favourable light. Some sources, though, portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people, especially in the east.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n;Cassius Dio\n[[Cassius Dio]] (c. 155\u2013229) was the son of [[Cassius Apronianus]], a Roman senator.

Tacitus described the rule of the Julio-Claudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced:\n\n{{quote|The histories of Tiberius, Caius, Claudius and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]].</ref>}}\n\nTacitus was the son of a [[Promagistrate|procurator]], who married into the elite family of Agricola.

The district has been represented by [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano]] since 2013.\n\nThe 15th district is located entirely within [[the Bronx]], namely the southern portion of the [[West Bronx]] as well as the [[South Bronx]]. [[Hispanics]] make up the majority of the district's population, followed by blacks. Whites, Asians and others comprise a small minority. [[Yankee Stadium]] and the [[Bronx Zoo]] are both located within the district.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013 it was composed of [[Upper Manhattan]], [[Rikers Island]] and a largely non-residential section of northwestern [[Queens]] on the shore of the [[East River]] mostly occupied by a [[Consolidated Edison]] facility and a [[New York Power Authority]] [[power plant]].  The district included the neighborhoods of [[Harlem]], [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]], [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]], [[Spanish Harlem, Manhattan|Spanish Harlem]], [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], and portions of the [[Upper West Side]] that included [[Apollo Theater]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Grant's Tomb]].\n\nScoring a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+43 in 2014 rendered the district the most Democratic in the nation.<ref>[http://cookpolitical.com/house/pvi#The Median & Most Partisan Districts], 1998-2014.</ref> U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] won 90% of the vote in the 15th congressional district in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]. In [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], this was the district scoring the highest percentage of local votes to President [[Barack Obama]]: 96.7%.

The state included a [[List of Ismaili castles|nexus of strategic fortresses]] throughout [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]], with each stronghold being surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, in particular, the [[Seljuk Empire]].\n\nThe order of the Assassins was formed as a result of a religious and political movement of the minority [[Nizari Ismaili]] sect supported by the anti-Seljuk population. Being heavily outnumbered, they resisted adversaries by employing strategic strongholds and the use of unconventional tactics, such as [[assassination]] of important figures and psychological warfare.\n\nTwo centuries after its foundation, the state declined internally under [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]], who eventually dismantled and surrendered the Alamut Castle to the [[Mongol Empire|invading Mongols]]. Much of what is known about the Nizaris are based on hostile sources.\n\n==History==\nMost [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Shia]]s outside North Africa, mostly in Persia and Syria, came to acknowledge [[Nizar ibn al-Mustansir]]'s claim to the Imamate as maintained by [[Hasan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]], and this point marks the fundamental split between Ismaili Shias. Within two generations, the [[Fatimid Empire]] would suffer several more splits and eventually implode.\n[[File:Alamut.png|thumb|300px|left|Location of several of the [[List of Ismaili castles|Ismaili castles]] in the regions of [[Alamut]] and [[Rudbar]] of Persia]]\nFollowing his expulsion from Egypt over his support for Nizar, Hassan-i Sabbah found that his co-religionists, the Ismailis, were scattered throughout Persia, with a strong presence in the northern and eastern regions, particularly in [[Daylam]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and [[Quhistan]]. The Ismailis and other occupied peoples of Persia held shared resentment for the ruling [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s, who had divided the country's farmland into ''[[Iqta'|iqt\u0101\u2019]]'' (fiefs) and levied heavy taxes upon the citizens living therein. The Seljuk ''[[amirs]]'' (independent rulers) usually held full jurisdiction and control over the districts they administered.<ref name=\"Short History\">{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9781558761933}}</ref>{{rp|126}} Meanwhile, Persian artisans, craftsmen and lower classes grew increasingly dissatisfied with the Seljuk policies and heavy taxes.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|126}} Hassan too, was appalled by the political and economic oppression imposed by the [[Sunni]] Seljuk ruling class on [[Shi'ite]] Muslims living across Persia.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|126}}  It was in this context that he embarked on a resistance movement against the Seljuqs, beginning with the search for a secure site from which to launch his revolt.\n\nBy 1090 AD, the Seljuk vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]] had already given orders for Hassan's arrest and therefore Hassan was living in hiding in the northern town of [[Qazvin]], approximately 60&nbsp;km from the Alamut Castle.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\">{{cite book |last=Willey |first=Peter |title=Eagle's Nest: Ismaili Castles in Iran and Syria |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

The castle had never before been captured by military means and thus Hassan planned meticulously.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}} Meanwhile, he dispatched his reliable supporters to the Alamut valley to begin settlements around the castle.\n\nIn the summer of 1090 AD, Hassan set out from Qazvin towards Alamut on a mountainous route through [[Andej]]. He remained at Andej disguised as a schoolteacher named Dehkhoda until he was certain that a number of his supporters had settled directly below the castle in the village of [[Gazorkhan]] or had gained employment at the fortress itself.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}} Still in disguise, Hassan made his way into the fortress, earning the trust and friendship of many of its soldiers. Careful not to attract the attention of the castle's [[Zaydi]] lord, Mahdi, Hassan began to attract prominent figures at Alamut to his mission. It has even been suggested that Mahdi's own deputy was a secret supporter of Hassan, waiting to demonstrate his loyalty on the day that Hassan would ultimately take the castle.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}}\nThe Alamut fortress was eventually captured from Mahdi in 1090 AD and therefore from Seljuk control by Hassan and his supporters without resorting to any violence.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|24}} Mahdi's life was spared, and he later received 3,000 gold dinars in compensation.\nCapturing of the Alamut Castle marks the founding of the Nizari Ismaili state.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Hasan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]] and the succeeding lords of Alamut, the strategy of covert capture was successfully replicated at strategic fortresses across Persia, Syria, and the Fertile Crescent.  The Nizari Ismaili created a state of unconnected fortresses, surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, and managed a unified power structure that proved more effective than either that in Fatimid Cairo, or Seljuk Bagdad, both of which suffered political instability, particularly during the transition between leaders. These periods of internal turmoil allowed the Ismaili state respite from attack, and even to have such sovereignty as to have minted their own coinage.\n{{quote box|align=right|width=26%|quote=\"They call him Shaykh-al-Hashishim.

The governor (''muhtasham'') of Quhistan was [[Nasir al-Din Abu al-Fath Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Mansur]], and the Nizaris were under Imam [[Ala' al-Din Muhammad]].<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nAfter the death of the last Khwarezmaian ruler [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the destruction of the [[Nizari Ismaili state]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] became thet main Mongol objectives. In 1238, the Nizari Imam and the Abbasid caliph sent a joint diplomatic mission to the European kings [[Louis IX of France]] and [[Edward I of England]] to forge an alliance against the invading Mongols, but this was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2zsef |last3=Studies |first3=Central European University Dept of Medieval |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |date=2001 |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn=978-963-9241-42-8 |page=32 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Daftari2000\" /> The Mongols kept putting pressure on the Nizris of [[Quhistan]] and [[Qumis (region)|Qumis]]. In 1256, Ala' al-Din was succeeded by his young son [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]] as the Nizari Imam. A year later, the main Mongol army under [[Hulagu Khan]] enter Iran via Khorasan. Numerous negotiations between the Nizari Imam and Hulagu Khan were futile. Apparently, the Nizari Imam seeked to at least keep the main Nizari strongohlds, while the Mongols demanded the full submission of the Nizaris.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nIn 19 November 1256, the Nizari Imam, whho was in the [[Maymun-Dizh]], surrendered the castle to the besieging Mongols under Hulagu Khan after a fierce conflict. [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] fell in December 1256 and [[Lambasar Castle|Lambsar]] fell in 1257, with [[Gerdkuh Castle|Gerdkuh]] remaining unconqured. In thte same year, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], the khagan of the [[Mongol Empire]], ordered a massacre of all Nizari Ismailis of Persia.

The valley's western entrance is a narrow one, shielded by cliffs over 350m high. Known as the [[Shirkuh]], the gorge sits at the intersection of three rivers: the [[Taliqan]], [[Shahrud]] and Alamut River. For much of the year, the raging waters of the river made this entrance nearly inaccessible. Qazvin, the closest town to the valley by land can only be reached by an underdeveloped mule track upon which an enemy's presence could easily be detected given the dust clouds arising from their passage.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|58}} But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of [[Lambsar Castle|Lamasar]] served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name ''[[dar al-hijra]]'' (place of refuge). The notion of the ''dar al-hijra'' originates from the time of the Prophet Muhammad, who fled with his supporters from intense persecution to safe haven in [[Yathrib]].<ref name=\"Secret Order\">{{cite book |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G.S. |title=The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Niz\u00e2r\u00ee Ism\u00e2'\u00eel\u00ees Against the Islamic World |year=2005 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780812219166}}</ref>{{rp|79}} In this way, the [[Fatimid]]s found their ''dar al-hijra'' in [[North Africa]].

One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}} Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends.  In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by commandos called ''fid\u0101\u2019\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc}}, \"devotee\"; plural {{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u0648\u0646}} ''fid\u0101\u2019iyy\u016bn'').  The assassinations were against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|61}} A single assassination was usually employed in favour of widespread bloodshed resultant from factional combat. The first instance of assassination in the effort to establish an Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the murder of Seljuq vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]].<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}} Carried out by a man dressed as a [[Sufi]] whose identity remains unclear, the vizier's murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the fida\u2019is have been significantly exaggerated.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}}  While the Seljuqs and [[Crusaders]] both employed assassination as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}}\n\n[[Knives]] and [[dagger]]s were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed onto the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message that he was marked for death.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Nizari Ismailism]]\n* [[List of assassinations by the Assassins]]\n* [[Order of Assassins]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Willey, Peter.

The state included a [[List of Ismaili castles|nexus of strategic fortresses]] throughout [[Greater Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]], with each stronghold being surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, in particular, the [[Seljuk Empire]].\n\nThe order of the Assassins was formed as a result of a religious and political movement of the minority [[Nizari Ismaili]] sect supported by the anti-Seljuk population. Being heavily outnumbered, they resisted adversaries by employing strategic strongholds and the use of unconventional tactics, such as [[assassination]] of important figures and psychological warfare.\n\nTwo centuries after its foundation, the state declined internally under [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]], who eventually dismantled and surrendered the Alamut Castle to the [[Mongol Empire|invading Mongols]]. Much of what is known about the Nizaris are based on hostile sources.\n\n==History==\nMost [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Shia]]s outside North Africa, mostly in Persia and Syria, came to acknowledge [[Nizar ibn al-Mustansir]]'s claim to the Imamate as maintained by [[Hasan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]], and this point marks the fundamental split between Ismaili Shias. Within two generations, the [[Fatimid Empire]] would suffer several more splits and eventually implode.\n[[File:Alamut.png|thumb|300px|left|Location of several of the [[List of Ismaili castles|Ismaili castles]] in the regions of [[Alamut]] and [[Rudbar]] of Persia]]\nFollowing his expulsion from Egypt over his support for Nizar, Hassan-i Sabbah found that his co-religionists, the Ismailis, were scattered throughout Persia, with a strong presence in the northern and eastern regions, particularly in [[Daylam]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] and [[Quhistan]]. The Ismailis and other occupied peoples of Persia held shared resentment for the ruling [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s, who had divided the country's farmland into ''[[Iqta'|iqt\u0101\u2019]]'' (fiefs) and levied heavy taxes upon the citizens living therein. The Seljuk ''[[amirs]]'' (independent rulers) usually held full jurisdiction and control over the districts they administered.<ref name=\"Short History\">{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=A Short History of the Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9781558761933}}</ref>{{rp|126}} Meanwhile, Persian artisans, craftsmen and lower classes grew increasingly dissatisfied with the Seljuk policies and heavy taxes.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|126}} Hassan too, was appalled by the political and economic oppression imposed by the [[Sunni]] Seljuk ruling class on [[Shi'ite]] Muslims living across Persia.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|126}}  It was in this context that he embarked on a resistance movement against the Seljuqs, beginning with the search for a secure site from which to launch his revolt.\n\nBy 1090 AD, the Seljuk vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]] had already given orders for Hassan's arrest and therefore Hassan was living in hiding in the northern town of [[Qazvin]], approximately 60&nbsp;km from the Alamut Castle.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\">{{cite book |last=Willey |first=Peter |title=Eagle's Nest: Ismaili Castles in Iran and Syria |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

The castle had never before been captured by military means and thus Hassan planned meticulously.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}} Meanwhile, he dispatched his reliable supporters to the Alamut valley to begin settlements around the castle.\n\nIn the summer of 1090 AD, Hassan set out from Qazvin towards Alamut on a mountainous route through [[Andej]]. He remained at Andej disguised as a schoolteacher named Dehkhoda until he was certain that a number of his supporters had settled directly below the castle in the village of [[Gazorkhan]] or had gained employment at the fortress itself.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}} Still in disguise, Hassan made his way into the fortress, earning the trust and friendship of many of its soldiers. Careful not to attract the attention of the castle's [[Zaydi]] lord, Mahdi, Hassan began to attract prominent figures at Alamut to his mission. It has even been suggested that Mahdi's own deputy was a secret supporter of Hassan, waiting to demonstrate his loyalty on the day that Hassan would ultimately take the castle.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|23}}\nThe Alamut fortress was eventually captured from Mahdi in 1090 AD and therefore from Seljuk control by Hassan and his supporters without resorting to any violence.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|24}} Mahdi's life was spared, and he later received 3,000 gold dinars in compensation.\nCapturing of the Alamut Castle marks the founding of the Nizari Ismaili state.\n\nUnder the leadership of [[Hasan-i Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]] and the succeeding lords of Alamut, the strategy of covert capture was successfully replicated at strategic fortresses across Persia, Syria, and the Fertile Crescent.  The Nizari Ismaili created a state of unconnected fortresses, surrounded by huge swathes of hostile territory, and managed a unified power structure that proved more effective than either that in Fatimid Cairo, or Seljuk Bagdad, both of which suffered political instability, particularly during the transition between leaders. These periods of internal turmoil allowed the Ismaili state respite from attack, and even to have such sovereignty as to have minted their own coinage.\n{{quote box|align=right|width=26%|quote=\"They call him Shaykh-al-Hashishim.

The governor (''muhtasham'') of Quhistan was [[Nasir al-Din Abu al-Fath Abd al-Rahim ibn Abi Mansur]], and the Nizaris were under Imam [[Ala' al-Din Muhammad]].<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nAfter the death of the last Khwarezmaian ruler [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]], the destruction of the [[Nizari Ismaili state]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] became thet main Mongol objectives. In 1238, the Nizari Imam and the Abbasid caliph sent a joint diplomatic mission to the European kings [[Louis IX of France]] and [[Edward I of England]] to forge an alliance against the invading Mongols, but this was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J\u00a2zsef |last3=Studies |first3=Central European University Dept of Medieval |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |date=2001 |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn=978-963-9241-42-8 |page=32 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Daftari2000\" /> The Mongols kept putting pressure on the Nizris of [[Quhistan]] and [[Qumis (region)|Qumis]]. In 1256, Ala' al-Din was succeeded by his young son [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]] as the Nizari Imam. A year later, the main Mongol army under [[Hulagu Khan]] enter Iran via Khorasan. Numerous negotiations between the Nizari Imam and Hulagu Khan were futile. Apparently, the Nizari Imam seeked to at least keep the main Nizari strongohlds, while the Mongols demanded the full submission of the Nizaris.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nIn 19 November 1256, the Nizari Imam, whho was in the [[Maymun-Dizh]], surrendered the castle to the besieging Mongols under Hulagu Khan after a fierce conflict. [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] fell in December 1256 and [[Lambasar Castle|Lambsar]] fell in 1257, with [[Gerdkuh Castle|Gerdkuh]] remaining unconqured. In thte same year, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], the khagan of the [[Mongol Emipre]], ordered a massacre of all Nizari Ismailis of Persia. Rukn al-Din Khurshah himself, who had travelled to mainland [[Mongolia]] to meet M\u00f6ngke Khan, was killed by his personal Mongol guard.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\" />\n\nThus the centralized government of the Nizaris was disestablished, and Nizaris were either killed or abandoned their traditional strongholds. Many of them migrated to [[Afghanistan]], [[Badakhshan]], and [[Sindh]]. Little is known about the history of the Ismailis in this stage, until two centuries later, when they again began to grow as scattered communities under regional ''[[da'i]]''s in Iran, Afghanistan, Badakhshan, Syria, and India.<ref name=\"Daftari2000\">{{cite web |last1=Daftary |first1=Farhad |authorlink1=Farhad Daftary |title=The Mediaeval Ismailis of the Iranian Lands {{!}} The Institute of Ismaili Studies |url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/mediaeval-ismailis-iranian-lands |website=www.iis.ac.uk |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Faith==\n{{main|Nizari Ismailism}}\n\n===Rulers and Imams===\n{{see also|Da'i|Imamate in Nizari doctrine|List of Ismaili imams}}\n\n; Da'is who ruled at Alamut\n\n#Da'i [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] ({{lang|fa|\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0635\u0628\u0627\u062d}}) {{ltr}}(1090\u20131124)\n#Da'i [[Kiya Buzurg-Ummid]] ({{lang|fa|\u06a9\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u0632\u0631\u06af \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f}}) {{ltr}}(1124\u20131138)\n#Da'i [[Muhammad Buzurg Ummid|Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Kiy\u0101 Buzurg-Umm\u012bd]] ({{lang|fa|\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0628\u0632\u0631\u06af \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f}}) {{ltr}}(1138\u20131162)\n\n; Concealed Im\u0101ms at Alamut\n#Im\u0101m [[:tr:El-H\u00e2d\u00ee bin el-Niz\u00e2r|Al\u012b al-H\u0101d\u012b ibn Niz\u0101r]] ({{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0646\u0632\u0627\u0631}})\n#Im\u0101m [[:tr:El-M\u00f4htad\u00ee bin el-H\u00e2d\u00ee|Al-Muhtad\u012b ibn al-H\u0101d\u012b ''(Muhammad I)'']] ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062a\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u062f\u064a}})\n#Im\u0101m [[:tr:El-Kahir bin el-M\u00f4htad\u00ee bi-Kuvvet\u2019\u00fbl-L\u00e2h / bi-Ahk\u00e2m\u00ee\u2019l-L\u00e2h|Al-Q\u0101hir ibn al-Muhtad\u012b bi-Quwatull\u0101h / bi-Ahk\u0101mill\u0101h ''(Hassan I)'']] ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0642\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 / \u0628\u0623\u062d\u0643\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}})\n\n; Im\u0101ms who ruled at Alamut\n#Im\u0101m [[Hassan II (imam)|Hasan \u2018Al\u0101 Dh\u012bkr\u2018\u012bh\u012b's-Sal\u0101m]] ''(Hassan II)'' ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0630\u06a9\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645}}) {{ltr}}(1162\u20131166)\n#Im\u0101m [[Nur al-Din Muhammad II|N\u016br al-D\u012bn Muhammad]] ''(Muhammad II)'' ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f}}) {{ltr}}(1166\u20131210)\n#Im\u0101m [[Jalaluddin Hasan|Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn Hasan]] ''(Hassan III)'' ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u062d\u0633\u0646}}) {{ltr}}(1210\u20131221)\n#Im\u0101m [[\u2018Al\u0101\u2019 ad-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad III|\u2018Al\u0101 al-D\u012bn Muhammad]] ''(Muhammad III)'' ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f}}) {{ltr}}(1221\u20131255)\n#Im\u0101m [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]] ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0631\u06a9\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0647}}) {{ltr}}(1255\u20131256)\n\nIn the Levant, [[Rashid al-Din Sinan]] announced independence of [[Masyaf]] from Alamut, founding a separate state in Syria.\n\n==Military tactics==\n[[Image:Crusaderstates.jpeg|thumb|right|262px|Map of the [[crusader states]], showing the area controlled by the Assassins around [[Masyaf]], slightly above the center, in white]]\n\n===Castles===\n{{see also|List of Ismaili castles}}\nThe state had around 200 fortresses overall. The most important one was [[Alamut Castle]], the residence of the Lord. The largest castle was [[Lambasar Castle]], featuring a complex and highly efficient water storage system. The most important fortress in Syria was [[Masyaf Castle]], though the castle of [[Al-Kahf Castle|Kahf]] was probably the main residence of the Syrian Ismaili leader [[Rashid al-Din Sinan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nizari Ismaili Castles of Iran and Syria|url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=105073|publisher=[[Institute of Ismaili Studies]]|accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref> \n{{History of Tabaristan|Shi'a period}}\nThe natural geographical features of the valley surrounding Alamut largely secured the castle's defence. Positioned atop a narrow rock base approximately 180 meters above ground level, the fortress could not be taken by direct military force.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|27}} To the east, the Alamut valley is bordered by a mountainous range called [[Alamkuh]] (The Throne of Solomon) between which the [[Alamut River]] flows. The valley's western entrance is a narrow one, shielded by cliffs over 350m high. Known as the [[Shirkuh]], the gorge sits at the intersection of three rivers: the [[Taliqan]], [[Shahrud]] and Alamut River. For much of the year, the raging waters of the river made this entrance nearly inaccessible. Qazvin, the closest town to the valley by land can only be reached by an underdeveloped mule track upon which an enemy's presence could easily be detected given the dust clouds arising from their passage.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe military approach of the Nizari Ismaili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|58}} But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Ismaili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. The Alamut castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Ismailis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of [[Lambsar Castle|Lamasar]] served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Ismaili military presence took on the name ''[[dar al-hijra]]'' (place of refuge). The notion of the ''dar al-hijra'' originates from the time of the Prophet Muhammad, who fled with his supporters from intense persecution to safe haven in [[Yathrib]].<ref name=\"Secret Order\">{{cite book |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G.S. |title=The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Niz\u00e2r\u00ee Ism\u00e2'\u00eel\u00ees Against the Islamic World |year=2005 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=9780812219166}}</ref>{{rp|79}} In this way, the [[Fatimid]]s found their ''dar al-hijra'' in [[North Africa]]. Likewise during the revolt against the Seljuqs, several fortresses served as spaces of refuge for the Ismailis.\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|262px|Map of the [[Hashashins]] in the [[Near East]] and their neighbors]]\nDuring the mid-12th century the Assassins captured or acquired several fortresses in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains|Nusayriyah Mountain Range]] in coastal Syria, including [[Masyaf]], Rusafa, [[al-Kahf]], [[al-Qadmus]], [[Khawabi]], [[Sarmin]], Quliya, Ulayqa, Maniqa, [[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]] and [[Harim Mountains|Jabal al-Summaq]]. For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270\u201373 when the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] sultan [[Baibars]] annexed them. Most were dismantled afterwards, while those at Masyaf and Ulayqa were later rebuilt.<ref>Raphael, 2011, p. 106.</ref> From then on, the Ismailis maintained limited autonomy over those former strongholds as loyal subjects of the Mamluks.<ref>Daftary, 2007, p. 402.</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Qazvin - Alamout Castle3.jpg|[[Alamut Castle]], Persia\nImage:Lambesar 2.jpg|[[Lambsar Castle]], Persia\nImage:\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u062f\u062e\u0627\u06461.jpg|[[Rudkhan Castle]], Persia\n\nImage:Masyaf2.jpg|[[Masyaf Castle]], Syria\nImage:Abu Qubeis2.jpg|[[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]], Syria\nImage:Fortress of Qalat el-Mudiq.jpg|[[Qalaat al-Madiq]], Syria\n</gallery>\n\n===Assassination===\n{{main|Order of Assassins|List of assassinations by the Assassins}}\nIn pursuit of their religious and political goals, the Ismailis adopted various military strategies popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}} Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends.  In the Ismaili context, these assignments were performed by commandos called ''fid\u0101\u2019\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc}}, \"devotee\"; plural {{lang|fa|\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u0648\u0646}} ''fid\u0101\u2019iyy\u016bn'').  The assassinations were against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|61}} A single assassination was usually employed in favour of widespread bloodshed resultant from factional combat. The first instance of assassination in the effort to establish an Nizari Ismaili state in Persia is widely considered to be the murder of Seljuq vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]].<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}} Carried out by a man dressed as a [[Sufi]] whose identity remains unclear, the vizier's murder in a Seljuq court is distinctive of exactly the type of visibility for which missions of the fida\u2019is have been significantly exaggerated.<ref name=\"Eagle's Nest\"/>{{rp|29}}  While the Seljuqs and [[Crusaders]] both employed assassination as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Ismailis.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{rp|129}}\n\n[[Knives]] and [[dagger]]s were used to kill, and sometimes as a warning, a knife would be placed onto the pillow of a Sunni, who understood the message that he was marked for death.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Nizari Ismailism]]\n* [[List of assassinations by the Assassins]]\n* [[Order of Assassins]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Willey, Peter.

A larger leak was filled in with around 40 wheelbarrows of rubble in December 1910 and required refilling a year later.

In April 1917, a local official recommended that the reservoir be drained or the water level significantly lowered to avoid any risk of destabilising the dam.

In its formative years, there were several incidents of the reservoir suffering damage. Two minor leaks in the embankments were fixed during the first decade. A larger leak was filled in with around 40 wheelbarrows of rubble in December 1910 and required refilling a year later. Settling issues caused further issues in the 1910s and rerouting work was undertaken when it was discovered that the top of the core in the embankments was only {{convert|2|ft|spell=in}} above the water level. In April 1917, a local official recommended that the reservoir be drained or the water level significantly lowered to avoid any risk of destabilising the dam.
