The term is introduced by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] who says he saw \"a watcher, a holy one come down (singular verb) from [[heaven]].\" He describes how in his dream the watcher says that Nebuchadnezzar will eat grass and be mad and that this punishment is \"by the decree of the watchers, the demand by the word of the holy ones\"&nbsp;... \"the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men.\" After hearing the king's dream Daniel considers for an hour and then responds:\n\n{{quote|And because the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven periods of time pass over him,' this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king, that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.<!-- Quotation marks in ESV source, albeit in other verses --><ref>{{bibleverse||Daniel|4:23-25|ESV}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Lutheran]] [[Protestant reformer]] [[List of Protestant Reformers#W|Johann Wigand]] viewed the ''watcher'' in Nebuchadnezzar's dream as either God himself, or the [[Son of God]].

The [[Second Book of Enoch]] addresses the watchers (Gk. ''egr\u1e17goroi'') who are in fifth heaven where the fall took place. The [[3 Enoch|Third Book of Enoch]] gives attention to the unfallen watchers.<ref name=\"Charlesworth,130\" />\n\nThe use of the term \"watchers\" is common in the [[Book of Enoch]]. The ''Book of the Watchers'' (1 Enoch 6\u201336) occurs in the Aramaic fragments with the phrase ''irin we-qadishin'', \"Watchers and Holy Ones\", a reference to Aramaic Daniel.<ref>{{harvnb|Boccaccini|2005|p=157}}: \"Exceedingly common in 1 Enoch is the term 'watchers,' which gives its name to an entire book of Enoch (1 En 6\u201336).

The term ''irin'' is primarily applied to disobedient watchers who numbered a total of 200, and of whom their leaders are named, but equally Aramaic ''iri'' (\"watcher\" singular) is also applied to the obedient archangels who chain them, such as Raphael (1 Enoch 22:6).\n\n=== Book of Enoch ===\n{{See|Fallen angel}}\n\nIn the [[Book of Enoch]], the watchers ([[Aramaic]] \u05e2\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05df, ''iyrin'') are angels dispatched to Earth to watch over the humans. They soon begin to lust for human women and, at the prodding of their leader [[Samyaza]], defect en masse to illicitly instruct humanity and procreate among them. The offspring of these unions are the [[Nephilim]], savage giants who pillage the earth and endanger humanity.\n\nSamyaza and his associates further taught their human charges arts and technologies such as weaponry, cosmetics, mirrors, [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], and other techniques that would otherwise be discovered gradually over time by humans, not foisted upon them all at once. Eventually God allows a [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]] to rid the earth of the Nephilim, but first sends [[Uriel]] to warn [[Noah]] so as not to eradicate the human race. The watchers are bound \"in the valleys of the Earth\" until [[Judgment Day]] ([[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] verse 6 says, \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.\").\n\nThe chiefs of tens, listed in the Book of Enoch, are as follows:\n\n{{quote|7. And these are the names of their leaders: [[Samyaza|S\u00eam\u00eeaz\u00e2z]], their leader, [[Arakiel|Ar\u00e2k\u00eeba]], R\u00e2m\u00ea\u00eal, [[Kokabiel|K\u00f4kab\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Tamiel|T\u00e2m\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Ramiel|R\u00e2m\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Daniel (angel)|D\u00e2n\u00eal]], [[Chazaqiel|\u00caz\u00eaq\u00ea\u00eal]], [[Baraqiel|Bar\u00e2q\u00eej\u00e2l]], [[Azazel|As\u00e2\u00eal]], [[Armaros|Arm\u00e2r\u00f4s]], [[Batariel|Bat\u00e2r\u00eal]], [[Ananiel|An\u00e2n\u00eal]], [[Zaqiel|Zaq\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Shamsiel|Sams\u00e2p\u00ea\u00eal]], [[Satariel|Satar\u00eal]], [[Turiel|T\u00fbr\u00eal]], [[Yomiel|J\u00f4mj\u00e2\u00eal]], [[Sariel|Sari\u00eal]]. 8.

Charles]] translation, ''The Book of the Watchers'', Chapter VI.}}\n\nThe book of Enoch also lists leaders of the 200 fallen angels who married and commenced in unnatural union with human women, and who taught forbidden knowledge. Some are also listed in [[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh|Book of Raziel (Sefer Raziel HaMalakh)]], the [[Zohar]], and [[Jubilees]].\n\n* [[Araqiel]] (also [[Arakiel]], Araqael, Araciel, Arqael, Sarquael, Arkiel, Arkas) taught humans the signs of the earth. However, in the ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'', Araqiel is referred to not as a [[fallen angel]], or watcher, but as one of the five [[angels]] who lead the souls of humans to judgment, the other four being [[Ramiel]], [[Uriel]], [[Samael]], and [[Azazel]].\n* [[Armaros]] (also Amaros) in Enoch I taught humanity the resolving of enchantments.\n* [[Azazel]] taught humans to make knives, swords, shields, and how to devise ornaments and cosmetics.\n* [[Gadreel]] (or Gader'el) taught the art of cosmetics, the use of weapons and killing blows.\n* [[Baraqel]] (Baraqiel) taught [[astrology]].\n* [[Bezaliel]] mentioned in Enoch I, left out of most translations because of damaged manuscripts and problematic [[Textual criticism|transmission of the text]].\n* [[Chazaqiel]] (sometimes [[Ezeqeel]] or Cambriel) taught humans the signs of the [[cloud]]s ([[meteorology]]).\n* [[Kokabiel]] (also Kakabel, Kochbiel, Kokbiel, Kabaiel, and Kochab), In the ''Book of Raziel'' he is a high-ranking, holy angel. In Enoch I, he is a fallen watcher, resident of the [[Underworld|nether realms]], and commands 365,000 surrogate spirits to do his bidding. Among other duties, he instructs his fellows in astrology.\n* [[Penemue]] \"taught mankind the art of writing with ink and paper,\" and taught \"the children of men the bitter and the sweet and the secrets of wisdom.\" (I Enoch 69.8)\n* [[Sariel (angel)|Sariel]] (also [[Suriel]]) taught humankind about the courses of the [[moon]] (at one time regarded as forbidden knowledge).\n* [[Samyaza]] (also Shemyazaz, Shamazya, Semiaza, Shemhazi, Semyaza and Amezyarak) is one of the leaders of the fall from heaven in ''Vocabulaire de l' Angelologie''.\n* [[Shamsiel]], once a guardian of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] as stated in the ''Zohar'', served as one of the two chief aides to the [[archangel]] [[Uriel]] (the other aide being Hasdiel) when [[Uriel]] bore his standard into battle, and is the head of 365 legions of angels and also crowns [[prayer]]s, accompanying them to the 5th [[heaven]]. In ''Jubilees'', he is referred to as one of the Watchers. He is a fallen angel who teaches the signs of the [[sun]].\n* {{anchor|Five Satans}}Yeqon or Jeqon ({{lang-he|\u05d9\u05b8\u05e7\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd|translit=Yaqum|lit=he shall rise}}) was the ringleader who first tempted the other Watchers into having sexual relations with humans.<ref name=\"Bane 2012\">{{cite book |last=Bane |first=Theresa |title=Encyclopedia of Demons in World Religions and Cultures |publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-7864-8894-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njDRfG6YVb8C&pg=PA333 |access-date=2018-11-27 |page=333}}</ref> His accomplices were [[Asbeel]], Gadreel, Penemue, and [[Kasdaye]] (or Kasadya), who were all identified as individual \"[[satan]]s\".\n\nThe account of the [[Book of Enoch]] has been associated with the passage in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 6:1-4, which speaks of [[Sons of God]] instead of Watchers:\n\n{{quote|When men began to multiply on earth and daughters were born to them, the ''sons of God'' saw how beautiful the daughters of man were, and so they took for their wives as many of them as they chose.

The term is introduced by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] who says he saw \"a watcher, a holy one come down (singular verb) from [[heaven]].\" He describes how in his dream the watcher says that Nebuchadnezzar will eat grass and be mad and that this punishment is \"by the decree of the watchers, the demand by the word of the holy ones\"&nbsp;... \"the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men.\" After hearing the king's dream Daniel considers for an hour and then responds:\n\n{{quote|And because the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven periods of time pass over him,' this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king, that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.<!-- Quotation marks in ESV source, albeit in other verses --><ref>{{bibleverse||Daniel|4:23-25|ESV}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Lutheran]] [[Protestant reformer]] [[List of Protestant Reformers#W|Johann Wigand]] viewed the ''watcher'' in Nebuchadnezzar's dream as either God himself, or the [[Son of God]].

The [[Second Book of Enoch]] addresses the watchers (Gk. ''egr\u1e17goroi'') who are in fifth heaven where the fall took place. The [[3 Enoch|Third Book of Enoch]] gives attention to the unfallen watchers.<ref name=\"Charlesworth,130\" />\n\nThe use of the term \"watchers\" is common in the [[Book of Enoch]]. The ''Book of the Watchers'' (1 Enoch 6\u201336) occurs in the Aramaic fragments with the phrase ''irin we-qadishin'', \"Watchers and Holy Ones\", a reference to Aramaic Daniel.<ref>{{harvnb|Boccaccini|2005|p=157}}: \"Exceedingly common in 1 Enoch is the term 'watchers,' which gives its name to an entire book of Enoch (1 En 6\u201336).

The term ''irin'' is primarily applied to disobedient watchers who numbered a total of 200, and of whom their leaders are named, but equally Aramaic ''iri'' (\"watcher\" singular) is also applied to the obedient archangels who chain them, such as Raphael (1 Enoch 22:6).\n\n=== Book of Enoch ===\n{{See|Fallen angel}}\n\nIn the [[Book of Enoch]], the watchers ([[Aramaic]] \u05e2\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05df, ''iyrin'') are angels dispatched to Earth to watch over the humans. They soon begin to lust for human women and, at the prodding of their leader [[Samyaza]], defect en masse to illicitly instruct humanity and procreate among them. The offspring of these unions are the [[Nephilim]], savage giants who pillage the earth and endanger humanity.\n\nSamyaza and his associates further taught their human charges arts and technologies such as weaponry, cosmetics, mirrors, [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], and other techniques that would otherwise be discovered gradually over time by humans, not foisted upon them all at once. Eventually God allows a [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]] to rid the earth of the Nephilim, but first sends [[Uriel]] to warn [[Noah]] so as not to eradicate the human race. The watchers are bound \"in the valleys of the Earth\" until [[Judgment Day]] ([[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] verse 6 says, \"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.\").\n\nThe chiefs of tens, listed in the Book of Enoch, are as follows:\n\n{{quote|7. And these are the names of their leaders: [[Samyaza|S\u00eam\u00eeaz\u00e2z]], their leader, [[Arakiel|Ar\u00e2k\u00eeba]], R\u00e2m\u00ea\u00eal, [[Kokabiel|K\u00f4kab\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Tamiel|T\u00e2m\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Ramiel|R\u00e2m\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Daniel (angel)|D\u00e2n\u00eal]], [[Chazaqiel|\u00caz\u00eaq\u00ea\u00eal]], [[Baraqiel|Bar\u00e2q\u00eej\u00e2l]], [[Azazel|As\u00e2\u00eal]], [[Armaros|Arm\u00e2r\u00f4s]], [[Batariel|Bat\u00e2r\u00eal]], [[Ananiel|An\u00e2n\u00eal]], [[Zaqiel|Zaq\u00ee\u00eal]], [[Shamsiel|Sams\u00e2p\u00ea\u00eal]], [[Satariel|Satar\u00eal]], [[Turiel|T\u00fbr\u00eal]], [[Yomiel|J\u00f4mj\u00e2\u00eal]], [[Sariel|Sari\u00eal]]. 8. These are their chiefs of tens.|[[R. H. Charles]] translation, ''The Book of the Watchers'', Chapter VI.}}\n\nThe book of Enoch also lists leaders of the 200 fallen angels who married and commenced in unnatural union with human women, and who taught forbidden knowledge. Some are also listed in [[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh|Book of Raziel (Sefer Raziel HaMalakh)]], the [[Zohar]], and [[Jubilees]].\n\n* [[Araqiel]] (also [[Arakiel]], Araqael, Araciel, Arqael, Sarquael, Arkiel, Arkas) taught humans the signs of the earth. However, in the ''[[Sibylline Oracles]]'', Araqiel is referred to not as a [[fallen angel]], or watcher, but as one of the five [[angels]] who lead the souls of humans to judgment, the other four being [[Ramiel]], [[Uriel]], [[Samael]], and [[Azazel]].\n* [[Armaros]] (also Amaros) in Enoch I taught humanity the resolving of enchantments.\n* [[Azazel]] taught humans to make knives, swords, shields, and how to devise ornaments and cosmetics.\n* [[Gadreel]] (or Gader'el) taught the art of cosmetics, the use of weapons and killing blows.\n* [[Baraqel]] (Baraqiel) taught [[astrology]].\n* [[Bezaliel]] mentioned in Enoch I, left out of most translations because of damaged manuscripts and problematic [[Textual criticism|transmission of the text]].\n* [[Chazaqiel]] (sometimes [[Ezeqeel]] or Cambriel) taught humans the signs of the [[cloud]]s ([[meteorology]]).\n* [[Kokabiel]] (also Kakabel, Kochbiel, Kokbiel, Kabaiel, and Kochab), In the ''Book of Raziel'' he is a high-ranking, holy angel. In Enoch I, he is a fallen watcher, resident of the [[Underworld|nether realms]], and commands 365,000 surrogate spirits to do his bidding. Among other duties, he instructs his fellows in astrology.\n* [[Penemue]] \"taught mankind the art of writing with ink and paper,\" and taught \"the children of men the bitter and the sweet and the secrets of wisdom.\" (I Enoch 69.8)\n* [[Sariel (angel)|Sariel]] (also [[Suriel]]) taught humankind about the courses of the [[moon]] (at one time regarded as forbidden knowledge).\n* [[Samyaza]] (also Shemyazaz, Shamazya, Semiaza, Shemhazi, Semyaza and Amezyarak) is one of the leaders of the fall from heaven in ''Vocabulaire de l' Angelologie''.\n* [[Shamsiel]], once a guardian of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] as stated in the ''Zohar'', served as one of the two chief aides to the [[archangel]] [[Uriel]] (the other aide being Hasdiel) when [[Uriel]] bore his standard into battle, and is the head of 365 legions of angels and also crowns [[prayer]]s, accompanying them to the 5th [[heaven]]. In ''Jubilees'', he is referred to as one of the Watchers. He is a fallen angel who teaches the signs of the [[sun]].\n* {{anchor|Five Satans}}Yeqon or Jeqon ({{lang-he|\u05d9\u05b8\u05e7\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd|translit=Yaqum|lit=he shall rise}}) was the ringleader who first tempted the other Watchers into having sexual relations with humans.<ref name=\"Bane 2012\">{{cite book |last=Bane |first=Theresa |title=Encyclopedia of Demons in World Religions and Cultures |publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-7864-8894-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njDRfG6YVb8C&pg=PA333 |access-date=2018-11-27 |page=333}}</ref> His accomplices were [[Asbeel]], Gadreel, Penemue, and [[Kasdaye]] (or Kasadya), who were all identified as individual \"[[satan]]s\".\n\nThe account of the [[Book of Enoch]] has been associated with the passage in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 6:1-4, which speaks of [[Sons of God]] instead of Watchers:\n\n{{quote|When men began to multiply on earth and daughters were born to them, the ''sons of God'' saw how beautiful the daughters of man were, and so they took for their wives as many of them as they chose.
