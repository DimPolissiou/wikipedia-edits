{"title_page": "List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\nSeveral fields of human cultural and scientific development are not included in the list of [[Nobel Prize]]s, because they are either not among the prizes established as part of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s will nor, in the case of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], sponsored afterwards by the [[Nobel Foundation]]. While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold. The distinguished prizes not awarded by the Nobel Foundation include (with the year when a prize was first awarded in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Applied mathematics==== \n* [[John von Neumann Lecture|John von Neumann Lecture Prize]] (1960)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cs.brown.edu/events/talks/knuth.2/|title=A John von Neumann Lecture|website=brown.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/daub.htm|title=Ingrid Daubechies|website=agnesscott.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wigner.html|title=Eugene Paul Wigner|website=mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk}}</ref>\n* [[Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize]] (2006)<sup>1</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/about/honors/international_awards/gauss-prize.html|title=Dr. Kiyoshi Ito receives Gauss Prize|website=kyoto-u.ac.jp}}</ref><ref name=mathprize>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271962747_Nobel_Prize_Not_in_Mathematics_An_Explanation|title=Nobel Prize Not in Mathematics : An Explanation|website=researchgate.net|author=Ganesh C.

The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/><ref name=shanghairanking2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey-2017/awards.html|title=ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref name=shanghairanking2017/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.

His great-grandfather, in the late 1960s, was the first NBA mascot. Many other variations/family members of the bull where passed on to different ones,luding Benny's chubby predecessor (or father) in the 1990s. A slim, dunking bull mascot named \"Da Bull\" was added at the time. According to an article on the Bulls' website: \"Da Bull is Benny the Bull's cousin, and he made his first appearance at a Bulls game during the 1995\u201396 season.

Later members, including [[Ceratopsidae|ceratopsids]] like ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'', became very large [[quadruped]]s and developed elaborate facial [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from [[predation|predators]], they may also have been used for [[display (zoology)|display]], [[thermoregulation]], the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1&nbsp;meter (3&nbsp;ft) and 23&nbsp;kilograms (50&nbsp;lb) to over 9&nbsp;meters (30&nbsp;ft) and 9,100&nbsp;kg (20,100&nbsp;lb).\n\n''Triceratops'' is by far the best-known ceratopsian to the general public. It is traditional for ceratopsian [[genus]] names to end in \"''-ceratops''\", although this is not always the case. One of the first named genera was ''[[Ceratops]]'' itself, which lent its name to the group, although it is considered a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' today as its fossil remains have no distinguishing characteristics that are not also found in other ceratopsians.<ref name=\"dodson1996\">Dodson, P. 1996.

On the tip of a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the [[predentary]] bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter.<ref>Holtz, Thomas R., Jr.; Rey, Luis V. (2007).

Also, the [[jugal]] bones below the eye are prominent, flaring out sideways to make the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the [[parietal bone|parietal]] and [[squamosal]] bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.<ref name=\"Youdod04\">You H. & Dodson, P. 2004.

Utah Geological Survey, 554 pp. {{ISBN|1-55791-634-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55791-634-1}}</ref> Soon after, Cope named two more dinosaurs that would eventually come to be recognized as ceratopsids: ''[[Polyonax]]'' and ''[[Monoclonius]]''. ''Monoclonius'' was notable for the number of disassociated remains found, including the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and frills. Several ''Monoclonius'' fossils were found by Cope, assisted by [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg]], in summer 1876 near the [[Judith River]] in [[Chouteau County]], Montana. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The frill bone was interpreted as a part of the breastbone.<ref>E.D. Cope. 1876. \"Descriptions of some vertebrate remains from the Fort Union Beds of Montana\". ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia'' '''28''': 248-261</ref>\n\nIn 1888 and 1889, [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, ''[[Ceratops]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]''. In 1890 Marsh classified them together in the family [[Ceratopsidae]] and the order Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realize that ''Triceratops'', ''Monoclonius'', and ''Agathaumas'' all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named [[Agathaumidae]] in 1891. Cope redescribed ''Monoclonius'' as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes, and a large [[Neck frill|frill]].\n\n==Classification==\nCeratopsia was coined by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1890 to include dinosaurs possessing certain characteristic features, including horns, a [[rostral bone]], teeth with two [[Dental anatomy#Crown and root|roots]], fused neck [[vertebra]]e, and a forward-oriented [[pubis (bone)|pubis]]. Marsh considered the group distinct enough to warrant its own suborder within Ornithischia.<ref name=\"marsh1890\">{{cite journal | last1 = Marsh | first1 = O.C. | year = 1890 | title = Additional characters of the Ceratopsidae, with notice of new Cretaceous dinosaurs | url = https://zenodo.org/record/2513377| journal = American Journal of Science | volume = 39 | issue = 233| pages = 418\u2013429 | doi = 10.2475/ajs.s3-39.233.418 | bibcode = 1890AmJS...39..418M }}</ref> The name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2''/''k\u00e9ras'' meaning 'horn' and ''\u1f44\u03c8\u1fd0\u03c2''/''\u00f3psis'' meaning 'appearance, view' and by extension 'face'.

There have been several [[cladistic]] studies performed on basal ceratopsians since 2000. None have used every taxon listed above and many of the differences between the studies are still unresolved.\n\nIn [[clade]]-based [[phylogenetic taxonomy]], Ceratopsia is often defined to include all [[marginocephalia]]ns more closely related to ''Triceratops'' than to ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"sereno1998\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sereno | first1 = P.C. | year = 1998 | title = A rationale for phylogenetic definitions, with applications to the higher-level taxonomy of Dinosauria | url = | journal = Neues Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Geologie und Pal\u00e4ontologie, Abhandlungen | volume = 210 | issue = | pages = 41\u201383 | doi = 10.1127/njgpa/210/1998/41 }}</ref> Under this definition, the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] known ceratopsians are ''[[Yinlong]]'', from the Late [[Jurassic]] Period, along with ''[[Chaoyangsaurus]]'' and the family [[Psittacosauridae]], from the Early [[Cretaceous]] Period, all of which were discovered in northern [[China]] or [[Mongolia]]. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.\n\nThe [[clade]] '''Neoceratopsia''' includes all ceratopsians more [[Synapomorphy|derived]] than psittacosaurids. Another subset of neoceratopsians is called '''Coronosauria''', which currently includes all ceratopsians more derived than ''[[Auroraceratops]]''. Coronosaurs show the first development of the neck frill and the fusion of the first several neck [[vertebra]]e to support the increasingly heavy head. Within Coronosauria, three groups are generally recognized, although the membership of these groups varies somewhat from study to study and some animals may not fit in any of them. One group can be called '''[[Protoceratopsidae]]''' and includes ''[[Protoceratops]]'' and its closest relatives, all Asian. Another group, '''[[Leptoceratopsidae]]''', includes mostly [[North America]]n animals that are more closely related to ''[[Leptoceratops]]''. The '''Ceratopsoidea''' includes animals like ''[[Zuniceratops]]'', which are more closely related to the family '''[[Ceratopsidae]]'''. This last family includes ''Triceratops'' and all the large North American ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies '''Centrosaurinae''' and '''Ceratopsinae''' (also known as '''Chasmosaurinae''').\n\n====Farke phylogeny====\n[[Andrew Farke]] and his colleagues in 2014 published a description of a new neoceratopsian, ''[[Aquilops americanus]]'', through the peer-reviewed science journal [[PLOS ONE]]. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that ''Aquilops'' was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large [[ghost lineage]] with ''Aquilops''.<ref name=\"farkeetal2014\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0112055| title = A Ceratopsian Dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of Western North America, and the Biogeography of Neoceratopsia| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 12| pages = e112055| year = 2014| last1 = Farke | first1 = A.

Later members, including [[Ceratopsidae|ceratopsids]] like ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'', became very large [[quadruped]]s and developed elaborate facial [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from [[predation|predators]], they may also have been used for [[display (zoology)|display]], [[thermoregulation]], the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1&nbsp;meter (3&nbsp;ft) and 23&nbsp;kilograms (50&nbsp;lb) to over 9&nbsp;meters (30&nbsp;ft) and 9,100&nbsp;kg (20,100&nbsp;lb).\n\n''Triceratops'' is by far the best-known ceratopsian to the general public. It is traditional for ceratopsian [[genus]] names to end in \"''-ceratops''\", although this is not always the case. One of the first named genera was ''[[Ceratops]]'' itself, which lent its name to the group, although it is considered a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' today as its fossil remains have no distinguishing characteristics that are not also found in other ceratopsians.<ref name=\"dodson1996\">Dodson, P. 1996.

On the tip of a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians.

Hayden]]. Teeth discovered during an 1855 expedition to [[Montana]] were first assigned to [[hadrosaurid]]s and included within the genus ''[[Trachodon]]''. It was not until the early 20th century that some of these were recognized as ceratopsian teeth.<ref name=HML07>Hatcher, J.B., Marsh, O.C. and Lull, R.S. (1907). ''The Ceratopsia''.

He alerted [[paleontologist]] [[Edward Drinker Cope]], who led a dig to recover the partial skeleton. Cope recognized the remains as a dinosaur, but noted that even though the fossil lacked a skull, it was different from any type of dinosaur then known. He named the new species ''[[Agathaumas|Agathaumas sylvestris]]'', meaning \"marvellous forest-dweller\".<ref name=gillette1999>Gillette, D.D. (1999). ''Vertebrate Paleontology In Utah''. Utah Geological Survey, 554 pp. {{ISBN|1-55791-634-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55791-634-1}}</ref> Soon after, Cope named two more dinosaurs that would eventually come to be recognized as ceratopsids: ''[[Polyonax]]'' and ''[[Monoclonius]]''. ''Monoclonius'' was notable for the number of disassociated remains found, including the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and frills. Several ''Monoclonius'' fossils were found by Cope, assisted by [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg]], in summer 1876 near the [[Judith River]] in [[Chouteau County]], Montana. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The frill bone was interpreted as a part of the breastbone.<ref>E.D. Cope. 1876. \"Descriptions of some vertebrate remains from the Fort Union Beds of Montana\". ''Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia'' '''28''': 248-261</ref>\n\nIn 1888 and 1889, [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, ''[[Ceratops]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]''. In 1890 Marsh classified them together in the family [[Ceratopsidae]] and the order Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realize that ''Triceratops'', ''Monoclonius'', and ''Agathaumas'' all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named [[Agathaumidae]] in 1891. Cope redescribed ''Monoclonius'' as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes, and a large [[Neck frill|frill]].\n\n==Classification==\nCeratopsia was coined by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1890 to include dinosaurs possessing certain characteristic features, including horns, a [[rostral bone]], teeth with two [[Dental anatomy#Crown and root|roots]], fused neck [[vertebra]]e, and a forward-oriented [[pubis (bone)|pubis]].

The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.\n\nThe [[clade]] '''Neoceratopsia''' includes all ceratopsians more [[Synapomorphy|derived]] than psittacosaurids. Another subset of neoceratopsians is called '''Coronosauria''', which currently includes all ceratopsians more derived than ''[[Auroraceratops]]''. Coronosaurs show the first development of the neck frill and the fusion of the first several neck [[vertebra]]e to support the increasingly heavy head. Within Coronosauria, three groups are generally recognized, although the membership of these groups varies somewhat from study to study and some animals may not fit in any of them. One group can be called '''[[Protoceratopsidae]]''' and includes ''[[Protoceratops]]'' and its closest relatives, all Asian. Another group, '''[[Leptoceratopsidae]]''', includes mostly [[North America]]n animals that are more closely related to ''[[Leptoceratops]]''. The '''Ceratopsoidea''' includes animals like ''[[Zuniceratops]]'', which are more closely related to the family '''[[Ceratopsidae]]'''. This last family includes ''Triceratops'' and all the large North American ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies '''Centrosaurinae''' and '''Ceratopsinae''' (also known as '''Chasmosaurinae''').\n\n====Farke phylogeny====\n[[Andrew Farke]] and his colleagues in 2014 published a description of a new neoceratopsian, ''[[Aquilops americanus]]'', through the peer-reviewed science journal [[PLOS ONE]]. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that ''Aquilops'' was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large [[ghost lineage]] with ''Aquilops''.<ref name=\"farkeetal2014\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0112055| title = A Ceratopsian Dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of Western North America, and the Biogeography of Neoceratopsia| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 12| pages = e112055| year = 2014| last1 = Farke | first1 = A.

Protoceratopsidae is considered to be the sister group of Ceratopsoidea. The fragmentary ''Asiaceratops'' was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid, most likely due to the amount of missing information. Removal of ''Asiaceratops'' stabilizes the entire cladogram.\n\nMakovicky's latest analysis includes IVPP V12722 (\"Xuanhuasaurus\"), a Late Jurassic ceratopsian from China that, at the time, was awaiting publication, but has since been published as ''[[Xuanhuaceratops]]''. ''Kulceratops'' and ''Turanoceratops'' are considered ''nomina dubia'' in this study. Makovicky believes ''Lamaceratops'', ''Magnirostris'', and ''Platyceratops'' to be [[junior synonym]]s of ''Bagaceratops'', and ''Bainoceratops'' to be synonymous with ''Protoceratops''.\n\n====You/Dodson Phylogeny====\n\n[[You Hailu]] of Beijing's [[Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences]], was a co-author with Xu and Makovicky in 2002 but, in 2003, he and [[Peter Dodson]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] published a separate analysis.<ref name = \"Youdod03\">{{cite journal | last1 = You | first1 = H. | last2 = Dodson | first2 = P. | year = 2003 | title = Redescription of neoceratopsian dinosaur ''Archaeoceratops'' and early evolution of Neoceratopsia | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 261\u2013272 }}</ref> The two presented this analysis again in 2004.<ref name=\"Youdod04\"/> In 2005, You and three others, including Dodson, published on ''Auroraceratops'' and inserted this new dinosaur into their phylogeny.<ref>You H., Li D., Lamanna, M.C., & Dodson, P. 2005.

Plant 4 is adjacent to [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]], formerly [[Carswell Air Force Base]].\n\n== Overview ==\nAir Force Plant 4 is one of the largest employers in the area with a staff of approximately 17,000 people. Air Force Plant 4 is located within the Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area which includes Johnson, Parker and Tarrant Counties. The area is characterized as a highly urbanized area with a diverse economic base concentrated in the manufacturing, service and retail industries. With a large number of defense industries and their associated supply and service businesses, the community has been greatly affected by the recent reduction in defense expenditures.<ref name=\"dallasnews\" />\n\n== History ==\nPlant 4's origins begin in May 1940 when the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce was trying to convince aircraft manufacturers to build an aircraft assembly plant in the Fort Worth area to support the massive expansion of the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]].\n\n[[Fleet Aircraft|Fleet]] and [[Consolidated Aircraft]], wanting to build in the area, suggested to the Air Corps that they jointly build an airfield adjacent to the heavy bomber plant they wanted to build in Fort Worth.  It was suggested that the Air Corps would benefit by having a joint facility.   Local officials promised to spend money to build an airport on the land next to the plant and lease it to the Air Corps.    After some objections to this, another suggestion to deed the Air Corps the land was made was accepted, and on 16 June 1941, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] approved $1.75 million to construct a military airfield ([[Fort Worth Army Airfield]]) next to the Consolidated manufacturing plant.<ref name=\"WWII\">Pate and Granger (2013), Arsenal of defense: Fort Worth's Military legacy, Texas State Historical Assn. {{ISBN|1625110006}}</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe [[B-24 Liberator]] was first proposed to the Air Corps in 1938, and with the start of [[World War II]] in Europe, the French Government placed an order for 60 aircraft, sight unseen.  In 1940, Britain ordered 164. These large foreign orders were placed well before the US military placed similar-sized orders, and played a large role in getting the B-24 project going.<ref name=\"B24\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/b24_8.html Baugher, 1999, The B-24 Production Pool]</ref>\n\nIn order to meet the projected demand for the B-24, in early 1941 the government established the Liberator Production Pool Program. Under this program, Consolidated would produce Liberators at the new plant in Fort Worth to supplement the B-24 production in its main San Diego plant.  Sub-assemblies and components of B-24Ds would first be sent to Fort Worth and assembled from smaller plants until Fort Worth could produce the complete aircraft.   Three designations of the Liberator, B-24D, B-24E, and B-24G would be flown to Fort Worth from Consolidated production lines in San Diego, Willow Run, Michigan and North American Aircraft in Dallas.    At Fort Worth, the aircraft would be processed through what was called a \"modification center\" where the aircraft would be updated with the latest modifications before being turned over to the Air Force and flown out from the Fort Worth Army Airfield, which it shared a common airfield with.  Over 3,000 B-24 aircraft were manufactured,  assembled and modified during the war.<ref name=\"B24\" />\n\nIn February 1943, the Army directed Consolidated to shift its production of the [[B-32 Dominator]] very heavy bomber from San Diego to Fort Worth, to streamline [[PBY Catalina]] production in San Diego for the Navy.   The B-32 program, however, was beset with technical problems and by the end of December 1944, only five aircraft had been delivered. In comparison, the [[B-29 Superfortress]] had been in combat for nearly six months.   Before the program's termination in September 1945, only 124 B-32s were produced in Fort Worth.<ref>[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/b32.html Baugher, 2009, Consolidated B-32 Dominator]</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/afp-4.htm\n|title=Air Force Plant 4 Fort Worth, TX\n|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Cold War ===\nIn 1942, Consolidated decided to manufacture its very long range bomber, the X[[B-36 Peacemaker]], in Fort Worth. Although the USAAF approved this plan, it caused a delay of several months in the XB-36 project; since all the drawings, the mockup, the engineers, and the tooling had to be moved from San Diego to Texas. Unfortunately, progress on the XB-36 was still slow, and by the middle of 1944, B-29s were attacking Japan regularly from bases in the [[Mariana Islands]]. Although the B-36 project would still continue, it would now do so with a lower priority. Following the surrender of Germany and the end of the war in Europe, aircraft production contracts were drastically cut back. However, the contract for the B-36 was untouched. The enormous losses suffered in seizing island bases in the Pacific convinced the USAAF that there was still a definite need for a very long-range bomber.<ref name=\"B36\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/b36.html Baugher, 2000, Convair B-36 Peacemaker]</ref>\n\nThe first XB-36 (42-13570) was rolled out of the Fort Worth factory on 8 September 1945, and took off from Fort Worth on its maiden flight on 8 August 1946.

After years of development, a medium jet bomber [[B-58 Hustler|Convair's XB-58]], was accepted by the Air Force in December 1955 for thirteen aircraft, which would be built at Plant 4 in Fort Worth.

The PNG working group designed the format for transferring images on the [[Internet]], not for [[professional]]-quality print graphics, and therefore it does not support non-RGB [[color space]]s such as [[CMYK color model|CMYK]].

There were also other problems with the GIF format that made a replacement desirable, notably its limit of 256 [[color]]s at a time when computers able to display far more than 256 colors were becoming common.\n\nA January 1995 precursory discussion thread, on the [[usenet newsgroup]] \"comp.graphics\" with the subject ''Thoughts on a GIF-replacement file format'', had many propositions, which would later be part of the PNG file format. In this thread, Oliver Fromme, author of the popular [[DOS]] [[JPEG]] viewer [[QPEG]], proposed the PING name, eventually becoming PNG, a [[recursive acronym]] meaning ''[[Recursive acronym|PING is not GIF]]'', and also the PNG extension.<ref name=\"fromme\">{{cite web|author=TBH |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.graphics/msg/1131d852358a7578 |title=Thoughts on a GIF-replacement file format |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=6 January 1995 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\nAlthough GIF allows for [[computer animation|animation]], it was decided that PNG should be a single-image format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2083#page-39|title=PNG standard, section 8.4|quote=PNG itself is strictly a single-image format.

Such a format will be considered a separate file format}}</ref>  In 2001, the developers of PNG published the [[Multiple-image Network Graphics]] (MNG) format, with support for animation.  MNG achieved moderate application support, but not enough among mainstream web browsers and no usage among web site designers or publishers.  In 2008, certain Mozilla developers published the [[APNG|Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG)]] format with similar goals. APNG is a format that is natively supported by Gecko- and Presto-based web browsers and is also commonly used for thumbnails on Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] system (using the normal PNG file extension), and as of 2017, usage of [[APNG]] remains minimal despite being supported by all major browsers but Microsoft Edge.\n\n* 1 October 1996: Version 1.0 of the PNG specification was released, and later appeared as [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 2083.

The CRC is a network-byte-order [[Computation of cyclic redundancy checks|CRC-32]] computed over the chunk type and chunk data, but not the length.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 8em\"  | Length\n! style=\"width: 8em\"  | Chunk type\n! style=\"width: 16em\" | Chunk data\n! style=\"width: 8em\"  | CRC\n|-\n| 4 bytes\n| 4 bytes\n| ''Length'' bytes\n| 4 bytes\n|}\n\nChunk types are given a four-letter [[Case sensitivity|case sensitive]] ASCII type/name; compare [[FourCC]]. The case of the different letters in the name (bit 5 of the numeric value of the character) is a [[bit field]] that provides the [[Codec|decoder]] with some information on the nature of chunks it does not recognize.\n\nThe case of the first letter indicates whether the chunk is critical or not. If the first letter is uppercase, the chunk is critical; if not, the chunk is ancillary.  Critical chunks contain information that is necessary to read the file. If a decoder encounters a critical chunk it does not recognize, it must abort reading the file or supply the user with an appropriate warning.\n\nThe case of the second letter indicates whether the chunk is \"public\" (either in the specification or the registry of special-purpose public chunks) or \"private\" (not standardised). Uppercase is public and lowercase is private. This ensures that public and private chunk names can never conflict with each other (although two private chunk names could conflict).\n\nThe third letter must be uppercase to conform to the PNG specification. It is reserved for future expansion. Decoders should treat a chunk with a lower case third letter the same as any other unrecognised chunk.\n\nThe case of the fourth letter indicates whether the chunk is safe to copy by editors that do not recognize it. If lowercase, the chunk may be safely copied regardless of the extent of modifications to the file. If uppercase, it may only be copied if the modifications have not touched any critical chunks.\n\n==== Critical chunks ====\nA decoder must be able to interpret critical chunks to read and render a PNG file.\n* <code>IHDR</code> must be the first chunk; it contains (in this order) the image's width (4 bytes), height (4 bytes), bit depth (1 byte), color type (1 byte), compression method (1 byte), filter method (1 byte), and interlace method (1 byte) (13 data bytes total).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11IHDR |title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition) |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n* <code>PLTE</code> contains the [[Palette (computing)|palette]]; list of colors.\n* <code>IDAT</code> contains the image, which may be split among multiple IDAT chunks.

It is optional for color types 2 and 6 (truecolor and truecolor with alpha) and it must not appear for color types 0 and 4 (grayscale and grayscale with alpha).\n\n==== Ancillary chunks ====\nOther image attributes that can be stored in PNG files include [[gamma correction|gamma]] values, background color, and textual [[metadata]] information.

The lowercase last letter in some chunks indicates that they are safe to copy, even if the application concerned does not understand them.\n\n=== Pixel format ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ PNG color type<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11IHDR Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition): 11.2.2 IHDR Image header].</ref>\n! rowspan=2| Color type\n! rowspan=2| Channels\n! colspan=5| Bits per channel\n|-\n! 1 !! 2 !! 4 !! 8 !! 16\n|-\n!

The palette is a separate table contained in the PLTE chunk.  Sample data for a single pixel consists of a tuple of between one and four numbers.  Whether the pixel data represents palette indices or explicit sample values, the numbers are referred to as [[Channel (digital image)|channels]] and every number in the image is encoded with an identical format.\n\nThe permitted formats encode each number as an unsigned integer value using a fixed number of bits, referred to in the PNG specification as the ''bit depth''.  Notice that this is not the same as [[color depth]], which is commonly used to refer to the total number of bits in each pixel, not each channel.  The permitted bit depths are summarized in the table along with the total number of bits used for each pixel.\n\nThe number of channels depends on whether the image is grayscale or color and whether it has an [[alpha channel]]. PNG allows the following combinations of channels, called the ''color type''.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n|0 (000<sub>2</sub>) || grayscale\n|-\n|2 (010<sub>2</sub>) || red, green and blue: rgb/truecolor\n|-\n|3 (011<sub>2</sub>) || indexed: channel containing indices into a palette of colors\n|-\n|4 (100<sub>2</sub>) || grayscale and alpha: level of [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] for each pixel\n|-\n|6 (110<sub>2</sub>) || red, green, blue and alpha\n|}\n\nThe color type is specified as an 8-bit value however only the low 3 bits are used and, even then, only the five combinations listed above are permitted.  So long as the color type is valid it can be considered as a bit field as summarized in the adjacent table:\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ PNG color types\n!rowspan=2| Color<br> type\n!rowspan=2| Name\n!colspan=4| Binary\n!rowspan=2| Masks\n|-\n!title=\"undefined\"| &nbsp; !!title=\"alpha\"| A !!title=\"color\"| C !!title=\"palette\"| P\n|-\n! 0 !!

Truecolor and alpha\n| {{no|0}} || {{yes|1}} || {{yes|1}} || {{no|0}}\n| alpha, color\n|}\n\n* bit value 1: the image data stores palette indices.  This is only valid in combination with '''bit value 2''';\n* bit value 2: the image samples contain three channels of data encoding [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]] [[color]]s, otherwise the image samples contain one channel of data encoding [[relative luminance]],\n* bit value 4: the image samples also contain an alpha channel expressed as a linear measure of the opacity of the pixel.  This is not valid in combination with '''bit value 1'''.\n\nWith indexed color images, the palette always stores trichromatic colors at a depth of 8 bits per channel (24 bits per palette entry). Additionally, an optional list of 8-bit alpha values for the palette entries may be included; if not included, or if shorter than the palette, the remaining palette entries are assumed to be opaque. The palette must not have more entries than the image bit depth allows for, but it may have fewer (for example, if an image with 8-bit pixels only uses 90 colors then it does not need palette entries for all 256 colors).  The palette must contain entries for all the pixel values present in the image.\n\nThe standard allows indexed color PNGs to have 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits per pixel; grayscale images with no alpha channel may have 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bits per pixel. Everything else uses a bit depth per channel of either 8 or 16. The combinations this allows are given in the table above. The standard requires that decoders can read all supported color formats, but many image editors can only produce a small subset of them.\n\n=== Transparency of image ===\nPNG offers a variety of transparency options. With true-color and grayscale images either a single pixel value can be declared as transparent or an [[alpha channel]] can be added (enabling any percentage of partial transparency to be used). For paletted images, alpha values can be added to palette entries. The number of such values stored may be less than the total number of palette entries, in which case the remaining entries are considered fully opaque.\n\nThe scanning of pixel values for binary transparency is supposed to be performed before any color reduction to avoid pixels becoming unintentionally transparent. This is most likely to pose an issue for systems that can decode 16-bits-per-channel images (as is required for compliance with the specification) but only output at 8 bits per channel (the norm for all but the highest end systems).\n\nAlpha ''storage'' can be \"associated\" (\"[[Alpha compositing|premultiplied]]\") or \"unassociated\", but PNG standardized<ref name=\"w3.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Rationale.html|title=PNG Specification: Rationale|work=w3.org}}</ref> on \"unassociated\" (\"non-premultiplied\") alpha, which means that imagery is not alpha ''encoded''; the emissions represented in RGB are not the emissions at the pixel level. This means that the over operation will multiply the RGB emissions by the alpha, and cannot represent emission and occlusion properly.\n\n=== Compression ===\n[[File:PNG demo Banana.png|thumb|250px|Example with several types of image content]][[File:PNG demo heatmap Banana.png|thumb|251px|Representation of bit cost per pixel for above PNG file (red=expensive, blue=cheap)]]\nPNG uses a 2-stage compression process:\n* pre-compression: filtering (prediction)\n* compression: [[DEFLATE]]\n\nPNG uses [[DEFLATE]], a non-patented [[lossless data compression]] [[algorithm]] involving a combination of [[LZ77 and LZ78|LZ77]] and [[Huffman coding]]. [[Permissive software licence|Permissively-licensed]] DEFLATE implementations, such as [[zlib]], are widely available.\n\nCompared to formats with [[lossy compression]] such as [[JPG]], choosing a compression setting higher than average delays processing, but often does not result in a significantly smaller file size.\n\n==== Filtering ====\n[[File:Pixel-prediction.svg|thumb|128px|PNG's filter method 0 can use the data in pixels A, B, and C to predict the value for X.]]\n[[File:PNG-Gradient.png|thumb|128px|A PNG with 256 colors, which is only 251 bytes large with pre-filter. The same image as a GIF would be more than thirteen times larger.]]\n\nBefore DEFLATE is applied, the data is transformed via a prediction method: a single ''filter method'' is used for the entire image, while for each image line, a ''filter type'' is chosen to transform the data to make it more efficiently compressible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#9Filters |title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition): 9 Filtering |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> The filter type used for a scanline is prepended to the scanline to enable inline decompression.\n\nThere is only one filter method in the current PNG specification (denoted method 0), and thus in practice the only choice is which filter type to apply to each line.  For this method, the filter predicts the value of each pixel based on the values of previous neighboring pixels, and subtracts the predicted color of the pixel from the actual value, as in [[DPCM]]. An image line filtered in this way is often more compressible than the raw image line would be, especially if it is similar to the line above, since the differences from prediction will generally be clustered around 0, rather than spread over all possible image values. This is particularly important in relating separate rows, since DEFLATE has no understanding that an image is a 2D entity, and instead just sees the image data as a stream of bytes.\n\nThere are five filter types for filter method 0; each type predicts the value of each byte (of the image data before filtering) based on the corresponding byte of the pixel to the left (''A''), the pixel above (''B''), and the pixel above and to the left (''C'') or some combination thereof, and encodes the ''difference'' between the predicted value and the actual value.  Filters are applied to byte values, not pixels; pixel values may be one or two bytes, or several values per byte, but never cross byte boundaries.  The filter types are:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Filters.html | work = PNG Specification | title = Filter Algorithms}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This improvement, and a heuristic method of implementing it commonly used by PNG-writing software, were created by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]], who tested the methods on many images during the creation of the format;<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.ddj.com/architect/184409587?pgno=4 | title = PNG: The Portable Network Graphic Format | work = [[Dr. Dobb's Journal]] | issue = 232 |date=July 1995 | volume = 20 | pages = 36\u201344 | first = Lee Daniel | last = Crocker | authorlink = Lee Daniel Crocker}}</ref> the choice of filter is a component of file size optimization, as discussed below.\n\nIf interlacing is used, each stage of the interlacing is filtered separately, meaning that the image can be progressively rendered as each stage is received; however, interlacing generally makes compression less effective.\n\n=== Interlacing ===\n[[File:Adam7 passes.gif|thumb|An illustration of Adam7 interlacing over a 16\u00d716 image.]]\nPNG offers an optional 2-dimensional, 7-pass [[interlacing (bitmaps)|interlacing]] scheme\u2014the [[Adam7 algorithm]]. This is more sophisticated than GIF's 1-dimensional, 4-pass scheme, and allows a clearer low-resolution image to be visible earlier in the transfer, particularly if interpolation algorithms such as [[bicubic interpolation]] are used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuwen.net/png.html |title=Introduction to PNG |publisher=nuwen.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the 7-pass scheme tends to reduce the data's compressibility more than simpler schemes.\n\n=== Animation ===\n[[File:Animated PNG example bouncing beach ball.png|thumb|An APNG (animated PNG) file (displays as static image in [[Comparison of web browsers#Image format support|some web browsers]])]]\nPNG itself does not support animation at all. [[Multiple-image Network Graphics|MNG]] is an extension to PNG that does; it was designed by members of the PNG Group. MNG shares PNG's basic structure and chunks, but it is significantly more complex and has a different file signature, which automatically renders it incompatible with standard PNG decoders.\n\nThe complexity of MNG led to the proposal of [[APNG]] by developers of the Mozilla Foundation. It is based on PNG, supports animation and is simpler than MNG. APNG offers fallback to single-image display for PNG decoders that do not support APNG. However, neither of these formats is currently widely supported. APNG is supported in [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]] 3.0 and up, [[Pale Moon (web browser)|Pale Moon]] (all versions), and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 9.5,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2007/09/14/opera-9-5-build |title=Opera Desktop Team: Post-Alpha Opera 9.5 Release |publisher=My.opera.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> but since Opera changed its layout engine to [[Blink (layout engine)|Blink]], support was dropped.

PNG supports animation only via unofficial extensions (see the [[#Animation|section on animation]], above).\n\nPNG images are less widely supported by older browsers.

Which One To Use? |publisher=Sitepoint.com |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\n=== JPEG ===\n[[File:Comparison of JPEG and PNG.png|thumb|200px|left|Composite image comparing lossy compression in JPEG with lossless compression in PNG: the JPEG artifacts can be easily visible in the background of this kind of image data, where the PNG image has solid color.]]\n\nThe [[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format can produce a smaller file than PNG for [[photography|photographic]] (and photo-like) images, since JPEG uses a [[lossy compression|lossy encoding method]] specifically designed for photographic image data, which is typically dominated by soft, low-contrast transitions, and an amount of noise or similar irregular structures. Using PNG instead of a high-quality JPEG for such images would result in a large increase in filesize with [[transparency (data compression)|negligible]] gain in quality. In comparison, when storing images that contain text, line art, or graphics \u2013 images with sharp transitions and large areas of solid color \u2013 the PNG format can compress image data more than JPEG can. Additionally, PNG is lossless, while JPEG produces visual artifacts around high-contrast areas. (Such artifacts depend on the settings used in the JPG compression; they can be quite noticeable when a low-quality [high-compression] setting is used.)  Where an image contains both sharp transitions and photographic parts, a choice must be made between the two effects. JPEG does not support transparency.\n\nJPEG's lossy compression also suffers from [[generation loss]], where repeatedly decoding and re-encoding an image to save it again causes a loss of information each time, degrading the image. This does not happen with repeated viewing or copying, but only if the file is edited and saved over again. Because PNG is lossless, it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are lossless compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, lossless [[WebP]] and [[Digital Negative|Adobe DNG]] (digital negative) for example. However these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no generation loss.\n\nThe PNG specification does not include a standard for embedding [[Exif]] image data from sources such as digital cameras. Instead, PNG has various dedicated ancillary chunks for storing the metadata that other file formats (such as JPEG) would typically store in Exif format.\n\nEarly web browsers did not support PNG images; JPEG and GIF were the main image formats. JPEG was commonly used when exporting images containing gradients for web pages, because of GIF's limited color depth. However, JPEG compression causes a gradient to blur slightly. A PNG format reproduces a gradient as accurately as possible for a given bit depth, while keeping the file size small. PNG became the optimal choice for small gradient images as web browser support for the format improved. No images at all are needed to display gradients in modern browsers, as gradients can be created using [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]].\n\n=== JPEG-LS ===\n[[JPEG-LS]] is an image format by the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group]], though far less widely known and supported than the other lossy JPEG format discussed above. It is directly comparable with PNG,{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=explain in which way it is directly comparable, or is this confused with Lossless JPEG?}} and has a standard set of test images.<ref name=\"jpegstdimg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/net/ITU-T/sigdb/speimage/T87.htm|title=T.87 : Lossless and near-lossless compression of continuous-tone still images \u2013 Baseline|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>  On the Waterloo Repertoire ColorSet, a standard set of test images (unrelated to the JPEG-LS conformance test set), JPEG-LS generally  performs better than PNG, by 10\u201315%, but on some images PNG performs substantially better, on the order of 50\u201375%.<ref name=\"pngcf\">[http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/chapter09.html Chapter 9. Compression and Filtering], in ''PNG: The Definitive Guide'' by Greg Roelofs.</ref> Thus, if both of these formats are options and file size is an important criterion, they should both be considered, depending on the image.\n\n=== TIFF ===\n[[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF) is a format that incorporates an extremely wide range of options. While this makes TIFF useful as a generic format for interchange between professional image editing applications, it makes adding support for it to applications a much bigger task and so it has little support in applications not concerned with image manipulation (such as web browsers). The high level of extensibility also means that most applications provide only a subset of possible features, potentially creating user confusion and compatibility issues.\n\nThe most common general-purpose, lossless compression algorithm used with TIFF is [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW). This compression technique, also used in GIF, was covered by patents until 2003. TIFF also supports the compression algorithm PNG uses (i.e. [[Tagged Image File Format#TIFF Compression Tag|Compression Tag 0008<sub>16</sub>]] '[[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]-style') with medium usage and support by applications. TIFF also offers special-purpose lossless compression algorithms like [[CCITT Group IV]], which can compress [[binary image|bilevel images]] (e.g., faxes or black-and-white text) better than PNG's compression algorithm.\n\nPNG supports non-premultiplied alpha only<ref name=\"w3.org\"/> whereas TIFF also supports \"associated\" (premultiplied) alpha.\n\n== Software support ==\nThe official [[reference implementation]] of the PNG format is the [[library (computing)|programming library]] ''[[libpng]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html | title=libpng | accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> It is published as free software under the terms of a [[permissive free software license]]. Therefore, it is usually found as an important system library in free operating systems.\n\n=== Bitmap graphics editor support for PNG ===\n{{Main|Comparison of raster graphics editors}}\n\nThe PNG format is widely supported by graphics programs, including [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Corel]]'s [[Corel Photo-Paint|Photo-Paint]] and [[Corel Paint Shop Pro|Paint Shop Pro]], the [[GIMP]], [[GraphicConverter]], [[Helicon Filter]], [[ImageMagick]], [[Inkscape]], [[IrfanView]], Pixel image editor, [[Paint.NET]] and [[Xara Photo & Graphic Designer]] and many others. Some programs bundled with popular [[operating system]]s which support PNG include [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft Paint|Paint]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Apple Photos|Photos]]/[[iPhoto]] and [[Preview (macOS)|Preview]], with the GIMP also often being bundled with popular [[Linux]] distributions.\n\n[[Adobe Fireworks]] (formerly by [[Macromedia]]) uses PNG as its native file format, allowing other image editors and preview utilities to view the flattened image. However, Fireworks by default also stores metadata for layers, animation, vector data, text and effects. Such files should not be distributed directly. Fireworks can instead export the image as an optimized PNG without the extra metadata for use on web pages, etc.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Web browser support for PNG ===\n{{Main|Comparison of web browsers#Image format support|l1=Web browser image format support}}\nPNG support first appeared in [[Internet Explorer]] 4.0b1 (32-bit only for NT) and in [[Netscape]] 4.04.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://oregon.usgs.gov/png_images.html | title = Use of PNG Images to Display Data | publisher = Oregon Water Science Center | date = 16 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nDespite calls by the [[Free Software Foundation]]<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html | title = Why There Are No GIF files on GNU Web Pages | work = [[GNU|GNU Operating System]] | date = 16 December 2008}}</ref> and the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/Press/PNG-fact.html | title = PNG Fact Sheet | publisher = [[World Wide Web Consortium]] | date = 7 October 1996}}</ref> tools such as gif2png,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/gif2png/|title=Resource page for gif2png 2.5.11|work=catb.org}}</ref> and campaigns such as Burn All GIFs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://burnallgifs.org/archives/|title=Burn All GIFs}}</ref> PNG adoption on websites was fairly slow due to late and buggy support in Internet Explorer, particularly regarding transparency.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1645187,00.asp | title = PNG Transparency in Internet Explorer | magazine = [[PC Magazine]] | date = 5 October 2004}}</ref>\n\nPNG compatible browsers include: Apple [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Camino (web browser)|Camino]], [[Internet Explorer 7]] (still numerous issues),<ref name=\"png-msie\">{{cite web | url = http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngapbr.html#msie-win-unix | title = Browsers with PNG Support | date = 14 March 2009}}</ref> [[Internet Explorer 8]] (still some issues), [[Internet Explorer 9]] and many others.

The screenshots show the default settings.|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 27 April 2008|date=May 2012}}]] -->\nPNG file size can vary significantly depending on how it is encoded and compressed; this is discussed and a number of tips are given in ''PNG: The Definitive Guide.''<ref name=\"pngcf\" />\n\n=== Compared to GIF ===\nCompared to [[GIF]] files, a PNG file with the same information (256 colors, no ancillary chunks/metadata), compressed by an effective compressor is normally smaller than a GIF image. Depending on the file and the compressor, PNG may range from somewhat smaller (10%) to significantly smaller (50%) to somewhat larger (5%), but is rarely significantly larger<ref name=\"pngcf\" /> for large images. This is attributed to the performance of PNG's [[DEFLATE]] compared to GIF's [[LZW]], and because the added precompression layer of PNG's predictive filters take account of the 2-dimensional image structure to further compress files; as filtered data encodes differences between pixels, they will tend to cluster closer to 0, rather than being spread across all possible values, and thus be more easily compressed by DEFLATE.  However, some versions of [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[CorelDRAW]] and [[Microsoft Paint|MS Paint]] provide poor PNG compression, creating the impression that GIF is more efficient.<ref name=\"pngcf\" />\n\n=== File size factors ===\nPNG files vary in size due to a number of factors:\n;color depth: Color depth can range from 1 to 64 bits per pixel.\n;ancillary chunks: PNG supports metadata\u2014this may be useful for editing, but unnecessary for viewing, as on websites.\n;interlacing: As each pass of the Adam7 algorithm is separately filtered, this can increase file size.<ref name=\"pngcf\" />\n;filter: As a precompression stage, each line is filtered by a predictive filter, which can change from line to line. As the ultimate DEFLATE step operates on the whole image's filtered data, one cannot optimize this row-by-row; the choice of filter for each row is thus potentially very variable, though heuristics exist.<ref group=\"note\">The filtering is used to increase the similarity to the data, hence increasing the compression ratio. However, there is theoretically no formula for similarity, nor absolute relationship between the similarity and compressor, thus unless the compression is done, one can't tell one filter set is better than another.</ref>\n;compression: With additional computation, DEFLATE compressors can produce smaller files.\nThere is thus a filesize trade-off between high color depth, maximal metadata (including color space information, together with information that does not affect display), interlacing, and speed of compression, which all yield large files, with lower color depth, fewer or no ancillary chunks, no interlacing, and tuned but computationally intensive filtering and compression. For different purposes, different trade-offs are chosen: a maximal file may be best for archiving and editing, while a stripped down file may be best for use on a website, and similarly fast but poor compression is preferred when repeatedly editing and saving a file, while slow but high compression is preferred when a file is stable: when archiving or posting.\nInterlacing is a trade-off: it dramatically speeds up early rendering of large files (improves latency), but may increase file size (decrease throughput) for little gain, particularly for small files.<ref name=\"pngcf\" />\n\n==== Lossy PNG compression ====\nAlthough PNG is a lossless format, PNG encoders can preprocess image data in a lossy fashion to improve PNG compression. For example, quantizing a truecolor PNG to 256 colors allows the indexed color type to be used for a likely reduction in file size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pngmini.com/lossypng.html |title=PNG can be a lossy format |publisher=Pngmini.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Image editing software ===\nSome programs are more efficient than others when saving PNG files, this relates to implementation of the PNG compression used by the program.\n\nMany graphics programs (such as Apple's [[Preview (software)|Preview]] software) save PNGs with large amounts of [[metadata]] and color-correction data that are generally unnecessary for [[World Wide Web|Web]] viewing. Unoptimized PNG files from [[Adobe Fireworks]] are also notorious for this since they contain options to make the image editable in supported editors. Also CorelDRAW (at least version 11) sometimes produces PNGs which cannot be opened by Internet Explorer (versions 6\u20138).\n\n[[Adobe Photoshop]]'s performance on PNG files has improved in the CS Suite when using the Save For Web feature (which also allows explicit PNG/8 use).\n\nAdobe's Fireworks saves larger PNG files than many programs by default. This stems from the mechanics of its ''Save'' format: the images produced by Fireworks' save function include large, private chunks, containing complete layer and vector information. This allows further lossless editing. When saved with the ''Export'' option, Fireworks' PNGs are competitive with those produced by other image editors, but are no longer editable as anything but flattened bitmaps. Fireworks is unable to save size-optimized vector-editable PNGs.\n\nOther notable examples of poor PNG compressors include:\n* Microsoft's Paint for Windows XP\n* Microsoft Picture It! Photo Premium 9 <!-- explain? -->\n\nPoor compression increases the PNG file size but does not affect the image quality or compatibility of the file with other programs.\n\nWhen the color depth of a [[24-bit color|truecolor]] image is reduced to an 8-bit palette (as in GIF), the resulting image data is typically much smaller.  Thus a truecolor PNG is typically larger than a color-reduced GIF, although PNG could store the color-reduced version as a palettized file of comparable size.  Conversely, some tools, when saving images as PNGs, automatically save them as truecolor, even if the original data use only 8-bit color, thus bloating the file unnecessarily.<ref name=\"pngcf\" /> Both factors can lead to the misconception that PNG files are larger than equivalent GIF files.\n\n=== Optimizing tools ===\nVarious tools are available for optimizing PNG files; they do this by:\n* (optionally) removing ancillary chunks,\n* reducing color depth, either:\n** use a palette (instead of RGB) if the image has 256 or fewer colors,\n** use a smaller palette, if the image has 2, 4, or 16 colors, or\n** (optionally) lossily discard some of the data in the original image,\n* optimizing line-by-line filter choice, and\n* optimizing DEFLATE compression.\n\n==== Tool list ====\n* [[pngcrush]] is the oldest of the popular PNG optimizers. It allows for multiple trials on filter selection and compression arguments, and finally chooses the smallest one. This working model is used in almost every png optimizer.\n* {{anchor|OptiPNG}}OptiPNG was inspired by pngcrush, but iterates over a wider range of compression parameters and performs trials in-memory for faster execution.<ref name=pngoptguide>Tru\u0163a, Cosmin. [http://optipng.sourceforge.net/pngtech/optipng.html \"A guide to PNG optimization\"].<!--Retrieved 23 March 2009--></ref> The main purpose of OptiPNG is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT [[data stream]] by trying various filtering and compression methods. It also performs automatic bit depth, color type and color palette reduction where possible, and can correct some data integrity errors in input files. (pngcrush has the ability to do color reduction in a later version.)\n* advpng and the similar advdef utility in the [[AdvanceCOMP]] package recompress the PNG IDAT. Different DEFLATE implementations are applied depending on the selected compression level, trading between speed and file size: zlib at level 1, libdeflate at level 2, [[7-zip]]'s [[LZMA]] DEFLATE at level 3, and [[zopfli]] at level 4.\n* [[pngout]] was made with the author's own deflater (same to the author's zip utility, kzip), while keeping all facilities of color reduction / filtering. However, pngout doesn't allow for using several trials on filters in a single run. It's suggested to use its commercial GUI version, pngoutwin, or used with a [[Portable Network Graphics#Wrapper tools|wrapper]] to automate the trials or to recompress using its own deflater while keep the filter line by line.<ref name=\"pngoutreusefilter\" group=\"note\">Use pngout -f6 to reuse previous filter set</ref>\n* [[zopfli]]png was also made with a self-own deflater, zopfli. It has all the optimizing features optipng and pngcrush have (including automating trials) while providing a very good, but slow deflater.\n\nA simple comparison of their features is listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although pngout offers both, only one type of filter can be specified in a single run, therefore it can be used with a [[Portable Network Graphics#Wrapper tools|wrapper tool]] or in combination with optipng or [[pngcrush]],<ref name=\"pngoutreusefilter\" group=\"note\"/> acting as a re-deflater, like advdef.\n\n==== Ancillary chunk removal ====\nFor removing ancillary chunks, most PNG optimization tools have the ability to remove all color correction data from PNG files (gamma, white balance, ICC color profile, standard RGB color profile). This often results in much smaller file sizes. For example, the following command line options achieve this with pngcrush:\n\n<code>pngcrush -rem gAMA -rem cHRM -rem iCCP -rem sRGB ''InputFile.png'' ''OutputFile.png''</code>\n\nAncillary chunks can also be losslessly removed using the free Win32 program [http://www.fieggen.com/software/pngextra.htm PNGExtra].\n\n==== Filter optimization ====\nOptiPNG, pngcrush, pngout, and zopflipng all offer options applying one of the filter types 0\u20134 globally (using the same filter type for all lines) or with a \"pseudo filter\" (numbered 5), which for each line chooses one of the filter types 0\u20134 using an adaptive algorithm. Zopflipng offers 3 different adaptive method, including a brute-force search that attempts to optimize the filtering.<ref group=\"note\">[optipng|pngcrush|pngout] -f OR zopflipng --filters</ref>\n\npngout and zopflipng provide an option to preserve/reuse<ref name=\"pngoutreusefilter\" group=\"note\"/><ref group=\"note\">zopflipng --filters=p</ref> the line-by-line filter set present in the input image.\n\nOptiPNG, pngcrush and zopflipng provide options to try different filter strategies in a single run and choose the best. The freeware command line version of pngout doesn't offer this, but the commercial version, pngoutwin, does.<ref group=\"note\">Pngoutwin's setting dialog for optimization offers the user a selection of filter strategies.</ref>\n\n==== DEFLATE optimization ====\n[[zopfli]] and the [[7zip#Software development kit|LZMA SDK]] employ [[DEFLATE]] implementations that produce higher [[Data compression ratio|compression ratio]]s than the [[zlib]] reference implementation at the cost of performance. [[AdvanceCOMP]]'s <code>advpng</code> and <code>advdef</code> can use either of these libraries to re-compress PNG files. Additionally, [[PNGOUT]] contains its own [[proprietary software|proprietary]] DEFLATE implementation.\n\n<tt>advpng</tt> doesn't have an option to apply filters and always uses filter 0 globally (leaving the image data unfiltered); therefore it should not be used where the image benefits significantly from filtering. By contrast, <tt>advdef</tt> from the same package doesn't deal with PNG structure and acts only as a re-deflater, retaining any existing filter settings.\n\n=== Icon optimization ===\nSince [[icon (computing)|icons]] intended for Windows Vista and later versions may contain PNG subimages, the optimizations can be applied to them as well. At least one [[icon (computing)|icon editor]], [http://www.qualibyte.com/pixelformer/ Pixelformer], is able to perform a special optimization pass while saving [[ICO (file format)|ICO]] files, thereby reducing their sizes. [[FileOptimizer]] (mentioned above) can also handle ICO files.\n\n[[Apple Icon Image format|Icons for macOS]] may also contain PNG subimages, yet there isn't such tool available.\n\n== See also ==\n*

PNG was developed as an improved, non-patented replacement for [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF).\n\nPNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit [[RGB color model|RGB]] or 32-bit [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] colors), [[grayscale]] images (with or without [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] for transparency), and full-color non-palette-based RGB or RGBA images. The PNG working group designed the format for transferring images on the [[Internet]], not for [[professional]]-quality print graphics, and therefore it does not support non-RGB [[color space]]s such as [[CMYK color model|CMYK]].  A PNG file contains a single image in an extensible structure of \"chunks\", encoding the basic pixels and other information such as textual comments and integrity checks documented in <nowiki>RFC 2083</nowiki>.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2083#section-3 |title= PNG (Portable Network Graphics) Specification Version 1.0 |at= sec. 3 |work= RFC 2083 |publisher= [[Internet Engineering Steering Group|IESG]]<!-- non-IETF work approved by IESG, eventually published by the RFC editor like all RCs -->|doi= 10.17487/RFC2083 |author1= T.

There were also other problems with the GIF format that made a replacement desirable, notably its limit of 256 [[color]]s at a time when computers able to display far more than 256 colors were becoming common.\n\nA January 1995 precursory discussion thread, on the [[usenet newsgroup]] \"comp.graphics\" with the subject ''Thoughts on a GIF-replacement file format'', had many propositions, which would later be part of the PNG file format. In this thread, Oliver Fromme, author of the popular [[DOS]] [[JPEG]] viewer [[QPEG]], proposed the PING name, eventually becoming PNG, a [[recursive acronym]] meaning ''[[Recursive acronym|PING is not GIF]]'', and also the PNG extension.<ref name=\"fromme\">{{cite web|author=TBH |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.graphics/msg/1131d852358a7578 |title=Thoughts on a GIF-replacement file format |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=6 January 1995 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\nAlthough GIF allows for [[computer animation|animation]], it was decided that PNG should be a single-image format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2083#page-39|title=PNG standard, section 8.4|quote=PNG itself is strictly a single-image format. (...) In the future, a multiple-image format based on PNG may be defined.  Such a format will be considered a separate file format}}</ref>  In 2001, the developers of PNG published the [[Multiple-image Network Graphics]] (MNG) format, with support for animation.  MNG achieved moderate application support, but not enough among mainstream web browsers and no usage among web site designers or publishers.  In 2008, certain Mozilla developers published the [[APNG|Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG)]] format with similar goals. APNG is a format that is natively supported by Gecko- and Presto-based web browsers and is also commonly used for thumbnails on Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] system (using the normal PNG file extension), and as of 2017, usage of [[APNG]] remains minimal despite being supported by all major browsers but Microsoft Edge.\n\n* 1 October 1996: Version 1.0 of the PNG specification was released, and later appeared as [[Request for Comments|RFC]] 2083. It became a [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] Recommendation on 1 October 1996.\n* 31 December 1998: Version 1.1, with some small changes and the addition of three new [[Portable Network Graphics#\"Chunks\" within the file|chunks]], was released.\n* 11 August 1999: Version 1.2, adding one extra chunk, was released.\n* 10 November 2003: PNG became an International Standard ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 15948:2003). This version of PNG differs only slightly from version 1.2 and adds no new chunks.\n* 3 March 2004: [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29581&scopelist=PROGRAMME ISO/IEC 15948:2004].<ref name=\"iso\" />\n\n== PNG Working Group ==\nThe original PNG specification was authored by an ad-hoc group of computer graphics experts and enthusiasts.

Chunks declare themselves as ''critical'' or ''ancillary'', and a program encountering an ancillary chunk that it does not understand can safely ignore it.  This chunk-based storage layer structure, similar in concept to a [[Container format (digital)|container format]] or to [[Amiga]]{{'}}s [[Interchange File Format|IFF]], is designed to allow the PNG format to be extended while maintaining compatibility with older versions\u2014it provides [[forward compatibility]], and this same file structure (with different signature and chunks) is used in the associated [[MNG]], [[JPEG Network Graphics|JNG]], and [[APNG]] formats.\n\nA chunk consists of four parts: length (4 bytes, [[Endianness#Big-endian|big-endian]]), chunk type/name (4 bytes), chunk data (length bytes) and [[cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] (cyclic redundancy code/checksum; 4 bytes). The CRC is a network-byte-order [[Computation of cyclic redundancy checks|CRC-32]] computed over the chunk type and chunk data, but not the length.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 8em\"  | Length\n! style=\"width: 8em\"  | Chunk type\n! style=\"width: 16em\" | Chunk data\n! style=\"width: 8em\"  | CRC\n|-\n| 4 bytes\n| 4 bytes\n| ''Length'' bytes\n| 4 bytes\n|}\n\nChunk types are given a four-letter [[Case sensitivity|case sensitive]] ASCII type/name; compare [[FourCC]]. The case of the different letters in the name (bit 5 of the numeric value of the character) is a [[bit field]] that provides the [[Codec|decoder]] with some information on the nature of chunks it does not recognize.\n\nThe case of the first letter indicates whether the chunk is critical or not. If the first letter is uppercase, the chunk is critical; if not, the chunk is ancillary.  Critical chunks contain information that is necessary to read the file. If a decoder encounters a critical chunk it does not recognize, it must abort reading the file or supply the user with an appropriate warning.\n\nThe case of the second letter indicates whether the chunk is \"public\" (either in the specification or the registry of special-purpose public chunks) or \"private\" (not standardised). Uppercase is public and lowercase is private. This ensures that public and private chunk names can never conflict with each other (although two private chunk names could conflict).\n\nThe third letter must be uppercase to conform to the PNG specification. It is reserved for future expansion. Decoders should treat a chunk with a lower case third letter the same as any other unrecognised chunk.\n\nThe case of the fourth letter indicates whether the chunk is safe to copy by editors that do not recognize it. If lowercase, the chunk may be safely copied regardless of the extent of modifications to the file. If uppercase, it may only be copied if the modifications have not touched any critical chunks.\n\n==== Critical chunks ====\nA decoder must be able to interpret critical chunks to read and render a PNG file.\n* <code>IHDR</code> must be the first chunk; it contains (in this order) the image's width (4 bytes), height (4 bytes), bit depth (1 byte), color type (1 byte), compression method (1 byte), filter method (1 byte), and interlace method (1 byte) (13 data bytes total).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11IHDR |title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition) |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n* <code>PLTE</code> contains the [[Palette (computing)|palette]]; list of colors.\n* <code>IDAT</code> contains the image, which may be split among multiple IDAT chunks. Such splitting increases filesize slightly, but makes it possible to generate a PNG in a streaming manner. The IDAT chunk contains the actual image data, which is the output stream of the compression algorithm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11IDAT |title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition) |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref>\n* <code>IEND</code> marks the image end.\nThe <code>PLTE</code> chunk is essential for color type 3 ([[indexed color]]). It is optional for color types 2 and 6 (truecolor and truecolor with alpha) and it must not appear for color types 0 and 4 (grayscale and grayscale with alpha).\n\n==== Ancillary chunks ====\nOther image attributes that can be stored in PNG files include [[gamma correction|gamma]] values, background color, and textual [[metadata]] information.

The \"value\" can be any length, including zero up to the maximum permissible chunk size minus the length of the keyword and separator. Neither \"key\" nor \"value\" can contain null character. Leading or trailing spaces are also disallowed.\n* <code>tIME</code> stores the time that the image was last changed.\n* <code>tRNS</code> contains transparency information. For indexed images, it stores alpha channel values for one or more palette entries. For truecolor and grayscale images, it stores a single pixel value that is to be regarded as fully transparent.\n* <code>zTXt</code> contains compressed text (and a compression method marker) with the same limits as <tt>tEXt.</tt>\n\nThe lowercase first letter in these chunks indicates that they are not needed for the PNG specification. The lowercase last letter in some chunks indicates that they are safe to copy, even if the application concerned does not understand them.\n\n=== Pixel format ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ PNG color type<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11IHDR Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition): 11.2.2 IHDR Image header].</ref>\n! rowspan=2| Color type\n! rowspan=2| Channels\n! colspan=5| Bits per channel\n|-\n! 1 !! 2 !! 4 !! 8 !! 16\n|-\n!

The palette is a separate table contained in the PLTE chunk.  Sample data for a single pixel consists of a tuple of between one and four numbers.  Whether the pixel data represents palette indices or explicit sample values, the numbers are referred to as [[Channel (digital image)|channels]] and every number in the image is encoded with an identical format.\n\nThe permitted formats encode each number as an unsigned integer value using a fixed number of bits, referred to in the PNG specification as the ''bit depth''.  Notice that this is not the same as [[color depth]], which is commonly used to refer to the total number of bits in each pixel, not each channel.  The permitted bit depths are summarized in the table along with the total number of bits used for each pixel.\n\nThe number of channels depends on whether the image is grayscale or color and whether it has an [[alpha channel]]. PNG allows the following combinations of channels, called the ''color type''.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n|0 (000<sub>2</sub>) || grayscale\n|-\n|2 (010<sub>2</sub>) || red, green and blue: rgb/truecolor\n|-\n|3 (011<sub>2</sub>) || indexed: channel containing indices into a palette of colors\n|-\n|4 (100<sub>2</sub>) || grayscale and alpha: level of [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] for each pixel\n|-\n|6 (110<sub>2</sub>) || red, green, blue and alpha\n|}\n\nThe color type is specified as an 8-bit value however only the low 3 bits are used and, even then, only the five combinations listed above are permitted.  So long as the color type is valid it can be considered as a bit field as summarized in the adjacent table:\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ PNG color types\n!rowspan=2| Color<br> type\n!rowspan=2| Name\n!colspan=4| Binary\n!rowspan=2| Masks\n|-\n!title=\"undefined\"| &nbsp; !!title=\"alpha\"| A !!title=\"color\"| C !!title=\"palette\"| P\n|-\n! 0 !!

Truecolor and alpha\n| {{no|0}} || {{yes|1}} || {{yes|1}} || {{no|0}}\n| alpha, color\n|}\n\n* bit value 1: the image data stores palette indices.  This is only valid in combination with '''bit value 2''';\n* bit value 2: the image samples contain three channels of data encoding [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]] [[color]]s, otherwise the image samples contain one channel of data encoding [[relative luminance]],\n* bit value 4: the image samples also contain an alpha channel expressed as a linear measure of the opacity of the pixel.  This is not valid in combination with '''bit value 1'''.\n\nWith indexed color images, the palette always stores trichromatic colors at a depth of 8 bits per channel (24 bits per palette entry). Additionally, an optional list of 8-bit alpha values for the palette entries may be included; if not included, or if shorter than the palette, the remaining palette entries are assumed to be opaque. The palette must not have more entries than the image bit depth allows for, but it may have fewer (for example, if an image with 8-bit pixels only uses 90 colors then it does not need palette entries for all 256 colors).  The palette must contain entries for all the pixel values present in the image.\n\nThe standard allows indexed color PNGs to have 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits per pixel; grayscale images with no alpha channel may have 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bits per pixel. Everything else uses a bit depth per channel of either 8 or 16. The combinations this allows are given in the table above. The standard requires that decoders can read all supported color formats, but many image editors can only produce a small subset of them.\n\n=== Transparency of image ===\nPNG offers a variety of transparency options. With true-color and grayscale images either a single pixel value can be declared as transparent or an [[alpha channel]] can be added (enabling any percentage of partial transparency to be used). For paletted images, alpha values can be added to palette entries. The number of such values stored may be less than the total number of palette entries, in which case the remaining entries are considered fully opaque.\n\nThe scanning of pixel values for binary transparency is supposed to be performed before any color reduction to avoid pixels becoming unintentionally transparent. This is most likely to pose an issue for systems that can decode 16-bits-per-channel images (as is required for compliance with the specification) but only output at 8 bits per channel (the norm for all but the highest end systems).\n\nAlpha ''storage'' can be \"associated\" (\"[[Alpha compositing|premultiplied]]\") or \"unassociated\", but PNG standardized<ref name=\"w3.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Rationale.html|title=PNG Specification: Rationale|work=w3.org}}</ref> on \"unassociated\" (\"non-premultiplied\") alpha, which means that imagery is not alpha ''encoded''; the emissions represented in RGB are not the emissions at the pixel level. This means that the over operation will multiply the RGB emissions by the alpha, and cannot represent emission and occlusion properly.\n\n=== Compression ===\n[[File:PNG demo Banana.png|thumb|250px|Example with several types of image content]][[File:PNG demo heatmap Banana.png|thumb|251px|Representation of bit cost per pixel for above PNG file (red=expensive, blue=cheap)]]\nPNG uses a 2-stage compression process:\n* pre-compression: filtering (prediction)\n* compression: [[DEFLATE]]\n\nPNG uses [[DEFLATE]], a non-patented [[lossless data compression]] [[algorithm]] involving a combination of [[LZ77 and LZ78|LZ77]] and [[Huffman coding]]. [[Permissive software licence|Permissively-licensed]] DEFLATE implementations, such as [[zlib]], are widely available.\n\nCompared to formats with [[lossy compression]] such as [[JPG]], choosing a compression setting higher than average delays processing, but often does not result in a significantly smaller file size.\n\n==== Filtering ====\n[[File:Pixel-prediction.svg|thumb|128px|PNG's filter method 0 can use the data in pixels A, B, and C to predict the value for X.]]\n[[File:PNG-Gradient.png|thumb|128px|A PNG with 256 colors, which is only 251 bytes large with pre-filter. The same image as a GIF would be more than thirteen times larger.]]\n\nBefore DEFLATE is applied, the data is transformed via a prediction method: a single ''filter method'' is used for the entire image, while for each image line, a ''filter type'' is chosen to transform the data to make it more efficiently compressible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#9Filters |title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition): 9 Filtering |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> The filter type used for a scanline is prepended to the scanline to enable inline decompression.\n\nThere is only one filter method in the current PNG specification (denoted method 0), and thus in practice the only choice is which filter type to apply to each line.  For this method, the filter predicts the value of each pixel based on the values of previous neighboring pixels, and subtracts the predicted color of the pixel from the actual value, as in [[DPCM]]. An image line filtered in this way is often more compressible than the raw image line would be, especially if it is similar to the line above, since the differences from prediction will generally be clustered around 0, rather than spread over all possible image values. This is particularly important in relating separate rows, since DEFLATE has no understanding that an image is a 2D entity, and instead just sees the image data as a stream of bytes.\n\nThere are five filter types for filter method 0; each type predicts the value of each byte (of the image data before filtering) based on the corresponding byte of the pixel to the left (''A''), the pixel above (''B''), and the pixel above and to the left (''C'') or some combination thereof, and encodes the ''difference'' between the predicted value and the actual value.  Filters are applied to byte values, not pixels; pixel values may be one or two bytes, or several values per byte, but never cross byte boundaries.  The filter types are:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Filters.html | work = PNG Specification | title = Filter Algorithms}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Multiple-image Network Graphics|MNG]] is an extension to PNG that does; it was designed by members of the PNG Group. MNG shares PNG's basic structure and chunks, but it is significantly more complex and has a different file signature, which automatically renders it incompatible with standard PNG decoders.\n\nThe complexity of MNG led to the proposal of [[APNG]] by developers of the Mozilla Foundation. It is based on PNG, supports animation and is simpler than MNG. APNG offers fallback to single-image display for PNG decoders that do not support APNG. However, neither of these formats is currently widely supported.

PNG supports animation only via unofficial extensions (see the [[#Animation|section on animation]], above).\n\nPNG images are less widely supported by older browsers.  In particular, IE6 has limited support for PNG.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitepoint.com/gif-png-jpg-which-one-to-use/ |title=GIF, PNG, JPG. Which One To Use? |publisher=Sitepoint.com |date=3 August 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\n=== JPEG ===\n[[File:Comparison of JPEG and PNG.png|thumb|200px|left|Composite image comparing lossy compression in JPEG with lossless compression in PNG: the JPEG artifacts can be easily visible in the background of this kind of image data, where the PNG image has solid color.]]\n\nThe [[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format can produce a smaller file than PNG for [[photography|photographic]] (and photo-like) images, since JPEG uses a [[lossy compression|lossy encoding method]] specifically designed for photographic image data, which is typically dominated by soft, low-contrast transitions, and an amount of noise or similar irregular structures. Using PNG instead of a high-quality JPEG for such images would result in a large increase in filesize with [[transparency (data compression)|negligible]] gain in quality. In comparison, when storing images that contain text, line art, or graphics \u2013 images with sharp transitions and large areas of solid color \u2013 the PNG format can compress image data more than JPEG can. Additionally, PNG is lossless, while JPEG produces visual artifacts around high-contrast areas. (Such artifacts depend on the settings used in the JPG compression; they can be quite noticeable when a low-quality [high-compression] setting is used.)  Where an image contains both sharp transitions and photographic parts, a choice must be made between the two effects. JPEG does not support transparency.\n\nJPEG's lossy compression also suffers from [[generation loss]], where repeatedly decoding and re-encoding an image to save it again causes a loss of information each time, degrading the image. This does not happen with repeated viewing or copying, but only if the file is edited and saved over again. Because PNG is lossless, it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are lossless compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, lossless [[WebP]] and [[Digital Negative|Adobe DNG]] (digital negative) for example. However these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no generation loss.\n\nThe PNG specification does not include a standard for embedding [[Exif]] image data from sources such as digital cameras. Instead, PNG has various dedicated ancillary chunks for storing the metadata that other file formats (such as JPEG) would typically store in Exif format.\n\nEarly web browsers did not support PNG images; JPEG and GIF were the main image formats. JPEG was commonly used when exporting images containing gradients for web pages, because of GIF's limited color depth. However, JPEG compression causes a gradient to blur slightly. A PNG format reproduces a gradient as accurately as possible for a given bit depth, while keeping the file size small. PNG became the optimal choice for small gradient images as web browser support for the format improved. No images at all are needed to display gradients in modern browsers, as gradients can be created using [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]].\n\n=== JPEG-LS ===\n[[JPEG-LS]] is an image format by the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group]], though far less widely known and supported than the other lossy JPEG format discussed above. It is directly comparable with PNG,{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=explain in which way it is directly comparable, or is this confused with Lossless JPEG?}} and has a standard set of test images.<ref name=\"jpegstdimg\">{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/net/ITU-T/sigdb/speimage/T87.htm|title=T.87 : Lossless and near-lossless compression of continuous-tone still images \u2013 Baseline|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>  On the Waterloo Repertoire ColorSet, a standard set of test images (unrelated to the JPEG-LS conformance test set), JPEG-LS generally  performs better than PNG, by 10\u201315%, but on some images PNG performs substantially better, on the order of 50\u201375%.<ref name=\"pngcf\">[http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/chapter09.html Chapter 9. Compression and Filtering], in ''PNG: The Definitive Guide'' by Greg Roelofs.</ref> Thus, if both of these formats are options and file size is an important criterion, they should both be considered, depending on the image.\n\n=== TIFF ===\n[[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF) is a format that incorporates an extremely wide range of options. While this makes TIFF useful as a generic format for interchange between professional image editing applications, it makes adding support for it to applications a much bigger task and so it has little support in applications not concerned with image manipulation (such as web browsers). The high level of extensibility also means that most applications provide only a subset of possible features, potentially creating user confusion and compatibility issues.\n\nThe most common general-purpose, lossless compression algorithm used with TIFF is [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW). This compression technique, also used in GIF, was covered by patents until 2003. TIFF also supports the compression algorithm PNG uses (i.e. [[Tagged Image File Format#TIFF Compression Tag|Compression Tag 0008<sub>16</sub>]] '[[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]-style') with medium usage and support by applications. TIFF also offers special-purpose lossless compression algorithms like [[CCITT Group IV]], which can compress [[binary image|bilevel images]] (e.g., faxes or black-and-white text) better than PNG's compression algorithm.\n\nPNG supports non-premultiplied alpha only<ref name=\"w3.org\"/> whereas TIFF also supports \"associated\" (premultiplied) alpha.\n\n== Software support ==\nThe official [[reference implementation]] of the PNG format is the [[library (computing)|programming library]] ''[[libpng]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html | title=libpng | accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> It is published as free software under the terms of a [[permissive free software license]]. Therefore, it is usually found as an important system library in free operating systems.\n\n=== Bitmap graphics editor support for PNG ===\n{{Main|Comparison of raster graphics editors}}\n\nThe PNG format is widely supported by graphics programs, including [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Corel]]'s [[Corel Photo-Paint|Photo-Paint]] and [[Corel Paint Shop Pro|Paint Shop Pro]], the [[GIMP]], [[GraphicConverter]], [[Helicon Filter]], [[ImageMagick]], [[Inkscape]], [[IrfanView]], Pixel image editor, [[Paint.NET]] and [[Xara Photo & Graphic Designer]] and many others. Some programs bundled with popular [[operating system]]s which support PNG include [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft Paint|Paint]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Apple Photos|Photos]]/[[iPhoto]] and [[Preview (macOS)|Preview]], with the GIMP also often being bundled with popular [[Linux]] distributions.\n\n[[Adobe Fireworks]] (formerly by [[Macromedia]]) uses PNG as its native file format, allowing other image editors and preview utilities to view the flattened image. However, Fireworks by default also stores metadata for layers, animation, vector data, text and effects. Such files should not be distributed directly. Fireworks can instead export the image as an optimized PNG without the extra metadata for use on web pages, etc.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Web browser support for PNG ===\n{{Main|Comparison of web browsers#Image format support|l1=Web browser image format support}}\nPNG support first appeared in [[Internet Explorer]] 4.0b1 (32-bit only for NT) and in [[Netscape]] 4.04.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://oregon.usgs.gov/png_images.html | title = Use of PNG Images to Display Data | publisher = Oregon Water Science Center | date = 16 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nDespite calls by the [[Free Software Foundation]]<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html | title = Why There Are No GIF files on GNU Web Pages | work = [[GNU|GNU Operating System]] | date = 16 December 2008}}</ref> and the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C),<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.w3.org/Press/PNG-fact.html | title = PNG Fact Sheet | publisher = [[World Wide Web Consortium]] | date = 7 October 1996}}</ref> tools such as gif2png,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/gif2png/|title=Resource page for gif2png 2.5.11|work=catb.org}}</ref> and campaigns such as Burn All GIFs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://burnallgifs.org/archives/|title=Burn All GIFs}}</ref> PNG adoption on websites was fairly slow due to late and buggy support in Internet Explorer, particularly regarding transparency.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1645187,00.asp | title = PNG Transparency in Internet Explorer | magazine = [[PC Magazine]] | date = 5 October 2004}}</ref>\n\nPNG compatible browsers include: Apple [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Camino (web browser)|Camino]], [[Internet Explorer 7]] (still numerous issues),<ref name=\"png-msie\">{{cite web | url = http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngapbr.html#msie-win-unix | title = Browsers with PNG Support | date = 14 March 2009}}</ref> [[Internet Explorer 8]] (still some issues), [[Internet Explorer 9]] and many others.

Depending on the file and the compressor, PNG may range from somewhat smaller (10%) to significantly smaller (50%) to somewhat larger (5%), but is rarely significantly larger<ref name=\"pngcf\" /> for large images. This is attributed to the performance of PNG's [[DEFLATE]] compared to GIF's [[LZW]], and because the added precompression layer of PNG's predictive filters take account of the 2-dimensional image structure to further compress files; as filtered data encodes differences between pixels, they will tend to cluster closer to 0, rather than being spread across all possible values, and thus be more easily compressed by DEFLATE.  However, some versions of [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[CorelDRAW]] and [[Microsoft Paint|MS Paint]] provide poor PNG compression, creating the impression that GIF is more efficient.<ref name=\"pngcf\" />\n\n=== File size factors ===\nPNG files vary in size due to a number of factors:\n;color depth: Color depth can range from 1 to 64 bits per pixel.\n;ancillary chunks: PNG supports metadata\u2014this may be useful for editing, but unnecessary for viewing, as on websites.\n;interlacing: As each pass of the Adam7 algorithm is separately filtered, this can increase file size.<ref name=\"pngcf\" />\n;filter: As a precompression stage, each line is filtered by a predictive filter, which can change from line to line. As the ultimate DEFLATE step operates on the whole image's filtered data, one cannot optimize this row-by-row; the choice of filter for each row is thus potentially very variable, though heuristics exist.<ref group=\"note\">The filtering is used to increase the similarity to the data, hence increasing the compression ratio. However, there is theoretically no formula for similarity, nor absolute relationship between the similarity and compressor, thus unless the compression is done, one can't tell one filter set is better than another.</ref>\n;compression: With additional computation, DEFLATE compressors can produce smaller files.\nThere is thus a filesize trade-off between high color depth, maximal metadata (including color space information, together with information that does not affect display), interlacing, and speed of compression, which all yield large files, with lower color depth, fewer or no ancillary chunks, no interlacing, and tuned but computationally intensive filtering and compression. For different purposes, different trade-offs are chosen: a maximal file may be best for archiving and editing, while a stripped down file may be best for use on a website, and similarly fast but poor compression is preferred when repeatedly editing and saving a file, while slow but high compression is preferred when a file is stable: when archiving or posting.\nInterlacing is a trade-off: it dramatically speeds up early rendering of large files (improves latency), but may increase file size (decrease throughput) for little gain, particularly for small files.<ref name=\"pngcf\" />\n\n==== Lossy PNG compression ====\nAlthough PNG is a lossless format, PNG encoders can preprocess image data in a lossy fashion to improve PNG compression. For example, quantizing a truecolor PNG to 256 colors allows the indexed color type to be used for a likely reduction in file size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pngmini.com/lossypng.html |title=PNG can be a lossy format |publisher=Pngmini.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Image editing software ===\nSome programs are more efficient than others when saving PNG files, this relates to implementation of the PNG compression used by the program.\n\nMany graphics programs (such as Apple's [[Preview (software)|Preview]] software) save PNGs with large amounts of [[metadata]] and color-correction data that are generally unnecessary for [[World Wide Web|Web]] viewing. Unoptimized PNG files from [[Adobe Fireworks]] are also notorious for this since they contain options to make the image editable in supported editors. Also CorelDRAW (at least version 11) sometimes produces PNGs which cannot be opened by Internet Explorer (versions 6\u20138).\n\n[[Adobe Photoshop]]'s performance on PNG files has improved in the CS Suite when using the Save For Web feature (which also allows explicit PNG/8 use).\n\nAdobe's Fireworks saves larger PNG files than many programs by default. This stems from the mechanics of its ''Save'' format: the images produced by Fireworks' save function include large, private chunks, containing complete layer and vector information. This allows further lossless editing. When saved with the ''Export'' option, Fireworks' PNGs are competitive with those produced by other image editors, but are no longer editable as anything but flattened bitmaps. Fireworks is unable to save size-optimized vector-editable PNGs.\n\nOther notable examples of poor PNG compressors include:\n* Microsoft's Paint for Windows XP\n* Microsoft Picture It! Photo Premium 9 <!-- explain? -->\n\nPoor compression increases the PNG file size but does not affect the image quality or compatibility of the file with other programs.\n\nWhen the color depth of a [[24-bit color|truecolor]] image is reduced to an 8-bit palette (as in GIF), the resulting image data is typically much smaller.  Thus a truecolor PNG is typically larger than a color-reduced GIF, although PNG could store the color-reduced version as a palettized file of comparable size.  Conversely, some tools, when saving images as PNGs, automatically save them as truecolor, even if the original data use only 8-bit color, thus bloating the file unnecessarily.<ref name=\"pngcf\" /> Both factors can lead to the misconception that PNG files are larger than equivalent GIF files.\n\n=== Optimizing tools ===\nVarious tools are available for optimizing PNG files; they do this by:\n* (optionally) removing ancillary chunks,\n* reducing color depth, either:\n** use a palette (instead of RGB) if the image has 256 or fewer colors,\n** use a smaller palette, if the image has 2, 4, or 16 colors, or\n** (optionally) lossily discard some of the data in the original image,\n* optimizing line-by-line filter choice, and\n* optimizing DEFLATE compression.\n\n==== Tool list ====\n* [[pngcrush]] is the oldest of the popular PNG optimizers. It allows for multiple trials on filter selection and compression arguments, and finally chooses the smallest one. This working model is used in almost every png optimizer.\n* {{anchor|OptiPNG}}OptiPNG was inspired by pngcrush, but iterates over a wider range of compression parameters and performs trials in-memory for faster execution.<ref name=pngoptguide>Tru\u0163a, Cosmin. [http://optipng.sourceforge.net/pngtech/optipng.html \"A guide to PNG optimization\"].<!--Retrieved 23 March 2009--></ref> The main purpose of OptiPNG is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT [[data stream]] by trying various filtering and compression methods. It also performs automatic bit depth, color type and color palette reduction where possible, and can correct some data integrity errors in input files. (pngcrush has the ability to do color reduction in a later version.)\n* advpng and the similar advdef utility in the [[AdvanceCOMP]] package recompress the PNG IDAT. Different DEFLATE implementations are applied depending on the selected compression level, trading between speed and file size: zlib at level 1, libdeflate at level 2, [[7-zip]]'s [[LZMA]] DEFLATE at level 3, and [[zopfli]] at level 4.\n* [[pngout]] was made with the author's own deflater (same to the author's zip utility, kzip), while keeping all facilities of color reduction / filtering. However, pngout doesn't allow for using several trials on filters in a single run. It's suggested to use its commercial GUI version, pngoutwin, or used with a [[Portable Network Graphics#Wrapper tools|wrapper]] to automate the trials or to recompress using its own deflater while keep the filter line by line.<ref name=\"pngoutreusefilter\" group=\"note\">Use pngout -f6 to reuse previous filter set</ref>\n* [[zopfli]]png was also made with a self-own deflater, zopfli. It has all the optimizing features optipng and pngcrush have (including automating trials) while providing a very good, but slow deflater.\n\nA simple comparison of their features is listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although pngout offers both, only one type of filter can be specified in a single run, therefore it can be used with a [[Portable Network Graphics#Wrapper tools|wrapper tool]] or in combination with optipng or [[pngcrush]],<ref name=\"pngoutreusefilter\" group=\"note\"/> acting as a re-deflater, like advdef.\n\n==== Ancillary chunk removal ====\nFor removing ancillary chunks, most PNG optimization tools have the ability to remove all color correction data from PNG files (gamma, white balance, ICC color profile, standard RGB color profile). This often results in much smaller file sizes. For example, the following command line options achieve this with pngcrush:\n\n<code>pngcrush -rem gAMA -rem cHRM -rem iCCP -rem sRGB ''InputFile.png'' ''OutputFile.png''</code>\n\nAncillary chunks can also be losslessly removed using the free Win32 program [http://www.fieggen.com/software/pngextra.htm PNGExtra].\n\n==== Filter optimization ====\nOptiPNG, pngcrush, pngout, and zopflipng all offer options applying one of the filter types 0\u20134 globally (using the same filter type for all lines) or with a \"pseudo filter\" (numbered 5), which for each line chooses one of the filter types 0\u20134 using an adaptive algorithm. Zopflipng offers 3 different adaptive method, including a brute-force search that attempts to optimize the filtering.<ref group=\"note\">[optipng|pngcrush|pngout] -f OR zopflipng --filters</ref>\n\npngout and zopflipng provide an option to preserve/reuse<ref name=\"pngoutreusefilter\" group=\"note\"/><ref group=\"note\">zopflipng --filters=p</ref> the line-by-line filter set present in the input image.\n\nOptiPNG, pngcrush and zopflipng provide options to try different filter strategies in a single run and choose the best. The freeware command line version of pngout doesn't offer this, but the commercial version, pngoutwin, does.<ref group=\"note\">Pngoutwin's setting dialog for optimization offers the user a selection of filter strategies.</ref>\n\n==== DEFLATE optimization ====\n[[zopfli]] and the [[7zip#Software development kit|LZMA SDK]] employ [[DEFLATE]] implementations that produce higher [[Data compression ratio|compression ratio]]s than the [[zlib]] reference implementation at the cost of performance. [[AdvanceCOMP]]'s <code>advpng</code> and <code>advdef</code> can use either of these libraries to re-compress PNG files. Additionally, [[PNGOUT]] contains its own [[proprietary software|proprietary]] DEFLATE implementation.\n\n<tt>advpng</tt> doesn't have an option to apply filters and always uses filter 0 globally (leaving the image data unfiltered); therefore it should not be used where the image benefits significantly from filtering. By contrast, <tt>advdef</tt> from the same package doesn't deal with PNG structure and acts only as a re-deflater, retaining any existing filter settings.\n\n=== Icon optimization ===\nSince [[icon (computing)|icons]] intended for Windows Vista and later versions may contain PNG subimages, the optimizations can be applied to them as well. At least one [[icon (computing)|icon editor]], [http://www.qualibyte.com/pixelformer/ Pixelformer], is able to perform a special optimization pass while saving [[ICO (file format)|ICO]] files, thereby reducing their sizes. [[FileOptimizer]] (mentioned above) can also handle ICO files.\n\n[[Apple Icon Image format|Icons for macOS]] may also contain PNG subimages, yet there isn't such tool available.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Computer graphics]], including:\n** [[Comparison of browser engines (graphics support)]]\n* [[Image editing]]\n* [[Image file formats]]\n* Related [[graphics file format]]s\n** [[APNG]] Animated PNG\n** [[JPEG Network Graphics]] (JNG)\n** [[Multiple-image Network Graphics]] (MNG)\n* Similar file formats\n** [[X PixMap]] for portable icons\n* [[Scalable Vector Graphics]]\n* [[WebP]]\n*[[IrfanView]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal|last=Roelofs|first=Greg|date=April 1997|title=Linux Gazette: History of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Format|journal=Linux Journal|publisher=Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc.|volume=1997|issue=36es|issn=1075-3583|url=http://linuxgazette.net/issue13/png.html}}\n*{{cite book|last=Roelofs|first=Greg|title=PNG: The Definitive Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/pngdefinitivegui00roel|edition=2nd|year=2003|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=1-56592-542-4|url-access=registration}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ PNG Home Site]\n* [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html libpng Home Page]\n* [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/slashpng-1999.html ''The Story of PNG'' by  Greg Roelofs]\n* [http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/ W3 PNG Specification]\n* [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/Inline-img.html Test inline PNG images]\n* RFC 2083\n* [http://hsivonen.iki.fi/png-gamma/ More information about PNG color correction]\n* [http://php.net/gd The GD-library to generate dynamic PNG-files with PHP]\n* [http://optipng.sourceforge.net/pngtech/optipng.html A guide to PNG optimization]\n* [http://schaik.com/png/adam7.html PNG Adam7 interlacing]\n* [http://www.idontplaydarts.com/2012/06/encoding-web-shells-in-png-idat-chunks/ Encoding Web Shells in PNG files]: Encoding human readable data inside an IDAT block.\n{{Graphics file formats}}\n{{Compression formats}}\n\n[[Category:Raster graphics file formats]]\n[[Category:Graphics standards]]\n[[Category:ISO standards]]\n[[Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards]]\n[[Category:Open formats]]\n[[Category:Image compression]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1996]]\n[[Category:PNG]]\n", "name_user": "103.70.202.9", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics"}

As of 2006, the estimated total population in the prefecture is 4,639,184 and 7,000 are members of the Catholic Church. The prefecture is subdivided into 27 [[parish]]es or pastoral areas, and has 10 priests altogether.\n\n==The Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang Today==\n''(Still being Constructed)''\n\n==Programs==\n''(Still being Constructed)''\n\n==A brief history of the Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang==\n[[File:Mary Mother of Inclusive Love.jpg|thumb|Mary, Our Mother of Inclusive Love.]]\nThe Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang traces its roots in the history of the Catholic Community in Battambang City.  On January 5, 1790, about 300 Cambodian Catholics left Pursat and Kompong Svay and settled in the outskirts of Battambang town, in the area that has been the cradle of Catholic presence and is now called Pet Yiet Chee. Some settled in the provinces of Siem Reap and Kompong Thom. \n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, when the Kingdom of Cambodia was all but destroyed by war with the Thai, the Catholic communities almost disappeared. In 1850 the Holy See established the Apostolic Vicariate of Phnom Penh, covering all the Kingdom of Cambodia, entrusting it to the care of the priests of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]].\n\n[[File:Old Battambang Church.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Old Battambang Catholic Church in Pet Yiey Chee compound destroyed by the Khmer Rouge in 1975]]\n\nDuring the French Protectorate, many Catholics came from Vietnam and settled in Cambodia. In 1905, two [[Congregation of Divine Providence|Sisters of Providence of Portieux]] went to Battambang and opened an orphanage and a hospital. A church built at around that time on the same piece of land was totally leveled later in the Khmer Rouge regime . \n\nOn September 26, 1968 the Apostolic Vicariate of Phnom Penh was divided into three: Phnom Penh, Kompong Cham and Battambang.\n\nDuring the dark, genocidal years of 1975-1979, all the Cambodian priests and religious, except for a handful of [[Religious Sisters]] who happened to be outside the country, and a great number of [[laity|lay]] Catholics, lost their lives.  Paul Tep Im Sotha, who had been named the first Apostolic Prefect of Battambang in 1968, was killed together with [[Dom (title)|Dom]] Jean Badre, a French [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monk]], in May 1975 in Bat Trang in the Mongolborei district of Banteay Meanchey Province. \n\nAt the end of the Khmer Rouge period, in 1979 and in the early eighties, only some Catholics were among the several hundred thousand who lived in the refugee settlements along the Thai border. The tiny communities grew, and during this time of exile, intense effort was made by the Paris Foreign Mission priests to translate the bible and [[liturgy]] into the Khmer language.\n \nAfter the liberation of 1979, the Catholics slowly re-gathered, prayed together, and organized their lives around their faith.  With the return of the refugees in the early 1990s, Catholic communities in the northwest of the Prefecture gathered momentum. The refugees who came back from the camps and the new Catholics from the camps gave new life to the Church, since they had received intense formation during their exile in Thailand. In Battambang, although property rights were lost during the years of turbulence and exile, the Catholic Church was able to buy back the same property and building which was formerly the hospital of the Sisters of Providence. Quickly this became an important pastoral centre for nurturing the small communities back to full life.  In Chomnaom, the Church compound was given back to the community without any remunerations made.\n\nIn 1990, the Catholic communities were given the permission to worship freely in Cambodia, and Caritas Cambodia was re-established after an absence of 15 years. Bishop Yves Ramousse, who since 1983 had been responsible for the pastoral care of Cambodian communities dispersed around the world, officially returned in late 1992.  On July 25, 1992, the Holy See re-appointed him as Vicar Apostolic of Phnom Penh.  On December 21 of the same year, he was also appointed [[Apostolic Administrator]] of Battambang until the year 2000.\n\n===Enrique Figaredo, SJ===\n\nOn July 2, 2000, Enrique Figaredo (commonly known as '''[[Mgr.]] Kike'''), a Jesuit priest from [[Asturias]] in Spain, who has been deeply involved in the life of the Cambodians beginning with his work in the Thai-Cambodia refugee camps, was installed as [[Prefect Apostolic]].\n\nWith the appointment of Figaredo, a new era for the Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang began.  Since 1985, Figaredo has worked with the Cambodian people, first through the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) in the camps on the Thai-Cambodia border and, later, in Banteay Prieb Technical School for the Handicapped and landmine victims in Ang Snuol, 22 kilometers from Phnom Penh.  The school aims to help in the reintegration of war victims into the society again.  Figaredo is an apostle on the bumpy roads of Cambodia, extending outreach services especially to people in the northwest of the country.  Because of his presence to people and the active commitment of the Society of Jesus to the Cambodians, the Holy See put the leadership of the Catholic Church to the Jesuits through Figaredo.  On July 2, 2010, the Catholic communities celebrated his 10 years of presence and leadership in the country.\n\n==Ordinaries==\n*[[Enrique Figaredo Alvargonzalez]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]: appointed April 1, 2000\n*Paul Tep Im Sotha: September 26, 1968 \u2013 May 1975 (was killed, together with the Priest of Chomnaom Parish, Fr.

On July 2, 2010, the Catholic communities celebrated his 10 years of presence and leadership in the country.\n\n==Ordinaries==\n*[[Enrique Figaredo Alvargonzalez]], [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]: appointed April 1, 2000\n*Paul Tep Im Sotha: September 26, 1968 \u2013 May 1975 (was killed, together with the Priest of Chomnaom Parish, Fr.

{"title_page": "Ceolwulf II of Mercia", "text_new": "{{short description|9th- century King of Mercia}}\n'''Ceolwulf II''' (died c. 879) was the last [[king of Mercia|king of independent Mercia]].<ref>Williams, Ceolwulf</ref> He succeeded [[Burgred of Mercia]] who was deposed by the [[Vikings]] in 874. His reign is generally dated 874 to 879 based on a Mercian regnal list which gives him a reign of five years. However, D. P. Kirby argues that he probably reigned into the early 880s. By 883, he had been replaced by [[\u00c6thelred, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], who became ruler of Mercia with the support of [[Alfred the Great]], [[king of Wessex]].<ref name=DNB>Miller, Ceolwulf II</ref><ref>Kirby, p. 176</ref>\n\n==Dynastic background==\nOn [[anthroponymic]] grounds, Ceolwulf is thought to belong to the ''C'' dynasty of Mercian kings, a family which claimed descent from [[Pybba of Mercia]]. The ''C'' dynasty, beginning with [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]], may have had ties to the ruling family of [[Hwicce]] in south-west Mercia.<ref>The tie to Pybba was through an unknown son named Cenwalh. Pybba's daughter married [[Cenwalh of Wessex]]. Later genealogists may have turned a son by marriage into a son of the blood; Woolf, pp. 151&ndash;152. The alternative is that the relationship is contrived and the ''C'' dynasty descended from the royal house of the [[Hwicce]]; Zalockyj, p. 228.</ref>\n\nCeolwulf's immediate ancestry is unknown, but he is thought to be a descendant of [[Ceolwulf I of Mercia|Ceolwulf I]] through his daughter \u00c6lffl\u00e6d. \u00c6lffl\u00e6d was first married to [[Wigmund of Mercia|Wigmund]], son of King [[Wiglaf of Mercia|Wiglaf]], and then to Beorhtfrith, son of King [[Beorhtwulf of Mercia|Beorhtwulf]]. Far from being \"an unwise king's thane\", it is clear that Ceolwulf was a descendant of previous kings. A number of [[thegn]]s who witnessed charters under Burgred witnessed charters under Ceolwulf, and his charters were witnessed by Mercian bishops, testifying to his acceptance in Mercia.<ref>Walker, pp. 59&ndash;60, 208, Table 1; Zaluckiyj, p. 236, fig. 3, & p.247, sets out the theory whereby Ceolwulf is taken to be a younger brother of [[Wigstan of Mercia]].</ref>\n\n==Mercia, Wessex and the Vikings==\nThe ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' offers the following account of Ceolwulf:<blockquote>This year went the army [i.e. the [[Great Heathen Army]]] from the [[Kingdom of Lindsey]] to [[Repton]], and there took up their winter-quarters, drove the king [i.e. of Mercia], Burgred, over sea, when he had reigned about two and twenty winters, and subdued all that land.  He then went to [[Rome]], and there remained to the end of his life.  And his body lies in the church of Sancta Maria, in the school of the English nation.  And the same year they gave Ceolwulf, an unwise king's thane, the Mercian kingdom to hold; and he swore oaths to them, and gave hostages, that it should be ready for them on whatever day they would have it; and he would be ready with himself, and with all those that would remain with him, at the service of the army.<ref>''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', trans. James Ingram, sub anno 874.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''Chronicle'' was compiled on the orders of [[Alfred the Great]], brother-in-law of King Burgred. This account is considered to be biased and politically motivated, written with a view of strengthening the claims of Alfred and [[Edward the Elder]] to the overlordship of Mercia, evidenced by a 2015 find of Anglo-Saxon Imperial coins dated to around 879 CE, near [[Leominster]], presumed to have been buried by retreating Vikings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/viking-treasure-rewrite-history-stolen-metal-detectorists-convicted-1473484 \u00a0|title=MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF VIKING TREASURE THAT COULD REWRITE HISTORY STOLEN, METAL DETECTORISTS CONVICTED |date=22 November 2019 |publisher=Newsweek |access-date=24 November 2019 |quote=An example of a rare two emperor coin, hinting at a previously-unknown alliance between the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia.}}</ref> The coins depict both Ceolwulf as a king as well as Alfred, leading some experts to indicate that the two were  equals.<ref>Walker, pp. 59&ndash;60; Yorke, p. 123.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Watlington Hoard: Saxon and Viking treasure from the time of Alfred the Great discovered in Oxfordshire field|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/watlington-hoard-saxon-and-viking-treasure-from-the-time-of-alfred-the-great-discovered-in-a6768421.html|publisher=The Independent|date=10 December 2015}}</ref> According to Gareth Williams of the [[British Museum]], \"these coins enable us to re-interpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-50461860 |title=Detectorists stole Viking hoard that 'rewrites history' |date=21 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=24 November 2019 |quote=\"These coins enable us to re-interpret our history at a key moment in the creation of England as a single kingdom,\" according to Gareth Williams, curator of early medieval coins at the British Museum.}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nA report by [[The Guardian]] adds an additional perspective, suggesting that the coins \"rewrite Anglo-Saxon history\":<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/21/detectorists-hid-find-that-rewrites-anglo-saxon-history |title=Detectorists stole Viking hoard that 'rewrites history' |date=21 November 2019 |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=24 November 2019 |quote=}}</ref><blockquote>\"The presence of both kings on the two emperor coins suggests some sort of pact between the pair.

In 881 Rhodri's sons defeated the Mercians at the [[Battle of the Conwy]], a victory described in Welsh annals as \"revenge of God for Rhodri\". The Mercian leader was Edryd Long-Hair, almost certainly Ceolwulf's successor as Mercian ruler, \u00c6thelred.<ref>Charles Edwards, pp. 487-91</ref>\n\n==Coinage and London==\nThree types of penny have been found which were issued in Ceolwulf's name.

In English, the word \"borscht\" is most often associated with the soup's variant of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] origin, one of the most famous dishes of [[Ukrainian cuisine]], made with [[beetroot]]s as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as [[sorrel]]-based [[Sorrel soup|green borscht]], [[rye]]-based [[Sour rye soup|white borscht]] and [[cabbage]] borscht.\n\nBorscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and [[umbel]]s of [[Heracleum sphondylium|common hogweed]] (''Heracleum sphondylium''), a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone [[Stock (food)|stock]] with [[Saut\u00e9ing|saut\u00e9ed]] vegetables, which \u2013 as well as beetroots \u2013 usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink.

In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or [[Ethnic Mennonite|Mennonites]], the groups who first brought it there from Europe.

[[Beef]], [[pork]] or a combination of both are most commonly used, with [[brisket]], [[Ribs (food)|ribs]], [[Shank (meat)|shank]] and [[Chuck steak|chuck]] considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. [[Bone marrow (food)|Marrow bones]] are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10\u201315 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for [[smoked meat]]s, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. [[Fasting]] varieties are typically made with [[Fish stock (food)|fish stock]] to avoid the use of meat, while purely [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] recipes often substitute forest [[Edible mushroom|mushroom]] broth for the stock.{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=83}}{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Appendix}}\n\n[[File:Borsch 01.webm|thumb|thumbtime=53|Borscht cooked in a clay pot inside a [[Russian oven]] in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava region]] in central Ukraine|alt=Video of a woman in traditional peasant costume cooking borscht in a clay pot standing inside a masonry stove]]The vegetables most commonly added to borscht are beetroots, [[white cabbage]], [[carrot]]s, [[parsley root]], [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s and [[tomato]]es. Some recipes may also call for [[bean]]s, [[Cooking apple|tart apples]], [[turnip]], [[celeriac]], [[zucchini]] or [[bell pepper]]s. [[Parsnip]] may be used as a substitute for parsley root, and [[tomato paste]] is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes.{{sfnp|Burlakoff |2013|loc=Appendix}} The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables \u2013 by saut\u00e9ing, [[braising]], [[Boiling#In cooking|boiling]] or [[baking]] \u2013 separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of [[Low-temperature cooking|slow cooking]] in the [[Russian oven]] (traditional [[Masonry heater|masonry stove]], used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had to be taken into account in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form ''{{transl |ru |borshchok}}''{{efn |In the [[Cyrillic script]]: {{lang |ru |\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449\u043e\u043a}}.}} rather than ''{{transl |ru |borshch}}''.{{sfnp |Burlakoff |2013 |loc=Chapter 2}} Vegetables are usually [[Julienning|julienned]], except for potatoes and zucchini, which are [[Dicing|diced]]. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with [[vinegar]] or [[lemon juice]] to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are saut\u00e9ed (traditionally in animal fat, especially [[lard]] or [[butter]]) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Appendix}}{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=84}}\n\n[[File:Borscz 041.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bowl of borscht with beans and other vegetables|Ukrainian borscht with beans]]\nThe dominant tastes in borscht are sweet and sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour.{{sfnp |Burlakoff |2013 |loc=Chapter 2}} It is made by covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing [[bacteria]] to [[fermentation|ferment]] some of the [[sugar]]s present in beetroots into [[dextran]] (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), [[mannitol]], [[acetic acid]] and [[lactic acid]].{{sfnp |Panek |1905 |p=41}} Stale [[rye bread]] is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as ''[[chametz]]'' (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for [[Passover]] meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2\u20135 days (or 2\u20133 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate.{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013 |loc=Appendix}} The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as ''kvas''{{efn |{{lang-pl |kwas buraczany|links=no}}; {{lang-ru |\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0441 |links=no}} (''{{transl |ru |svekolny kvas}}''); {{lang-uk |\u0431\u0443\u0440\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0441 |links=no}} (''{{transl |uk |buryakovy kvas}}'').}} (literally 'sour, acid'; compare [[kvass]]) and in Yiddish as ''{{transl |yi |rosl}}''{{efn |In the [[Hebrew script]]: {{rtl-lang |yi |\u05e8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e1\u05dc}}; also [[Romanization|Romanized]] as ''{{transl|yi|rosel}}, {{transl|yi|rossel}}, {{transl|yi|russel}}'' or ''{{transl|yi|russell}}''.}} (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian ''{{transl|ru|rassol}}''{{efn |In the Cyrillic script: {{lang|ru|\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u043b}}.}} 'pickle juice', Polish ''{{lang|pl|ros\u00f3\u0142}}'' 'broth').

Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the [[Kiev]] variant uses [[Lamb and mutton|mutton or lamb]] as well as beef, while in the [[Poltava]] region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Duck (food)|duck]] or [[Domestic goose|goose]]. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the [[Chernihiv]] borscht; in this variant, beetroots are saut\u00e9ed in [[vegetable oil]] rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The [[Lviv]] borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of [[Vienna sausage]]s.{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=83\u201386}}{{sfn|Kulinariya|pp=792\u2013793}}\n\nMany regional recipes for borscht have also developed in [[Russian cuisine]].

In some versions, smoked meat may be used for the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice, dill pickle brine, or dry red wine. It may be served either in a soup bowl or \u2013 especially at dinner parties \u2013 as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a [[croquette]] or a filled pastry on the side.

As [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|combining meat with milk is proscribed]] by [[kosher]] dietary laws, Jews have developed two variants of the soup: meat (''{{transl|yi|fleischik}}'') and dairy (''{{transl|yi|milchik}}''). The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket (pork is never used{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 4}}{{sfnp|Marks|1999|p=63}}) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended with sour cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and [[beet sugar]] for sweetness. [[Galician Jews]] traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet.

The Mennonites, who began arriving in Canada and the United States from Russia's [[Volga region]] in the 1870s,{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 4}} still eschew beetroots in their borscht;{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 2}} instead, Mennonite varieties include ''{{lang|pdt|Komst Borscht}}'' (with cabbage or sauerkraut) and ''{{lang|pdt|Somma Borscht}}'' (sorrel-based \"summer borscht\").{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 4}} According to the  ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' published in 1906, cabbage-based ''kraut borscht'' was also more popular than the beet-based variant in [[American Jewish cuisine]] at the time.{{sfnp|Jewish Encyclopedia|1906|p=257}} Subsequent Jewish immigration helped popularize the red borscht in America.\n\n[[File:Ukrainian borscht.JPG|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Ukrainian beet-and-cabbage borscht]]\nIn the 1930s, when most American hotels refused to accept Jewish guests due to widespread [[antisemitism in the United States|anti-Semitism]], [[New York (state)|New York]] Jews began flocking to Jewish-owned resorts in the [[Catskill Mountains]] for their summer vacations. The area grew into a major center of Jewish entertainment, with restaurants offering [[Buffet#All-you-can-eat (AYCE)|all-you-can-eat]] Ashkenazi Jewish fare, including copious amounts of borscht. [[Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel|Grossinger's]], one of the largest resorts, served borscht throughout the day, every day of the year.

Such kind of \"purplish, watery broth\" is, according to Nikolai Burlakoff, author of ''The World of Russian Borsch'', \"associated in America with borsch, in general, and Jewish borsch in particular.\"{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 7}}\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], borscht was one of the most popular everyday dishes.

In Ukraine, the soup contains vegetables that are saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil rather than lard, as well as beans and mushrooms. It may be also thickened with wheat flour [[Dry roasting|dry-roasted]] in a pan instead of the usual roux.{{sfnp|Artyukh|2006|p=13}} The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby-red broth.

in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Northern Asia]]. In English, the word \"borscht\" is most often associated with the soup's variant of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] origin, one of the most famous dishes of [[Ukrainian cuisine]], made with [[beetroot]]s as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as [[sorrel]]-based [[Sorrel soup|green borscht]], [[rye]]-based [[Sour rye soup|white borscht]] and [[cabbage]] borscht.\n\nBorscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and [[umbel]]s of [[Heracleum sphondylium|common hogweed]] (''Heracleum sphondylium''), a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone [[Stock (food)|stock]] with [[Saut\u00e9ing|saut\u00e9ed]] vegetables, which \u2013 as well as beetroots \u2013 usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink. It is often served with ''[[Smetana (dairy product)|smetana]]'' or [[sour cream]], hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved [[Garnish (food)|garnishes]] and side dishes, such as ''{{lang|pl|[[uszka]]}}'' or ''{{lang|uk|[[pampushky]]}}'', that can be served with the soup.\n\nIts popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former [[Russian Empire]], and \u2013 by way of migration \u2013 to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or [[Ethnic Mennonite|Mennonites]], the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its various local guises, as their own [[national dish]] consumed as part of ritual meals within [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]], [[Latin Church|Roman Catholic]], and Jewish religious traditions.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Russkij-Borschtsch.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption |A [[tureen]] of thick Russian borscht]]\n\nThe name derives from the word {{lang|uk|[[:wikt:\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449|\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449]]}} (''{{transl|uk|borshch}}''), which is common to [[East Slavic languages]], such as [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]{{sfnp|Neilson|Knott|Carhart|1947}} or [[Russian language|Russian]].{{sfn|Dictionary.com|loc=[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/borscht \"borscht\"]}}{{sfn|Harper|loc=[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=borscht \"borscht\"]}}{{sfnp|Mish|2004|p=144|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&pg=PA144 \"borscht or borsch\"]}}{{sfn|Merriam-Webster's Word Central|loc=[http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?va=borscht borscht]}} Together with [[cognate]]s in other Slavic languages,{{efn|{{lang-be|\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0448\u0447|links=no}} (''{{transl|be|borshch}}''); {{lang-pl|barszcz|links=no}}.}} it comes from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] ''*b\u016dr\u0161\u010d\u01d0'' 'hogweed' and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*bhr\u0325sti-'' < ''*bhares-/bhores-'' 'point, stubble'.{{sfnp|Rudnyc'kyj|1972|pp=179\u2013180 (vol. 1)|loc=\"\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449\"}}{{sfnp|Pokorny|2007|p=312|loc=\"bhares-:bhores-\"}}{{sfnp|Vasmer|1973|loc=[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/vasmer/37071/\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449 \"\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449\"]}} [[Heracleum sphondylium|Common hogweed]] (''{{lang|la|Heracleum sphondylium}}'') was the soup's principal ingredient{{sfnp|Dembi\u0144ska|1999|p=127}} before it was replaced with other vegetables, notably beetroot in the Ukrainian version.

Depending on the recipe, some of these components may be omitted or substituted for.\n\n[[File:Borsch-con-fungi 032.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Refer to caption |Borscht ingredients may include beef, pork, lard, beetroots, cabbage, carrots, celeriac, onions, potatoes, mushrooms, tomato paste, parsley, chives, dill, bay leaves, allspice and black pepper.]]\nThe stock is typically made by boiling meat, bones, or both. [[Beef]], [[pork]] or a combination of both are most commonly used, with [[brisket]], [[Ribs (food)|ribs]], [[Shank (meat)|shank]] and [[Chuck steak|chuck]] considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. [[Bone marrow (food)|Marrow bones]] are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10\u201315 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for [[smoked meat]]s, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. [[Fasting]] varieties are typically made with [[Fish stock (food)|fish stock]] to avoid the use of meat, while purely [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] recipes often substitute forest [[Edible mushroom|mushroom]] broth for the stock.{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=83}}{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Appendix}}\n\n[[File:Borsch 01.webm|thumb|thumbtime=53|Borscht cooked in a clay pot inside a [[Russian oven]] in the [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava region]] in central Ukraine|alt=Video of a woman in traditional peasant costume cooking borscht in a clay pot standing inside a masonry stove]]The vegetables most commonly added to borscht are beetroots, [[white cabbage]], [[carrot]]s, [[parsley root]], [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s and [[tomato]]es. Some recipes may also call for [[bean]]s, [[Cooking apple|tart apples]], [[turnip]], [[celeriac]], [[zucchini]] or [[bell pepper]]s. [[Parsnip]] may be used as a substitute for parsley root, and [[tomato paste]] is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes.{{sfnp|Burlakoff |2013|loc=Appendix}} The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables \u2013 by saut\u00e9ing, [[braising]], [[Boiling#In cooking|boiling]] or [[baking]] \u2013 separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of [[Low-temperature cooking|slow cooking]] in the [[Russian oven]] (traditional [[Masonry heater|masonry stove]], used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had to be taken into account in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form ''{{transl |ru |borshchok}}''{{efn |In the [[Cyrillic script]]: {{lang |ru |\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449\u043e\u043a}}.}} rather than ''{{transl |ru |borshch}}''.{{sfnp |Burlakoff |2013 |loc=Chapter 2}} Vegetables are usually [[Julienning|julienned]], except for potatoes and zucchini, which are [[Dicing|diced]]. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with [[vinegar]] or [[lemon juice]] to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are saut\u00e9ed (traditionally in animal fat, especially [[lard]] or [[butter]]) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Appendix}}{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=84}}\n\n[[File:Borscz 041.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bowl of borscht with beans and other vegetables|Ukrainian borscht with beans]]\nThe dominant tastes in borscht are sweet and sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour.{{sfnp |Burlakoff |2013 |loc=Chapter 2}} It is made by covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing [[bacteria]] to [[fermentation|ferment]] some of the [[sugar]]s present in beetroots into [[dextran]] (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), [[mannitol]], [[acetic acid]] and [[lactic acid]].{{sfnp |Panek |1905 |p=41}} Stale [[rye bread]] is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as ''[[chametz]]'' (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for [[Passover]] meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2\u20135 days (or 2\u20133 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate.{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013 |loc=Appendix}} The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as ''kvas''{{efn |{{lang-pl |kwas buraczany|links=no}}; {{lang-ru |\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0441 |links=no}} (''{{transl |ru |svekolny kvas}}''); {{lang-uk |\u0431\u0443\u0440\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0441 |links=no}} (''{{transl |uk |buryakovy kvas}}'').}} (literally 'sour, acid'; compare [[kvass]]) and in Yiddish as ''{{transl |yi |rosl}}''{{efn |In the [[Hebrew script]]: {{rtl-lang |yi |\u05e8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e1\u05dc}}; also [[Romanization|Romanized]] as ''{{transl|yi|rosel}}, {{transl|yi|rossel}}, {{transl|yi|russel}}'' or ''{{transl|yi|russell}}''.}} (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian ''{{transl|ru|rassol}}''{{efn |In the Cyrillic script: {{lang|ru|\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u043b}}.}} 'pickle juice', Polish ''{{lang|pl|ros\u00f3\u0142}}'' 'broth').

[[Salt]], [[black pepper]], [[garlic]], [[Laurus nobilis|bay leaves]] and [[dill]] are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include [[allspice]], [[celery]] stalks, [[parsley]], [[marjoram]], [[hot pepper]]s, [[saffron]], horseradish, [[ginger]] and [[prune]]s. Some recipes require flour or [[roux]] to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.{{sfnp |Burlakoff |2013 |loc=Appendix}}{{sfnp |Zdanovich |2014 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NXmoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT100 \"\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0449\u0438\"]}}\n\n== Variations ==\n[[File:Borsch z galuschkamy 02.jpg|thumb|alt=A large pot of orange-yellow borscht with thick doughy noodles|Poltava borscht with ''[[halushky]]'']]\nAs the home country of beetroot borscht,{{sfnp|Kafka|1998|p=176}} [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukraine]] boasts great diversity of the soup's regional variants,{{sfnp|Saberi|Saberi|2014}}{{sfnp|Volokh|Manus|1983|p=96}} with virtually every [[Oblasts of Ukraine|province]] having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the [[Kiev]] variant uses [[Lamb and mutton|mutton or lamb]] as well as beef, while in the [[Poltava]] region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Duck (food)|duck]] or [[Domestic goose|goose]]. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the [[Chernihiv]] borscht; in this variant, beetroots are saut\u00e9ed in [[vegetable oil]] rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The [[Lviv]] borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of [[Vienna sausage]]s.{{sfnp|Pokhlebkin|2004|p=83\u201386}}{{sfn|Kulinariya|pp=792\u2013793}}\n\nMany regional recipes for borscht have also developed in [[Russian cuisine]]. Examples include the [[Moscow]] borscht, served with pieces of beef, ham and Vienna sausages; [[Siberia]]n borscht with [[meatball]]s; and [[Pskov]] borscht with dried [[European smelt|smelt]] from the local lakes.

The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket (pork is never used{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 4}}{{sfnp|Marks|1999|p=63}}) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended with sour cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks.

Celebrated after the first star has appeared in the sky{{sfnp|\u0141ozi\u0144ska|\u0141ozi\u0144ski|2013|pp=162\u2013165}} on December 24 (Roman Catholic) or January 6 (Greek Catholic), it is a meal which is at the same time festive and fasting, a multicourse affair (traditionally, with twelve distinct dishes) that excludes ingredients of land-animal origin.{{sfnp|Szymula|2012|p=280}} Christmas Eve borscht is, therefore, either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed with sour cream. In Ukraine, the soup contains vegetables that are saut\u00e9ed in vegetable oil rather than lard, as well as beans and mushrooms. It may be also thickened with wheat flour [[Dry roasting|dry-roasted]] in a pan instead of the usual roux.{{sfnp|Artyukh|2006|p=13}} The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby-red broth.

Youths used to celebrate [[Holy Saturday]], the last day of the fast, with a mock \"funeral\" of the white borscht, in which a pot of the soup was either buried in the ground or broken, sometimes \u2013 to the crowd's amusement \u2013 while being carried by an unsuspecting boy on his head.{{sfnp|Gloger|1900|pp=522\u2013523 (vol. 4)|loc=[[:s:pl:Encyklopedia staropolska/\u017bur|\"\u017bur\"]]}} On the next day, the white borscht would reappear on the Easter table, but this time, in its more coveted, meat-based guise with sausage, bacon and eggs.{{sfn|Dumanowski, ''Barszcz, \u017cur i post''}}\n\nIn Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, vegetarian borscht served with sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as ''{{transl|yi|peysakhdiker borsht}}'', is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to provide an opportunity to use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season.{{sfnp|Marks|2010|pp=196\u2013200|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT196 \"Borscht\"]}} Cold borscht blended with sour cream is also popular on [[Shavuot]] (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June.{{sfnp|Morel|2008}} [[Seudah Shlishit]], or the third meal of the [[Shabbat]], often includes borscht as well.{{sfnp|Marks|2010|pp=196\u2013200|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT196 \"Borscht\"]}}\n\n=== As an ethnic dish ===\n[[File:Borsch 05.jpg|thumb|alt=A meal of borscht and bread on a wooden table standing in the yard of a traditional peasant hut|Borscht served in a ceramic bowl with bread and salt in a village in the Poltava region of Ukraine]]\nIn its currently most popular, beet-based version, borscht most likely originated in what is now Ukraine.{{sfnp|Schultze|2000|pp=65\u201366}}{{sfnp|Marks|2010|pp=196\u2013200|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT196 \"Borscht\"]}}{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 2}} Borscht's role as a staple of everyday Ukrainian diet is reflected in the Ukrainian saying, \"borscht and porridge are our food\"{{efn|{{lang-uk|\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0449 \u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u2013 \u0457\u0436\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430|links=no}} (''{{transl|uk|Borshch ta kasha \u2013 yizha nasha}}'').}}{{sfn|''Prykazky ta pryslivya...''}} (compare the equivalent Russian saying, where borscht is replaced with ''{{transl|ru|[[shchi]]}}''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u0429\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u2013 \u043f\u0438\u0449\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430|links=no}} (''{{transl|uk|Shchi da kasha \u2013 pishcha nasha}}'').}}{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Preface}}).

Borscht, in the words of Burlakoff, \"is perfectly suited to a global culture.\" He describes it as \"a global phenomenon\", in which \"local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition.\" In his view, borscht \"is an almost perfect example of&nbsp;... '[[glocalization]]' \u2013 a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation;&nbsp;... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones.\"{{sfnp|Burlakoff|2013|loc=Chapter 3}} However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, \"people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it.\" Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of \"a common connection between culinary and territorial claims\", which results in the culinary area turning into \"a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of
