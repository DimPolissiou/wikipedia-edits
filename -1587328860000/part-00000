Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a villa on [[Long Island]] from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so and eventually both were imprisoned. Soon after Ned's escape from prison in 1872, he returned to New York to help Lyons escape from prison by using a disguise to infiltrate [[Sing Sing]] and break through the wall of her jail cell.

I have seen her steal in [[Montreal]] and elsewhere.\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \"recommendations showing his good character\".

Plunkett told the crowd that \"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\" was standing before them.
