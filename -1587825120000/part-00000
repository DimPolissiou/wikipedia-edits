In 1974, he became the second man in the [[Open Era]] to win three majors in a calendar year, and was not permitted to participate in the fourth, the French Open.  In 1982, he won both Wimbledon and the US Open and is considered to be the [[World-number-one male tennis-player rankings|World-number-one Player]] for that year, in addition to 1974 and 1976. He retired in 1996 at the age of 43.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2016}}\nConnors grew up in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], across the [[Mississippi River]] from St. Louis, and was raised [[Catholicism|Catholic]]. During his childhood he was coached and trained by his mother and grandmother.<ref name=\"si1978\"/> He played in his first U.S. Championship, the U.S. boys' 11-and-under of 1961, when he was nine years old. Connors' mother, Gloria, took him to Southern California to be coached by [[Pancho Segura]], starting at age 16, in 1968.<ref>Caroline Seebohm: ''Little Pancho'' (2009)</ref> He and his brother, John \"Johnny\" Connors, attended St. Phillip's grade school.\n\nConnors won the [[Junior Orange Bowl]] in both the 12- and the 14-year categories, and is one of only nine tennis players to win the Junior Orange Bowl championship twice in its 70-year history, which list includes [[Andy Murray]], [[Jennifer Capriati]], [[Monica Seles]], and [[Yshai Oliel]].<ref name=\"ynetnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4607068,00.html|title=14-year-old Israeli wins revered junior tennis tournament|publisher=ynetnews|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> In 1970, Connors recorded his first victory in the first round of the [[Countrywide Classic|Pacific Southwest Open]] in Los Angeles, defeating [[Roy Emerson]]. In 1971, Connors won the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] singles title as a Freshman while attending [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and attained All-American status.\n\nHe turned professional in 1972 and won his first tournament, the [[Jacksonville Open (tennis)|Jacksonville Open]]. Connors was acquiring a reputation as a maverick in 1972 when he refused to join the newly formed [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP), the union that was embraced by most male professional players, in order to play in and dominate a series of smaller tournaments organized by Bill Riordan, his manager. However, Connors played in other tournaments and won the [[1973 U.S. Pro Tennis Championships|1973 U.S. Pro]] Singles, his first significant title, toppling [[Arthur Ashe]] in a five-set final, 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20132.\n\n===Peak years===\n[[File:Jimmy Connors (1978).jpg|thumb|Connors at the 1978 ABN Tennis Tournament holding his Wilson T2000 steel racket]]\nConnors won eight Grand Slam singles championships: five [[US Open (tennis)|US Opens]], two [[Wimbledon (tennis)|Wimbledons]], and one [[Australian Open]]. He did not participate in the [[French Open]] during his peak years (1974\u201378), as he was banned from playing by the event in 1974 due to his association with [[World Team Tennis]] (WTT).<ref>{{cite book|title=World of Tennis '75|year=1975|publisher=Queen Anne Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-362-00217-1|pages=15\u201317|editor=John Barrett}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Connors, Goolagong 'Can't Play'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PsoqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6cwFAAAAIBAJ&dq=connors%20goolagong%20french%20tennis&pg=3375%2C4022177|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=May 22, 1974}}</ref> and in the other four years was either banned or chose not to participate. He only played in two Australian Opens in his entire career, winning it in 1974 and reaching the final in 1975. Few highly ranked players, aside from Australians, travelled to Australia for that event up until the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1974, Connors was the dominant player and held the ATP No. 1 ranking at the end of the year. He had a 99\u20134 record that year and won 15 tournaments of the 21 he entered, including three of the four Grand Slam singles titles. As noted, the [[1974 French Open|French Open]] did not allow Connors to participate due to his association with [[World Team Tennis]] (WTT), but he won the [[1974 Australian Open|Australian Open]], which began in late December 1973 and concluded on January 1, [[1974 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1974]], defeating [[Phil Dent]] in four sets, and beat [[Ken Rosewall]] in straight sets in the finals of both [[1974 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] and the [[1974 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] losing only 6 and 2 games, respectively, in those finals. His exclusion from the French Open denied him the opportunity to become the second male player of the Open Era, after [[Rod Laver]], to win all four Major singles titles in a calendar year.  He chose not to participate in the season-ending Masters Cup between the top eight players of the world and was not eligible for the World Championship Tennis (WCT) finals because he did not compete in the WCT's regular tournaments.\n\nIn the open era, Connors is one of only six men to win three or more Grand Slam singles titles in a calendar year. The others are: [[Rod Laver]] who won the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] in 1969; [[Mats Wilander]] won the Australian, French and US Open in 1988; [[Roger Federer]] won the Australian, Wimbledon and US Open in 2004, 2006 and 2007; [[Rafael Nadal]] won the French, Wimbledon, and US Open in 2010; and [[Novak Djokovic]] won the Australian, Wimbledon, and US Open in 2011 and 2015.\n\nConnors reached the final of the US Open in five straight years from 1974 through 1978, winning three times with each win being on a different surface ([[1974 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1974]] on grass, [[1976 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1976]] on clay and [[1978 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]] on hard). He reached the final of Wimbledon four out of five years during his peak ([[1974 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1974]], [[1975 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1975]], [[1977 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1977]] and [[1978 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]). Despite not being allowed to play or choosing not to participate in the French Open from 1974 to 1978, he was still able to reach the semifinals four times in the later years of his career.\n\nIn 1975, Connors reached the finals of Wimbledon, the US Open and Australia, he but did not win any of them, although his loss to John Newcombe was close as Connors lost 9-7 in a fourth set tiebreak. He won nine of the tournaments he entered achieving an 82\u20138 record.  While he achieved enough points to retain the ATP No. 1 ranking the entire year, most tennis authorities, including the ATP, named Arthur Ashe, who solidly defeated Connors at Wimbledon, as the Player of the Year. He once again did not participate in the Masters Cup or the WCT Finals.\n\nIn [[1976 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1976]], Connors captured the US Open once again (defeating Bj\u00f6rn Borg) while losing in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. While winning 12 events, including the U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia, Palm Springs and Las Vegas, he achieved a record of 90\u20138 and defeated Borg all four times they played. He was ranked No. 1 by the ATP for the entire year and was named the player of the year by most tennis sources, but not by the ATP, which named Bj\u00f6rn Borg as its player of the year.\n\nIn 1977, Connors lost in the Wimbledon finals to Borg 6-4 in the fifth set and in the US Open finals to Guillermo Vilas, but Connors captured both the Masters, beating Borg, and the WCT Finals. While holding onto the ATP No. 1 ranking, the ATP and most tennis authorities ranked Borg or Vilas No. 1 with Connors rated as No. 3.\n\nIn 1978, Borg defeated Connors in the Wimbledon final, but Connors defeated Borg at the US Open (played on hard court for the inaugural time) with both of their victories being dominating.  Connors also won the U.S. Pro Indoor. While he retained the ATP No. 1 ranking at the end of the year, the ATP and most tennis authorities rated Borg, who also won the French Open, as the player of the year.\n\nConnors reached the ATP world No. 1 ranking on July 29, 1974 and held it for 160 consecutive weeks, a record until it was surpassed by [[Roger Federer]] on February 26, 2007. He was the ATP year-end no. 1 player from 1974 through 1978 and held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 268 weeks during his career.\n\nIn 1979 through 1981, Connors generally reached the semi-finals of the three top Grand Slam events and the Masters each year, but he did win the WCT Finals in 1980. He was generally ranked third in the world those years.\n\nIn 1982 Connors experienced a resurgence as he defeated John McEnroe in five close sets to win Wimbledon and Ivan Lendl to win the US Open after which he reclaimed the ATP No. 1 ranking. He also reached the semi-final of the Masters Cup and won five other tournaments.  After trading the No. 1 ranking with back and forth with McEnroe, he finished the year ranked No. 2 in points earned, but he was named Player of the Year by the ATP and most other authorities due to his victories at Wimbledon and the US Open.\n\nIn 1983, Connors, McEnroe and Lendl traded the No. 1 ranking several times with Connors winning the US Open for a record fifth time and finishing the year as the No. 3 ranked player.\n\n===Contemporaries and rivalries===\nProminent contemporary players with Connors included [[Phil Dent]], [[Brian Gottfried]], [[Raul Ram\u00edrez]], [[Harold Solomon]], [[Dick Stockton (tennis)|Dick Stockton]], [[Roscoe Tanner]], and [[Guillermo Vilas]]. His older rivals included [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Rod Laver]], [[Ilie N\u0103stase]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Manuel Orantes]], [[Ken Rosewall]], and [[Stan Smith]]. His prominent younger opponents included [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]], [[Vitas Gerulaitis]], [[Ivan Lendl]], and [[John McEnroe]].\n\n====Bj\u00f6rn Borg====\n{{main|Borg\u2013Connors rivalry}}\nDuring his best years of 1974 through 1978, Connors was challenged the most by Borg, with twelve matches on tour during that time frame. Borg won only four of those meetings, but two of those wins were in the Wimbledon finals of [[1977 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1977]] and [[1978 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]. Connors lost his stranglehold on the top ranking to Borg in early 1979 and wound up with an official tour record of 8\u201315 against Borg as Borg is four years younger and won the last ten times they met. Head to head in major championship finals, they split their four meetings, Borg winning two Wimbledons ([[1977 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1977]] & [[1978 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]) and Connors winning two US Opens ([[1976 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1976]] & [[1978 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]).\n\n====Ilie N\u0103stase====\nNastase was another rival in Connors' prime. Though six years older than Connors, Nastase won ten of their first eleven meetings. However, Connors won 11 of their final 14 meetings. The two would team up to win the doubles championships at the 1973 Wimbledon and the 1975 US Open.\n\n====Manuel Orantes and Guillermo Vilas====\nOrantes upset Connors in the final of the [[1975 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1975 US Open]], but Connors was 11\u20133 overall against Orantes in tour events. On the other hand, Vilas wore down Connors in the final of the [[1977 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1977 US Open]] and was much more competitive in all of their meetings. Connors was only able to manage a 5\u20134 record against Vilas in tour events.\n\n====Rod Laver and John Newcombe====\nIn 1975, Connors won two highly touted \"Challenge Matches\", both arranged by the Riordan company and televised nationally by [[CBS Sports]] from [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. The first match, in February and billed as $100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1975|r=0}}}} today) winner-takes-all, was against Laver. Connors won that match, 6\u20134, 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 7\u20135. In April, Connors met Newcombe in a match billed as a $250,000 winner-takes-all. Connors won the match, 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20134. Connors ended his business relationship with Riordan later in 1975.<ref name=\"si1978\">{{cite web|author1=[[Frank Deford]]|title=Raised by women to conquer men|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2014/11/25/raised-women-conquer-men-jimmy-connors-frank-deford-si-60|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=August 28, 1978}}</ref>\n\nConnors played Newcombe in four tour events, with Newcombe winning the first two meetings on grass (1973 US Open quarterfinal and 1975 Australian Open final) and Connors winning the last two on hard courts (1978 Sydney Indoor quarterfinal and 1979 Hong Kong round of 16). Connors won all three meetings with Rod Laver in tour events.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1984 Connors had made both the finals of Wimbledon and the WCT finals with semifinal appearances at the French Open, the US Open, and the Masters Cup.  He finished the year as the No. 2 ranked player after McEnroe. In 1985 he made the semi-finals of the big 4 four events and finished number No. 4 for the year, a ranking he would again obtain in 1987 at the age of 35.\n\nConnors had shining moments against [[John McEnroe]] and [[Ivan Lendl]], both of whom rose to prominence after Connors peaked in the mid-1970s. He would continue to compete against much younger players and had one of the most remarkable comebacks for any athlete when he reached the semifinals of the 1991 US Open at the age of 39.\n\n====John McEnroe====\n{{main|Connors\u2013McEnroe rivalry}}\nIn the [[1980 World Championship Tennis Finals|1980 WCT Finals]], Connors defeated the defending champion, John McEnroe. McEnroe and Borg were battling for the top spot in that year, while Connors played the role of the spoiler. However, in 1982, at age 29, Connors was back in the Wimbledon singles final, where he faced McEnroe, who by then was established firmly as the world's top player. Connors recovered from being three points away from defeat in a fourth-set tie-break (at 3\u20134) to win the match, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20137, 7\u20136, 6\u20134, and claimed his second Wimbledon title, eight years after his first. Although Connors' tour record against McEnroe was 14\u201320, McEnroe is six years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won 12 out of their last 14 meetings. Head to head in major championship finals, they split their two meetings, Connors winning the [[1982 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1982]] Wimbledon in five sets, and McEnroe winning the [[1984 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1984]] Wimbledon in straight sets.\n\n====Ivan Lendl====\n{{main|Connors\u2013Lendl rivalry}}\nConnors defeated another of the next generation of tennis stars, Ivan Lendl, in the 1982 US Open final and soon regained the No. 1 ranking. Connors had a tour record of 13\u201322 against Lendl, but Lendl is seven years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won their last 17 matches from 1984 through 1992, after Connors' prime. Head to head in major championship finals, Connors defeated Lendl in both meetings, winning the [[1982 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1982]] and [[1983 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1983]] US Open.\n\n====Other matches====\nConnors continued to compete against younger men well into his 41st year.\n\nIn the fourth round of the [[1987 Wimbledon Championships]], Connors defeated [[Mikael Pernfors]], ten years his junior, 1\u20136, 1\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20134, 6\u20132, after having trailed 4\u20131 in the third set and 3\u20130 in the fourth set. In July 1988, Connors ended a four-year title drought by winning the Sovran Bank Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. It was the 106th title of his career. Connors had played in 56 tournaments and lost 11 finals since his previous victory in the Tokyo Indoors against Lendl in October 1984.\n\nAt the 1989 US Open, Connors defeated the third seed (and future two-time champion), [[Stefan Edberg]], in straight sets in the fourth round and pushed sixth-seeded [[Andre Agassi]] to five sets in a quarterfinal.\n\nHis career seemed to be at an end in 1990, when he played only three tournament matches and lost all three, dropping to No. 936 in the world rankings. However, after surgery on his deteriorating left wrist, he came back to play 14 tournaments in 1991. An ailing back forced him to retire from a five-sets match in the third round of the French Open against [[Michael Chang]], the 1989 champion. Connors walked off the court after hitting a winner against Chang.\n\nConnors recuperated and made an improbable run to the [[1991 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1991 US Open semifinals]] which he later said were \"the best 11 days of my tennis career\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2015/02/10/connors-krickstein-turn-back-the-clock-with-reunion-match/23190289/|title=Jimmy Connors faces Aaron Krickstein in reunion match|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref> On his 39th birthday he defeated 24-year-old [[Aaron Krickstein]], 3\u20136, 7\u20136, 1\u20136, 6\u20133, 7\u20136, in 4 hours and 41 minutes, coming back from a 2\u20135 deficit in the final set. Connors then defeated [[Paul Haarhuis]] in the quarterfinals before losing to [[Jim Courier]]. 22 years later [[ESPN]] aired a documentary commemorating Connors' run.<ref name=\"30for30\"/>\n\nConnors participated in his last major tournament, in the 1992 US Open, where he beat [[Jaime Oncins]], 6\u20131, 6\u20132, 6\u20133 in the first round, before losing to Lendl (then ranked No. 7), 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 2\u20136, 0\u20136 in the second round.\n\nIn September 1992, Connors played [[Martina Navratilova]] in the third [[The Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]] tennis match at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Connors was allowed only one serve per point and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won, 7\u20135, 6\u20132.\n\nHowever, this would not be the end of his playing career. As late as June 1995, three months shy of his 43rd birthday Connors beat [[S\u00e9bastien Lareau]], 6\u20134, 7\u20136, and [[Martin Sinner]], 7\u20136, 6\u20130, to progress to the quarterfinals of the Halle event in Germany. Connors lost this quarterfinal, 6\u20137, 3\u20136 to [[Marc Rosset]]. Connors' last match on the main ATP tour came in April 1996, when he lost, 2\u20136, 6\u20133, 1\u20136, to [[Richey Reneberg]] in Atlanta.<ref>ATP World Tour, Official Website. Player Information Jimmy Connors. Main Website http://www.atpworldtour.com/</ref>\n\n===Maverick===\nIn 1974, Connors and Riordan began filing lawsuits, amounting to $10 million, against the ATP and its president, [[Arthur Ashe]], for allegedly restricting his freedom in the game. The lawsuits stemmed from the French Open banning Connors in 1974 after he had signed a contract to play [[World Team Tennis]] (WTT) for the [[Baltimore Banners]]. Connors was seeking to enter the French Open, but the ATP and French officials opposed WTT because of scheduling conflicts, so the entries of WTT players were refused between 1974 and 1978. Connors dropped Riordan and eventually the lawsuits after losing to Ashe in the 1975 Wimbledon final (according to the official film produced by Wimbledon 1975, his $2 million suit against Ashe was still outstanding when the two met in the 1975 Wimbledon final).\n\nAt Wimbledon in 1977, he declined to participate in a parade of former champions to celebrate the tournament's centenary, choosing instead to practice in the grounds with Ilie Nastase while the parade took place. In 2000, he also declined to join a gathering of 58 former champions held to mark the millennium. In his 2013 autobiography, Connors blamed his missing the 1977 parade on the All England Club for not letting his doctor onto the grounds so that Connors could try on a customized splint for a thumb injury. Connors explained that this necessitated his rushing to meet the doctor at the entrance to the grounds, and then convincing Nastase to help him try out the splint on a practice court. By Connors' account, he then rushed to Centre Court for the parade, but was too late. He was booed when he played his first round match the next day. Reaching the final, he lost in five sets to Borg, who a month later was able briefly to interrupt Connors's long hold on the world No. 1 ranking.\n\nConnors also irritated sponsors and tennis officials by shunning the end-of-year [[Tennis Masters Cup|Masters]] championship from 1974 through 1976. However, he entered this round-robin competition in 1977 when it moved to New York City. Although Connors lost a celebrated late-night match to Vilas, 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 5\u20137, he took the title by defeating Borg in the final, 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 6\u20134.\n\n===Distinctions and honors===\nConnors won a male record 109 singles titles.<ref>[http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=18 James Scott Connors- International Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119111954/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=18 |date=November 19, 2006 }}</ref> He also won 16 doubles titles (including the men's doubles titles at Wimbledon in 1973 and the US Open in 1975).

The 31 semifinals stood as a record until surpassed by Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2012. The 41 quarterfinals remained a record until Roger Federer surpassed it at Wimbledon 2014. Connors was the only player to win the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] on three different surfaces: [[grass court|grass]], [[clay court|clay]], and [[hard court|hard]]. He was also the first male tennis player to win [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles on three different surfaces: grass (1974), clay (1976), and hard (1978).\n\nConnors was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1998 and [[Intercollegiate Tennis Association#Hall of Fame|Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

Because of his fiery competitiveness and acrimonious relationships with a number of peers, he has been likened to baseball player [[Pete Rose]].<ref name=\"30for30\">ESPN's [[30 for 30]] documentary [http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thisiswhattheywant ''This is What They Want'']</ref>\n\n==Playing style==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Jimmy Connors 2 (1978).jpg\n | width1 = 1856\n | height1 = 2706\n | alt1 = Jimmy Connors (1978)\n | caption1 = Jimmy Connors (1978)\n\n | image2 = Jimmy connors.jpg\n | width2 = 674 \n | height2 = 1024\n | alt2 = Jimmy Connors (2007)\n | caption2 = Jimmy Connors (2007)\n}}\nIn the modern era of power tennis, Connors's style of play has often been cited as highly influential, especially in the development of the flat backhand. Larry Schwartz on ESPN.com said about Connors, \"His biggest weapons were an indomitable spirit, a two-handed backhand and the best service return in the game. It is difficult to say which was more instrumental in Connors becoming a champion.&nbsp;... Though smaller than most of his competitors, Connors didn't let it bother him, making up for a lack of size with determination.\"<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014143.html|title=ESPN.com: Connors conquered with intensity|work=go.com}}</ref> Of his own competitive nature Connors has said, \"[T]here's always somebody out there who's willing to push it that extra inch, or mile, and that was me. (Laughter) I didn't care if it took me 30 minutes or five hours. If you beat me, you had to be the best, or the best you had that day. But that was my passion for the game. If I won, I won, and if I lost, well, I didn't take it so well.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nHis on-court antics, designed to get the crowd involved, both helped and hurt his play. Schwartz said, \"While tennis fans enjoyed Connors's gritty style and his never-say-die attitude, they often were shocked by his antics. His sometimes vulgar on-court behavior\u2014like giving the finger to a linesman after disagreeing with a call or strutting about the court with the tennis racket handle between his legs; sometimes he would yank on the handle in a grotesque manner and his fans would go wild or groan in disapproval\u2014did not help his approval rating. During the early part of his career, Connors frequently argued with umpires, linesmen, the players union, [[Davis Cup]] officials and other players. He was even booed at [[Wimbledon (tennis)|Wimbledon]]\u2014a rare show of disapproval there\u2014for snubbing the Parade of Champions on the first day of the Centenary in 1977.\"<ref name=\"ESPN\" /> His brash behavior both on and off the court earned him a reputation as the brat of the tennis world. Tennis commentator [[Bud Collins]] nicknamed Connors the \"Brash Basher of Belleville\" after the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St Louis]] suburb where he grew up.<ref>[http://www.espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_08_aug/20070807_BudCollinsJoinsESPN.htm Bud Collins Joins ESPN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307125607/http://www.espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_08_aug/20070807_BudCollinsJoinsESPN.htm |date=March 7, 2009 }}</ref> Connors himself thrived on the energy of the crowd, positive or negative, and manipulated and exploited it to his advantage in many of the greatest matches of his career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/05/13/jimmy-connors-the-outsider-chris-evert-arthur-ashe-andre-agassi/2153571/|title=Connors has no apologies, for his career or book|last=Sports|first=Chris Oddo, Special for USA TODAY|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nConnors was taught to hit the ball on the rise by his teaching-pro mother, Gloria Connors, a technique he used to defeat the opposition in the early years of his career. Gloria sent her son to Southern California to work with [[Pancho Segura]] at the age of 16. Segura advanced Connors' game of hitting the ball on the rise which enabled Connors to reflect the power and velocity of his opponents back at them. Segura was the master strategist in developing Jimmy's complete game. In the [[1975 Wimbledon]] final, [[Arthur Ashe]] countered this strategy by taking the pace off the ball, giving Connors only soft junk shots (dinks, drop shots, and lobs) to hit.\n\nIn an era when the [[serve and volley]] was the norm, [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]] excepted, Connors was one of the few players to hit the ball flat, low, and predominantly from the baseline. Connors hit his forehand with a semi-Western grip and with little net clearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.quickfound.net/training/jimmy_connors.html|title=Excerpts from How to Play Tougher Tennis by Jimmy Connors: QuickSports Tennis.|work=quickfound.net}}</ref> Contemporaries such as Arthur Ashe and commentators such as Joel Drucker characterized his forehand as his greatest weakness, especially on extreme pressure points, as it lacked the safety margin of hard forehands hit with topspin. His serve, while accurate and capable, was never a great weapon for him as it did not reach the velocity and power of his opponents.\n\nHis lack of a dominating serve and net game, combined with his individualist style and maverick tendencies, meant that he was not as successful in doubles as he was in singles, although he did win [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles with [[Ilie N\u0103stase]], reached a final with [[Chris Evert]], and accumulated 16 doubles titles during his career.\n\n===Racket evolution===\nAt a time when most other tennis pros played with wooden rackets, Connors used the \"Wilson T2000\" steel racket, which utilized a method for stringing that had been devised and patented by [[Lacoste]] in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/rackets/history.asp|title=Racket history|work=itftennis.com}}</ref><ref name=\"80t\">{{cite web|url=http://80s-tennis.com/pages/jimmy-connors.html|title=Jimmy Connors (USA)  80s-tennis.com|work=80s-tennis.com|access-date=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618204233/http://www.80s-tennis.com/pages/jimmy-connors.html|archive-date=June 18, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>  He played with this chrome tubular steel racket until 1984, when most other pros had shifted to new racket technologies, materials, and designs.<ref name=\"80t\" />\n\nAt the [[1983 Tokyo Indoor|Tokyo Indoor]] in October 1983, Connors switched to a new mid-size graphite racket, the Wilson ProStaff, that had been designed especially for him and he used it on the 1984 tour.<ref name=wot1984>{{cite book|title=World of Tennis 1984 : The Official Yearbook of the [[International Tennis Federation]]|year=1984|publisher=Willow Books|location=London|isbn=0-00-218122-3|page=150|editor=[[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]]}}</ref> But 1985 again found Connors playing with the T2000. In 1987, he finally switched to a graphite racket when he signed a contract with [[Slazenger]] to play their Panther Pro Ceramic. In 1990, Connors signed with Estusa.<ref name=\"80t\" />\n\nConnors used lead tape which he would wind around the racket head to provide the proper \"feel\" for his style of game.\n\n==Commentating==\nConnors did commentary with [[NBC-TV]] in 1990 and 1991, during its coverage of the [[French Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tournaments. During the Wimbledon tournaments of 2005, 2006, and 2007, Connors commentated for the [[BBC]] alongside [[John McEnroe]] (among others), providing moments of heated discussion between two former archrivals. Connors returned to BBC commentary at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in 2014. Connors has also served as a commentator and analyst for the [[Tennis Channel]] since the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] tournament of 2009.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/01/28/connors.tennis.channel.ap/index.html Ex-Tennis Great Jimmy Connors to Work for Tennis Channel] SI.com, January 28, 2009</ref>\n\n==Coaching==\nOn July 24, 2006, at the start of the [[Countrywide Classic]] tournament in Los Angeles, American tennis player [[Andy Roddick]] announced his partnership with Connors as his coach. In September, [[2006 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2006]] Roddick reached the final of the U.S. Open, where he lost to [[Roger Federer]]. On March 6, 2008, Roddick announced the end of that 19-month relationship.\n\nIn July 2013 former women's world No. 1 [[Maria Sharapova]] announced on her website that Connors was her new coach.

Connors was acquiring a reputation as a maverick in 1972 when he refused to join the newly formed [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP), the union that was embraced by most male professional players, in order to play in and dominate a series of smaller tournaments organized by Bill Riordan, his manager. However, Connors played in other tournaments and won the [[1973 U.S. Pro Tennis Championships|1973 U.S. Pro]] Singles, his first significant title, toppling [[Arthur Ashe]] in a five-set final, 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20132.\n\n===Peak years===\n[[File:Jimmy Connors (1978).jpg|thumb|Connors at the 1978 ABN Tennis Tournament holding his Wilson T2000 steel racket]]\nConnors won eight Grand Slam singles championships: five [[US Open (tennis)|US Opens]], two [[Wimbledon (tennis)|Wimbledons]], and one [[Australian Open]].

He only played in two Australian Opens in his entire career, winning it in 1974 and reaching the final in 1975. Few highly ranked players, aside from Australians, travelled to Australia for that event up until the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1974, Connors was the dominant player and held the ATP No. 1 ranking at the end of the year. He had a 99\u20134 record that year and won 15 tournaments of the 21 he entered, including three of the four Grand Slam singles titles. As noted, the [[1974 French Open|French Open]] did not allow Connors to participate due to his association with [[World Team Tennis]] (WTT), but he won the [[1974 Australian Open|Australian Open]], which began in late December 1973 and concluded on January 1, [[1974 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1974]], defeating [[Phil Dent]] in four sets, and beat [[Ken Rosewall]] in straight sets in the finals of both [[1974 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] and the [[1974 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] losing only 6 and 2 games, respectively, in those finals. His exclusion from the French Open denied him the opportunity to become the second male player of the Open Era, after [[Rod Laver]], to win all four Major singles titles in a calendar year.  He chose not to participate in the season-ending Masters Cup between the top eight players of the world and was not eligible for the World Championship Tennis (WCT) finals because he did not compete in the WCT's regular tournaments.\n\nIn the open era, Connors is one of only six men to win three or more Grand Slam singles titles in a calendar year. The others are: [[Rod Laver]] who won the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] in 1969; [[Mats Wilander]] won the Australian, French and US Open in 1988; [[Roger Federer]] won the Australian, Wimbledon and US Open in 2004, 2006 and 2007; [[Rafael Nadal]] won the French, Wimbledon, and US Open in 2010; and [[Novak Djokovic]] won the Australian, Wimbledon, and US Open in 2011 and 2015.\n\nConnors reached the final of the US Open in five straight years from 1974 through 1978, winning three times with each win being on a different surface ([[1974 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1974]] on grass, [[1976 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1976]] on clay and [[1978 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]] on hard). He reached the final of Wimbledon four out of five years during his peak ([[1974 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1974]], [[1975 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1975]], [[1977 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1977]] and [[1978 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]). Despite not being allowed to play or choosing not to participate in the French Open from 1974 to 1978, he was still able to reach the semifinals four times in the later years of his career.\n\nIn 1975, Connors reached the finals of Wimbledon, the US Open and Australia, he but did not win any of them, although his loss to John Newcombe was close as Connors lost 9-7 in a fourth set tiebreak. He won nine of the tournaments he entered achieving an 82\u20138 record.  While he achieved enough points to retain the ATP No. 1 ranking the entire year, most tennis authorities, including the ATP, named Arthur Ashe, who solidly defeated Connors at Wimbledon, as the Player of the Year. He once again did not participate in the Masters Cup or the WCT Finals.\n\nIn [[1976 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1976]], Connors captured the US Open once again (defeating Bj\u00f6rn Borg) while losing in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. While winning 12 events, including the U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia, Palm Springs and Las Vegas, he achieved a record of 90\u20138 and defeated Borg all four times they played. He was ranked No. 1 by the ATP for the entire year and was named the player of the year by most tennis sources, but not by the ATP, which named Bj\u00f6rn Borg as its player of the year.\n\nIn 1977, Connors lost in the Wimbledon finals to Borg 6-4 in the fifth set and in the US Open finals to Guillermo Vilas, but Connors captured both the Masters, beating Borg, and the WCT Finals. While holding onto the ATP No. 1 ranking, the ATP and most tennis authorities ranked Borg or Vilas No. 1 with Connors rated as No. 3.\n\nIn 1978, Borg defeated Connors in the Wimbledon final, but Connors defeated Borg at the US Open (played on hard court for the inaugural time) with both of their victories being dominating.  Connors also won the U.S. Pro Indoor. While he retained the ATP No. 1 ranking at the end of the year, the ATP and most tennis authorities rated Borg, who also won the French Open, as the player of the year.\n\nConnors reached the ATP world No. 1 ranking on July 29, 1974 and held it for 160 consecutive weeks, a record until it was surpassed by [[Roger Federer]] on February 26, 2007. He was the ATP year-end no. 1 player from 1974 through 1978 and held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 268 weeks during his career.\n\nIn 1979 through 1981, Connors generally reached the semi-finals of the three top Grand Slam events and the Masters each year, but he did win the WCT Finals in 1980. He was generally ranked third in the world those years.\n\nIn 1982 Connors experienced a resurgence as he defeated John McEnroe in five close sets to win Wimbledon and Ivan Lendl to win the US Open after which he reclaimed the ATP No. 1 ranking. He also reached the semi-final of the Masters Cup and won five other tournaments.  After trading the No. 1 ranking with back and forth with McEnroe, he finished the year ranked No. 2 in points earned, but he was named Player of the Year by the ATP and most other authorities due to his victories at Wimbledon and the US Open.\n\nIn 1983, Connors, McEnroe and Lendl traded the No. 1 ranking several times with Connors winning the US Open for a record fifth time and finishing the year as the No. 3 ranked player.\n\n===Contemporaries and rivalries===\nProminent contemporary players with Connors included [[Phil Dent]], [[Brian Gottfried]], [[Raul Ram\u00edrez]], [[Harold Solomon]], [[Dick Stockton (tennis)|Dick Stockton]], [[Roscoe Tanner]], and [[Guillermo Vilas]]. His older rivals included [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Rod Laver]], [[Ilie N\u0103stase]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Manuel Orantes]], [[Ken Rosewall]], and [[Stan Smith]]. His prominent younger opponents included [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]], [[Vitas Gerulaitis]], [[Ivan Lendl]], and [[John McEnroe]].\n\n====Bj\u00f6rn Borg====\n{{main|Borg\u2013Connors rivalry}}\nDuring his best years of 1974 through 1978, Connors was challenged the most by Borg, with twelve matches on tour during that time frame. Borg won only four of those meetings, but two of those wins were in the Wimbledon finals of [[1977 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1977]] and [[1978 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]. Connors lost his stranglehold on the top ranking to Borg in early 1979 and wound up with an official tour record of 8\u201315 against Borg as Borg is four years younger and won the last ten times they met. Head to head in major championship finals, they split their four meetings, Borg winning two Wimbledons ([[1977 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1977]] & [[1978 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]) and Connors winning two US Opens ([[1976 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1976]] & [[1978 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]]).\n\n====Ilie N\u0103stase====\nNastase was another rival in Connors' prime. Though six years older than Connors, Nastase won ten of their first eleven meetings. However, Connors won 11 of their final 14 meetings. The two would team up to win the doubles championships at the 1973 Wimbledon and the 1975 US Open.\n\n====Manuel Orantes and Guillermo Vilas====\nOrantes upset Connors in the final of the [[1975 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1975 US Open]], but Connors was 11\u20133 overall against Orantes in tour events. On the other hand, Vilas wore down Connors in the final of the [[1977 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1977 US Open]] and was much more competitive in all of their meetings. Connors was only able to manage a 5\u20134 record against Vilas in tour events.\n\n====Rod Laver and John Newcombe====\nIn 1975, Connors won two highly touted \"Challenge Matches\", both arranged by the Riordan company and televised nationally by [[CBS Sports]] from [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. The first match, in February and billed as $100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1975|r=0}}}} today) winner-takes-all, was against Laver. Connors won that match, 6\u20134, 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 7\u20135. In April, Connors met Newcombe in a match billed as a $250,000 winner-takes-all. Connors won the match, 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20134. Connors ended his business relationship with Riordan later in 1975.<ref name=\"si1978\">{{cite web|author1=[[Frank Deford]]|title=Raised by women to conquer men|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2014/11/25/raised-women-conquer-men-jimmy-connors-frank-deford-si-60|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=August 28, 1978}}</ref>\n\nConnors played Newcombe in four tour events, with Newcombe winning the first two meetings on grass (1973 US Open quarterfinal and 1975 Australian Open final) and Connors winning the last two on hard courts (1978 Sydney Indoor quarterfinal and 1979 Hong Kong round of 16). Connors won all three meetings with Rod Laver in tour events.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1984 Connors had made both the finals of Wimbledon and the WCT finals with semifinal appearances at the French Open, the US Open, and the Masters Cup.  He finished the year as the No. 2 ranked player after McEnroe. In 1985 he made the semi-finals of the big 4 four events and finished number No. 4 for the year, a ranking he would again obtain in 1987 at the age of 35.\n\nConnors had shining moments against [[John McEnroe]] and [[Ivan Lendl]], both of whom rose to prominence after Connors peaked in the mid-1970s. He would continue to compete against much younger players and had one of the most remarkable comebacks for any athlete when he reached the semifinals of the 1991 US Open at the age of 39.\n\n====John McEnroe====\n{{main|Connors\u2013McEnroe rivalry}}\nIn the [[1980 World Championship Tennis Finals|1980 WCT Finals]], Connors defeated the defending champion, John McEnroe. McEnroe and Borg were battling for the top spot in that year, while Connors played the role of the spoiler. However, in 1982, at age 29, Connors was back in the Wimbledon singles final, where he faced McEnroe, who by then was established firmly as the world's top player. Connors recovered from being three points away from defeat in a fourth-set tie-break (at 3\u20134) to win the match, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20137, 7\u20136, 6\u20134, and claimed his second Wimbledon title, eight years after his first. Although Connors' tour record against McEnroe was 14\u201320, McEnroe is six years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won 12 out of their last 14 meetings. Head to head in major championship finals, they split their two meetings, Connors winning the [[1982 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1982]] Wimbledon in five sets, and McEnroe winning the [[1984 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1984]] Wimbledon in straight sets.\n\n====Ivan Lendl====\n{{main|Connors\u2013Lendl rivalry}}\nConnors defeated another of the next generation of tennis stars, Ivan Lendl, in the 1982 US Open final and soon regained the No. 1 ranking. Connors had a tour record of 13\u201322 against Lendl, but Lendl is seven years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won their last 17 matches from 1984 through 1992, after Connors' prime. Head to head in major championship finals, Connors defeated Lendl in both meetings, winning the [[1982 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1982]] and [[1983 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1983]] US Open.\n\n====Other matches====\nConnors continued to compete against younger men well into his 41st year.\n\nIn the fourth round of the [[1987 Wimbledon Championships]], Connors defeated [[Mikael Pernfors]], ten years his junior, 1\u20136, 1\u20136, 7\u20135, 6\u20134, 6\u20132, after having trailed 4\u20131 in the third set and 3\u20130 in the fourth set. In July 1988, Connors ended a four-year title drought by winning the Sovran Bank Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. It was the 106th title of his career. Connors had played in 56 tournaments and lost 11 finals since his previous victory in the Tokyo Indoors against Lendl in October 1984.\n\nAt the 1989 US Open, Connors defeated the third seed (and future two-time champion), [[Stefan Edberg]], in straight sets in the fourth round and pushed sixth-seeded [[Andre Agassi]] to five sets in a quarterfinal.\n\nHis career seemed to be at an end in 1990, when he played only three tournament matches and lost all three, dropping to No. 936 in the world rankings. However, after surgery on his deteriorating left wrist, he came back to play 14 tournaments in 1991. An ailing back forced him to retire from a five-sets match in the third round of the French Open against [[Michael Chang]], the 1989 champion. Connors walked off the court after hitting a winner against Chang.\n\nConnors recuperated and made an improbable run to the [[1991 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1991 US Open semifinals]] which he later said were \"the best 11 days of my tennis career\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2015/02/10/connors-krickstein-turn-back-the-clock-with-reunion-match/23190289/|title=Jimmy Connors faces Aaron Krickstein in reunion match|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref> On his 39th birthday he defeated 24-year-old [[Aaron Krickstein]], 3\u20136, 7\u20136, 1\u20136, 6\u20133, 7\u20136, in 4 hours and 41 minutes, coming back from a 2\u20135 deficit in the final set. Connors then defeated [[Paul Haarhuis]] in the quarterfinals before losing to [[Jim Courier]]. 22 years later [[ESPN]] aired a documentary commemorating Connors' run.<ref name=\"30for30\"/>\n\nConnors participated in his last major tournament, in the 1992 US Open, where he beat [[Jaime Oncins]], 6\u20131, 6\u20132, 6\u20133 in the first round, before losing to Lendl (then ranked No. 7), 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 2\u20136, 0\u20136 in the second round.\n\nIn September 1992, Connors played [[Martina Navratilova]] in the third [[The Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]] tennis match at [[Caesars Palace]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. Connors was allowed only one serve per point and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won, 7\u20135, 6\u20132.\n\nHowever, this would not be the end of his playing career. As late as June 1995, three months shy of his 43rd birthday Connors beat [[S\u00e9bastien Lareau]], 6\u20134, 7\u20136, and [[Martin Sinner]], 7\u20136, 6\u20130, to progress to the quarterfinals of the Halle event in Germany. Connors lost this quarterfinal, 6\u20137, 3\u20136 to [[Marc Rosset]]. Connors' last match on the main ATP tour came in April 1996, when he lost, 2\u20136, 6\u20133, 1\u20136, to [[Richey Reneberg]] in Atlanta.<ref>ATP World Tour, Official Website. Player Information Jimmy Connors. Main Website http://www.atpworldtour.com/</ref>\n\n===Maverick===\nIn 1974, Connors and Riordan began filing lawsuits, amounting to $10 million, against the ATP and its president, [[Arthur Ashe]], for allegedly restricting his freedom in the game. The lawsuits stemmed from the French Open banning Connors in 1974 after he had signed a contract to play [[World Team Tennis]] (WTT) for the [[Baltimore Banners]]. Connors was seeking to enter the French Open, but the ATP and French officials opposed WTT because of scheduling conflicts, so the entries of WTT players were refused between 1974 and 1978. Connors dropped Riordan and eventually the lawsuits after losing to Ashe in the 1975 Wimbledon final (according to the official film produced by Wimbledon 1975, his $2 million suit against Ashe was still outstanding when the two met in the 1975 Wimbledon final).\n\nAt Wimbledon in 1977, he declined to participate in a parade of former champions to celebrate the tournament's centenary, choosing instead to practice in the grounds with Ilie Nastase while the parade took place. In 2000, he also declined to join a gathering of 58 former champions held to mark the millennium. In his 2013 autobiography, Connors blamed his missing the 1977 parade on the All England Club for not letting his doctor onto the grounds so that Connors could try on a customized splint for a thumb injury. Connors explained that this necessitated his rushing to meet the doctor at the entrance to the grounds, and then convincing Nastase to help him try out the splint on a practice court. By Connors' account, he then rushed to Centre Court for the parade, but was too late. He was booed when he played his first round match the next day. Reaching the final, he lost in five sets to Borg, who a month later was able briefly to interrupt Connors's long hold on the world No. 1 ranking.\n\nConnors also irritated sponsors and tennis officials by shunning the end-of-year [[Tennis Masters Cup|Masters]] championship from 1974 through 1976. However, he entered this round-robin competition in 1977 when it moved to New York City. Although Connors lost a celebrated late-night match to Vilas, 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 5\u20137, he took the title by defeating Borg in the final, 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 6\u20134.\n\n===Distinctions and honors===\nConnors won a male record 109 singles titles.<ref>[http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=18 James Scott Connors- International Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119111954/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=18 |date=November 19, 2006 }}</ref> He also won 16 doubles titles (including the men's doubles titles at Wimbledon in 1973 and the US Open in 1975).

The 31 semifinals stood as a record until surpassed by Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2012. The 41 quarterfinals remained a record until Roger Federer surpassed it at Wimbledon 2014. Connors was the only player to win the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] on three different surfaces: [[grass court|grass]], [[clay court|clay]], and [[hard court|hard]]. He was also the first male tennis player to win [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles on three different surfaces: grass (1974), clay (1976), and hard (1978).\n\nConnors was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1998 and [[Intercollegiate Tennis Association#Hall of Fame|Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Hall of Fame]] in 1986.

Larry Schwartz on ESPN.com said about Connors, \"His biggest weapons were an indomitable spirit, a two-handed backhand and the best service return in the game. It is difficult to say which was more instrumental in Connors becoming a champion.&nbsp;... Though smaller than most of his competitors, Connors didn't let it bother him, making up for a lack of size with determination.\"<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014143.html|title=ESPN.com: Connors conquered with intensity|work=go.com}}</ref> Of his own competitive nature Connors has said, \"[T]here's always somebody out there who's willing to push it that extra inch, or mile, and that was me. (Laughter) I didn't care if it took me 30 minutes or five hours. If you beat me, you had to be the best, or the best you had that day. But that was my passion for the game. If I won, I won, and if I lost, well, I didn't take it so well.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nHis on-court antics, designed to get the crowd involved, both helped and hurt his play. Schwartz said, \"While tennis fans enjoyed Connors's gritty style and his never-say-die attitude, they often were shocked by his antics. His sometimes vulgar on-court behavior\u2014like giving the finger to a linesman after disagreeing with a call or strutting about the court with the tennis racket handle between his legs; sometimes he would yank on the handle in a grotesque manner and his fans would go wild or groan in disapproval\u2014did not help his approval rating. During the early part of his career, Connors frequently argued with umpires, linesmen, the players union, [[Davis Cup]] officials and other players.

Segura advanced Connors' game of hitting the ball on the rise which enabled Connors to reflect the power and velocity of his opponents back at them. Segura was the master strategist in developing Jimmy's complete game. In the [[1975 Wimbledon]] final, [[Arthur Ashe]] countered this strategy by taking the pace off the ball, giving Connors only soft junk shots (dinks, drop shots, and lobs) to hit.\n\nIn an era when the [[serve and volley]] was the norm, [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]] excepted, Connors was one of the few players to hit the ball flat, low, and predominantly from the baseline. Connors hit his forehand with a semi-Western grip and with little net clearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.quickfound.net/training/jimmy_connors.html|title=Excerpts from How to Play Tougher Tennis by Jimmy Connors: QuickSports Tennis.|work=quickfound.net}}</ref> Contemporaries such as Arthur Ashe and commentators such as Joel Drucker characterized his forehand as his greatest weakness, especially on extreme pressure points, as it lacked the safety margin of hard forehands hit with topspin. His serve, while accurate and capable, was never a great weapon for him as it did not reach the velocity and power of his opponents.\n\nHis lack of a dominating serve and net game, combined with his individualist style and maverick tendencies, meant that he was not as successful in doubles as he was in singles, although he did win [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles with [[Ilie N\u0103stase]], reached a final with [[Chris Evert]], and accumulated 16 doubles titles during his career.\n\n===Racket evolution===\nAt a time when most other tennis pros played with wooden rackets, Connors used the \"Wilson T2000\" steel racket, which utilized a method for stringing that had been devised and patented by [[Lacoste]] in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/rackets/history.asp|title=Racket history|work=itftennis.com}}</ref><ref name=\"80t\">{{cite web|url=http://80s-tennis.com/pages/jimmy-connors.html|title=Jimmy Connors (USA)  80s-tennis.com|work=80s-tennis.com|access-date=April 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618204233/http://www.80s-tennis.com/pages/jimmy-connors.html|archive-date=June 18, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>  He played with this chrome tubular steel racket until 1984, when most other pros had shifted to new racket technologies, materials, and designs.<ref name=\"80t\" />\n\nAt the [[1983 Tokyo Indoor|Tokyo Indoor]] in October 1983, Connors switched to a new mid-size graphite racket, the Wilson ProStaff, that had been designed especially for him and he used it on the 1984 tour.<ref name=wot1984>{{cite book|title=World of Tennis 1984 : The Official Yearbook of the [[International Tennis Federation]]|year=1984|publisher=Willow Books|location=London|isbn=0-00-218122-3|page=150|editor=[[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]]}}</ref> But 1985 again found Connors playing with the T2000. In 1987, he finally switched to a graphite racket when he signed a contract with [[Slazenger]] to play their Panther Pro Ceramic. In 1990, Connors signed with Estusa.<ref name=\"80t\" />\n\nConnors used lead tape which he would wind around the racket head to provide the proper \"feel\" for his style of game.\n\n==Commentating==\nConnors did commentary with [[NBC-TV]] in 1990 and 1991, during its coverage of the [[French Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tournaments. During the Wimbledon tournaments of 2005, 2006, and 2007, Connors commentated for the [[BBC]] alongside [[John McEnroe]] (among others), providing moments of heated discussion between two former archrivals. Connors returned to BBC commentary at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in 2014. Connors has also served as a commentator and analyst for the [[Tennis Channel]] since the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] tournament of 2009.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/tennis/01/28/connors.tennis.channel.ap/index.html Ex-Tennis Great Jimmy Connors to Work for Tennis Channel] SI.com, January 28, 2009</ref>\n\n==Coaching==\nOn July 24, 2006, at the start of the [[Countrywide Classic]] tournament in Los Angeles, American tennis player [[Andy Roddick]] announced his partnership with Connors as his coach. In September, [[2006 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2006]] Roddick reached the final of the U.S. Open, where he lost to [[Roger Federer]]. On March 6, 2008, Roddick announced the end of that 19-month relationship.\n\nIn July 2013 former women's world No. 1 [[Maria Sharapova]] announced on her website that Connors was her new coach. On August 15, 2013 Sharapova confirmed that she had ended the partnership with Connors after just one match together.\n\n==Author==\nIn 2013, Connors published his autobiography ''The Outsider''.

Their engagement was broken off shortly before the 1975 Wimbledon championship. Connors and Evert briefly reconciled in 1976 and 1978, before parting for good. In May 2013, Connors wrote his autobiography in which he alleged that Evert was pregnant with their child and that she unilaterally made the decision to have an abortion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jimmy|first=Connors|title=The Outsider|year=2013|publisher=Bantam/HarperCollins|location=New York City, NY|isbn=978-0-593-06927-1|pages=132\u2013133}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jimmy|first=Connors|title=Today Show Interview|url=http://www.today.com/news/jimmy-connors-chris-evert-abortion-we-were-young-1C9872997|publisher=NBC News Today Show|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Chris|title=Jimmy Connors implies Chris Evert was pregnant with his child|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/05/jimmy-connors-chris-evert-pregnant/|accessdate=September 6, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFormer [[Miss World]] [[Marjorie Wallace]] was engaged to Connors from 1976 to 1977, but in 1979 Connors married ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Patti McGuire]].
