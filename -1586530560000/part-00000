It is the second novel in [[The Echorium Sequence]], and it is the sequel to'' [[Song Quest]]''. The novel was first published in 2001 by the Chicken House.\n\n== Plot introduction ==\n\nCrystal Mask is set in the world of the [[Isle of Echoes]] where the Singers live in [[The Echorium]]. The Singers have many special abilities, the most important of which is knowledge of the Songs of Power: Challa for sleep, Kashe for laughter, Shi for sadness, Aushan for fear and Yehn for death. All Singer children, called novices, learn these Songs, but if their voices do not last into adulthood they receive a mild form of Yehn which makes them forget the Songs. The Singers can also farlisten to hear over great distances, an ability enhanced by the bluestone which the Isle is made up of, and hear truth. The Singers help to keep peace on the mainland, and produce treaties to protect Half Creatures \u2013 the half-human beings with knowledge of the Songs, which include merlee (fish people), naga (water snake people) and quetzal (bird people).\n\nDuring the novel [[Song Quest]], set twenty years before Crystal Mask, the Singers encountered a powerful enemy in Khizpriest Frazhin, who harnessed the powers of a strange black crystal called the khiz to manipulate people's thoughts and memories. He attempted to destroy the Echorium by kidnapping a novice, Rialle, and was only stopped by the efforts of another novice, Kherron, who had originally been taken in by Frazhin. Although Frazhin was apparently killed by quetzal after the Battle of the Merlee at the end of Song Quest, and finished off by being sung Yehn over a distance, his body was never recovered. While the khiz was thought to be destroyed, the arrival of a girl for treatment with memories of a khiz crystal mask which steals thoughts leads the Echorium to believe that Frazhin may have survived.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\n[[Renn]], a gifted but often bullied Eight Year novice in [[the Echorium]] who can speak to Half-Creatures, is asked to assist the Singers by translating for Shaiala Two-Hoof, a wild girl brought to the Island for treatment, who claims to have been raised by centaurs. Although initially the pair argue, meeting Rialle helps to calm Shaiala and she begins to remember, enough to reveal that her memories were wiped using a mask made of khiz. Second Singer Kherron takes this excuse to insist that Shaiala and Renn leave with him to search for Frazhin, the escaped khizpriest whose body was never found. After this revelation, Rialle takes Shaiala, who was very disturbed by her recollections, and Renn to come to the cave where she lives and meet the merlee. While Shaiala swims with the merlee, Renn rejects their friendly offers and is horrified to learn that \"crazy\" Rialle is his mother.\n\nThe next day, Renn and Shaiala leave with Kherron on the Wavesong, heading to Southport. On the journey, Renn is irritable and offends Shaiala by refusing to believe her tales of centaurs. Kherron also gives Shaiala a bluestone necklace. Upon arrival, the group begins to explore Southport and Shaiala, despite being closelyguarded by a pentad of orderlies including Frenn and Lazim, escapes, only to become lost in the rough part of the city. She is kidnapped and thrown in a cellar with several street children, and [[Erihan]], the son of [[Lord Nahar]], the leader of the [[Kalerei]] tribe of Horselords. The children are taken away by barge towards the Plains.\n\nWhile Kherron attempts to trace Shaiala through her bluestone necklace, they rapidly lose track of the barge. Meanwhile, the children meet \"[[Yashra|Aunt Yashra]]\", a seemingly kindly pregnant woman who asks to hear each child sing, and then chooses some to return to her \"Singing Palace\" while others are to be \"gotten rid of\". This disturbs Shaiala, who recognises Yashra, and causes friction between the children, with many of those chosen wanting to stay. However, after three days of cramped conditions, they hatch a plan to escape. Shaiala kicks a hole in the side of the boat for the children to escape through, but several are left behind as the boat begins to sink, attracting the crew's attention. Shaiala and the other remaining children are taken to Aunt Yashra's camp, where Yashra uses the khiz mask to make them passive. Shaiala remembers the mask and, with Erihan's help, escapes. Shaiala and Erihan steal Yashra's horses and head onto the Plains together to search for tracks - Erihan for Horselord's, Shaiala for centaur's.\n\nMeanwhile, Renn is asked to track Shaiala's bluestone, as novices are more sensitive than Singers. Although they follow the barge for a few days, Renn is shocked when the bluestone is suddenly underwater, and he fears Shaiala has drowned. However, the bluestone is soon retrieved by a Half-Creature similar to a merlee, known as a naga. The Singers follow the naga upriver, and eventually arrange a meeting. The naga shows them its collection of 'sparklies' \u2013 consisting of Shaiala's bluestone, a piece of khiz and Erihan's dagger. Seeing Erihan's dagger, the Singers are attacked by Lord Nahar and the Kaleri, who have been following the Singers in their search for Erihan. After a brief confrontation, the two groups agree to work together, and the Horselords tell the Singers about the Sunless Valley, reachable only through the Pass of Silence, where they suspect the children have been taken. Renn contacts the naga again and, in exchange for the return of a 'sparkly', it tells them where it found the dagger \u2013 with Shaiala's bluestone \u2013 and where it found the khiz, in the mountains. However, it leaves before Renn can ask if it knows another way into the Sunless Valley.\n\nMeanwhile, Shaiala and Erihan eventually track down Shaiala's herd of centaurs by the Dancing Canyons. Seeing them, Shaiala remembers why no-one else had spotted them - the adults use herdstones to bend light around the herd, rendering it invisible. Shaiala offers to take herdstones to the centaur foals enslaved in the Sunless Valley, and she and Erihan travel there through underwater caves, guided by naga, within which they see khiz crystal poisoning the naga eggs. Meanwhile, the Singers attempt to get through the Pass of Silence, a pass so precarious that the slightest noise can start an avalanche. However, when they are attacked, Renn accidentally cries out, setting off an avalanche. Frenn and another orderly are killed, Kherron is captured, a crystal forced into his throat, and is taken away, and only Renn's quick thinking saves himself and the other orderlies from the second avalanche set off by the Harai guarding the Pass. Grateful, Lazim finally explains how Frazhin disappeared after the Battle of the Merlee twenty years ago, and, although those sent to find his body disappeared, he was not considered a threat after the khiz was destroyed.\n\nWhile the orderlies attempt to disable to gong used to set off avalanches in the Pass of Silence - thereby allowing Lord Nahar and the Kaleri to pass through safely - Renn hides, only to be caught by Yashra as she brings in the captured street children, and be taken to the Khizalace - Yashra's stronghold. However, there is trouble in the Valley - Shaiala and Erihan have arrived to find the captured centaurs working as slaves to mine khiz, and have freed them with herdstones, leading a revolution. The angry foals storm the palace, leaving Shaiala and Erihan no choice but to follow. They get inside the Khizalace, but are soon separated from the centaurs. Instead, they find a group of street children, apparently hypnotised, and follow them to their dormitory, which is dominated by the presence of a giant khiz crystal. Although the pair quickly disable the guards, they are unable to break the crystal's hold on the children, and only just keep from succumbing themselves.\n\nRenn is taken to see Singer Kherron in the dungeons, who is clearly badly injured by the khiz crystal in his throat. Frazhin arrives, and attempts to force Kherron to teach the children in the Khizalace the Songs of Power, scorning the Singer's attempts to break free. Frazhin threatens that if Kherron does not help him, he will harm Renn - whom Frazhin believes to be Kherron's son. It is made clear in the conversation that Yashra's unborn child is Frazhin's. Renn is taken away, but escapes from his guards when he hears of a \"wild centaur girl\" causing havoc in the dormitories. He hurries to find Shaiala attempting to crack the khiz with her kicks, and helps her to crack the crystal and free the children. With the Khizalace shattering around them from the blow, the Harai flee, and Shaiala and Renn hurry to free Kherron, whose voice is badly damaged from the crystal, then join the battle outside.\n\nWith the arrival of the Kaleri, the battle has turned in the Singer's favour, at least until Yashra appears and seals the gates against them with khiz power, trapping them inside. Although she seems victorious, capturing Erihan as a hostage and controlling the khiz against the Kaleri, she is distracted when Singer Kherron warns her to keep an eye on Frazhin, who is trying to escape without her. She hurries after him, and between Renn's singing and the centaur's kicks, the gates are destroyed. When the group catches up to Yashra, she is watching from the lakeshore as Frazhin on a boat in the centaur calls to the naga. Although they help him initially, they suddenly turn on him and pull him under the water. Yashra, trapped by the Singers, is offered a choice: immediate execution or life on the Echorium until her child is born followed by a course of Yehn. She chooses the Echorium, for the sake of her child, and protests before she is taken away that Frazhin's crimes are the Singer's fault, for destroying his hopes of joining them when he was a child.\n\nAfter leaving the valley, Shaiala and Renn forget their earlier disagreements, and with Renn's singing to assist her, Shaiala successfully cracks rock to find her own herdstone. A songless Kherron, after reporting to the Echorium with Renn's help, admits that, while he would be glad to call himself Renn's father, Rialle had a close relationship with Frenn - who Renn was named for - and Renn's parentage is uncertain. Shaiala joins the Kaleri to learn to be a tribeswoman from Erihan's mother, and Renn returns to the Echorium, where he reconciles with Rialle and the merlee.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Major characters ===\n\n* '''[[Shaiala]]''' \u2013 A human child brought up by [[centaur]]s, but her tribe was ransacked and the centaur foals taken to the mines in the Sunless Valley to work for [[Yashra]] mining [[khiz]]. Later, she is brought to the [[Isle of Echoes]], home of the Singers, for a dose of Singer healing to regain her memory that was erased, discovering that it was erased by [[Frazhin]] using khiz crystal. She travels for a short while with [[Renn]] and the Singers to Southport but becomes separated when she runs away from their grasp and ends up captured by child snatches. Escaping from her captors, she later travels with [[Erihan]]; one of the other captured children to regroup with her centaur and find [[Erihan]]'s father and tribe.\n* '''[[Renn]]''' \u2013 A novice singer from [[The Echorium]] who is the son of singer [[Rialle]] and [[Frenn]]. He discovers he is able to understand [[Shaiala]]'s half creature language after encountering her at the Five Thousand Steps on the [[Isle of Echoes]]. [[Renn]] is unfriendly and abusive towards [[Shaiala]] showing a stubborn attitude towards her and the trip he is brought along on. Renn realises his differences with Shaiala towards the end of the story and they stop arguing. Renn is taken with [[Kherron]] on a quest to find more about Shaiala's past and the Khizpriest Frazhin. He discovers his talents and destroys the large khiz crystal at the Khizalace, destroying the mind control device that was controlling the captured children that were being held there.\n* '''[[Kherron]]''' \u2013 The Second Singer of [[The Echorium]] and enemy of Lord [[Frazhin]] who has the ability to control the powers of the [[khiz]] crystal. He was also part of the previous novel in the trilogy called [[Song Quest]] as novice [[Kherron]] being one of the main characters associated with the plot. He has had a troubled past and shows this through his forceful and impatient characteristics as Second Singer.\n* '''[[Erihan]]''' \u2013 The son of the Horse [[Lord Nahar]] and Prince of the [[Kalerei]] who gets captured by the Harai when he is carried downstream a river to Southport and picked by them. He makes friends with [[Shaiala]]; also from the Purple Plains and joins with her to find his father and tribe and her centaur tribe. This ultimately ends in a final quest to free the children and centaur slaves at the Khizalace.\n* '''[[Lord Nahar|Nahar]]''' \u2013 The leader of the [[Kalerei]] who helps [[Kherron]] and the Singers to defeat [[Yashra]] as they share a common goal to free the children slaves and [[centaur]]s at the Khizalace which she and Frazhin are holding. He has a son named [[Erihan]], Prince of the [[Kalerei]] who is also a main character in the novel. Lord Nahar's assistance at the Khizalace results in a victory with his army of the Kalerei and the Singers, they defeat Frazhin again and capture Yashra.\n* '''[[Yashra]]''' \u2013 An evil woman who owns a mask made from [[khiz]] crystal that she uses to link and keep in contact with the half-living Lord [[Frazhin]]. She is an enemy of [[The Echorium]] who helps [[Frazhin]] enslave human children and [[centaur]]s that  they use to quarry for the [[khiz]] crystal she and [[Frazhin]] need. She later has a child named [[Kyarra]] who is mentioned as the unborn child in Crystal Mask and later appears in the last novel of the trilogy [[Dark Quetzal]].\n* '''[[Frazhin]]''' \u2013 An evil male character who [[Yashra]] works with. He also features in the prequel [[Song Quest]] as the Khizpriest; manipulating the minds of others and using the [[khiz-crystal]]s to detect if someone is lying, as well as other functions like wiping memories. He works with [[Yashra]] to enslave [[centaur]]s and human children for their own purposes. He is believed to have died at the end of Crystal Mask as the nagas looked to have killed him at the lake outside the Khizalace but as the sequel is written it seems he survived.\n\n=== Minor characters ===\n\n* '''Imari, Laphie and the other captured children''' \u2013 Imari and Laphie are characters [[Shaiala]] encounters once she is captured by the Harai in the docks of Southport. [[Erihan]] (who later becomes a major part within the novel), Imari, Laphie and Teggi are some of the more prominent children captured by Harai's men, with Teggi being the more charismatic character influencing and leading the children.\n* '''Rafiz Longshadow''' \u2013 One of the captured centaurs taken to the Sunless Valley to work under the mines to collect [[khiz]] crystals for [[Frazhin]] and [[Yashra]]. A centaur friend of [[Shaiala]] who appears at the beginning in the description of one of [[Shaiala]]'s flashbacks and at the end when Shaiala frees the centaurs and uses the herdstones to gain an advantage against destroying the palace.\n* '''Kamara Silvermane''' \u2013 Another one of the captured centaurs taken to the Sunless Valley to work under mines. Kamara is also a friend of Shaiala's who helps the other centaurs destroy the Khizalace.\n* '''Alaira and Geran''' \u2013 Both appear at the very beginning of the novel as classmates of [[Renn]]; novice singer at [[The Echorium]]. Alaira and Geran bully [[Renn]] at times specifically at the beginning they bullied him into going with them to observe a crazy being brought to [[The Echorium]] which therefore led to the discovery of his talents (being able to speak half-creature language).\n* '''Ollaron''' \u2013 A teacher at [[The Echorium]] who features at the beginning of the novel, teaching [[Renn]]'s class a history lesson of [[The Echorium]]. Ironically he talks about the \"Battle of the Merlee\" which is referring to the plotline within the prequel [[Song Quest]] when Rialle persuades the Merlee to conjure storms and destroy the ships [[Frazhin]] was bringing to the [[Isle of Echoes]]. Ollaron explains what happened to Lord Javelly from Song Quest, who apparently died from the Yehn the Singers were singing at the Pentangle on the Isle of Echoes which appears inconceivable as it is too far away to be transmitted that far but this explained as the Lord Javelly was given a trust gift by the second singer in Song Quest which ultimately killed him as the bluestone necklace the Lord was given amplified the song and killed the wearer which was Lord Javelly. Ollaron is described as an old ancient man almost as old as the events he teachers within his history lessons.\n* '''First Singer Graia''' \u2013 The First Singer of [[The Echorium]] during the times of the Crystal Mask. She features in [[Song Quest]] as one of the teachers of [[The Echorium]]. She appears once in the book at the very beginning when she is in the Pentangle with the rest of the Singers trying to heal a crazy (person who is not right in the head and in this case has a loss of memory).\n* '''Singer Rialle''' \u2013 No longer a full-time Singer, Rialle from [[Song Quest]] appears at the beginning during the Pentangle session and afterwards when she takes [[Renn]] and [[Shaiala]] to see her home on the Isle of Echoes which is in a cave away from [[The Echorium]]. The most likely location of this cave is probably where [[Kherron]] in Song Quest went to investigate which was a series of caves along the beach.\n* '''Lazim''' \u2013 From [[Song Quest]] he has a minor part throughout the novel and travels with Second Singer [[Kherron]] and the other Singers on their quest to investigate [[Shaiala]]'s story. He survived the avalanche at the Pass of Silence and helped destroy the Khizalace. He is an orderly not a singer as he joins The Echorium in Song Quest.\n* '''Frenn''' \u2013 From Song Quest he also has a minor part, travelling with the Singer group on their quest. Frenn dies during the avalanche at the Pass of Silence and is later revealed as [[Renn]]'s father. Frenn is not officially a Singer but an orderly.\n\n== Major themes ==\n\nThe plot is similar to [[Song Quest]] as the story follows young novices who have the chance to adventure outside [[The Echorium]], which is rare for their age. Crystal Mask relies on Song Quest its storyline to be understood; for example about [[Renn]]'s parents and concerning the centaur tribes. Crystal Mask contains many instances of arguments and abuse towards each of the characters, such as the arguments between [[Renn]] and [[Shaiala]] with [[Renn]]'s stubbornness towards [[Shaiala]]'s ignorance and impatience.\n\nCrystal Mask is based on a general plotline, involving setting off on a quest, becoming separated, and each party finding its own way to a final destination, gaining experience, acquiring allies, and overcoming difficulties along the way.<ref name=\"good\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/c/crystal-mask |title=Goodtoread.org reviewing Crystal Mask at |access-date=2006-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902023812/http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/c/crystal-mask |archive-date=2006-09-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[The Echorium Sequence]] uses themes from [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (book series)|Earthsea]] and [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s [[Pern]] in the sense of merlee and half creatures in conjunction with human beings and singers.\n\n=== Half-creatures ===\n\nThe usage of [[half-creatures]] is a theme throughout [[The Echorium Sequence]] as the general plot behind each of the three novels concerns or involves half creatures or mentions of them through references. Crystal Mask focuses on centaurs, which are half creatures native to the Dancing Canyons who are enslaved by the khizpriests.\n\nAlso, the Singers have a bond with half-creatures at a young age as some novices are able to understand the half-creatures' languages, but this eventually fades as they become older, with the exception of Rialle who has retained her ability to communicate with them.\n\nThrough Crystal Mask, a symbiotic relationship is seen between the half-creatures and the Singers. At the beginning of the book, it describes how humans and half-creatures lived in harmony with each other, but the humans went back on their old ways and started to progress and forget about half creatures. The Singers were the group of people who moved away from all this to keep to their old traditions so they moved to the [[Isle of Echoes]] and this is how the mutual relationship between half-creatures and humans was kept throughout the history of the trilogy.\n\n=== Khiz ===\n\n[[Khiz]] plays a major part in the Crystal Mask, with the manipulation of the crystals for mind control and to erase people's memories. Yashra for example used the [[khiz]]-crystal to seduce children to come to her palace in the Sunless Valley and sing for her. [[Yashra]] and [[Frazhin]] both use khiz to keep in contact with other using masks as Frazhin is fatally injured and cannot come with her on her travels.\n\nKhiz is also detrimental to the Singers ability to use their voice as it becomes weaker in the vicinity of khiz. Khiz also pollutes the nagas habitats, as described at the end of Crystal Mask that the khiz-crystals were polluting the nagas watercourse in the Sunless Valley.\n\n=== Songs of Power ===\n\nThe Songs of Power were the songs used by the Singers for different situations and effects. The effects of these songs are:\n\n* Challa \u2013 Dream Song. Most common form of healing. Puts people to sleep and helps people forget their troubles\n* Kashe \u2013 Laughter Song. Wakes people up, and cures depression in them.\n* Shi \u2013 Pain Song. Forces people to confront their pain and heals through tears.\n* Aushan \u2013 Fear Song. Gives life to inner fears and makes people scream.\n* Yehn \u2013 Death Song. Closes doors in the head. In extreme cases, leads to a form of living death.\n\nSingers use these powers to control the environment around them and to keep peace within the region which they live in with humans and half-creatures. The songs have immense power and can only be dwarfed by the manipulation of khiz-crystals which dims the effect of the Songs.\n\n== Allusions/references to other works ==\n\nCrystal Mask relies on its prequel, [[Song Quest]], for the reader to fully understand the novel's storyline. The plot, as regards to [[Renn]]'s true parents, can partially be explained from [[Song Quest]] with the friendship of [[Frenn]] and [[Rialle]]. Some of the main characters in [[Song Quest]] feature in Crystal Mask, following on 20 years into the future but do not have a major part within the storyline.<ref>Review of Song Quest/Crystal Mask pertaining some reference to the whole series\u2014literary qualities [http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/s/song-quest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050216/http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/s/song-quest |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe setting is roughly the same as [[Song Quest]], located at the [[Isle of Echoes]] and the shoreline of the continent to the west of the island. At the beginning is a scene set in a history lesson being taught by Singer Ollaron who refers to events 20 years in the past that occurred in the novel Song Quest. The theme of half-creatures is still apparent within Crystal Mask; like in [[Song Quest]], they play a major part within the storyline.\n\n== Literary criticism ==\n\nCrystal Mask received mixed reviews with several negative comments; Goodtoread.org commented that, \"The characters seem stilted, never really fulfilling their initial promise,\" and that it relies too much on the previous book [[Song Quest]] to truly appreciate the plot behind some of the novel.<ref name=\"good\"/>\n\nAlso, Goodtoread.org said, \"The characters of [[Renn]] and [[Shaiala]] who interest the reader at first quickly become pale and flat plot devices with only occasional moments of relief and colour.\" <ref name=\"good\"/>\n\nOther comments made by Goodtoread.org were, \"Music clearly plays an important, almost mystical, part in the history of the story. Song is used by those trained in its use for healing, laughter, discipline, even death. There is no sign, however, of recreational music.\" <ref name=\"good\"/>\n\n[[Kirkus Reviews]] said, \"It is difficult to distinguish heroes and villains on the basis of either their actions or their attitudes,\" referring to the fact that the main characters appear aggressive and violent towards each other as well as ignorant and abusive. According to Kirkus Reviews, [[Erihan]] is the only truly appealing character within Crystal Mask, showing kindness and friendship towards [[Shaiala]]. Kirkus Reviews also said, \"As the final confrontation sputters into an inconclusive anticlimax, the one interesting revelation, which might explain some contradictions, is pointlessly repudiated,\" referring to discovery of [[Renn]]'s true parents. Kirkus Reviews concluded in their review that \"Fans of the first book might enjoy the updates on favorite characters; but hardly anyone else will care. Crystal Mask fails to include any likable inhabitants.\"<ref name=\"Kirkus\">[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780439440837&itm=1 Kirkus Reviews comments displayed at Barnes & Noble.com]</ref>\n\nBut author [[Jacqueline Wilson]] said, \"There are so many deft, exciting and original touches. I raced through it occasionally moved to tears.\" <ref name=\"blurb\">Blurb printed on back of Crystal Mask paperback edition</ref>\n\nThe majority of reviewers raised the point that the novel was poorly concluded and lacked a climax and interest at events such as the discovery of [[Renn]]'s true parents and the destruction of [[Yashra]]'s palace. Reviewers pointed out that the characters lacked development with most of the speech, including arguments and abuse between the main characters. The recurring characters from [[Song Quest]], such as [[Kherron]], also showed similar characteristics to the prequel such as their ignorance and weak mindedness. Other comments raised were concerned with the plot, that it was too slow to start with and contained dull and plain characters bringing little interest at first. It is also noted that it is better to read the prequel before reading Crystal Mask as many of the sub-plots are not understandable from reading only the second book.\n\nPositive comments raised were the original touches used within the book, such as the concept of Singers and half creatures which have references to other novels' work. The [[School Library Journal]] said the world she has created is original and detailed <ref name=\"Library\">[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780439440837&itm=1 School Library Journal's comments displayed at Barnes & Noble.com]</ref> with cliff hangers and realistic responses from the characters to situations raised in the plot. The [[School Library Journal]] also said the novel had a consistent pace and mystery surrounding the plot to maintain interest, contradicting what was raised by Kirkus Reviews who stated the novel as having an \"inconclusive anticlimax\".<ref name=\"Kirkus\"/>\n\n== Release details ==\n\n* 2001, UK, The Chicken House, {{ISBN|1-903434-19-X}}, Pub date 1 Aug 2001, Hardback\n* 2002, UK, The Chicken House, {{ISBN|1-903434-56-4}}, Pub date 1 Jul 2002, Paperback\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.katherineroberts.com/ Katherine Roberts homepage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902023812/http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/c/crystal-mask Review of Crystal Mask]\n\n[[Category:British fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:2001 British novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Katherine Roberts]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{infobox book | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Crystal Mask\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = Crystal Mask - Bookcover.jpg\n| image_size = 200px\n| caption = Early paperback edition cover\n| author        = [[Katherine Roberts]]\n| illustrator   = James Marsh\n| cover_artist  = \n| country       = United Kingdom\n| language      = English\n| series        = [[The Echorium Sequence]]\n| genre         = [[Fantasy novel|Fantasy]] \n| publisher     = [[Scholastic Corporation|The Chicken House]]\n| release_date  = August 1, 2001\n| english_release_date = Aug 1, [[2001 in literature|2001]]\n| media_type    = Print ([[Hardcover|Hardback]] & [[Paperback]])\n| pages         = 255  (first edition, hardback)\n| isbn =  1-903434-19-X\n| oclc= 46910021\n| preceded_by   = [[Song Quest]]\n| followed_by   = [[Dark Quetzal]]\n}}\n\n'''''Crystal Mask''''' is a [[fantasy literature|fantasy novel]] by English writer [[Katherine Roberts]]. It is the second novel in [[The Echorium Sequence]], and it is the sequel to'' [[Song Quest]]''. The novel was first published in 2001 by the Chicken House.\n\n== Plot introduction ==\n\nCrystal Mask is set in the world of the [[Isle of Echoes]] where the Singers live in [[The Echorium]]. The Singers have many special abilities, the most important of which is knowledge of the Songs of Power: Challa for sleep, Kashe for laughter, Shi for sadness, Aushan for fear and Yehn for death. All Singer children, called novices, learn these Songs, but if their voices do not last into adulthood they receive a mild form of Yehn which makes them forget the Songs. The Singers can also farlisten to hear over great distances, an ability enhanced by the bluestone which the Isle is made up of, and hear truth. The Singers help to keep peace on the mainland, and produce treaties to protect Half Creatures - the half-human beings with knowledge of the Songs, which include merlee (fish people), naga (water snake people) and quetzal (bird people).\n\nDuring the novel [[Song Quest]], set twenty years before Crystal Mask, the Singers encountered a powerful enemy in Khizpriest Frazhin, who harnessed the powers of a strange black crystal called the khiz to manipulate people's thoughts and memories. He attempted to destroy the Echorium by kidnapping a novice, Rialle, and was only stopped by the efforts of another novice, Kherron, who had originally been taken in by Frazhin. Although Frazhin was apparently killed by quetzal after the Battle of the Merlee at the end of Song Quest, and finished off by being sung Yehn over a distance, his body was never recovered. While the khiz was thought to be destroyed, the arrival of a girl for treatment with memories of a khiz crystal mask which steals thoughts leads the Echorium to believe that Frazhin may have survived.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\n[[Renn]], a gifted but often bullied Eight Year novice in [[the Echorium]] who can speak to Half-Creatures, is asked to assist the Singers by translating for Shaiala Two-Hoof, a wild girl brought to the Island for treatment, who claims to have been raised by centaurs. Although initially the pair argue, meeting Rialle helps to calm Shaiala and she begins to remember, enough to reveal that her memories were wiped using a mask made of khiz. Second Singer Kherron takes this excuse to insist that Shaiala and Renn leave with him to search for Frazhin, the escaped khizpriest whose body was never found. After this revelation, Rialle takes Shaiala, who was very disturbed by her recollections, and Renn to come to the cave where she lives and meet the merlee. While Shaiala swims with the merlee, Renn rejects their friendly offers and is horrified to learn that \"crazy\" Rialle is his mother.\n\nThe next day, Renn and Shaiala leave with Kherron on the Wavesong, heading to Southport. On the journey, Renn is irritable and offends Shaiala by refusing to believe her tales of centaurs. Kherron also gives Shaiala a bluestone necklace. Upon arrival, the group begin to explore Southport and Shaiala, despite being closelyguarded by a pentad of orderlies including Frenn and Lazim, escapes, only to become lost in the rough part of the city. She is kidnapped and thrown in a cellar with several street children, and [[Erihan]], the son of [[Lord Nahar]], the leader of the [[Kalerei]] tribe of Horselords. The children are taken away by barge towards the Plains.\n\nWhile Kherron attempts to trace Shaiala through her bluestone necklace, they rapidly lose track of the barge. Meanwhile, the children meet \"[[Yashra|Aunt Yashra]]\", a seemingly kindly pregnant woman who asks to hear each child sing, and then chooses some to return to her \"Singing Palace\" while others are to be \"gotten rid of\". This disturbs Shaiala, who recognises Yashra, and causes friction between the children, with many of those chosen wanting to stay. However, after three days of cramped conditions, they hatch a plan to escape. Shaiala kicks a hole in the side of the boat for the children to escape through, but several are left behind as the boat begins to sink, attracting the crew's attention. Shaiala and the other remaining children are taken to Aunt Yashra's camp, where Yashra uses the khiz mask to make them passive. Shaiala remembers the mask and, with Erihan's help, escapes. Shaiala and Erihan steal Yashra's horses and head onto the Plains together to search for tracks - Erihan for Horselord's, Shaiala for centaur's.\n\nMeanwhile, Renn is asked to track Shaiala's bluestone, as novices are more sensitive than Singers. Although they follow the barge for a few days, Renn is shocked when the bluestone is suddenly underwater, and he fears Shaiala has drowned. However, the bluestone is soon retrieved by a Half-Creature similar to a merlee, known as a naga. The Singers follow the naga upriver, and eventually arrange a meeting. The naga shows them its collection of 'sparklies' - consisting of Shaiala's bluestone, a piece of khiz and Erihan's dagger. Seeing Erihan's dagger, the Singers are attacked by Lord Nahar and the Kaleri, who have been following the Singers in their search for Erihan. After a brief confrontation, the two groups agree to work together, and the Horselords tell the Singers about the Sunless Valley, reachable only though the Pass of Silence, where they suspect the children have been taken. Renn contacts the naga again and, in exchange for the return of a 'sparkly', it tells them where it found the dagger - with Shaiala's bluestone - and where it found the khiz, in the mountains. However, it leaves before Renn can ask if it knows another way into the Sunless Valley.\n\nMeanwhile, Shaiala and Erihan eventually track down Shaiala's herd of centaurs by the Dancing Canyons. Seeing them, Shaiala remembers why no-one else had spotted them - the adults use herdstones to bend light around the herd, rendering it invisible. Shaiala offers to take herdstones to the centaur foals enslaved in the Sunless Valley, and she and Erihan travel there through underwater caves, guided by naga, within which they see khiz crystal poisoning the naga eggs. Meanwhile, the Singers attempt to get through the Pass of Silence, a pass so precarious that the slightest noise can start an avalanche. However, when they are attacked, Renn accidentally cries out, setting off an avalanche. Frenn and another orderly are killed, Kherron is captured, a crystal forced into his throat, and is taken away, and only Renn's quick thinking saves himself and the other orderlies from the second avalanche set off by the Harai guarding the Pass. Grateful, Lazim finally explains how Frazhin disappeared after the Battle of the Merlee twenty years ago, and, although those sent to find his body disappeared, he was not considered a threat after the khiz was destroyed.\n\nWhile the orderlies attempt to disable to gong used to set off avalanches in the Pass of Silence - thereby allowing Lord Nahar and the Kaleri to pass through safely - Renn hides, only to be caught by Yashra as she brings in the captured street children, and be taken to the Khizalace - Yashra's stronghold. However, there is trouble in the Valley - Shaiala and Erihan have arrived to find the captured centaurs working as slaves to mine khiz, and have freed them with herdstones, leading a revolution. The angry foals storm the palace, leaving Shaiala and Erihan no choice but to follow. They get inside the Khizalace, but are soon separated from the centaurs. Instead, they find a group of street children, apparently hypnotised, and follow them to their dormitory, which is dominated by the presence of a giant khiz crystal. Although the pair quickly disable the guards, they are unable to break the crystal's hold on the children, and only just keep from succumbing themselves.\n\nRenn is taken to see Singer Kherron in the dungeons, who is clearly badly injured by the khiz crystal in his throat. Frazhin arrives, and attempts to force Kherron to teach the children in the Khizalace the Songs of Power, scorning the Singer's attempts to break free. Frazhin threatens that if Kherron does not help him, he will harm Renn - whom Frazhin believes to be Kherron's son. It is made clear in the conversation that Yashra's unborn child is Frazhin's. Renn is taken away, but escapes from his guards when he hears of a \"wild centaur girl\" causing havoc in the dormitories. He hurries to find Shaiala attempting to crack the khiz with her kicks, and helps her to crack the crystal and free the children. With the Khizalace shattering around them from the blow, the Harai flee, and Shaiala and Renn hurry to free Kherron, whose voice is badly damaged from the crystal, then join the battle outside.\n\nWith the arrival of the Kaleri, the battle has turned in the Singer's favour, at least until Yashra appears and seals the gates against them with khiz power, trapping them inside. Although she seems victorious, capturing Erihan as a hostage and controlling the khiz against the Kaleri, she is distracted when Singer Kherron warns her to keep an eye on Frazhin, who is trying to escape without her. She hurries after him, and between Renn's singing and the centaur's kicks, the gates are destroyed. When the group catches up to Yashra, she is watching from the lakeshore as Frazhin on a boat in the centaur calls to the naga. Although they help him initially, they suddenly turn on him and pull him under the water. Yashra, trapped by the Singers, is offered a choice: immediate execution or life on the Echorium until her child is born followed by a course of Yehn. She chooses the Echorium, for the sake of her child, and protests before she is taken away that Frazhin's crimes are the Singer's fault, for destroying his hopes of joining them when he was a child.\n\nAfter leaving the valley, Shaiala and Renn forget their earlier disagreements, and with Renn's singing to assist her, Shaiala successfully cracks rock to find her own herdstone. A songless Kherron, after reporting to the Echorium with Renn's help, admits that, while he would be glad to call himself Renn's father, Rialle had a close relationship with Frenn - who Renn was named for - and Renn's parentage is uncertain. Shaiala joins the Kaleri to learn to be a tribeswoman from Erihan's mother, and Renn returns to the Echorium, where he reconciles with Rialle and the merlee.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Major characters ===\n\n* '''[[Shaiala]]''' \u2013 A human child brought up by [[centaur]]s, but her tribe was ransacked and the centaur foals taken to the mines in the Sunless Valley to work for [[Yashra]] mining [[khiz]]. Later, she is brought to the [[Isle of Echoes]], home of the Singers, for a dose of Singer healing to regain her memory that was erased, discovering that it was erased by [[Frazhin]] using khiz crystal. She travels for a short while with [[Renn]] and the Singers to Southport but becomes separated when she runs away from their grasp and ends up captured by child snatches. Escaping from her captors, she later travels with [[Erihan]]; one of the other captured children to regroup with her centaur and find [[Erihan]]'s father and tribe.\n* '''[[Renn]]''' \u2013 A novice singer from [[The Echorium]] who is the son of singer [[Rialle]] and [[Frenn]]. He discovers he is able to understand [[Shaiala]]'s half creature language after encountering her at the Five Thousand Steps on the [[Isle of Echoes]]. [[Renn]] is unfriendly and abusive towards [[Shaiala]] showing a stubborn attitude towards her and the trip he is brought along on. Renn realises his differences with Shaiala towards the end of the story and they stop arguing. Renn is taken with [[Kherron]] on a quest to find more about Shaiala's past and the Khizpriest Frazhin. He discovers his talents and destroys the large khiz crystal at the Khizalace, destroying the mind control device that was controlling the captured children that were being held there.\n* '''[[Kherron]]''' \u2013 The Second Singer of [[The Echorium]] and enemy of Lord [[Frazhin]] who has the ability to control the powers of the [[khiz]] crystal. He was also part of the previous novel in the trilogy called [[Song Quest]] as novice [[Kherron]] being one of the main characters associated with the plot. He has had a troubled past and shows this through his forceful and impatient characteristics as Second Singer.\n* '''[[Erihan]]''' \u2013 The son of the Horse [[Lord Nahar]] and Prince of the [[Kalerei]] who gets captured by the Harai when he is carried downstream a river to Southport and picked by them. He makes friends with [[Shaiala]]; also from the Purple Plains and joins with her to find his father and tribe and her centaur tribe. This ultimately ends in a final quest to free the children and centaur slaves at the Khizalace.\n* '''[[Lord Nahar|Nahar]]''' \u2013 The leader of the [[Kalerei]] who helps [[Kherron]] and the Singers to defeat [[Yashra]] as they share a common goal to free the children slaves and [[centaur]]s at the Khizalace which she and Frazhin are holding. He has a son named [[Erihan]], Prince of the [[Kalerei]] who is also a main character in the novel. Lord Nahar's assistance at the Khizalace results in a victory with his army of the Kalerei and the Singers, they defeat Frazhin again and capture Yashra.\n* '''[[Yashra]]''' \u2013 An evil woman who owns a mask made from [[khiz]] crystal that she uses to link and keep in contact with the half-living Lord [[Frazhin]]. She is an enemy of [[The Echorium]] who helps [[Frazhin]] enslave human children and [[centaur]]s that  they use to quarry for the [[khiz]] crystal she and [[Frazhin]] need. She later has a child named [[Kyarra]] who is mentioned as the unborn child in Crystal Mask and later appears in the last novel of the trilogy [[Dark Quetzal]].\n* '''[[Frazhin]]''' \u2013 An evil male character who [[Yashra]] works with. He also features in the prequel [[Song Quest]] as the Khizpriest; manipulating the minds of others and using the [[khiz-crystal]]s to detect if someone is lying, as well as other functions like wiping memories. He works with [[Yashra]] to enslave [[centaur]]s and human children for their own purposes. He is believed to have died at the end of Crystal Mask as the nagas looked to have killed him at the lake outside the Khizalace but as the sequel is written it seems he survived.\n\n=== Minor characters ===\n\n* '''Imari, Laphie and the other captured children''' \u2013 Imari and Laphie are characters [[Shaiala]] encounters once she is captured by the Harai in the docks of Southport. [[Erihan]] (who later becomes a major part within the novel), Imari, Laphie and Teggi are some of the more prominent children captured by Harai's men, with Teggi being the more charismatic character influencing and leading the children.\n* '''Rafiz Longshadow''' \u2013 One of the captured centaurs taken to the Sunless Valley to work under the mines to collect [[khiz]] crystals for [[Frazhin]] and [[Yashra]]. A centaur friend of [[Shaiala]] who appears at the beginning in the description of one of [[Shaiala]]'s flashbacks and at the end when Shaiala frees the centaurs and uses the herdstones to gain an advantage against destroying the palace.\n* '''Kamara Silvermane''' \u2013 Another one of the captured centaurs taken to the Sunless Valley to work under mines. Kamara is also a friend of Shaiala's who helps the other centaurs destroy the Khizalace.\n* '''Alaira and Geran''' \u2013 Both appear at the very beginning of the novel as classmates of [[Renn]]; novice singer at [[The Echorium]]. Alaira and Geran bully [[Renn]] at times specifically at the beginning they bullied him into going with them to observe a crazy being brought to [[The Echorium]] which therefore led to the discovery of his talents (being able to speak half-creature language).\n* '''Ollaron''' \u2013 A teacher at [[The Echorium]] who features at the beginning of the novel, teaching [[Renn]]'s class a history lesson of [[The Echorium]]. Ironically he talks about the \"Battle of the Merlee\" which is referring to the plotline within the prequel [[Song Quest]] when Rialle persuades the Merlee to conjure storms and destroy the ships [[Frazhin]] was bringing to the [[Isle of Echoes]]. Ollaron explains what happened to Lord Javelly from Song Quest, who apparently died from the Yehn the Singers were singing at the Pentangle on the Isle of Echoes which appears inconceivable as it is too far away to be transmitted that far but this explained as the Lord Javelly was given a trust gift by the second singer in Song Quest which ultimately killed him as the bluestone necklace the Lord was given amplified the song and killed the wearer which was Lord Javelly. Ollaron is described as an old ancient man almost as old as the events he teachers within his history lessons.\n* '''First Singer Graia''' \u2013 The First Singer of [[The Echorium]] during the times of the Crystal Mask. She features in [[Song Quest]] as one of the teachers of [[The Echorium]]. She appears once in the book at the very beginning when she is in the Pentangle with the rest of the Singers trying to heal a crazy (person who is not right in the head and in this case has a loss of memory).\n* '''Singer Rialle''' \u2013 No longer a full-time Singer, Rialle from [[Song Quest]] appears at the beginning during the Pentangle session and afterwards when she takes [[Renn]] and [[Shaiala]] to see her home on the Isle of Echoes which is in a cave away from [[The Echorium]]. The most likely location of this cave is probably where [[Kherron]] in Song Quest went to investigate which was a series of caves along the beach.\n* '''Lazim''' \u2013 From [[Song Quest]] he has a minor part throughout the novel and travels with Second Singer [[Kherron]] and the other Singers on their quest to investigate [[Shaiala]]'s story. He survived the avalanche at the Pass of Silence and helped destroy the Khizalace. He is an orderly not a singer as he joins The Echorium in Song Quest.\n* '''Frenn''' \u2013 From Song Quest he also has a minor part, travelling with the Singer group on their quest. Frenn dies during the avalanche at the Pass of Silence and is later revealed as [[Renn]]'s father. Frenn is not officially a Singer but an orderly.\n\n== Major themes ==\n\nThe plot is similar to [[Song Quest]] as the story follows young novices who have the chance to adventure outside [[The Echorium]], which is rare for their age. Crystal Mask relies on Song Quest its storyline to be understood; for example about [[Renn]]'s parents and concerning the centaur tribes. Crystal Mask contains many instances of arguments and abuse towards each of the characters, such as the arguments between [[Renn]] and [[Shaiala]] with [[Renn]]'s stubbornness towards [[Shaiala]]'s ignorance and impatience.\n\nCrystal Mask is based on a general plotline, involving setting off on a quest, becoming separated, and each party finding its own way to a final destination, gaining experience, acquiring allies, and overcoming difficulties along the way.<ref name=\"good\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/c/crystal-mask |title=Goodtoread.org reviewing Crystal Mask at |access-date=2006-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902023812/http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/c/crystal-mask |archive-date=2006-09-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[The Echorium Sequence]] uses themes from [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (book series)|Earthsea]] and [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s [[Pern]] in the sense of merlee and half creatures in conjunction with human beings and singers.\n\n=== Half-creatures ===\n\nThe usage of [[half-creatures]] is a theme throughout [[The Echorium Sequence]] as the general plot behind each of the three novels concerns or involves half creatures or mentions of them through references. Crystal Mask focuses on centaurs, which are half creatures native to the Dancing Canyons who are enslaved by the khizpriests.\n\nAlso, the Singers have a bond with half-creatures at a young age as some novices are able to understand the half-creatures' languages, but this eventually fades as they become older, with the exception of Rialle who has retained her ability to communicate with them.\n\nThrough Crystal Mask, a symbiotic relationship is seen between the half-creatures and the Singers. At the beginning of the book, it describes how humans and half-creatures lived in harmony with each other, but the humans went back on their old ways and started to progress and forget about half creatures. The Singers were the group of people who moved away from all this to keep to their old traditions so they moved to the [[Isle of Echoes]] and this is how the mutual relationship between half-creatures and humans was kept throughout the history of the trilogy.\n\n=== Khiz ===\n\n[[Khiz]] plays a major part in the Crystal Mask, with the manipulation of the crystals for mind control and to erase people's memories. Yashra for example used the [[khiz]]-crystal to seduce children to come to her palace in the Sunless Valley and sing for her. [[Yashra]] and [[Frazhin]] both use khiz to keep in contact with other using masks as Frazhin is fatally injured and cannot come with her on her travels.\n\nKhiz is also detrimental to the Singers ability to use their voice as it becomes weaker in the vicinity of khiz. Khiz also pollutes the nagas habitats, as described at the end of Crystal Mask that the khiz-crystals were polluting the nagas watercourse in the Sunless Valley.\n\n=== Songs of Power ===\n\nThe Songs of Power were the songs used by the Singers for different situations and effects. The effects of these songs are:\n\n* Challa \u2013 Dream Song. Most common form of healing. Puts people to sleep and helps people forget their troubles\n* Kashe \u2013 Laughter Song. Wakes people up, and cures depression in them.\n* Shi \u2013 Pain Song. Forces people to confront their pain and heals through tears.\n* Aushan \u2013 Fear Song. Gives life to inner fears and makes people scream.\n* Yehn \u2013 Death Song. Closes doors in the head. In extreme cases, leads to a form of living death.\n\nSingers use these powers to control the environment around them and to keep peace within the region which they live in with humans and half-creatures. The songs have immense power and can only be dwarfed by the manipulation of khiz-crystals which dims the effect of the Songs.\n\n== Allusions/references to other works ==\n\nCrystal Mask relies on its prequel, [[Song Quest]], for the reader to fully understand the novel's storyline. The plot, as regards to [[Renn]]'s true parents, can partially be explained from [[Song Quest]] with the friendship of [[Frenn]] and [[Rialle]]. Some of the main characters in [[Song Quest]] feature in Crystal Mask, following on 20 years into the future but do not have a major part within the storyline.<ref>Review of Song Quest/Crystal Mask pertaining some reference to the whole series\u2014literary qualities [http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/s/song-quest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050216/http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/s/song-quest |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe setting is roughly the same as [[Song Quest]], located at the [[Isle of Echoes]] and the shoreline of the continent to the west of the island. At the beginning is a scene set in a history lesson being taught by Singer Ollaron who refers to events 20 years in the past that occurred in the novel Song Quest. The theme of half-creatures is still apparent within Crystal Mask; like in [[Song Quest]], they play a major part within the storyline.\n\n== Literary criticism ==\n\nCrystal Mask received mixed reviews with several negative comments; Goodtoread.org commented that, \"The characters seem stilted, never really fulfilling their initial promise,\" and that it relies too much on the previous book [[Song Quest]] to truly appreciate the plot behind some of the novel.<ref name=\"good\"/>\n\nAlso, Goodtoread.org said, \"The characters of [[Renn]] and [[Shaiala]] who interest the reader at first quickly become pale and flat plot devices with only occasional moments of relief and colour.\" <ref name=\"good\"/>\n\nOther comments made by Goodtoread.org were, \"Music clearly plays an important, almost mystical, part in the history of the story. Song is used by those trained in its use for healing, laughter, discipline, even death. There is no sign, however, of recreational music.\" <ref name=\"good\"/>\n\n[[Kirkus Reviews]] said, \"It is difficult to distinguish heroes and villains on the basis of either their actions or their attitudes,\" referring to the fact that the main characters appear aggressive and violent towards each other as well as ignorant and abusive. According to Kirkus Reviews, [[Erihan]] is the only truly appealing character within Crystal Mask, showing kindness and friendship towards [[Shaiala]]. Kirkus Reviews also said, \"As the final confrontation sputters into an inconclusive anticlimax, the one interesting revelation, which might explain some contradictions, is pointlessly repudiated,\" referring to discovery of [[Renn]]'s true parents. Kirkus Reviews concluded in their review that \"Fans of the first book might enjoy the updates on favorite characters; but hardly anyone else will care. Crystal Mask fails to include any likable inhabitants.\"<ref name=\"Kirkus\">[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780439440837&itm=1 Kirkus Reviews comments displayed at Barnes & Noble.com]</ref>\n\nBut author [[Jacqueline Wilson]] said, \"There are so many deft, exciting and original touches. I raced through it occasionally moved to tears.\" <ref name=\"blurb\">Blurb printed on back of Crystal Mask paperback edition</ref>\n\nThe majority of reviewers raised the point that the novel was poorly concluded and lacked a climax and interest at events such as the discovery of [[Renn]]'s true parents and the destruction of [[Yashra]]'s palace. Reviewers pointed out that the characters lacked development with most of the speech, including arguments and abuse between the main characters. The recurring characters from [[Song Quest]], such as [[Kherron]], also showed similar characteristics to the prequel such as their ignorance and weak mindedness. Other comments raised were concerned with the plot, that it was too slow to start with and contained dull and plain characters bringing little interest at first. It is also noted that it is better to read the prequel before reading Crystal Mask as many of the sub-plots are not understandable from reading only the second book.\n\nPositive comments raised were the original touches used within the book, such as the concept of Singers and half creatures which have references to other novels' work. The [[School Library Journal]] said the world she has created is original and detailed <ref name=\"Library\">[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780439440837&itm=1 School Library Journal's comments displayed at Barnes & Noble.com]</ref> with cliff hangers and realistic responses from the characters to situations raised in the plot. The [[School Library Journal]] also said the novel had a consistent pace and mystery surrounding the plot to maintain interest, contradicting what was raised by Kirkus Reviews who stated the novel as having an \"inconclusive anticlimax\".<ref name=\"Kirkus\"/>\n\n== Release details ==\n\n* 2001, UK, The Chicken House, {{ISBN|1-903434-19-X}}, Pub date 1 Aug 2001, Hardback\n* 2002, UK, The Chicken House, {{ISBN|1-903434-56-4}}, Pub date 1 Jul 2002, Paperback\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.katherineroberts.com/ Katherine Roberts homepage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902023812/http://www.goodtoread.org/books.cgi/initial/c/crystal-mask Review of Crystal Mask]\n\n[[Category:British fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:2001 British novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Katherine Roberts]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through; mos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Mask"}

It is as well related to personal and professional care practices. In medicine and everyday life settings, hygiene practices are employed as preventive measures to reduce the incidence and spreading of disease.\n\nHygiene practices vary, and what is considered acceptable in one [[culture]] might not be acceptable in another.\n\nIn the manufacturing of food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other products, good hygiene is a critical component of [[quality assurance]].\n\nThe terms [[cleanliness]] and hygiene are often used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In general, hygiene refers to practices that prevent spread of disease-causing organisms. Cleaning processes (e.g., handwashing) remove infectious microbes as well as dirt and soil, and are thus often the means to achieve hygiene.\n\nOther uses of the term appear in phrases including ''body hygiene, personal hygiene, [[sleep hygiene]], [[mental hygiene]], [[Oral hygiene|dental hygiene]],'' and ''[[occupational hygiene]]'', used in connection with [[public health]]. ''Hygiene'' is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion and preservation of health.\n\n==Medical hygiene==\nMedical hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes the spread of disease.\n\nMedical hygiene practices include:\n* [[Isolation (health care)|Isolation]] or [[quarantine]] of infectious persons or materials to prevent spread of infection.\n* [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] of instruments used in [[surgery|surgical procedures]].\n* Use of protective clothing and barriers, such as [[Surgical mask|masks]], [[Hospital gown|gowns]], [[cap]]s, [[Eye protection|eyewear]] and [[Medical gloves|gloves]].\n* Proper [[Bandage|bandaging]] and [[dressing (medical)|dressing]] of [[injuries]].\n* Safe [[waste disposal|disposal]] of [[hazardous waste|medical waste]].\n* Disinfection of reusables (i.e., linen, pads, uniforms).\n* Scrubbing up, hand-washing, especially in an operating room, but in more general health-care settings as well, where diseases can be transmitted.\n\nMost of these practices were developed in the 19th century and were well established by the mid-20th century. Some procedures (such as disposal of [[medical waste]]) were refined in response to late-20th century disease outbreaks, notably [[AIDS]] and [[Ebola]].\n\n== Home and everyday hygiene ==\nHome hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices that prevent or minimize the spread of disease at home and other everyday settings such as social settings, public transport, the workplace, public places, etc.\n\nHygiene in a variety of settings plays an important role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.<ref name=\"globalburden\">{{cite web|vauthors=Bloomfield SF, Exner M, Fara GM, Nath KJ, Scott EA, Van der Voorden C|title=The global burden of hygiene-related diseases in relation to the home and community|url=https://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/review/global-burden-hygiene-related-diseases-relation-home-and-community|publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene|date=2009}}</ref> It includes procedures used in a variety of domestic situations such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, food and water hygiene, general home hygiene (hygiene of environmental sites and surfaces), care of domestic animals, and home health care (the care of those who are at greater risk of infection).\n\nAt present, these components of hygiene tend to be regarded as separate issues, although based on the same underlying microbiological principles. Preventing the spread of diseases means breaking the chain of infection transmission. Simply put, if the chain of infection is broken, infection cannot spread. In response to the need for effective codes of hygiene in home and everyday life settings the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a [[probabilistic risk analysis|risk-based approach]] based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point ([[HACCP]]), also referred to as \"targeted hygiene.\" Targeted hygiene is based on identifying the routes of pathogen spread in the home and introducing hygiene practices at critical times to break the chain of infection.\n\nThe main sources of infection in the home<ref name=\"sustainability\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/review/chain-infection-transmission-home-and-everyday-life-settings-and-role-hygiene-reducing-risk|title=The Chain of Infection Transmission in the Home and Everyday Life Settings, and the Role of Hygiene in Reducing the Risk of Infection|publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene|date=2012}}</ref> are people (who are carriers or are infected), foods (particularly raw foods) and water, and domestic animals (in the U.S. more than 50% of homes have one or more pets<ref>{{Cite book|title=U.S. Pet Ownership & Demographics Sourcebook|last=|first=|publisher=AMVA|year=2012|isbn=978-1-882691-28-9|location=Schaumburg, IL|pages=}}</ref>). Sites that accumulate stagnant water\u2014such as sinks, [[toilet]]s, waste pipes, cleaning tools, face cloths, etc. readily support microbial growth and can become secondary reservoirs of infection, though species are mostly those that threaten \"at risk\" groups. [[Pathogens]] (potentially infectious bacteria, viruses etc.\u2014colloquially called \"germs\") are constantly shed from these sources via mucous membranes, feces, vomit, skin scales, etc. Thus, when circumstances combine, people are exposed, either directly or via food or water, and can develop an infection.\n\nThe main \"highways\" for the spread of pathogens in the home are the hands, hand and food contact surfaces, and cleaning cloths and utensils. Pathogens can also be spread via clothing and household linens, such as [[towels]]. Utilities such as toilets and wash basins, for example, were invented for dealing safely with human waste but still have risks associated with them. Safe disposal of human waste is a fundamental need; poor [[sanitation]] is a primary cause of diarrhea disease in low income communities. Respiratory viruses and fungal spores are spread via the air.\n\nGood home hygiene means engaging in hygiene practices at critical points to break the chain of infection.<ref name=sustainability /> Because the \"infectious dose\" for some pathogens can be very small (10-100 viable units or even less for some viruses), and infection can result from direct transfer of pathogens from surfaces via hands or food to the mouth, nasal mucous or the eye, 'hygienic cleaning' procedures should be sufficient to eliminate pathogens from critical surfaces.\n\nHygienic cleaning can be done through:\n* Mechanical removal (i.e., cleaning) using a [[soap]] or [[detergent]]. To be effective as a hygiene measure, this process must be followed by thorough rinsing under running water to remove pathogens from the surface.\n* Using a process or product that inactivates the pathogens in situ. Pathogen kill is achieved using a \"micro-biocidal\" product, i.e., a [[disinfectant]] or [[antibacterial]] product; [[hand sanitizer|waterless hand sanitizer]]; or by application of heat.\n* In some cases combined pathogen removal with kill is used, e.g., laundering of clothing and household linens such as towels and bed linen.\n\n===Hand washing===\n{{main|Hand washing}}\n[[File:Finished UDDT in Pumpuentsa (5630907486).jpg|thumb|A tippy tap for handwashing after using a [[urine-diverting dry toilet]] in Pumpuentsa, Ecuador]]\nHand hygiene is defined as [[hand washing]] or washing hands and nails with soap and water or using a [[hand sanitizer|water less hand sanitizer]].

A [https://soleme.in/?v=6c8403f93333 toilet seat] sanitizer helps to kill bacteria just as any other sanitizer which helps to protect from UTI.  Pathogens can survive in the scum or scale left behind on baths, [[shower]]s and wash basins after washing and bathing.\n\nWater left stagnant in the pipes of showers can be contaminated with pathogens that become airborne when the shower is turned on. If a shower has not been used for some time, it should be left to run at a hot temperature for a few minutes before use.\n\nThorough cleaning is important in preventing the spread of fungal infections.<ref name=scott2010>Scott E.

Soil and microbes from fabrics are severed and suspended in the wash water. These are then \"washed away\" during the rinse and spin cycles. In addition to physical removal, micro-organisms can be killed by thermal inactivation which increases as the temperature is increased. Chemical inactivation of microbes by the surfactants and activated oxygen-based bleach used in detergents contributes to the hygiene effectiveness of laundering. Adding hypochlorite bleach in the washing process achieves inactivation of microbes. A number of other factors can contribute including drying and ironing.\n\nDrying laundry on a line in direct sunlight is known to reduce pathogens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nLaundry detergents contain a mix of ingredients including surfactants, builders, optical brighteners, etc. Cleaning action arises primarily from the action of the surfactants and other ingredients, which are designed to maximise release and suspension of dirt and microbes into the wash liquid, together with enzymes and/or an activated oxygen-based bleach which digest and remove stains. Although activated oxygen bleach is included in many powder detergents to digest and remove stains, it produces some chemical inactivation of bacteria, fungi and viruses. As a rule of thumb, powders and tablets normally contain an activated oxygen bleach, but liquids and all products (liquid or powder) used for \"coloureds\" do not. Surfactants also exert some chemical inactivation action against certain species although the extent of their action is not known.\n\nIn 2013 the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene (IFH) reviewed some 30 studies of the hygiene effectiveness of laundering at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 70&nbsp;\u00b0C, under varying conditions.<ref>{{cite web |vauthors=Bloomfield SF, Exner M, Signorelli C, Scott EA |title=Effectiveness of laundering processes used in domestic (home) settings |date=2013|publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/review/effectiveness-laundering-processes-used-domestic-home-settings-2013}}</ref> A key finding was the lack of standardisation and control within studies, and the variability in test conditions between studies such as wash cycle time, number of rinses, etc. The consequent variability in the data (i.e., the reduction in contamination on fabrics) obtained, in turn makes it extremely difficult to propose guidelines for laundering with any confidence, based on currently available data.

Across the world, governments are increasingly under pressure to fund the level of healthcare that people expect. Care of increasing numbers of patients in the community, including at home is one answer, but can be fatally undermined by inadequate infection control in the home. Increasingly, all of these \"at-risk\" groups are cared for at home by a carer who may be a household member who thus requires a good knowledge of hygiene. People with reduced immunity to infection, who are looked after at home, make up an increasing proportion of the population (currently up to 20%).<ref name=globalburden/> The largest proportion are the elderly who have co-morbidities, which reduce their immunity to infection. It also includes the very young, patients discharged from hospital, taking immuno-suppressive drugs or using invasive systems, etc. For patients discharged from hospital, or being treated at home special \"medical hygiene\" (see above) procedures may need to be performed for them e.g. catheter or dressing replacement, which puts them at higher risk of infection.\n\n[[Antiseptic]]s may be applied to cuts, wounds abrasions of the skin to prevent the entry of harmful bacteria that can cause sepsis. Day-to-day hygiene practices, other than special medical hygiene procedures<ref name=\"trainingresource\">{{cite web |title=Home hygiene \u2013 prevention of infection at home: a training resource for carers and their trainers |date=2003 |publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-training/home-hygiene-%E2%80%93-prevention-infection-home-training-resource-carers-and-their}}</ref> are no different for those at increased risk of infection than for other family members. The difference is that, if hygiene practices are not correctly carried out, the risk of infection is much greater.\n\n===Disinfectants and antibacterials in home hygiene===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n[[disinfectant|Chemical disinfectants]] are products that kill [[pathogens]]. If the product is a disinfectant, the label on the product should say \"disinfectant\" or \"kills\" pathogens. Some commercial products, e.g. bleaches, even though they are technically disinfectants, say that they \"kill pathogens\" but are not actually labelled as \"disinfectants\". Not all disinfectants kill all types of pathogens. All disinfectants kill bacteria (called bactericidal). Some also kill fungi (fungicidal), bacterial spores (sporicidal) or viruses (virucidal).\n\nAn [[antibacterial soap|antibacterial]] product is a product that acts against bacteria in some unspecified way. Some products labelled \"antibacterial\" kill bacteria while others may contain a concentration of active ingredient that only prevent them multiplying. It is, therefore, important to check whether the product label states that it \"kills\" bacteria.\" An antibacterial is not necessarily anti-fungal or anti-viral unless this is stated on the label.\n\nThe term [[disinfection|sanitizer]] has been used to define substances that both clean and disinfect. More recently this term has been applied to alcohol-based products that disinfect the hands ([[hand sanitizer|alcohol hand sanitizers]]). Alcohol hand sanitizers however are not considered to be effective on soiled hands.\n\nThe term [[biocide]] is a broad term for a substance that kills, inactivates or otherwise controls living organisms. It includes [[antiseptics]] and disinfectants, which combat micro-organisms, and [[pesticides]].\n\n=== Home hygiene in developing countries ===\nIn [[Developing country|developing countries]], universal access to water and [[sanitation]] has been seen as the essential step in reducing the preventable infectious diseases burden, but it is now clear that this is best achieved by programs that integrate hygiene promotion with improvements in water quality and availability, and [[sanitation]]. This approach has been integrated into the [[Sustainable Development Goal]] Number 6 whose second target states: \"By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end [[open defecation]], paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations\".<ref name=\"SDG6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref> Due to their close linkages, water, sanitation, hygiene are together abbreviated and funded under the term [[WASH]] in [[Development aid|development cooperation]].\n\nAbout 2 million people die every year due to diarrheal diseases, most of them are children less than 5 years of age.<ref name=\"WHO2008\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/|title=The global burden of disease: 2004 update|website=World Health Organization}}</ref> The most affected are the populations in developing countries, living in extreme conditions of poverty, normally peri-urban dwellers or rural inhabitants.

Motivations for personal hygiene practice include reduction of personal illness, healing from personal illness, optimal health and sense of wellbeing, social acceptance and prevention of spread of illness to others. What is considered proper personal hygiene can be cultural-specific and may change over time.\n\nPractices that are generally considered proper hygiene include showering or bathing regularly, [[Hand washing|washing hands]] regularly and especially before handling food, washing scalp hair, keeping hair short or removing hair, wearing clean clothing, brushing teeth, cutting finger nails, besides other practices. Some practices are gender-specific, such as by a woman during her [[menstruation]]. [[Toiletry bag]]s holds body hygiene and toiletry supplies.\n\n[[Anal hygiene]] is the practice that a person performs on the anal area of themselves after [[defecation]]. The [[anus]] and [[buttocks]] may be either washed with liquids or wiped with [[toilet paper]] or adding [[gel wipe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2018/06/15/toilet-paper-gel-cleans-up-no-2-in-more-ways-than-one/#30aa3f9e9a44 |title=Toilet Paper Gel Cleans Up No. 2 In More Ways Than One|publisher=}}</ref> to toilet tissue as an alternative to [[wet wipes]] or other solid materials in order to remove remnants of [[Human feces|feces]].\n\nPeople tend to develop a routine for attending to their personal hygiene needs. Other personal hygienic practices would include covering one's mouth when coughing, disposal of soiled tissues appropriately, making sure toilets are clean, and making sure food handling areas are clean, besides other practices. Some cultures do not kiss or shake hands to reduce transmission of bacteria by contact.\n\n[[Personal grooming]] extends personal hygiene as it pertains to the maintenance of a good personal and public appearance, which need not necessarily be hygienic. It may involve, for example, using deodorants or perfume, shaving, or combing, besides other practices.\n\n===Excessive body hygiene===\nExcessive body hygiene is one example of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]].\n\n====Excessive body hygiene and allergies====\nThe [[hygiene hypothesis]] was first formulated in 1989 by Strachan who observed that there was an inverse relationship between family size and development of atopic allergic disorders\u2014the more children in a family, the less likely they were to develop these [[allergies]].<ref name=\"Strachan2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Strachan|first1=DP|title=Family size, infection and atopy: the first decade of the 'hygiene hypothesis'|journal=Thorax|date=August 2000|volume=55|issue=1|pages=S2\u2013S10|pmc=1765943|pmid=10943631|doi=10.1136/thorax.55.suppl_1.s2}}</ref> From this, he hypothesized that a lack of exposure to \"infections\" in early childhood transmitted by contact with older siblings could be a cause of the rapid rise in atopic disorders over the last 30 to 40 years. Strachan further proposed that the reason why this exposure no longer occurs is not only because of the trend towards smaller families, but also \"improved household amenities and higher standards of [[personal hygiene|personal cleanliness]]\".\n\nAlthough there is substantial evidence that some microbial exposures in early childhood can in some way protect against allergies, there is no evidence that humans need exposure to harmful microbes (infection) or that it is necessary to suffer a clinical infection.<ref name=\"hh\">{{cite web |vauthors=Stanwell Smith R, Bloomfield SF, Rook GA |title=The Hygiene Hypothesis and its Implications for Home Hygiene, Lifestyle and Public Health|publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-hypothesis-and-its-implications-home-hygiene-lifestyle-and-public-0 |date=2012}}</ref><ref name=\"hhsummary\">{{cite web |title=The Hygiene Hypothesis and its implications for home hygiene, lifestyle and public health: Summary |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-hypothesis-and-its-implications-home-hygiene-lifestyle-and-public |publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene|date=2012}}</ref><ref name=\"tooclean\">{{cite journal|last1=Bloomfield|first1=S.

This has caused concern among health professionals that everyday life hygiene behaviours, which are the foundation of public health, are being undermined. In response to the need for effective hygiene in home and everyday life settings, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a \"risk-based\" or targeted approach to home hygiene that seeks to ensure that hygiene measures are focussed on the places, and at the times most critical for infection transmission.<ref name=sustainability/> Whilst targeted hygiene was originally developed as an effective approach to hygiene practice, it also seeks, as far as possible, to sustain \"normal\" levels of exposure to the microbial flora of our environment to the extent that is important to build a balanced immune system.\n\n====Excessive body hygiene of internal ear canals====\n{{See also|Earwax}}\n\nExcessive body hygiene of the [[ear canals]] can result in infection or irritation. The ear canals require less body hygiene care than other parts of the body, because they are sensitive, and the body adequately cares for them. Most of the time the ear canals are self-cleaning; that is, there is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining the ear canal from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear. Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the ear canal out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/ear_wax/page2.htm|title=Ear Wax Symptoms, Treatment, Causes \u2013 When should ear wax be removed? |work=medicinenet.com}}</ref> Attempts to clean the ear canals through the removal of [[earwax]] can reduce ear canal cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed.\n\nExcessive application of soaps, creams, and ointments can adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin. For examples, soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and external substances can be absorbed, to disturb natural hormonal balances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Oral hygiene ===\n{{Main|Oral hygiene}}\n\nIt is recommended that all healthy adults brush twice a day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/basics/brushing-and-flossing|title=Brushing & Flossing: Technique & Choosing Dental Products |website=www.colgate.com}}</ref> softly,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2014/11/18/4131191.htm|title=Can you brush your teeth too hard? \u2013 Health & Wellbeing|first=Australian Broadcasting|last=Corporation|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref> with the correct technique, replacing their toothbrush every few months (~3) or after a bout of illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/b/brushing-your-teeth|title=Brush Teeth |publisher= American Dental Association|website=www.mouthhealthy.org}}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of common oral hygiene misconceptions.

It is as well related to personal and professional care practices. In medicine and everyday life settings, hygiene practices are employed as preventive measures to reduce the incidence and spreading of disease.\n\nHygiene practices vary, and what is considered acceptable in one [[culture]] might not be acceptable in another.\n\nIn the manufacturing of food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other products, good hygiene is a critical component of [[quality assurance]].\n\nThe terms [[cleanliness]] and hygiene are often used interchangeably, which can cause confusion. In general, hygiene refers to practices that prevent spread of disease-causing organisms. Cleaning processes (e.g., handwashing) remove infectious microbes as well as dirt and soil, and are thus often the means to achieve hygiene.\n\nOther uses of the term appear in phrases including ''body hygiene, personal hygiene, [[sleep hygiene]], [[mental hygiene]], [[Oral hygiene|dental hygiene]],'' and ''[[occupational hygiene]]'', used in connection with [[public health]]. ''Hygiene'' is also the name of a branch of science that deals with the promotion and preservation of health.\n\n==Medical hygiene==\nMedical hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes the spread of disease.\n\nMedical hygiene practices include:\n* [[Isolation (health care)|Isolation]] or [[quarantine]] of infectious persons or materials to prevent spread of infection.\n* [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] of instruments used in [[surgery|surgical procedures]].\n* Use of protective clothing and barriers, such as [[Surgical mask|masks]], [[Hospital gown|gowns]], [[cap]]s, [[Eye protection|eyewear]] and [[Medical gloves|gloves]].\n* Proper [[Bandage|bandaging]] and [[dressing (medical)|dressing]] of [[injuries]].\n* Safe [[waste disposal|disposal]] of [[hazardous waste|medical waste]].\n* Disinfection of reusables (i.e., linen, pads, uniforms).\n* Scrubbing up, hand-washing, especially in an operating room, but in more general health-care settings as well, where diseases can be transmitted.\n\nMost of these practices were developed in the 19th century and were well established by the mid-20th century. Some procedures (such as disposal of [[medical waste]]) were refined in response to late-20th century disease outbreaks, notably [[AIDS]] and [[Ebola]].\n\n== Home and everyday hygiene ==\nHome hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices that prevent or minimize the spread of disease at home and other everyday settings such as social settings, public transport, the workplace, public places, etc.\n\nHygiene in a variety of settings plays an important role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.<ref name=\"globalburden\">{{cite web|vauthors=Bloomfield SF, Exner M, Fara GM, Nath KJ, Scott EA, Van der Voorden C|title=The global burden of hygiene-related diseases in relation to the home and community|url=https://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/review/global-burden-hygiene-related-diseases-relation-home-and-community|publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene|date=2009}}</ref> It includes procedures used in a variety of domestic situations such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, food and water hygiene, general home hygiene (hygiene of environmental sites and surfaces), care of domestic animals, and home health care (the care of those who are at greater risk of infection).\n\nAt present, these components of hygiene tend to be regarded as separate issues, although based on the same underlying microbiological principles. Preventing the spread of diseases means breaking the chain of infection transmission. Simply put, if the chain of infection is broken, infection cannot spread. In response to the need for effective codes of hygiene in home and everyday life settings the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a [[probabilistic risk analysis|risk-based approach]] based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point ([[HACCP]]), also referred to as \"targeted hygiene.\" Targeted hygiene is based on identifying the routes of pathogen spread in the home and introducing hygiene practices at critical times to break the chain of infection.\n\nThe main sources of infection in the home<ref name=\"sustainability\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/review/chain-infection-transmission-home-and-everyday-life-settings-and-role-hygiene-reducing-risk|title=The Chain of Infection Transmission in the Home and Everyday Life Settings, and the Role of Hygiene in Reducing the Risk of Infection|publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene|date=2012}}</ref> are people (who are carriers or are infected), foods (particularly raw foods) and water, and domestic animals (in the U.S. more than 50% of homes have one or more pets<ref>{{Cite book|title=U.S. Pet Ownership & Demographics Sourcebook|last=|first=|publisher=AMVA|year=2012|isbn=978-1-882691-28-9|location=Schaumburg, IL|pages=}}</ref>). Sites that accumulate stagnant water\u2014such as sinks, [[toilet]]s, waste pipes, cleaning tools, face cloths, etc. readily support microbial growth and can become secondary reservoirs of infection, though species are mostly those that threaten \"at risk\" groups. [[Pathogens]] (potentially infectious bacteria, viruses etc.\u2014colloquially called \"germs\") are constantly shed from these sources via mucous membranes, feces, vomit, skin scales, etc. Thus, when circumstances combine, people are exposed, either directly or via food or water, and can develop an infection.\n\nThe main \"highways\" for the spread of pathogens in the home are the hands, hand and food contact surfaces, and cleaning cloths and utensils. Pathogens can also be spread via clothing and household linens, such as [[towels]]. Utilities such as toilets and wash basins, for example, were invented for dealing safely with human waste but still have risks associated with them. Safe disposal of human waste is a fundamental need; poor [[sanitation]] is a primary cause of diarrhea disease in low income communities. Respiratory viruses and fungal spores are spread via the air.\n\nGood home hygiene means engaging in hygiene practices at critical points to break the chain of infection.<ref name=sustainability /> Because the \"infectious dose\" for some pathogens can be very small (10-100 viable units or even less for some viruses), and infection can result from direct transfer of pathogens from surfaces via hands or food to the mouth, nasal mucous or the eye, 'hygienic cleaning' procedures should be sufficient to eliminate pathogens from critical surfaces.\n\nHygienic cleaning can be done through:\n* Mechanical removal (i.e., cleaning) using a [[soap]] or [[detergent]]. To be effective as a hygiene measure, this process must be followed by thorough rinsing under running water to remove pathogens from the surface.\n* Using a process or product that inactivates the pathogens in situ. Pathogen kill is achieved using a \"micro-biocidal\" product, i.e., a [[disinfectant]] or [[antibacterial]] product; [[hand sanitizer|waterless hand sanitizer]]; or by application of heat.\n* In some cases combined pathogen removal with kill is used, e.g., laundering of clothing and household linens such as towels and bed linen.\n\n===Hand washing===\n{{main|Hand washing}}\n[[File:Finished UDDT in Pumpuentsa (5630907486).jpg|thumb|A tippy tap for handwashing after using a [[urine-diverting dry toilet]] in Pumpuentsa, Ecuador]]\nHand hygiene is defined as [[hand washing]] or washing hands and nails with soap and water or using a [[hand sanitizer|water less hand sanitizer]].

Pathogens can survive in the scum or scale left behind on baths, [[shower]]s and wash basins after washing and bathing.\n\nWater left stagnant in the pipes of showers can be contaminated with pathogens that become airborne when the shower is turned on. If a shower has not been used for some time, it should be left to run at a hot temperature for a few minutes before use.\n\nThorough cleaning is important in preventing the spread of fungal infections.<ref name=scott2010>Scott E.

Soil and microbes from fabrics are severed and suspended in the wash water. These are then \"washed away\" during the rinse and spin cycles. In addition to physical removal, micro-organisms can be killed by thermal inactivation which increases as the temperature is increased. Chemical inactivation of microbes by the surfactants and activated oxygen-based bleach used in detergents contributes to the hygiene effectiveness of laundering. Adding hypochlorite bleach in the washing process achieves inactivation of microbes. A number of other factors can contribute including drying and ironing.\n\nDrying laundry on a line in direct sunlight is known to reduce pathogens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nLaundry detergents contain a mix of ingredients including surfactants, builders, optical brighteners, etc. Cleaning action arises primarily from the action of the surfactants and other ingredients, which are designed to maximise release and suspension of dirt and microbes into the wash liquid, together with enzymes and/or an activated oxygen-based bleach which digest and remove stains. Although activated oxygen bleach is included in many powder detergents to digest and remove stains, it produces some chemical inactivation of bacteria, fungi and viruses. As a rule of thumb, powders and tablets normally contain an activated oxygen bleach, but liquids and all products (liquid or powder) used for \"coloureds\" do not. Surfactants also exert some chemical inactivation action against certain species although the extent of their action is not known.\n\nIn 2013 the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene (IFH) reviewed some 30 studies of the hygiene effectiveness of laundering at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 70&nbsp;\u00b0C, under varying conditions.<ref>{{cite web |vauthors=Bloomfield SF, Exner M, Signorelli C, Scott EA |title=Effectiveness of laundering processes used in domestic (home) settings |date=2013|publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/review/effectiveness-laundering-processes-used-domestic-home-settings-2013}}</ref> A key finding was the lack of standardisation and control within studies, and the variability in test conditions between studies such as wash cycle time, number of rinses, etc. The consequent variability in the data (i.e., the reduction in contamination on fabrics) obtained, in turn makes it extremely difficult to propose guidelines for laundering with any confidence, based on currently available data.

Across the world, governments are increasingly under pressure to fund the level of healthcare that people expect. Care of increasing numbers of patients in the community, including at home is one answer, but can be fatally undermined by inadequate infection control in the home. Increasingly, all of these \"at-risk\" groups are cared for at home by a carer who may be a household member who thus requires a good knowledge of hygiene. People with reduced immunity to infection, who are looked after at home, make up an increasing proportion of the population (currently up to 20%).<ref name=globalburden/> The largest proportion are the elderly who have co-morbidities, which reduce their immunity to infection. It also includes the very young, patients discharged from hospital, taking immuno-suppressive drugs or using invasive systems, etc. For patients discharged from hospital, or being treated at home special \"medical hygiene\" (see above) procedures may need to be performed for them e.g. catheter or dressing replacement, which puts them at higher risk of infection.\n\n[[Antiseptic]]s may be applied to cuts, wounds abrasions of the skin to prevent the entry of harmful bacteria that can cause sepsis. Day-to-day hygiene practices, other than special medical hygiene procedures<ref name=\"trainingresource\">{{cite web |title=Home hygiene \u2013 prevention of infection at home: a training resource for carers and their trainers |date=2003 |publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-training/home-hygiene-%E2%80%93-prevention-infection-home-training-resource-carers-and-their}}</ref> are no different for those at increased risk of infection than for other family members. The difference is that, if hygiene practices are not correctly carried out, the risk of infection is much greater.\n\n===Disinfectants and antibacterials in home hygiene===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\n[[disinfectant|Chemical disinfectants]] are products that kill [[pathogens]]. If the product is a disinfectant, the label on the product should say \"disinfectant\" or \"kills\" pathogens. Some commercial products, e.g. bleaches, even though they are technically disinfectants, say that they \"kill pathogens\" but are not actually labelled as \"disinfectants\". Not all disinfectants kill all types of pathogens. All disinfectants kill bacteria (called bactericidal). Some also kill fungi (fungicidal), bacterial spores (sporicidal) or viruses (virucidal).\n\nAn [[antibacterial soap|antibacterial]] product is a product that acts against bacteria in some unspecified way. Some products labelled \"antibacterial\" kill bacteria while others may contain a concentration of active ingredient that only prevent them multiplying. It is, therefore, important to check whether the product label states that it \"kills\" bacteria.\" An antibacterial is not necessarily anti-fungal or anti-viral unless this is stated on the label.\n\nThe term [[disinfection|sanitizer]] has been used to define substances that both clean and disinfect. More recently this term has been applied to alcohol-based products that disinfect the hands ([[hand sanitizer|alcohol hand sanitizers]]).

Motivations for personal hygiene practice include reduction of personal illness, healing from personal illness, optimal health and sense of wellbeing, social acceptance and prevention of spread of illness to others. What is considered proper personal hygiene can be cultural-specific and may change over time.\n\nPractices that are generally considered proper hygiene include showering or bathing regularly, [[Hand washing|washing hands]] regularly and especially before handling food, washing scalp hair, keeping hair short or removing hair, wearing clean clothing, brushing teeth, cutting finger nails, besides other practices. Some practices are gender-specific, such as by a woman during her [[menstruation]].

Other personal hygienic practices would include covering one's mouth when coughing, disposal of soiled tissues appropriately, making sure toilets are clean, and making sure food handling areas are clean, besides other practices. Some cultures do not kiss or shake hands to reduce transmission of bacteria by contact.\n\n[[Personal grooming]] extends personal hygiene as it pertains to the maintenance of a good personal and public appearance, which need not necessarily be hygienic. It may involve, for example, using deodorants or perfume, shaving, or combing, besides other practices.\n\n===Excessive body hygiene===\nExcessive body hygiene is one example of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]].\n\n====Excessive body hygiene and allergies====\nThe [[hygiene hypothesis]] was first formulated in 1989 by Strachan who observed that there was an inverse relationship between family size and development of atopic allergic disorders\u2014the more children in a family, the less likely they were to develop these [[allergies]].<ref name=\"Strachan2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Strachan|first1=DP|title=Family size, infection and atopy: the first decade of the 'hygiene hypothesis'|journal=Thorax|date=August 2000|volume=55|issue=1|pages=S2\u2013S10|pmc=1765943|pmid=10943631|doi=10.1136/thorax.55.suppl_1.s2}}</ref> From this, he hypothesized that a lack of exposure to \"infections\" in early childhood transmitted by contact with older siblings could be a cause of the rapid rise in atopic disorders over the last 30 to 40 years.

This has caused concern among health professionals that everyday life hygiene behaviours, which are the foundation of public health, are being undermined. In response to the need for effective hygiene in home and everyday life settings, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a \"risk-based\" or targeted approach to home hygiene that seeks to ensure that hygiene measures are focussed on the places, and at the times most critical for infection transmission.<ref name=sustainability/> Whilst targeted hygiene was originally developed as an effective approach to hygiene practice, it also seeks, as far as possible, to sustain \"normal\" levels of exposure to the microbial flora of our environment to the extent that is important to build a balanced immune system.\n\n====Excessive body hygiene of internal ear canals====\n{{See also|Earwax}}\n\nExcessive body hygiene of the [[ear canals]] can result in infection or irritation. The ear canals require less body hygiene care than other parts of the body, because they are sensitive, and the body adequately cares for them. Most of the time the ear canals are self-cleaning; that is, there is a slow and orderly migration of the skin lining the ear canal from the eardrum to the outer opening of the ear. Old earwax is constantly being transported from the deeper areas of the ear canal out to the opening where it usually dries, flakes, and falls out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/ear_wax/page2.htm|title=Ear Wax Symptoms, Treatment, Causes \u2013 When should ear wax be removed? |work=medicinenet.com}}</ref> Attempts to clean the ear canals through the removal of [[earwax]] can reduce ear canal cleanliness by pushing debris and foreign material into the ear that the natural movement of ear wax out of the ear would have removed.\n\nExcessive application of soaps, creams, and ointments can adversely affect certain of the natural processes of the skin. For examples, soaps and ointments can deplete the skin of natural protective oils and fat-soluble content such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and external substances can be absorbed, to disturb natural hormonal balances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Oral hygiene ===\n{{Main|Oral hygiene}}\n\nIt is recommended that all healthy adults brush twice a day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/basics/brushing-and-flossing|title=Brushing & Flossing: Technique & Choosing Dental Products |website=www.colgate.com}}</ref> softly,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2014/11/18/4131191.htm|title=Can you brush your teeth too hard? \u2013 Health & Wellbeing|first=Australian Broadcasting|last=Corporation|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref> with the correct technique, replacing their toothbrush every few months (~3) or after a bout of illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/b/brushing-your-teeth|title=Brush Teeth |publisher= American Dental Association|website=www.mouthhealthy.org}}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of common oral hygiene misconceptions.

The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters.

and [[executive body]] and a general state-management organ in the [[Government of North Korea]].<ref>Article 123 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The Cabinet's principal newspaper is ''[[Minju Choson]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Park Hon-youn and Ather 1949.jpg|thumb|The cabinet, headed by [[Kim Il-sung]], visiting [[Moscow]] in 1949]]\nIn North Korea's first constitution, adopted in 1948, the executive powers were vested in the Cabinet, chaired by [[Kim Il-sung]] himself. The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.
