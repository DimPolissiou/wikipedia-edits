His collaboration with [[University of Texas at Dallas School of Arts and Humanities|the University of Texas at Dallas' School of Arts and Humanities]] provided national and international artists with a residency fellowship (during a period of six months to a year) funded by small grants, as well as the participation of the artists themselves, most of whom transported themselves to [[Texas]] from [[Argentina]], [[France]], and [[Austria]], among others. With inspiration from critically acclaimed programs such as the [[Chinati Foundation]] in [[Marfa, Texas]] and the CORE Program at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], the residency lasted for a little over two years,<ref>{{cite book|title=UT Dallas Southside Artist Residency: The First Two Years|year=2005|publisher=Millet the Printer|location=Dallas}}</ref> ending over a disagreement between Matthews and the university.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=Jesse|title=Artless: A residency program for artists fades quietly|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2006-01-12/news/artless/2/|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> However, the residency reimagined itself as CentralTrak in early 2008 with support from the university and Dr. Terranova as its inaugural director.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charissa Terranova Named Director of Central Track: The UT Dallas Artists Residency|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2007/08/23-001.html|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Notable exhibits===\n* February 13 \u2013 June 13, 2015; ''Who's Afraid of Chuck and George?''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcritical.com/2015/04/04/darren-jones-on-chuck-george/ |title=Dallas in Wonderland: Chuck and George at CentralTrak - artcritical artcritical |publisher=Artcritical.com |date=2015-04-04 |accessdate=2016-10-17}}</ref> \n* August 3 \u2013 24, 2013: ''Take'' by David Witherspoon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centraltrak.net/portfolios/witherspoon/ |title=Artist Residency in Dallas, TX \u2013 part of UT Dallas |publisher=CentralTrak |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}</ref> \n* July 6\u201327, 2013: ''Between Here and Cool \u2013 The photographs of Diane Durant''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centraltrak.net/portfolios/dianedurant/ |title=Artist Residency in Dallas, TX \u2013 part of UT Dallas |publisher=CentralTrak |date= |accessdate=2016-10-17}}</ref> \n* May 11 \u2013 June 29, 2013: ''That Mortal Coil: Rebuking the Ideal in Contemporary Figurative Art''<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Caitlin |url=http://frontrow.dmagazine.com/2013/05/this-weeks-visual-art-may-9-12-bodies-models-sex-and-death-that-mortal-coil-at-centraltrak/ |title=This Week\u2019s Visual Art, May 9-12: Bodies, Models, Sex, and Death: That Mortal Coil at CentralTrak \u2013 D Magazine |publisher=Frontrow.dmagazine.com |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n* March 9 \u2013 April 27, 2013: ''Failing Flat: Sculptural Tendencies in Painting'' curated by Nathan Green.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artthisweek.com/centraltrak-next-topic-failing-flat-sculptural-tendencies-in-painting-curator-nathan-green-kim-cadmus-owens-and-john-pomara-artist-talk/|title=Centraltrak: Next Topic-Failing Flat: Sculptural Tendencies in Painting-Curator Nathan Green, Kim Cadmus Owens and John Pomara-Artist Talk|date=4 April 2013|website=artthisweek.com}}</ref>\n* Jan 19 \u2013 March 2, 2013:  ''Painting of all Excuses'' Raul Cordero and Michel P\u00e9rez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/dallas-four-must-see-art-shows-6428754|title=Dallas\u2019 Four Must-See Art Shows|first=Jamie|last=Laughlin|date=17 January 2013|website=Dallas Observer}}</ref>\n* Nov 17, 2012 \u2013 Jan 5, 2013: ''Co- Re-Creating Spaces:'' a group exhibition curated by Carolyn Sortor & Michael A.
