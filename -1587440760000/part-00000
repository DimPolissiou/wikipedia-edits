prefectures of China|Autonomous Prefecture of China]] occupying the western arm of [[Sichuan]]. It is sometimes spelled \"Kardze\" and \"Garzin\"{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}} by non-government sources.\n\nThe prefecture's area is {{convert|151078|km2|mi2}}. The population is approximately 880,000, with [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] accounting for 77.8% of the total population.  The capital city of Garz\u00ea is [[Kangding]] (Dartsedo).\n\n==History==\nGarz\u00ea was traditionally part of the historical region of [[Kham]].\n\nDuring the period of rule by the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)]], Garz\u00ea became nominally part of the province of [[Xikang]], which included parts of former Kham.\n\nIn 1930, the Tibetan army invaded Garz\u00ea, capturing it without much resistance. However, in 1932, the Tibetan army withdrew after suffering defeats elsewhere at the hands of the warlord of [[Qinghai]], [[Ma Bufang]].{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}} Chinese warlord [[Liu Wenhui]] reoccupied Garz\u00ea, and signed an agreement with the Tibetans formalizing his control of the area east of the upper [[Yangtze]], which corresponds roughly with eastern Kham.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1950, following the defeat of the [[Kuomintang]] forces by the [[People's Liberation Army]], the area fell within the control of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Eastern Xikang was merged with Sichuan in 1955, where Garz\u00ea became an Autonomous Prefecture.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the census of 2000, Garz\u00ea had a population of 897,239 (population density: 5.94 people/km\u00b2).\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=cccccc\n! nationality\n! population\n! proportion\n|-\n| [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]\n| 703,168\n| 78.37%\n|-\n| [[Han Chinese]]\n| 163,648\n| 18.24%\n|-\n| [[Yi people|Yi]]\n| 22,946\n| 2.56%\n|-\n| [[Qiang people|Qiang]]\n| 2,860\n| 0.32%\n|-\n| [[Hui people|Hui]]\n| 2,190\n| 0.24%\n|-\n| [[Naxi people|Naxi]]\n| 760\n| 0.08%\n|-\n| [[Mongols|Mongolian]]s\n| 477\n| 0.05%\n|-\n| [[Bai people|Bai]]\n| 292\n| 0.03%\n|-\n| others\n| 898\n| 0.11%\n|}\n\n==Languages==\nGarz\u00ea is highly linguistically diverse, and has many [[Qiangic languages]].\n*[[Kangding]]: [[Guiqiong language|Guiqiong]], [[Muya language|Muya]]\n*[[Luding County]]: [[Muya language|Muya]]\n*[[Danba County]]: [[Rgyalrong languages|rGyalrong]]\n*[[Jiulong County]]: [[Pumi language|Pumi]] (Southern)\n*[[Yajiang County]]: [[Zhaba language|Zhaba]]\n*[[Dawu County, Sichuan|Dawu County]]: [[Horpa language|Horpa]]\n*[[Xinlong County]]: [[Choyo language|Queyu]]\n\n==Religion==\n[[Tibetan Buddhism]] is historically the predominant religion practiced in Garz\u00ea.

prefectures of China|Autonomous Prefecture of China]] occupying the western arm of [[Sichuan]]. It is sometimes spelled \"Kardze\" and \"Garzin\"{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}} by non-government sources.\n\nThe prefecture's area is {{convert|151078|km2|mi2}}. The population is approximately 880,000, with [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] accounting for 77.8% of the total population.  The capital city of Garz\u00ea is [[Kangding]] (Dartsedo).\n\n==History==\nGarz\u00ea was traditionally part of the historical region of [[Kham]].\n\nDuring the period of rule by the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)]], Garz\u00ea became nominally part of the province of [[Xikang]], which included parts of former Kham.\n\nIn 1930, the Tibetan army invaded Garz\u00ea, capturing it without much resistance. However, in 1932, the Tibetan army withdrew after suffering defeats elsewhere at the hands of the warlord of [[Qinghai]], [[Ma Bufang]].{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}} Chinese warlord [[Liu Wenhui]] reoccupied Garz\u00ea, and signed an agreement with the Tibetans formalizing his control of the area east of the upper [[Yangtze]], which corresponds roughly with eastern Kham.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1950, following the defeat of the [[Kuomintang]] forces by the [[People's Liberation Army]], the area fell within the control of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Eastern Xikang was merged with Sichuan in 1955, where Garz\u00ea became an Autonomous Prefecture.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed to support claim|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the census of 2000, Garz\u00ea had a population of 897,239 (population density: 5.94 people/km\u00b2).\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=cccccc\n! nationality\n! population\n! proportion\n|-\n| [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]\n| 703,168\n| 78.37%\n|-\n| [[Han Chinese]]\n| 163,648\n| 18.24%\n|-\n| [[Yi people|Yi]]\n| 22,946\n| 2.56%\n|-\n| [[Qiang people|Qiang]]\n| 2,860\n| 0.32%\n|-\n| [[Hui people|Hui]]\n| 2,190\n| 0.24%\n|-\n| [[Naxi people|Naxi]]\n| 760\n| 0.08%\n|-\n| [[Mongols|Mongolian]]s\n| 477\n| 0.05%\n|-\n| [[Bai people|Bai]]\n| 292\n| 0.03%\n|-\n| others\n| 898\n| 0.11%\n|}\n\n==Languages==\nGarz\u00ea is highly linguistically diverse, and has many [[Qiangic languages]].\n*[[Kangding]]: [[Guiqiong language|Guiqiong]], [[Muya language|Muya]]\n*[[Luding County]]: [[Muya language|Muya]]\n*[[Danba County]]: [[Rgyalrong languages|rGyalrong]]\n*[[Jiulong County]]: [[Pumi language|Pumi]] (Southern)\n*[[Yajiang County]]: [[Zhaba language|Zhaba]]\n*[[Dawu County, Sichuan|Dawu County]]: [[Horpa language|Horpa]]\n*[[Xinlong County]]: [[Choyo language|Queyu]]\n\n==Religion==\n[[Tibetan Buddhism]] is historically the predominant religion practiced in Garz\u00ea.

{"title_page": "R. Austin Freeman", "text_new": "{{other uses|Austin Freeman}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Richard Austin Freeman''' (11 April 1862 \u2013 28 September 1943) was a British writer of [[detective stories]], mostly featuring the medico-legal [[forensic]] [[detective|investigator]] [[Dr. Thorndyke]]. He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]], qualifying in 1887.  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons. He entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]].  He used \"his tact and formidable intelligence\" to avoid a massacre when a British expedition investigated French activities, which would normally have foretold success in the colonial service.  Unfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>, but was unable to find a permanent medical position, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first stories were written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".  His first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F. Bleiler.</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nFreeman held conservative political views.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite book |first=Angus |last=McLaren |title=Reproduction by Design: Sex, Robots, Trees, and Test-Tube Babies in Interwar Britain |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |isbn=0-226-56069-4 |pages=64\u20135}}</ref> In his 1921 book ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' Freeman put forth the view that [[mechanization]] had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".<ref name=\"am\"/> Freeman supported the [[eugenics]] movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and\n[[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]\".<ref>McLaren, 2012, (p. 71).</ref> The book also attacked the British [[Labour movement]] and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain. ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' referred to the [[Russian Revolution]] as \"the Russian catastrophe\" and argued society needed to protected from \"  degenerates of the destructive or \" Bolshevik \" type.\" <ref>R.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R. Austin Freeman, ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'', 1973, Dover (New York), {{ISBN|0-486-20388-3}}, from the introduction by E. F. Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ... There is even a gaslight charm about his Victorian love affairs, and those wonderful walks across London ...'  Most of us agree with Chandler.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\" />\n\nIn ''Bloody Murder'', [[Julian Symons]] wrote: \"... [his] talents as a writer were negligible.

He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]], qualifying in 1887.  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons. He entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]].  He used \"his tact and formidable intelligence\" to avoid a massacre when a British expedition investigated French activities, which would normally have foretold success in the colonial service.  Unfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>, but was unable to find a permanent medical position, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first stories were written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".  His first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F. Bleiler.</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nFreeman held conservative political views.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite book |first=Angus |last=McLaren |title=Reproduction by Design: Sex, Robots, Trees, and Test-Tube Babies in Interwar Britain |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |isbn=0-226-56069-4 |pages=64\u20135}}</ref> In his 1921 book ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' Freeman put forth the view that [[mechanization]] had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".<ref name=\"am\"/> Freeman supported the [[eugenics]] movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and\n[[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]\".<ref>McLaren, 2012, (p. 71).</ref> The book also attacked the British [[Labour movement]] and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain. ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' referred to the [[Russian Revolution]] as \"the Russian catastrophe\" and argued society needed to protected from \"  degenerates of the destructive or \" Bolshevik \" type.\" <ref>R.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R. Austin Freeman, ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'', 1973, Dover (New York), {{ISBN|0-486-20388-3}}, from the introduction by E. F. Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ... There is even a gaslight charm about his Victorian love affairs, and those wonderful walks across London ...'  Most of us agree with Chandler.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\" />\n\nIn ''Bloody Murder'', [[Julian Symons]] wrote: \"... [his] talents as a writer were negligible.

Situated on the western edge of the [[Southern Heath Nature Park]] in the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]], about 1&nbsp;km southwest of Hermannsburg itself, it currently has about 610 inhabitants. The name means \"village on the Beke\" (i.e. the stream). In old records it can be found as ''Beketorpe'', ''Bekendorpe'' or ''Beckedorp''. In 1973 Beckedorf was incorporated into the parish of Hermannsburg as part of Lower Saxony's territorial and administrative reforms.\n\n== Pre-history ==\n<!-- [[File:BeckSteinaxt.jpg|thumb|[[Late Bronze Age]] stone axes found near Beckedorf. Because bronze was valuable, the devices were often rebuilt in stone]] Licence issues prevent transfer from de.wiki -->\n\nIn 1936 Dr. Hans Piesker, an [[archaeologist]] from [[Hermannsburg]], discovered a settlement of the [[Beaker culture]] (ca. 4200-2800 BC) northwest of Beckedorf on the ''L\u00fchrsberg'', a low hill 77 metres above [[Normalnull|sea level]] and 500 metres wide. Of the original settlement, 30,000 square metres in area, numerous post- and settlement pits were exposed, as well as several house structures. The houses had a length of about 6 metres and were dug between 0.80 m and 1.40 m into the ground. They had braided walls (''Flechtw\u00e4nde'') coated in [[clay]]. In addition, [[arrowhead]]s, scrapers, a spearhead and fragments of axes made of  [[flint]] were found and shards of pottery excavated. From the discovery of [[drop spindle|spindle whorls]] it can be deduced that also wool or plant fibres were also been processed here.\n\nThe other partially surviving [[passage grave|barrows]] in the area, the barrows at Wohlde, the [[Bonstorf Barrows|burial site at Bonstorf]] and the [[Dohnsen-Siddernhausen Dolmen|megalithic grave at Dohnsen]] from the [[Neolithic]] age, indicate that there was a settlement here before and during the [[Bronze Age]].\n\n== History ==\nThe first written mention of Beckedorf dates to the year 1235 in a document which is now in the archives of [[Walsrode Abbey]]. Here it mentions that Count Siegfried of Osterburg gave the monastery a few houses that had previously been [[enfeoffed]] to the knight, Dietrich of Beckedorpe, who had since died.\n\n== Economy and Transport ==\nThe place was dominated by the railway. The [[Celle-Soltau railway]] run by the [[East Hanoverian Railways]] runs through the village and branches here; [[Beckedorf-Munster railway|the line to Munster]] branches off in Beckedorf (see also [[Celle-Soltau, Celle-Munster Light Railway]]). Passenger services were reduced in 1970 and cut entirely in 1976; freight services have reduced considerably. The line to Munster is used primarily for military traffic to [[Munster Training Area]] and the line to Soltau for transport to the [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area]].\n\nToday there are several farms in Beckedorf. Some of them even have ''[[Treppenspeicher]]'' storage barns from the 19th century. A ''H\u00e4uslingshaus'' has been partly preserved in its original state. ''H\u00e4uslinge'' were farm workers who worked on the farm and, for a small rent, or even rent-free, were allowed to live in the house.\n\nThrough the town flows a small stream, the ''Hasselbach'', which flows into the [[\u00d6rtze]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:H\u00e4uslingshaus (1).JPG|''H\u00e4uslingshaus'' and ''[[Treppenspeicher]]'' barn\nFile:BeckTrpSpch.jpg|A 19th century ''[[Treppenspeicher]]'' barn \nFile:BeckHasselbch (1).jpg|The Hasselbach\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.hermannsburg.de/index.php?id=69 Information about Beckedorf on the Hermannsburg website]\n\n{{Villages in the parish of Hermannsburg}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Lower Saxony]]\n[[Category:Celle (district)]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the village in Celle district, Lower Saxony, Germany|other uses|Beckedorf (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox German location\n| type = Subdivision\n| name = Beckedorf\n| Town = \n| Municipality = [[S\u00fcdheide (municipality)|S\u00fcdheide]]\n| image_coa = \n| coordinates = {{coord|52|48|57|N|10|3|30|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| state = Lower Saxony\n| district = Celle\n| elevation = 62\n| area = \n| population = 610\n| Stand = \n| postal_code = 29320\n| area_code = 05052\n| image_plan = \n| plantext = \n}}\n<!-- [[File:BahnhofBeckedorf.JPG|thumb|280 px|The station in Beckedorf]] -->\n'''Beckedorf''' is a village in the [[municipality]] of [[S\u00fcdheide (municipality)|S\u00fcdheide]] in northern [[Celle district]] in the German state of [[Lower Saxony]].
