As the game of baseball garnered interest in the United States in the 19th century, professional baseball in St. Louis became rooted chiefly in one disestablished Major League club \u2013 named the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings|Brown Stockings]], the same as the Cardinals' earliest name \u2013 which is loosely connected, but does not fall within the scope of, today's Cardinals.  The Brown Stockings became St. Louis' first fully professional baseball club when they gained accession in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] (NA) in [[1875 in baseball|1875]].  However, the NA folded after that season.  That winter, with five other former NA teams, St. Louis established a new, eight-team league called the [[National League]] (NL) and began play the [[1876 in baseball|next season]].  Despite early success, Brown Stocking players were found to be connected to game fixing scandals, which forced bankruptcy and the club's expulsion from the NL.  This scandal also abrogated their professional status but some members maintained play as a semi-professional team, primarily operated by [[outfielder]] [[Ned Cuthbert]], until 1881.\n\nWith interest in reviving professional baseball in St. Louis steadily growing, [[Grocery store|grocery]] and [[brewery]] tycoon [[Chris von der Ahe]] observed with fascination the team playing near his store and [[beer garden]] garnered large crowds.  He purchased the club in 1881, and \u2013 together with other club owners (who also happened to beer magnates) interested in creating professional league that could rival the National League \u2013 made it a charter member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in [[1882 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|1882]], bringing professional baseball back to the Gateway City.  This Brown Stockings club became St. Louis' Major League mainstay, now competing as the Cardinals.  During their time in the AA, the Cardinals established the first St. Louis professional sports dynasty, finishing with best overall record in the league each year from [[1885 St. Louis Browns season|1885]] to [[1888 St. Louis Browns season|1888]] and the best all-time record in that league's history.  They also took their first interleague [[List of pre-World Series baseball champions|championship]] (a precursor to the [[World Series]]), finishing off their [[Cardinals-Cubs rivalry|rivals]], the [[1886 Chicago White Stockings season|Chicago White Stockings]] \u2013 now the Chicago Cubs \u2013 in the [[1886 World Series]].\n\nWith instability plaguing the American Association, the league folded after the [[1891 in baseball|1891 season]].  Now named \"Browns\", St. Louis rejoined the National League, only to find a complete reversal of its AA success.  From [[1892 St. Louis Browns season|1892]] to [[1919 St. Louis Cardinals season|1920]] \u2013 a span of twenty-nine seasons \u2013 St. Louis managed just five winning seasons and finished in last or next-to-last place on 17 occasions.  The club also rode out 31 managerial changes and two more name changes, the last being to \"Cardinals\" in [[1900 St. Louis Cardinals season|1900]].   However, following this extended era of futility, the Cardinals emerged into a renaissance in the 1920s that brought championship baseball back to St. Louis.\n\n==Origins of professional baseball in St. Louis==\n\n===Timeline of naming and affiliations===\n;Franchise names:\n* [[1875 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|1875]]\u2013[[1882 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|1882]]:  [[St. Louis Brown Stockings]]\n* [[1883 St. Louis Browns season|1883]]\u2013[[1898 St. Louis Browns season|1898]]:  St. Louis Browns\n* [[1899 St. Louis Perfectos season|1899: St. Louis Perfectos]]\n* [[1900 St. Louis Cardinals season|1900]]\u2013present:  St. Louis Cardinals\n\n;League affiliations:\n* 1875:  [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]]\n* [[1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|1876]]&ndash;[[1877 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|1877]]:  [[National League]]\n* 1878\u20131881:  ''Independent \u2013 semi-professional''\n* [[1882 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|1882]]\u2013[[1891 St. Louis Browns season|1891]]:  [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]\n* [[1892 St. Louis Browns season|1892]]\u2013present:  National League\n\n===The original versus the modern game===\n{{See also|History of baseball in the United States}}\nThe game of baseball as it is played today is significantly removed from the game that originated in the late 19th century in the northeastern United States.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorn |first=John |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/16/134570236/the-secret-history-of-baseballs-earliest-days |title=Baseball's official historian explains the origins of our national pastime |work=[[NPR]] |date=March 16, 2011}}</ref>  Noted baseball [[historian]] and [[statistician]] [[Bill James]] commented that the game and [[baseball field|playing field]] resembled [[fastpitch softball]] more than contemporary baseball.  The style of play diverged in many facets.  [[Pitcher]]s were prohibited from throwing overhand \u2013 they were only permitted to throw underhanded or sidearmed.  They threw from a flat outlined box without a designated point of footing to release the ball instead of a [[Baseball field#pitcher's mound|mound]] with a pitching rubber until 1893.  The pitcher's mound did not receive official recognition until 1903.<ref name=\"Cash 2002: 2\">[[#Cas02|Cash 2002]]: 2</ref>\n\nCounts of balls and strikes were also modified: originally, a hitter did not receive a [[Base on balls|walk]] until the pitcher threw nine balls and the number required to draw a walk was eventually whittled down to four in the 1880s.  Hit batsmen did not automatically get awarded first base at first (it was instead counted as a ball) and foul balls and pitches taken in the strike zone were not initially regarded as strikes.  Both fair ball and foul ball rules varied, influencing the batter's ability to get on base.<ref name=\"Cash 2002: 2\"/>\n\nFielders played barehanded; gloves did not become prevalent until the 1880s and at that point they resembled work gloves.<ref>[[#Cas02|Cash 2002]]: 1</ref>  The [[infield]] contained three fielders with a large gap between [[second base|second]] and [[third base]].

The sport especially drew the attention of [[Gambling|gamblers]], which took decades for [[Major League Baseball]] to root out and St. Louis baseball teams would prove to be no exemption.

That season, [[Cap Anson]] of the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] publicly threatened not to play any 'white' professional teams who hired black players just months after the [[International League]] prohibited further signing of black players.  Ironically, it would be by an act 60 years later by then-former Cardinals executive in [[Branch Rickey]] that broke the color barrier in MLB when he debuted [[Jackie Robinson]] [[1947 Brooklyn Dodgers season|in 1947]] with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].\n\n===Early version of the World Series and AA's final seasons===\nDue to their AA pennant wins, the Browns played in a predecessor of the [[World Series]] from [[1885 Major League Baseball season|1885]]&ndash;[[1888 Major League Baseball season|1888]], in which the AA champion challenged the NL champion in what was considered at the time an exhibition series, predating the formation of the [[American League]].  The Browns met the [[Chicago Cubs]] prototype, the Chicago White Stockings for the first two World Series.  The [[1885 World Series|1885 series]] ended in a dispute (tie), but St. Louis won the [[1886 World Series|1886 series]] outright, spurring a vigorous [[Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry|St. Louis-Chicago rivalry]] that ensues to this day.<ref>[[#Cas02|Cash 2002]]: 138</ref>  This 1886 World Series was also the only one won by any AA team.

This contest proved significant in two ways.  First, it was the first [[no-hitter]] in Cardinals franchise history.  Second, it was the last no-hitter on the final day of play in the American Association, as the league went bankrupt and ceased operations [[1891 in baseball|following the 1891 season]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Gisclair |first=S.

The St. Louis Cardinals have had perpetual affiliation since.  Their [[1892 St. Louis Browns season|inaugural season]] of reentry was largely a disappointment their winning percentage plunged from .625 in 1891 to .373.  With an opportunity emerging [[1893 St. Louis Browns season|the next season]] for a larger property at Vandeventer and Natural Bridge Avenues, Von der Ahe moved the club a few blocks north-northwest from Grand and Dodier and opened a new park christened as \"[[Robison Field|New Sportsman's Park]]\" on April 27.

Despite the new park and league, the struggles the club encountered to rediscover the form of success that hallmarked their dominance in the American Association endured.  Between 1892 and [[1919 St. Louis Cardinals season|1919]], St. Louis managed just five winning seasons, finishing in last or next-to-last place 16 times.

One exception was Warren \"Fuzzy\" Anderson, Breadon's partner in the Pierce-Arrow dealership, who confided with him had more $15,000 invested in the Cardinals.  Anderson decided he, too, wanted to invest more in the Cardinals.  He requested financial assistance from Breadon who complied, loaning more than $18,000 to the franchise and for Anderson to purchase more stock.<ref name=\"Lee 119\u2013120\"/>\n\nAfter quickly acquiring some of the greatest fiscal investment in the club, Jones named Breadon as chairman of the board.  Late in 1919, Jones asked him to accept the position as president of the team.  Envisaging a possibility of frustrated control due to the number of persons comprising the board, Breadon demanded a condition that the number of members of the board be reduced from 25 to five.  After a meeting, he accepted the position with a board membership that was reduced to seven, supplanting Rickey as team president.<ref name=\"Lee 121\">[[#Lee09|Lee 2009]]: 121</ref>\n\nBecause Anderson held the second-largest share in the club, he reasoned that he should be named vice president.  However, Breadon balked.  Dejected at his refusal to share power, Anderson sold Breadon all his remaining stock, ending his baseball ownership career.  Perceiving that Rickey may have been miffed at his removal from the position of team president, Breadon instead offered him the position of vice president, which he accepted.  With a loan from Breadon, he purchased a stake in the team amounting to less than 20%.  At this point, Rickey was firmly entrenched in nearly all front office decisions.<ref name=\"Lee 121\"/>  In [[1919 St. Louis Cardinals season|1919]], to avoid paying a separate manager's salary, he appointed himself to succeed [[Jack Hendricks]] as [[Manager (baseball)|field]] [[List of St. Louis Cardinals managers|manager]], who had quit.<ref name=\"Cardinals franchise index\"/><ref name=\"Rickey\"/>  He even borrowed items from his wife's stockpile of heirlooms to partially furnish his office.<ref name=\"Rickey\"/>\n\nDoak became credited for the modern design of the [[baseball glove]] after suggesting to [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]] in 1919 that a web be laced between the thumb and forefinger to create a pocket  that extended the surface by which the fielder could catch the ball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawlings.com/timeline.aspx |quote=[In]1919 Bill Doak Glove paved the future of baseball gloves, featuring a revolutionary built-in pocket and the thumb and forefinger attached to form a web. |title=Rawlings Timeline |work=www.rawlings.com |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref>  Also that year, the league moved to ban pitching with the spitball due in part to it giving the pitcher an unfair advantage over the hitter.

However, he insisted upon remaining the field manager while carrying on his front office duties and continued to do so [[1925 St. Louis Cardinals season|until 1925]].  Breadon also recognized Rickey's acumen, and \u2013 along with his proclivity for signing players as cheaply as possible \u2013 the two men united into a mutually workable arrangement as one of Rickey's chief motives was also to sign as talented of players as inexpensively as possible.  Unlike many owners who seemed content to dabble in front office affairs, Breadon was comfortable deferring the player management and development decisions to Rickey.  This owner-executive combination catalyzed into one of the most powerful duos in sports.

As the game of baseball garnered interest in the United States in the 19th century, professional baseball in St. Louis became rooted chiefly in one disestablished Major League club \u2013 named the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings|Brown Stockings]], the same as the Cardinals' earliest name \u2013 which is loosely connected, but does not fall within the scope of, today's Cardinals.  The Brown Stockings became St. Louis' first fully professional baseball club when they gained accession in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] (NA) in [[1875 in baseball|1875]].  However, the NA folded after that season.  That winter, with five other former NA teams, St. Louis established a new, eight-team league called the [[National League]] (NL) and began play the [[1876 in baseball|next season]].  Despite early success, Brown Stocking players were found to be connected to game fixing scandals, which forced bankruptcy and the club's expulsion from the NL.  This scandal also abrogated their professional status but some members maintained play as a semi-professional team, primarily operated by [[outfielder]] [[Ned Cuthbert]], until 1881.\n\nWith interest in reviving professional baseball in St. Louis steadily growing, [[Grocery store|grocery]] and [[brewery]] tycoon [[Chris von der Ahe]] observed with fascination the team playing near his store and [[beer garden]] garnered large crowds.  He purchased the club in 1881, and \u2013 together with other club owners (who also happened to beer magnates) interested in creating professional league that could rival the National League \u2013 made it a charter member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in [[1882 St. Louis Brown Stockings season|1882]], bringing professional baseball back to the Gateway City.  This Brown Stockings club became St. Louis' Major League mainstay, now competing as the Cardinals.  During their time in the AA, the Cardinals established the first St. Louis professional sports dynasty, finishing with best overall record in the league each year from [[1885 St. Louis Browns season|1885]] to [[1888 St. Louis Browns season|1888]] and the best all-time record in that league's history.  They also took their first interleague [[List of pre-World Series baseball champions|championship]] (a precursor to the [[World Series]]), finishing off their [[Cardinals-Cubs rivalry|rivals]], the [[1886 Chicago White Stockings season|Chicago White Stockings]] \u2013 now the Chicago Cubs \u2013 in the [[1886 World Series]].\n\nWith instability plaguing the American Association, the league folded after the [[1891 in baseball|1891 season]].

From [[1892 St. Louis Browns season|1892]] to [[1919 St. Louis Cardinals season|1920]] \u2013 a span of twenty-nine seasons \u2013 St. Louis managed just five winning seasons and finished in last or next-to-last place on 17 occasions.  The club also rode out 31 managerial changes and two more name changes, the last being to \"Cardinals\" in [[1900 St. Louis Cardinals season|1900]].

Hit batsmen did not automatically get awarded first base at first (it was instead counted as a ball) and foul balls and pitches taken in the strike zone were not initially regarded as strikes.  Both fair ball and foul ball rules varied, influencing the batter's ability to get on base.<ref name=\"Cash 2002: 2\"/>\n\nFielders played barehanded; gloves did not become prevalent until the 1880s and at that point they resembled work gloves.<ref>[[#Cas02|Cash 2002]]: 1</ref>  The [[infield]] contained three fielders with a large gap between [[second base|second]] and [[third base]].

With an opportunity emerging [[1893 St. Louis Browns season|the next season]] for a larger property at Vandeventer and Natural Bridge Avenues, Von der Ahe moved the club a few blocks north-northwest from Grand and Dodier and opened a new park christened as \"[[Robison Field|New Sportsman's Park]]\" on April 27.  The last game in Sportsman's Park was against the [[1893 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] on April 23.  Despite the new park and league, the struggles the club encountered to rediscover the form of success that hallmarked their dominance in the American Association endured.  Between 1892 and [[1919 St. Louis Cardinals season|1919]], St. Louis managed just five winning seasons, finishing in last or next-to-last place 16 times.  They had also had zero World Series appearances, four seasons of 100-losses or more, and even finished [[1897 St. Louis Browns season|the 1897 season]] at 29\u2013102 for a franchise-worst .221 winning percentage.

In spite of the quarreling, Rickey was reluctant to join the Cardinals because the club was notoriously undercapitalized and underachieving.

One exception was Warren \"Fuzzy\" Anderson, Breadon's partner in the Pierce-Arrow dealership, who confided with him had more $15,000 invested in the Cardinals.  Anderson decided he, too, wanted to invest more in the Cardinals.  He requested financial assistance from Breadon who complied, loaning more than $18,000 to the franchise and for Anderson to purchase more stock.<ref name=\"Lee 119\u2013120\"/>\n\nAfter quickly acquiring some of the greatest fiscal investment in the club, Jones named Breadon as chairman of the board.  Late in 1919, Jones asked him to accept the position as president of the team.  Envisaging a possibility of frustrated control due to the number of persons comprising the board, Breadon demanded a condition that the number of members of the board be reduced from 25 to five.  After a meeting, he accepted the position with a board membership that was reduced to seven, supplanting Rickey as team president.<ref name=\"Lee 121\">[[#Lee09|Lee 2009]]: 121</ref>\n\nBecause Anderson held the second-largest share in the club, he reasoned that he should be named vice president.  However, Breadon balked.  Dejected at his refusal to share power, Anderson sold Breadon all his remaining stock, ending his baseball ownership career.  Perceiving that Rickey may have been miffed at his removal from the position of team president, Breadon instead offered him the position of vice president, which he accepted.  With a loan from Breadon, he purchased a stake in the team amounting to less than 20%.  At this point, Rickey was firmly entrenched in nearly all front office decisions.<ref name=\"Lee 121\"/>  In [[1919 St. Louis Cardinals season|1919]], to avoid paying a separate manager's salary, he appointed himself to succeed [[Jack Hendricks]] as [[Manager (baseball)|field]] [[List of St. Louis Cardinals managers|manager]], who had quit.<ref name=\"Cardinals franchise index\"/><ref name=\"Rickey\"/>  He even borrowed items from his wife's stockpile of heirlooms to partially furnish his office.<ref name=\"Rickey\"/>\n\nDoak became credited for the modern design of the [[baseball glove]] after suggesting to [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]] in 1919 that a web be laced between the thumb and forefinger to create a pocket  that extended the surface by which the fielder could catch the ball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawlings.com/timeline.aspx |quote=[In]1919 Bill Doak Glove paved the future of baseball gloves, featuring a revolutionary built-in pocket and the thumb and forefinger attached to form a web. |title=Rawlings Timeline |work=www.rawlings.com |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref>  Also that year, the league moved to ban pitching with the spitball due in part to it giving the pitcher an unfair advantage over the hitter.

However, he insisted upon remaining the field manager while carrying on his front office duties and continued to do so [[1925 St. Louis Cardinals season|until 1925]].  Breadon also recognized Rickey's acumen, and \u2013 along with his proclivity for signing players as cheaply as possible \u2013 the two men united into a mutually workable arrangement as one of Rickey's chief motives was also to sign as talented of players as inexpensively as possible.  Unlike many owners who seemed content to dabble in front office affairs, Breadon was comfortable deferring the player management and development decisions to Rickey.  This owner-executive combination catalyzed into one of the most powerful duos in sports.  In the years ensuing, Rickey stumbled upon a relatively untapped [[Farm team|player development model]] that he established ahead of its time and helped actuate the Cardinals' second golden era later in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Rickey\"/><ref>[[#Lee09|Lee 2009]]: 121\u2013122</ref>\n\n<br />\n''For the next historic period, see: [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (1920\u201352)|1920\u20131952]].''\n\n'''1875\u20131919''' | [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (1920\u201352)|1920\u20131952]] | [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (1953\u201389)|1953\u20131989]] | [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (1990\u2013present)|1990\u2013present]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n*{{note label|CY|a|a}}<small>[http://beckerboys.com/gggdad-cardinals  A photo] of Cy Young in uniform with the St Louis team before Opening Day 1899.

According to the Obey Giant website, \"The sticker has no meaning but exists only to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning in the sticker\". The website also says, by contrast, that those who are familiar with the sticker find humor and enjoyment from it and that those who try to analyze its meaning only burden themselves and may condemn the art as an act of vandalism from an evil, underground cult.\n\nOriginally intending the sticker campaign to gain fame among his classmates and college peers, Fairey says:\n<blockquote>At first I was only thinking about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding the use of public space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/interview-with-shepard-fairey-still-obeying-after-all-these-year|title=Interview with Shepard Fairey: Still Obeying After all These Years|author=Steven Heller}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a [[manifesto]] he wrote in 1990, and since posted on his website, he links his work with [[Heidegger]]'s concept of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].<ref>Steven Heller, V\u00e9ronique Vienne, ''Citizen Designer: Perspectives on Design Responsibility'', Allworth Communications Inc., 2003, p224. {{ISBN|1-58115-265-5}}</ref>  His \"Obey\" Campaign is from the [[John Carpenter]] movie ''[[They Live]]'' which starred pro wrestler [[Roddy Piper]], taking a number of its slogans, including the \"Obey\" slogan, as well as the \"This is Your God\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/28602/street-cred|title=Street Cred - Artinfo|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Fairey has spun off the OBEY clothing line from the original sticker campaign.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  He also uses the slogan \"[[The Medium is the Message]]\" borrowed from [[Marshall McLuhan]].

According to the Obey Giant website, \"The sticker has no meaning but exists only to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning in the sticker\". The website also says, by contrast, that those who are familiar with the sticker find humor and enjoyment from it and that those who try to analyze its meaning only burden themselves and may condemn the art as an act of vandalism from an evil, underground cult.\n\nOriginally intending the sticker campaign to gain fame among his classmates and college peers, Fairey says,\n<blockquote>At first I was only thinking about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding the use of public space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/interview-with-shepard-fairey-still-obeying-after-all-these-year|title=Interview with Shepard Fairey: Still Obeying After all These Years|author=Steven Heller}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a [[manifesto]] he wrote in 1990, and since posted on his website, he links his work with [[Heidegger]]'s concept of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].<ref>Steven Heller, V\u00e9ronique Vienne, ''Citizen Designer: Perspectives on Design Responsibility'', Allworth Communications Inc., 2003, p224. {{ISBN|1-58115-265-5}}</ref>  His \"Obey\" Campaign is from the [[John Carpenter]] movie ''[[They Live]]'' which starred pro wrestler [[Roddy Piper]], taking a number of its slogans, including the \"Obey\" slogan, as well as the \"This is Your God\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/28602/street-cred|title=Street Cred - Artinfo|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Fairey has spun off the OBEY clothing line from the original sticker campaign.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  He also uses the slogan \"[[The Medium is the Message]]\" borrowed from [[Marshall McLuhan]].

In order to apply the electrode directly to the skin, or tissues inside the mouth, anus or vagina, a \"vacuum electrode\" was used, consisting of a metal electrode sealed inside a partially evacuated glass tube, which produced a dramatic violet glow. The glass wall of the tube and the skin surface formed a [[capacitor]] which limited the current to the patient, preventing discomfort.
