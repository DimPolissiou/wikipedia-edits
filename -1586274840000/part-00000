He was educated at the independent school [[Brighton College]] and Rudolf Steiner at Kidbrooke Park in Sussex.\n\n==Early career==\nKerr became trainee manager at the Roebuck Hotel in [[East Sussex]], England, when he was 15 years old. After five years in the British Army as catering adviser, he became general manager of the Royal Ascot Hotel.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Move to New Zealand and ''Entertaining With Kerr''==\nKerr moved to [[New Zealand]] in 1958, becoming chief catering adviser for the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]].\n\nHe moved into television in New Zealand when being recruited by [[Television New Zealand|NZBC]] producer [[Shirley Maddock]]. In 1959, he began hosting the television show ''Entertaining with Kerr'', in which he appeared dressed in military uniform.<ref name=\"cook's info\">{{cite web |title=Graham Kerr |url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/graham-kerr |publisher=Cook's Info}}</ref> His recipes were also delivered on radio and in magazines, and the first edition of a related book, ''Entertaining with Kerr'', was sold out in eight days. During these early years Kerr won a Penguin Award as 'Personality of the Year'.\n\n==Move to Australia==\nShortly after the NZTV series was launched, promoter Anthony Hollows introduced Kerr to his business partner, rising New Zealand entertainment promoter and artist manager [[Harry M. Miller]]. Miller was at first skeptical of taking Kerr on, having just lost heavily on a disastrous promotion of a folk music concert, but Hollows was insistent, and after seeing Kerr in action, Miller immediately saw his potential. Miller (who was well established across the Tasman Sea as a concert promoter) was confident that he could launch Kerr in Australia. Kerr signed on as Miller's first management client, and the relationship proved enormously important and financially rewarding to both men. Miller was instrumental in launching Kerr in Australia, and Kerr's breakthrough in turn laid the foundation for Miller's own success as a leading player in the Australian and New Zealand entertainment industry over the next 20 years.<ref name=\"Harry M.

Miller (with Dennis O'Brien), ''My Story'', (Macmillan Company, 1983), pp.147-151</ref>\n\nIn 1964 Kerr moved to Sydney,<ref name=\"cook's info\" /> and through his Australian contacts, Miller was soon able to sign Kerr to present a regular cooking show on Channel 10, also called ''Entertaining with Kerr'', as part of the [[TEN Network]], Australia's recently established third commercial television outlet. Although Kerr's initial fee was modest, Miller wisely balanced that against the value of the exposure, certain that Kerr would make an impact. The show quickly became a huge national success, leading to daily radio spots, newspaper and magazine columns, personal appearances, and lucrative product endorsements. Miller also cited winemaker and critic [[Len Evans (wine)|Len Evans]] as being especially helpful to Kerr in these early days. Miller soon scored another coup when he signed the multinational food company [[Nestl\u00e9]] as Kerr's first major sponsor.\n\nAt some point, Kerr's television ratings took a dive, and the series was canceled. However, his radio show continued. On the recommendation of the wife of a board member, who listened to Kerr's radio show, the Australian Dairy Board signed Kerr to what Miller described as an endorsement contract \"of staggering proportions,\" and Kerr was soon back on national television.<ref name=\"Harry M. Miller 1983 pp.147\u2013151\" />\n\nIn his autobiography, ''My Story'', Miller recounted that \"the sweetest contract I offered Graham was one he refused to sign.\" In the mid-1960s [[Union Carbide]], the manufacturers of [[The Glad Products Company#Australian history|Glad Wrap]] approached Miller with a lucrative offer for Kerr to become its national endorser. All Kerr had to do was make a few commercials, pose for a few photos, and use the product on his cooking show. Sensing the huge potential of the new product, Miller cannily negotiated for a multiyear contract in which Kerr was to receive a royalty of about 0.5c on every unit sold instead of a flat fee. To Miller's astonishment, however, Kerr was unimpressed by Glad Wrap, and despite Miller's strenuous effort to demonstrate its enormous usefulness, Kerr remained unconvinced. <ref name=\"Harry M. Miller 1983 pp.147\u2013151\" />\n\n==Move to Canada and ''The Galloping Gourmet''==\nMiller and Kerr parted ways in the late-1960s after Kerr received a lucrative offer from Fremantle of Canada. Although his management contract with Miller still had several years to run, Kerr and Miller agreed to a negotiated buy-out; the two parted ways amicably, and remained good friends.\n\nKerr's new series for Fremantle, ''The Galloping Gourmet'' (1969\u201371), named for his onscreen persona, was taped in Ottawa at [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]] and produced by his wife Treena Kerr. The origin of his Galloping Gourmet persona stemmed from a 1967 book he co-authored with wine expert [[Len Evans (wine)|Len Evans]], titled ''The Galloping Gourmets''. The nickname was the result of a 35-day worldwide trek to the finest restaurants around the globe. The show was taped in front of a live audience. The title was echoed in the opening of each episode, where Kerr entered the stage area by running in and leaping over a chair in the dining room set (a stunt conceived by Treena).<ref name=\"arugula\">{{cite book |title=The United States of Arugula |author=David Kamp |year=2006 |publisher=Broadway Books |pages=109\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nMany episodes featured a prerecorded segment with Kerr in a part of the world wherein that episode's dish originated.<ref name=\"arugula\" />\n\nThe series was known for its lighthearted humor, tomfoolery, and the copious use of [[clarified butter]], cream, and fat. A famous line of Kerr's on the show was his response to someone's criticism of his cooking: \"Madam, you could go outside and get run over by a bus and just think what you would have missed!\" He also liberally featured wine, serving it with most meals, using it in his dishes, and waxing poetic about its virtues. He would also raise a glass of wine to his lips as a cue to the director to cut to commercials, then would bring it back up to his lips right before the show came back on. This gave the impression to some viewers that he was drinking heavily during the taping. In reality he drank very little.<ref name=\"arugula\" />\n\nIn an ongoing feature of the show, Kerr would make his way into the audience as the closing credits began and select an audience member (usually female) whom he would invite onstage with him to enjoy whatever dish he had just prepared. Another recurring feature at the end of each show would be a close-up of Kerr as he sampled the dish he had just cooked. To \"oohs and ahs\" from the audience, he would pull a face as though he was in ecstasy from tasting his latest creation. \n\n''The Galloping Gourmet'' was a hit, and earned two [[Emmy Award]] nominations. During its run, Kerr became a worldwide sensation and wrote an abundance of cookbooks. However, he was pilloried by many of the elite of the food world of the time, including influential food writer Michael Field, who called Kerr \"the [[Liberace]] of the food world,\" and [[James Beard]], who wrote that Kerr \"has very little respect for food.\"<ref name=\"arugula\" />\n\nThe show was dubbed in French and aired on [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9|T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada]] starting September 6, 1971, under the title ''Le Gourmet farfelu''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Le Gourmet farfelu |date=September 4, 1971 |volume=5 |issue=37 |page=12  |url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2882527 |magazine=Ici Radio-Canada |location=Montreal |publisher=BanQ |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1969 to 1972 Kerr also made guest appearances on ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'', a long-running NBC radio variety program.<ref>[http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounddownloads.html The Monitor Tribute Pages; The Sounds of Monitor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217055552/http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounddownloads.html |date=17 December 2014 }} Retrieved on 2012-03-29.</ref>\n\n==Personal setbacks, born-again Christianity and ''Take Kerr''==\nSome near-tragedies caused Kerr to suspend his television career, thus ending the show. In April 1971, Kerr and his wife Treena were involved in a car crash in California. As a result of the accident, he suffered a dislocated spine and a weakened left arm. As therapy, Kerr had to wear a one-pound bracelet in order to strengthen the weakened arm. Then in January 1972, Treena was at first diagnosed with lung cancer. That diagnosis turned out to be incorrect; it was later determined she had tuberculosis and part of her lung had to be removed. She went on to make a full recovery. However she became addicted to painkillers as well as several other medications.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EoA0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=HI0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6537%2C3448629 \"Gourmet Kerr Off On Yacht\"], ''Sarasota, FL \u2013 Journal newspaper'', 24 July 1972</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Treena became a born again Christian after being encouraged by an employee; Kerr also became religious at the same time.<ref name=\"changed man\">{{cite news |title=TV's Galloping Gourmet a Changed Man |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19751003&id=F9ZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JuADAAAAIBAJ&pg=3016,656511&hl=en |first=Ann |last=Baker |newspaper=The Register-Guard |date=3 October 1975}}</ref> \n\nKerr returned to television in 1975 with a daily syndicated five-minute series, ''Take Kerr'', which featured a particular recipe for each show. This program reflected his newfound embrace of both Christianity and healthful eating, with lighter-calorie recipes and Christian elements, including the use of the hymn \"This Is the Day the Lord Has Made\" as a theme song.<ref name=\"changed man\" /> The programme lasted four series. One Christian element on the show, an inclusion of a passage from the Bible in the closing credits, was strongly resisted by one of the stations on which the show aired, and indirectly caused Kerr to lose millions of dollars in potential revenue owing to his unwillingness to compromise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinglightnews.org/vgourmet.htm|title=Galloping Gourmet Changes Directions|author=Donna Lynne Siewert|publisher=Living Light News|accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref> This series was later repeated on [[CNN]] during its first year or so on the air.\n\nIn a 1975 interview publicizing ''Take Kerr'', Kerr renounced the show ''The Galloping Gourmet'', saying that \"What I did wasn't art, it was a crime,\" given the increasing rate of obesity in the United States. He also apologized for two of his trademarks on that show, his wine drinking and his double entendres.<ref name=\"changed man\" /> He stated that he was trying to convince TV stations to remove reruns of the show from syndication.<ref name=\"changed man\" />\n\n==\"Minimax\", ''The Graham Kerr Show'', and ''Graham Kerr's Kitchen''==\nAfter his wife Treena's stroke, then heart attack in 1986, Kerr was prompted to create a new style of cooking that he dubbed \"Minimax\". This new method of food preparation minimized (\"Mini-\") fat and cholesterol while it maximized (\"-max\") aroma, color, texture, and taste. Minimax led to ''The Graham Kerr Show'', originally produced at [[KING-TV]] in Seattle and later syndicated to local stations during the 1990\u201391 season, followed by a run on the [[Discovery Channel]]. From 1992 to 1995, Kerr starred on the [[PBS]] show ''Graham Kerr's Kitchen'', which again embraced the low-fat, \"minimax\" approach.\n\nMinimax also led to three successful cookbooks: ''Graham Kerr's Smart Cooking'', ''Graham Kerr's Minimax Cookbook'', and ''Graham Kerr's Creative Choices (A Minimax Book)'' along with corresponding series on public television: ''Graham Kerr's Kitchen'', ''Graham Kerr's Swifty Seasoned'', and ''The Best of Graham Kerr''.\n\n==Later career: 1995\u2013present==\nIn 1995, he appeared in a PBS special with [[Julia Child]] called ''Cooking in Concert: Julia Child & Graham Kerr''.<ref name=alacarte>[http://www.alacartetv.com/html/jnj/aboutalc.htm Alacarte Communications; Julia and Jacque] Retrieved on 2009-03-28.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Kerr, in his book of that year called ''Swiftly Seasoned'', created the concept of a \"Moulded Ethnic Vegetable,\" a baked combination of starches and vegetables seasoned with flavors characteristic of different ethnic cuisines. The \"MEV,\" as he referred to it in recipes, was intended to remedy what he perceived as a lack of focus in vegetarian meals; according to Kerr, while omnivorous cuisine generally has a central focus in a meat dish, vegetarian plates are often little more than collections of side dishes, and the MEV was an attempt to provide a central focus for such meals. The MEV was not a widely successful concept, and a business venture to manufacture and sell a [[muffin tin]]\u2013like MEV baking pan was not successful. (While it was generally intended to be vegetarian, Kerr did incorporate meats into some MEV recipes in later books.)\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000, Kerr was also the editor at large for ''[[Cooking Light]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"cook's info\" />\n\nSince the late 1990s, Graham Kerr appeared in a series of radio and television features for the ''[[5 A Day]]'' program of the National Cancer Institute, called ''Do Yourself a Flavor'', emphasizing the use of fruits and vegetables in recipes. Kerr's earlier series, including ''The Galloping Gourmet'', has aired in the U.S. on [[Food Network]] and [[Cooking Channel]]. He works with [[Bastyr University]] and many businesses looking for innovation, better health and good taste.\n\nIn 1997\u201398, Kerr recorded a series titled The Gathering Place in Toronto, Canada\u2014a total of 130 one-hour episodes were recorded. The series featured guests who were prominent authorities in various health fields. Kerr included videos shot on location on a worldwide voyage aboard the ''Queen Elizabeth 2.''\n\nKerr's autobiography ''Flash Of Silver...the leap that changed my world'' was published in 2015.\n\n==Awards and accolades==\nIn 1965, Kerr was awarded the Gold Medal at the Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt, Germany, for ''The Graham Kerr Cookbook by the Galloping Gourmet''.\n\nIn 2003, he received an honorary doctorate for culinary arts and nutrition from [[Johnson & Wales University]] in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Kerr\">[http://www.grahamkerr.com/index.php/about/graham/ Graham Kerr Biography Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901201544/http://www.grahamkerr.com/index.php/about/graham/ |date=1 September 2010 }}</ref> Also in 2003, Kerr was awarded an Honorary Life Member of the American Dietetic Association.

Four versions were known to exist\u2014a regular version and three additional versions released in conjunction with [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, [[CBC Television]] in Canada, and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in Britain. The Fremantle and KABC versions were hardcover, and the CBC and BBC versions, though identical in content, were softcover and [[General Binding Corporation|GBC]]\u2013bound, with different covers (with the BBC version under the title ''Entertaining with Kerr''). These cookbooks were generally sold by mail order through the television series.\n\nIn 1972, the cookbooks were re-released with new color covers and sold in bookshops. This new version was sold by [[Hachette Book Group USA|Paperback Library]] but, despite the publisher's name, the books were hardcover.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of New Zealand television personalities]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0601/cover.html 2003 interview with the Seattle Times]\n* [http://dougmilesinterview.milestonebroadcasting.com/2009/07/19/doug-miles-interviews-graham-kerr-tvs-the-galloping-gourmet-wslr-radio.aspx Radio Interview with Graham Kerr WSLR w/Doug Miles]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kerr, Graham}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:Scottish television chefs]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from London]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to Australia]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:People educated at Brighton College]]\n[[Category:Army Catering Corps officers]]\n[[Category:Australian television chefs]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Television chef}}\n{{about|the cooking personality|the Scottish embryologist and Member of Parliament|John Graham Kerr|the Australian rules footballer|Graham Kerr (footballer)|the Scottish rugby union player|Graham Kerr (rugby union)}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=June 2016}}\n{{overly detailed|date=June 2016}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=September 2014}}\n{{Infobox chef\n| name           = Graham Kerr\n| image          =Graham Kerr.jpg \n| caption        = Kerr in January 2018\n| birth_name     = \n| birth_date     = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1934|01|22}}\n| birth_place    = [[London]], England, UK\n| death_date     = \n| death_place    = \n| spouse         = Treena Kerr (d. 2015)\n| children       = 3\n| style          = \n| education      = [[Brighton College]]\n| ratings        = \n| television     = ''[[The Galloping Gourmet (1969\u201371)]]''\n| website        = \n| nationality    = New Zealand\n}}\n\n'''Graham Kerr''' (born 22 January 1934) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] cooking personality who is best known for his 1969\u20131971 television cooking show ''The Galloping Gourmet''.\n\n==Early life==\nKerr was born in London, and his Scottish parents were established hoteliers.<ref>https://www.cooksinfo.com/graham-kerr</ref> As a result, much of his childhood was spent among European chefs.

In reality he drank very little.<ref name=\"arugula\" />\n\nIn an ongoing feature of the show, Kerr would make his way into the audience as the closing credits began and select an audience member (usually female) whom he would invite onstage with him to enjoy whatever dish he had just prepared. Another recurring feature at the end of each show would be a close-up of Kerr as he sampled the dish he had just cooked. To \"oohs and ahs\" from the audience, he would pull a face as though he was in ecstasy from tasting his latest creation. \n\n''The Galloping Gourmet'' was a hit, and earned two [[Emmy Award]] nominations. During its run, Kerr became a worldwide sensation and wrote an abundance of cookbooks. However, he was pilloried by many of the elite of the food world of the time, including influential food writer Michael Field, who called Kerr \"the [[Liberace]] of the food world,\" and [[James Beard]], who wrote that Kerr \"has very little respect for food.\"<ref name=\"arugula\" />\n\nThe show was dubbed in French and aired on [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9|T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada]] starting September 6, 1971, under the title ''Le Gourmet farfelu''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Le Gourmet farfelu |date=September 4, 1971 |volume=5 |issue=37 |page=12  |url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2882527 |magazine=Ici Radio-Canada |location=Montreal |publisher=BanQ |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1969 to 1972 Kerr also made guest appearances on ''[[Monitor (NBC Radio)|Monitor]]'', a long-running NBC radio variety program.<ref>[http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounddownloads.html The Monitor Tribute Pages; The Sounds of Monitor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217055552/http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounddownloads.html |date=17 December 2014 }} Retrieved on 2012-03-29.</ref>\n\n==Personal setbacks, born-again Christianity and ''Take Kerr''==\nSome near-tragedies caused Kerr to suspend his television career, thus ending the show. In April 1971, Kerr and his wife Treena were involved in an car crash in California. As a result of the accident, he suffered a dislocated spine and a weakened left arm. As therapy, Kerr had to wear a one-pound bracelet in order to strengthen the weakened arm. Then in January 1972, Treena was at first diagnosed with lung cancer. That diagnosis turned out to be incorrect; it was later determined she had tuberculosis and part of her lung had to be removed. She went on to make a full recovery. However she became addicted to painkillers as well as several other medications.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EoA0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=HI0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6537%2C3448629 \"Gourmet Kerr Off On Yacht\"], ''Sarasota, FL \u2013 Journal newspaper'', 24 July 1972</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Treena became a born again Christian after being encouraged by an employee; Kerr also became religious at the same time.<ref name=\"changed man\">{{cite news |title=TV's Galloping Gourmet a Changed Man |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19751003&id=F9ZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JuADAAAAIBAJ&pg=3016,656511&hl=en |first=Ann |last=Baker |newspaper=The Register-Guard |date=3 October 1975}}</ref> \n\nKerr returned to television in 1975 with a daily syndicated five-minute series, ''Take Kerr'', which featured a particular recipe for each show. This program reflected his newfound embrace of both Christianity and healthful eating, with lighter-calorie recipes and Christian elements, including the use of the hymn \"This Is the Day the Lord Has Made\" as a theme song.<ref name=\"changed man\" /> The programme lasted four series. One Christian element on the show, an inclusion of a passage from the Bible in the closing credits, was strongly resisted by one of the stations on which the show aired, and indirectly caused Kerr to lose millions of dollars in potential revenue owing to his unwillingness to compromise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinglightnews.org/vgourmet.htm|title=Galloping Gourmet Changes Directions|author=Donna Lynne Siewert|publisher=Living Light News|accessdate=29 May 2012}}</ref> This series was later repeated on [[CNN]] during its first year or so on the air.\n\nIn a 1975 interview publicizing ''Take Kerr'', Kerr renounced the show ''The Galloping Gourmet'', saying that \"What I did wasn't art, it was a crime,\" given the increasing rate of obesity in the United States. He also apologized for two of his trademarks on that show, his wine drinking and his double entendres.<ref name=\"changed man\" /> He stated that he was trying to convince TV stations to remove reruns of the show from syndication.<ref name=\"changed man\" />\n\n==\"Minimax\", ''The Graham Kerr Show'', and ''Graham Kerr's Kitchen''==\nAfter his wife Treena's stroke, then heart attack in 1986, Kerr was prompted to create a new style of cooking that he dubbed \"Minimax\". This new method of food preparation minimized (\"Mini-\") fat and cholesterol while it maximized (\"-max\") aroma, color, texture, and taste. Minimax led to ''The Graham Kerr Show'', originally produced at [[KING-TV]] in Seattle and later syndicated to local stations during the 1990\u201391 season, followed by a run on the [[Discovery Channel]]. From 1992 to 1995, Kerr starred on the [[PBS]] show ''Graham Kerr's Kitchen'', which again embraced the low-fat, \"minimax\" approach.\n\nMinimax also led to three successful cookbooks: ''Graham Kerr's Smart Cooking'', ''Graham Kerr's Minimax Cookbook'', and ''Graham Kerr's Creative Choices (A Minimax Book)'' along with corresponding series on public television: ''Graham Kerr's Kitchen'', ''Graham Kerr's Swifty Seasoned'', and ''The Best of Graham Kerr''.\n\n==Later career: 1995\u2013present==\nIn 1995, he appeared in a PBS special with [[Julia Child]] called ''Cooking in Concert: Julia Child & Graham Kerr''.<ref name=alacarte>[http://www.alacartetv.com/html/jnj/aboutalc.htm Alacarte Communications; Julia and Jacque] Retrieved on 2009-03-28.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Kerr, in his book of that year called ''Swiftly Seasoned'', created the concept of a \"Moulded Ethnic Vegetable,\" a baked combination of starches and vegetables seasoned with flavors characteristic of different ethnic cuisines. The \"MEV,\" as he referred to it in recipes, was intended to remedy what he perceived as a lack of focus in vegetarian meals; according to Kerr, while omnivorous cuisine generally has a central focus in a meat dish, vegetarian plates are often little more than collections of side dishes, and the MEV was an attempt to provide a central focus for such meals. The MEV was not a widely successful concept, and a business venture to manufacture and sell a [[muffin tin]]\u2013like MEV baking pan was not successful. (While it was generally intended to be vegetarian, Kerr did incorporate meats into some MEV recipes in later books.)\n\nFrom 1996 to 2000, Kerr was also the editor at large for ''[[Cooking Light]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"cook's info\" />\n\nSince the late 1990s, Graham Kerr appeared in a series of radio and television features for the ''[[5 A Day]]'' program of the National Cancer Institute, called ''Do Yourself a Flavor'', emphasizing the use of fruits and vegetables in recipes. Kerr's earlier series, including ''The Galloping Gourmet'', has aired in the U.S. on [[Food Network]] and [[Cooking Channel]]. He works with [[Bastyr University]] and many businesses looking for innovation, better health and good taste.\n\nIn 1997\u201398, Kerr recorded a series titled The Gathering Place in Toronto, Canada\u2014a total of 130 one-hour episodes were recorded. The series featured guests who were prominent authorities in various health fields. Kerr included videos shot on location on a worldwide voyage aboard the ''Queen Elizabeth 2.''\n\nKerr's autobiography ''Flash Of Silver...the leap that changed my world'' was published in 2015.\n\n==Awards and accolades==\nIn 1965, Kerr was awarded the Gold Medal at the Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt, Germany, for ''The Graham Kerr Cookbook by the Galloping Gourmet''.\n\nIn 2003, he received an honorary doctorate for culinary arts and nutrition from [[Johnson & Wales University]] in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Kerr\">[http://www.grahamkerr.com/index.php/about/graham/ Graham Kerr Biography Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901201544/http://www.grahamkerr.com/index.php/about/graham/ |date=1 September 2010 }}</ref> Also in 2003, Kerr was awarded an Honorary Life Member of the American Dietetic Association.

Four versions were known to exist\u2014a regular version and three additional versions released in conjunction with [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles, [[CBC Television]] in Canada, and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in Britain. The Fremantle and KABC versions were hardcover, and the CBC and BBC versions, though identical in content, were softcover and [[General Binding Corporation|GBC]]\u2013bound, with different covers (with the BBC version under the title ''Entertaining with Kerr''). These cookbooks were generally sold by mail order through the television series.\n\nIn 1972, the cookbooks were re-released with new color covers and sold in bookshops. This new version was sold by [[Hachette Book Group USA|Paperback Library]] but, despite the publisher's name, the books were hardcover.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of New Zealand television personalities]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0601/cover.html 2003 interview with the Seattle Times]\n* [http://dougmilesinterview.milestonebroadcasting.com/2009/07/19/doug-miles-interviews-graham-kerr-tvs-the-galloping-gourmet-wslr-radio.aspx Radio Interview with Graham Kerr WSLR w/Doug Miles]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kerr, Graham}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:Scottish television chefs]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from London]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to Australia]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to Canada]]\n[[Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:People educated at Brighton College]]\n[[Category:Army Catering Corps officers]]\n[[Category:Australian television chefs]]\n", "name_user": "MayerG", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePersonal setbacks, born-again Christianity and Take Kerr:indefinite article agreement with noun", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Kerr"}

Subsidiaries include [[Belgacom ICS|BICS]], [[Belgacom Skynet|Skynet]], [[Tango (telecom)|Tango]], and [[Scarlet (company)|Scarlet]].\n\nSince September 2014, [[Proximus]] has been the commercial brand of all Belgacom products.\n\n==History==\n\n===The start of telephony in Belgium===\nIn 1879, the Belgian [[telegraph]] service installed a telephone line at the Parliament. That same year, several private contractors submitted requests to operate the telephone networks in various Belgian cities. The lack of legislation during the first few years of operation reduced the telephone network's chances of developing. It also forced the Belgian authorities to develop a legislative framework to regulate the operation of telephony in [[Belgium]].\n\nIn 1896, the whole [[telephony]] sector passed into the hands of a public company.\n\nIn 1913, a large portion of Belgium was accessible by telephone. Although the number of subscribers was still small, the majority of railway stations, post offices and telegraphs were equipped with public telephone booths.\n\n===After World War I: the shift to an autonomous public-sector company===\n[[World War I]] had caused a complete and utter suspension of telecommunications in Belgium. One of the reasons for this was the financial dependency of the public company. The damage caused during the war and the dismantling of parts of the networks meant that colossal investments were needed to manage the telegraphs and telephones.\n\nThe national telegraph and telephone company (R\u00e9gie des T\u00e9l\u00e9graphes et T\u00e9l\u00e9phones, ''RTT'') was set up on 19 July 1930. The public-sector company thus became autonomous: it was no longer dependent on annual State budgets and was authorized to carry out its own management.\n\n===Inclusion of the RTT in the state industrial policy===\nWhen the RTT was created, huge sums were invested in the Belgian telephone network. More and more sectors of society now had access to telephony. At the same time, another development was unfolding that would quickly entail a major expense for the company.\n\nDuring the economic crisis of the 1930s, the State would involve the RTT in its industrial and employment policy. In an attempt to reduce the high unemployment rate in the sector the State forced the entire Belgian telephone network to become automated. This development strongly restricted the autonomy of the RTT. Although the law of 1930 explicitly stated that the company could draw up and implement an investment plan in an [[autonomous]] manner, by imposing its employment policy, the State was going against the basic principle of the law. After the war, this would soon become a structural problem for the RTT.\n\n===From a leading-edge company to crisis: the RTT in the post-war period===\nAfter [[World War II]], the RTT was faced with considerable damage and the dismantling of part of its networks. To give a quick boost to the sector, the State decided to intervene financially.\n\nDuring this period, the demand for telecommunication services increased at an alarming rate. The number of subscribers quickly rose from approximately 350,000 in 1946 to 522,000 in 1951 and 1,049,000 in 1965. This growth in the customer base led to a very high rate of investment. Thanks to this, towards the end of the 1960s, the RTT found itself at the forefront of social and technological development.\n\nBut this expansionist approach had a negative side. From the late 1960s, the losses began to accumulate. And the global economic crisis in 1973 did not help matters:  the company's financial situation only worsened. This situation would lead the RTT to carry out major reorganization programs during the mid-1970s.\n\nDuring the 1980s, it became clear that the telecommunications sector would become one of the key development poles at the end of the 20th century. Thus, in 1981, the RTT management began a major reorganization to solve certain structural problems within the company.\n\nDuring that period, another player entered the scene. In 1987, the [[European Commission]] published its [[Green Paper]] on telecommunications, which focused on [[liberalization]].\n\n===The 1990s: the Belgacom law and the evolution of the sector under European influence===\nThe Green Paper of 1987 was incorporated into the Belgian law of 21 March 1991, which created a new type of public-sector company with greater management autonomy. The Belgian telecommunications sector was thus reorganized and saw the creation of Belgacom, an autonomous public-sector company. This law aims to create an environment that is favorable to the competitive development of the telecommunications market in [[Belgium]]. From now on, a management contract had to define the prerogatives of the company and the public authorities in order to guarantee the offer of a certain number of general utility public services and a wider management autonomy than that provided for in the law of 1930.\n\nIn 1994, the European convergence process began to accelerate. In a new Green Paper, the European Commission declared that the operation of the networks and [[telephony]] must also be open to competition. 1994 was also the year in which Belgacom founded [[Proximus]], Belgium's first mobile network.\n\nOn 1 July 1994, this activity, as well as the old analog Mob2 system, was transferred to a subsidiary, Belgacom Mobile, with the following shareholding: 75% Belgacom \u2013 25% Air Touch, then [[Vodafone]] in 1999.\n\nAt the same time, Belgacom faced competition by forming partnerships with [[Ameritech]], Tele Danmark and [[Singapore]] Telecom. Various Belgian financial institutions responded by forming a consortium, which was called ADSB. The Belgian State holds 50.1% of the shares and therefore remains the main shareholder.\n\nThe BeST plan, which was mainly aimed at restructuring the company and dividing it into four \"business units,\" was implemented in 2001. Belgacom also disposed of certain activities such as Belgacom France, Ben, its security activities as well as the French activities of Infosources.\n\nThe human dimension of the BeST plan was implemented in the course of 2002. The company, which employed too many staff at the time, had many reasons for adopting this plan: voluntary offers for departure, part-time work and reconversion were proposed to a large portion of the staff.\n\nIn an increasingly [[open market]], in which competition is more aggressive by the day, Belgacom decided to bet on the future by radically changing its image in 2003. A change of logo, colors and the promise to be closer to its customers were the bases on which the former RTT began to work.\n\nThese radical changes in the company's philosophy were followed by the operator's [[initial public offering]]. On 22 March 2004, Belgacom was listed for the first time on the [[Euronext]] stock market. The Belgian State remains the majority shareholder with 50% + 1 of all shares, while the ADSB consortium sold all its shares.\n\nThis enabled the Belgian incumbent operator to free considerable sums to finance its objectives. Indeed, the time has come for broadband, and the funding of the Broadway project (to cover the whole Belgian territory with fiber optic cables) requires huge investments.\n\n2004 was also the year in which the incumbent operator carried out its first digital TV tests with a view to finding new sources of income in an increasingly competitive market.\n\n===From 2005 to 2010: consolidation, convergence and first bundled offers===\n2005 was marked by two important events for Belgacom: the launch of [[Belgacom TV]] and the takeover bid on [[Telindus]]. The first signs of digital TV in Belgium appeared in 2004, when Belgacom started its first digital TV tests in a few hundred homes. In May 2005, the Belgian operator took the market by surprise when it acquired the rights to broadcast professional Belgian football (D1 & D2) for the next three seasons through its subsidiary Skynet iMotions Activities.\n\nThis step anticipated the imminent launch of Belgacom TV in June 2005. This digital TV offer via ADSL was the first of its kind in Belgium and transformed Belgacom into a quadruple player, offering fixed telephony, mobile telephony, high-speed Internet as well as television. It also enabled the Belgian company to secure new sources of income, given that the profit margins on its traditional activities are becoming increasingly reduced.\n\n2005 was also the year of the takeover bid on Telindus, a leader in the network integration sector. An initial bid, considered \"hostile\" by the Telindus management, was made in September. This marked the start of a stock-market saga that would go on for almost four months. Tensions were high between the two companies, and the different stakeholders fought it out in the press.

Subsidiaries include [[Belgacom ICS|BICS]], [[Belgacom Skynet|Skynet]], [[Tango (telecom)|Tango]], and [[Scarlet (company)|Scarlet]].\n\nSince September 2014, [[Proximus]] has been the commercial brand of all Belgacom products.\n\n==History==\n\n===The start of telephony in Belgium===\nIn 1879, the Belgian [[telegraph]] service installed a telephone line at the Parliament. That same year, several private contractors submitted requests to operate the telephone networks in various Belgian cities. The lack of legislation during the first few years of operation reduced the telephone network\u2019s chances of developing. It also forced the Belgian authorities to develop a legislative framework to regulate the operation of telephony in [[Belgium]].\n\nIn 1896, the whole [[telephony]] sector passed into the hands of a public company.\n\nIn 1913, a large portion of Belgium was accessible by telephone. Although the number of subscribers was still small, the majority of railway stations, post offices and telegraphs were equipped with public telephone booths.\n\n===After World War I: the shift to an autonomous public-sector company===\n[[World War I]] had caused a complete and utter suspension of telecommunications in Belgium. One of the reasons for this was the financial dependency of the public company. The damage caused during the war and the dismantling of parts of the networks meant that colossal investments were needed to manage the telegraphs and telephones.\n\nThe national telegraph and telephone company (R\u00e9gie des T\u00e9l\u00e9graphes et T\u00e9l\u00e9phones, ''RTT'') was set up on 19 July 1930. The public-sector company thus became autonomous: it was no longer dependent on annual State budgets and was authorized to carry out its own management.\n\n===Inclusion of the RTT in the state industrial policy===\nWhen the RTT was created, huge sums were invested in the Belgian telephone network. More and more sectors of society now had access to telephony. At the same time, another development was unfolding that would quickly entail a major expense for the company.\n\nDuring the economic crisis of the 1930s, the State would involve the RTT in its industrial and employment policy. In an attempt to reduce the high unemployment rate in the sector the State forced the entire Belgian telephone network to become automated. This development strongly restricted the autonomy of the RTT. Although the law of 1930 explicitly stated that the company could draw up and implement an investment plan in an [[autonomous]] manner, by imposing its employment policy, the State was going against the basic principle of the law. After the war, this would soon become a structural problem for the RTT.\n\n===From a leading-edge company to crisis: the RTT in the post-war period===\nAfter [[World War II]], the RTT was faced with considerable damage and the dismantling of part of its networks. To give a quick boost to the sector, the State decided to intervene financially.\n\nDuring this period, the demand for telecommunication services increased at an alarming rate. The number of subscribers quickly rose from approximately 350,000 in 1946 to 522,000 in 1951 and 1,049,000 in 1965. This growth in the customer base led to a very high rate of investment. Thanks to this, towards the end of the 1960s, the RTT found itself at the forefront of social and technological development.\n\nBut this expansionist approach had a negative side. From the late 1960s, the losses began to accumulate. And the global economic crisis in 1973 did not help matters:  the company\u2019s financial situation only worsened. This situation would lead the RTT to carry out major reorganization programs during the mid-1970s.\n\nDuring the 1980s, it became clear that the telecommunications sector would become one of the key development poles at the end of the 20th century. Thus, in 1981, the RTT management began a major reorganization to solve certain structural problems within the company.\n\nDuring that period, another player entered the scene. In 1987, the [[European Commission]] published its [[Green Paper]] on telecommunications, which focused on [[liberalization]].\n\n===The 1990s: the Belgacom law and the evolution of the sector under European influence===\nThe Green Paper of 1987 was incorporated into the Belgian law of 21 March 1991, which created a new type of public-sector company with greater management autonomy. The Belgian telecommunications sector was thus reorganized and saw the creation of Belgacom, an autonomous public-sector company. This law aims to create an environment that is favorable to the competitive development of the telecommunications market in [[Belgium]]. From now on, a management contract had to define the prerogatives of the company and the public authorities in order to guarantee the offer of a certain number of general utility public services and a wider management autonomy than that provided for in the law of 1930.\n\nIn 1994, the European convergence process began to accelerate. In a new Green Paper, the European Commission declared that the operation of the networks and [[telephony]] must also be open to competition. 1994 was also the year in which Belgacom founded [[Proximus]], Belgium\u2019s first mobile network.\n\nOn 1 July 1994, this activity, as well as the old analog Mob2 system, was transferred to a subsidiary, Belgacom Mobile, with the following shareholding: 75% Belgacom \u2013 25% Air Touch, then [[Vodafone]] in 1999.\n\nAt the same time, Belgacom faced competition by forming partnerships with [[Ameritech]], Tele Danmark and [[Singapore]] Telecom. Various Belgian financial institutions responded by forming a consortium, which was called ADSB. The Belgian State holds 50.1% of the shares and therefore remains the main shareholder.\n\nThe BeST plan, which was mainly aimed at restructuring the company and dividing it into four \"business units,\" was implemented in 2001. Belgacom also disposed of certain activities such as Belgacom France, Ben, its security activities as well as the French activities of Infosources.\n\nThe human dimension of the BeST plan was implemented in the course of 2002. The company, which employed too many staff at the time, had many reasons for adopting this plan: voluntary offers for departure, part-time work and reconversion were proposed to a large portion of the staff.\n\nIn an increasingly [[open market]], in which competition is more aggressive by the day, Belgacom decided to bet on the future by radically changing its image in 2003. A change of logo, colors and the promise to be closer to its customers were the bases on which the former RTT began to work.\n\nThese radical changes in the company\u2019s philosophy were followed by the operator\u2019s [[initial public offering]]. On 22 March 2004, Belgacom was listed for the first time on the [[Euronext]] stock market. The Belgian State remains the majority shareholder with 50% + 1 of all shares, while the ADSB consortium sold all its shares.\n\nThis enabled the Belgian incumbent operator to free considerable sums to finance its objectives. Indeed, the time has come for broadband, and the funding of the Broadway project (to cover the whole Belgian territory with fiber optic cables) requires huge investments.\n\n2004 was also the year in which the incumbent operator carried out its first digital TV tests with a view to finding new sources of income in an increasingly competitive market.\n\n===From 2005 to 2010: consolidation, convergence and first bundled offers===\n2005 was marked by two important events for Belgacom: the launch of [[Belgacom TV]] and the takeover bid on [[Telindus]]. The first signs of digital TV in Belgium appeared in 2004, when Belgacom started its first digital TV tests in a few hundred homes. In May 2005, the Belgian operator took the market by surprise when it acquired the rights to broadcast professional Belgian football (D1 & D2) for the next three seasons through its subsidiary Skynet iMotions Activities.\n\nThis step anticipated the imminent launch of Belgacom TV in June 2005. This digital TV offer via ADSL was the first of its kind in Belgium and transformed Belgacom into a quadruple player, offering fixed telephony, mobile telephony, high-speed Internet as well as television. It also enabled the Belgian company to secure new sources of income, given that the profit margins on its traditional activities are becoming increasingly reduced.\n\n2005 was also the year of the takeover bid on Telindus, a leader in the network integration sector. An initial bid, considered \"hostile\" by the Telindus management, was made in September. This marked the start of a stock-market saga that would go on for almost four months. Tensions were high between the two companies, and the different stakeholders fought it out in the press. After a counter bid launched by [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], Belgacom eventually carried the day, arriving at a conditional partnership agreement with Telindus in late December.

Socrates, in ''Phaedo'' 109a referred to the portion of the world he knew of as between the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and the River Phasis, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Anaximander]] considered Rioni as a boundary between Europe and Asia<ref name=\"pp324\"/> The famed voyage of Jason and the Argonauts, though semi-mythological, was said to have occurred by the Argonauts sailing up the Rioni river from its mouth at the Black Sea at Poti, to [[Kutaisi]], Georgia.\n\nThe term \"[[pheasant]]\" and the scientific name ''[[Phasianus colchicus]]'' are derived from \"Phasis\" and \"Colchis\", as this was said to be the region from which the common pheasant was introduced to Europe<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, September 2009</ref> in ancient times (the ring-necked pheasants seen in the present day were later introduced from [[East Asia]]; see [[Common pheasant]] for details). It is said that \"the failure of Kolkhis to emerge as a strong kingdom or to be maintained as a province of Rome has been blamed on the pestilential climate of the Phasis Valley, a situation remarked upon by travelers down to modern times, when the swamps were finally drained.<ref>Robert H. Hewsen, Armenia: A Historical Atlas, 2001, page 38</ref>\".\n\n=== Description ===\nThe Rioni is the longest river wholly within the borders of Georgia.
