[[Ma'at]], a female personification, considered to be both maternal and a delivering force, is an Ancient Egyptian personification of physical and moral law, order, and truth. In the judgment scene described in the Egyptian and the Book of Pass (the [[Book of the Dead]], which evolved from the [[Coffin Texts]] and the [[Pyramid Texts]]), there are 42 questions personifying the analysis of [[Ma'at]]. If the departed reasonably can give answers to the 42 questions, they have the potential to either be reincarnate, or if completely successful, reach the ultimate goal of becoming a Star, whereon, they can continue to give Light, and fuel Universal growth. These 42 questions correspond to the \"42 Negative Confessions\" from funerary texts such as the [[Maat#42_Negative_Confessions_(Papyrus_of_Ani) | Papyrus of Ani]].\n** There are 42 [[Stations of the Exodus]] which are the locations visited by the [[Israelite|Israelites]] following their [[The Exodus|exodus from Egypt]], recorded in [https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0433.htm#1 Numbers 33], with variations also recorded in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]].\n**42 is the number with which God creates the Universe in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic tradition]]. In Kabbalah, the most significant name is that of the En Sof (also known as \"[[Ein Sof]]\", \"Infinite\" or \"Endless\"), who is above the Sefirot (sometimes spelled \"[[Sephirot]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.ucsc.edu/cosmo/primack_abrams/InABeginningTikkun1995.pdf|title=In A Beginning...Quantum Cosmology and Kabbalah|accessdate=2008-03-14|author1=Joel Primack|author2=Nancy E. Abrams}}</ref> The Forty-Two-Lettered Name contains four combined names which are spelled in Hebrew letters  (spelled in letters   = 42 letters), which is the name of Azilut (or \"[[Atziluth]]\" \"Emanation\"). While there are obvious links between the Forty-Two Lettered Name of the Babylonian Talmud and the Kabbalah's Forty-Two Lettered Name, they are probably not identical because of the Kabbalah's emphasis on numbers. The Kabbalah also contains a Forty-Five Lettered Name and a Seventy-Two Lettered Name.\n** The number 42 appears in various contexts in [[Christianity]]. There are 42 generations (names) in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]'s version of the [[Genealogy of Jesus]]; it is prophesied that for 42 months the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast]] will hold dominion over the Earth ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13:5); 42 men of Beth-azmaveth were counted in the [[census]] of men of [[Israel]] upon return from exile ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:24); [[God in Christianity|God]] sent bears to maul 42 of the teenage boys who mocked [[Elisha]] for his baldness ([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 2:23), etc.\n** In [[Judaism]], the number (in the ''Babylonian Talmud'', compiled 375&nbsp;AD to 499&nbsp;AD) of the \"Forty-Two Lettered Name\" ascribed to God. Rab (or Rabhs), a 3rd-century source in the Talmud stated \"The Forty-Two Lettered Name is entrusted only to him who is pious, meek, middle-aged, free from bad temper, sober, and not insistent on his rights\". [Source: ''Talmud Kidduschin'' 71a, Translated by Rabbi Dr. I. Epstein]. [[Maimonides]] felt that the original Talmudic Forty-Two Lettered Name was perhaps composed of several combined divine names [Maimonides \"Moreh\"]. The apparently unpronouncable [[Tetragrammaton]] provides the backdrop from the Twelve-Lettered Name and the Forty-Two Lettered Name of the Talmud.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n** In [[Judaism]], by some traditions the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]] is written with no fewer than 42 lines per column, based on the journeys of Israel. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Ganzfried |first1=R.

If the departed reasonably can give answers to the 42 questions, they have the potential to either be reincarnate, or if completely successful, reach the ultimate goal of becoming a Star, whereon, they can continue to give Light, and fuel Universal growth. These 42 questions correspond to the \"42 Negative Confessions\" from funerary texts such as the [[Maat#42_Negative_Confessions_(Papyrus_of_Ani) | Papyrus of Ani]].\n** There are 42 [[Stations of the Exodus]] which are the locations visited by the [[Israelite|Israelites]] following their [[The Exodus|exodus from Egypt]], recorded in [https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0433.htm#1 Numbers 33], with variations also recorded in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Deuteronomy]].\n**42 is the number with which God creates the Universe in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic tradition]]. In Kabbalah, the most significant name is that of the En Sof (also known as \"[[Ein Sof]]\", \"Infinite\" or \"Endless\"), who is above the Sefirot (sometimes spelled \"[[Sephirot]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.ucsc.edu/cosmo/primack_abrams/InABeginningTikkun1995.pdf|title=In A Beginning...Quantum Cosmology and Kabbalah|accessdate=2008-03-14|author1=Joel Primack|author2=Nancy E. Abrams}}</ref> The Forty-Two-Lettered Name contains four combined names which are spelled in Hebrew letters  (spelled in letters   = 42 letters), which is the name of Azilut (or \"[[Atziluth]]\" \"Emanation\"). While there are obvious links between the Forty-Two Lettered Name of the Babylonian Talmud and the Kabbalah's Forty-Two Lettered Name, they are probably not identical because of the Kabbalah's emphasis on numbers. The Kabbalah also contains a Forty-Five Lettered Name and a Seventy-Two Lettered Name.\n** The number 42 appears in various contexts in [[Christianity]]. There are 42 generations (names) in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]'s version of the [[Genealogy of Jesus]]; it is prophesied that for 42 months the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast]] will hold dominion over the Earth ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13:5); 42 men of Beth-azmaveth were counted in the [[census]] of men of [[Israel]] upon return from exile ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:24); [[God in Christianity|God]] sent bears to maul 42 of the teenage boys who mocked [[Elisha]] for his baldness ([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 2:23), etc.\n** In [[Judaism]], the number (in the ''Babylonian Talmud'', compiled 375&nbsp;AD to 499&nbsp;AD) of the \"Forty-Two Lettered Name\" ascribed to God. Rab (or Rabhs), a 3rd-century source in the Talmud stated \"The Forty-Two Lettered Name is entrusted only to him who is pious, meek, middle-aged, free from bad temper, sober, and not insistent on his rights\". [Source: ''Talmud Kidduschin'' 71a, Translated by Rabbi Dr. I. Epstein]. [[Maimonides]] felt that the original Talmudic Forty-Two Lettered Name was perhaps composed of several combined divine names [Maimonides \"Moreh\"]. The apparently unpronouncable [[Tetragrammaton]] provides the backdrop from the Twelve-Lettered Name and the Forty-Two Lettered Name of the Talmud.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n** In [[Judaism]], by some traditions the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]] is written with no fewer than 42 lines per column, based on the journeys of Israel. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Ganzfried |first1=R.
