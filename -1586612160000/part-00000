It supports the structures of the [[face]] and provides a protective [[Cranial cavity|cavity]] for the [[brain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skull|title=skull|website=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217083723/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skull|archivedate=17 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The skull is composed of two parts: the '''cranium''' and the [[mandible]]. In [[human]]s, these two parts are the [[neurocranium]] and the viscerocranium or [[facial skeleton]] that includes the mandible as its largest [[bone]]. The skull forms the anterior most portion of the skeleton and is a product of [[cephalisation]]\u2014housing the [[brain]], and several [[sensory system|sensory]] structures such as the [[eye]]s, [[ear]]s, [[nose]], and [[mouth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/cephalization|title=Cephalization: Biology|website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502000749/http://www.britannica.com/science/cephalization|archivedate=2 May 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=23 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In humans these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton.\n\nFunctions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow [[stereoscopic vision]], and fixing the position of the ears to enable [[sound localisation]] of the direction and distance of sounds. In some animals such as horned [[ungulate]]s, the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the [[frontal bone]]) for the [[horn (anatomy)|horns]].\n\nThe English word \"skull\" is probably derived from [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|Old Norse]] \"skulle\", while the [[Latin]] word ''cranium'' comes from the [[Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek root]] \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (''kranion'').\n\nThe skull is made up of a number of fused [[flat bone]]s, and contains many [[foramina]], [[fossa (anatomy)|fossae]], [[process (anatomy)|processes]], and several cavities or [[sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]]. In [[zoology]] there are openings in the skull called [[fenestra]]e.\n\n==Skulls among vertebrate animals==\n===Fish===\n[[File:FishKeyDay.jpg|thumb|right|Fish head parts, 1889, Fauna of British India, Sir Francis Day]]\n[[File:Xiphias gladius 7zz.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of a [[swordfish]]]]\n[[File:Esox lucius 30zz.jpg|thumb|Skull of a [[Northern pike]]]]\nThe skull of fishes is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones. [[Lamprey]]s and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper and lower [[jaw]]s being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional [[dermal bone]], forming a more or less coherent [[skull roof]] in [[lungfish]] and [[holost]] fish. The lower jaw defines a chin.\n\nThe simpler structure is found in [[jawless fish]], in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws.<ref name=\"VB2\" />\n\n[[Cartilaginous fish]], such as [[shark]]s and rays, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large [[fontanelle]]. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], and capsules to enclose the [[olfactory]] organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the [[inner ear]]. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]], articulating with the first [[vertebra]]. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller [[Foramina of skull|foramina]] for the cranial nerves. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper.<ref name=\"VB2\">{{cite book |last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |first2=Parsons |last2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA |pages=173\u2013177 |isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anarhichas lupus skull Iles de la Madeleine.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of an [[Atlantic wolffish]]]]\n\nIn [[ray-finned fish]]es, there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the [[premaxilla]], with the [[maxilla]] itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.<ref name=\"VB\" />\n\nAlthough the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living [[lungfish]]es. The [[skull roof]] is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the [[pterygoid bone|pterygoid]]s and [[vomer]]s alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from [[cartilage]], and its overall structure is reduced.<ref name=\"VB\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tetrapods===\n[[File:Tiktaalik skull front.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', an extinct genus transitional between [[lobe-finned fish]] and early tetrapods]]\n[[File:Chelydra-serpentina3.jpg|thumb|right|Common snapping turtle]]\nThe skulls of the earliest [[tetrapod]]s closely resembled those of their [[ancestor]]s amongst the [[lobe-finned fish]]es. The [[skull roof]] is formed of a series of plate-like bones, including the [[maxilla]], [[frontal bone|frontals]], [[parietal bone|parietal]]s, and [[lacrimal bone|lacrimal]]s, among others. It is overlaying the [[endocranium]], corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in [[sharks]] and [[Batoidea|rays]]. The various separate bones that compose the [[temporal bone]] of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the [[vomer]] and [[palatine bone]]s. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the [[foramen magnum]] and a median bone lying further forward; these are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[occipital bone]] and parts of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] in mammals. Finally, the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones, only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian [[mandible]].<ref name=\"VB\">{{cite book |last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |last2=Parsons |first2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA |pages=216\u2013247 |isbn=0-03-910284-X}}</ref>\n\nIn living tetrapods, a great many of the original bones have either disappeared or fused into one another in various arrangements.\n\n===Birds===\n[[File:CuckooSkull.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Cuckoo skull]]\n[[File:Anatidae-skull02.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Side view of [[Anatidae]] skull]]\n[[Bird]]s have a [[diapsid]] skull, as in reptiles, with a prelachrymal fossa (present in some reptiles).

The skull of a normal bird usually weighs about 1% of the bird's total bodyweight. The eye occupies a considerable amount of the skull and is surrounded by a sclerotic eye-ring, a ring of tiny bones. This characteristic is also seen in reptiles.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Amphibians===\n[[File:AmphibSkeletons.png|thumb|right|Amphibians skulls, Hans Gadow, 1909 Amphibia and Reptiles]]\nLiving [[amphibian]]s typically have greatly reduced skulls, with many of the bones either absent or wholly or partly replaced by cartilage.<ref name=\"VB\" /> In mammals and birds, in particular, modifications of the skull occurred to allow for the expansion of the brain. The fusion between the various bones is especially notable in birds, in which the individual structures may be difficult to identify.\n\n== Structure ==\n=== Fenestrae===\n\n[[File:Centrosaurus.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' skull]]\n\n[[File:Spinosaurus skull en.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' skull]]\n\n[[File:Massospondylus Skull Steveoc 86.png|thumb|right|The [[Fenestra (anatomy)|fenestrae]] in the skull of the dinosaur ''[[Massospondylus]]'']]\n\n{|\n|\nThe [[Fenestra (anatomy)|fenestrae]] (from Latin, meaning ''windows'') are openings in the skull.\n* [[Antorbital fenestra]]\n* [[Mandible|Mandibular]] fenestra\n* [[Quadratojugal]] fenestra\n* [[Subsquamosal fenestra]], an opening between two parts of the [[squamosal bone]] in some rodents\n* [[Temple (anatomy)|Temporal]] fenestra\n|}\n\nThe [[Temple (anatomy)|temporal]] [[Fenestra (anatomy)|fenestrae]] are anatomical features of the skulls of several types of [[amniote]]s, characterised by bilaterally symmetrical holes (fenestrae) in the temporal bone. Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the [[postorbital]] and [[squamosal]] bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the [[infratemporal fenestra]]e. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.\n\nPhysiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the [[synapsid]]s (mammal-like reptiles) and the [[diapsid]]s (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are diapsids, have large advanced openings, and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess one fenestral opening in the skull, situated to the rear of the orbit.\n\n====Classification====\n[[File:Chimpanzee skull.jpg|thumb|right|Chimpanzee skull|258x258px]]\n[[File:Goat skull-FMVZ USP-18.jpeg|thumb|Goat skull.]]\nThere are four types of amniote skull, classified by the number and location of their temporal fenestrae. These are:\n* [[Anapsida]] \u2013 no openings\n* [[Synapsida]] \u2013 one low opening (beneath the postorbital and squamosal bones)\n* [[Euryapsida]] \u2013 one high opening (above the postorbital and squamosal bones); euryapsids actually evolved from a diapsid configuration, losing their lower temporal fenestra.\n* [[Diapsida]] \u2013 two openings\n\nEvolutionarily, they are related as follows:\n*[[Amniota]]\n**Class '''[[Synapsida]]'''\n***Order [[Therapsida]]\n****Class [[Mammalia]] \u2013 mammals\n**(Unranked) [[Sauropsida]] \u2013 reptiles and birds\n***Class [[Reptilia]]\n****Subclass [[Parareptilia]]\n*****Infraclass '''[[Anapsida]]'''\n****Subclass [[Eureptilia]]\n*****Infraclass '''[[Diapsida]]'''\n******Class [[Bird|Aves]]\n*****Infraclass '''[[Euryapsida]]'''\n\n=== Bones ===\nThe [[jugal]] is a skull bone found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds.

The membranous viscerocranium includes the [[mandible]].\n\nThe sutures are fairly rigid joints between bones of the neurocranium.\n\nThe facial skeleton is formed by the bones supporting the face.\n\n===Bones of human skull===\nExcept for the [[Human mandible|mandible]], all of the bones of the skull are joined together by [[Fibrous joint#Sutures|sutures]]\u2014[[synarthrosis|synarthrodial]] (immovable) [[joints]] formed by bony [[ossification]], with [[Sharpey's fibres]] permitting some flexibility. Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as [[wormian bone]]s or ''sutural bones''. Most commonly these are found in the course of the [[lambdoid suture]].\n\nThe human skull is generally considered to consist of twenty-two [[bone]]s\u2014eight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the neurocranium these are the [[occipital bone]], two [[temporal bone]]s, two [[parietal bone]]s, the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]] and [[frontal bone]]s.\n\nThe  bones of the [[facial skeleton]] (14) are the [[vomer]], two [[inferior nasal concha]]e, two [[nasal bone]]s, two [[maxilla]], the [[mandible]], two [[palatine bone]]s, two [[zygomatic bone]]s, and two [[lacrimal bone]]s. Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the [[hyoid bone]] or the three [[ossicles]] of the [[middle ear]] but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two.\n\nSome of these bones\u2014the occipital, parietal, frontal, in the neurocranium, and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial skeleton are [[flat bone]]s.\n\n===Cavities and foramina===\n[[File:3d CT scan animation.gif|thumb|CT scan of a human skull in 3D]]\nThe skull also contains [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]], air-filled cavities known as [[paranasal sinuses]], and numerous [[List of foramina in the human body#Skull|foramina]]. The sinuses are lined with [[respiratory epithelium]]. Their known functions are the lessening of the weight of the skull, the aiding of resonance to the voice and the warming and moistening of the air drawn into the [[nasal cavity]].jzuuzuzzusuusif\n\nThe foramina are openings in the skull. The largest of these is the [[foramen magnum]] that allows the passage of the [[spinal cord]] as well as [[nerve]]s and [[blood vessel]]s.\n\n===Processes===\nThe many [[Process (anatomy)#Examples|processes]] of the skull include the [[mastoid process]] and the [[zygomatic process]]es.\n\n==Development of human skull==\n[[File:Sobo 1909 104.png|thumb|left|Skull of a new-born child from the side]]\nThe skull is a complex structure; its bones are formed both by [[intramembranous ossification|intramembranous]] and [[endochondral ossification]]. The [[skull roof]] bones, comprising the bones of the [[facial skeleton]] and the sides and roof of the neurocranium, are [[dermal bone]]s formed by intramembranous ossification, though the [[temporal bone]]s are formed by endochondral ossification. The [[endocranium]], the bones supporting the brain (the [[occipital bone|occipital]], [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], and [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]]) are largely formed by endochondral ossification. Thus frontal and parietal bones are purely membranous.<ref>{{cite book|url=|title=Human Embryology & Developmental Biology|last=Carlson|first=Bruce M.|publisher=Mosby|year=1999|isbn=0-8151-1458-3|edition=Second|location=|page=|pages=166\u2013170|accessdate=}}</ref> The geometry of the [[base of skull|skull base]] and its [[fossa (anatomy)|fossae]], the [[anterior cranial fossa|anterior]], [[middle cranial fossa|middle]] and [[posterior cranial fossa]]e changes rapidly.

During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the [[frontal bone]]). The bones of the [[skull roof|roof of the skull]] are initially separated by regions of dense [[connective tissue]] called [[fontanelles]]. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the \"obstetrical hinge\", which is where the [[Squama occipitalis|squamous]] and [[Lateral parts of occipital bone|lateral parts]] of the [[occipital bone]] meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the [[great cerebral vein]]. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating [[Suture (anatomical)|suture]]s. The five sutures are the two [[squamosal suture|squamous sutures]], one [[coronal suture|coronal]], one [[lambdoid suture|lambdoid]], and one [[sagittal suture]]. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a \"soft spot\" on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle.\n\nThe skull in the [[neonate]] is large in proportion to other parts of the body. The facial skeleton is one seventh of the size of the [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]]. (In the adult it is half the size). The [[base of the skull]] is short and narrow, though the [[inner ear]] is almost adult size.<ref name=\"Human Anatomy Volume 3\">{{cite book|title=BD Chaurasia's Human Anatomy: Regional and Applied Dissection and Clinical|last1=Chaurasia|first=B.

This is why patients with [[concussion]] must be watched extremely carefully.\n\nDating back to [[Neolithic]] times, a skull operation called [[trepanning]] was sometimes performed. This involved drilling a ''burr'' hole in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward.

In [[human]]s, these two parts are the [[neurocranium]] and the viscerocranium or [[facial skeleton]] that includes the mandible as its largest [[bone]]. The skull forms the anterior most portion of the skeleton and is a product of [[cephalisation]]\u2014housing the [[brain]], and several [[sensory system|sensory]] structures such as the [[eye]]s, [[ear]]s, [[nose]], and [[mouth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/cephalization|title=Cephalization: Biology|website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502000749/http://www.britannica.com/science/cephalization|archivedate=2 May 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=23 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In humans these sensory structures are part of the facial skeleton.\n\nFunctions of the skull include protection of the brain, fixing the distance between the eyes to allow [[stereoscopic vision]], and fixing the position of the ears to enable [[sound localisation]] of the direction and distance of sounds. In some animals such as horned [[ungulate]]s, the skull also has a defensive function by providing the mount (on the [[frontal bone]]) for the [[horn (anatomy)|horns]].\n\nThe English word \"skull\" is probably derived from [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|Old Norse]] \"skulle\", while the [[Latin]] word ''cranium'' comes from the [[Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek root]] \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd (''kranion'').\n\nThe skull is made up of a number of fused [[flat bone]]s, and contains many [[foramina]], [[fossa (anatomy)|fossae]], [[process (anatomy)|processes]], and several cavities or [[sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]]. In [[zoology]] there are openings in the skull called [[fenestra]]e.\n\n==Skulls among vertebrate animals==\n===Fish===\n[[File:FishKeyDay.jpg|thumb|right|Fish head parts, 1889, Fauna of British India, Sir Francis Day]]\n[[File:Xiphias gladius 7zz.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of a [[swordfish]]]]\n[[File:Esox lucius 30zz.jpg|thumb|Skull of a [[Northern pike]]]]\nThe skull of fishes is formed from a series of only loosely connected bones. [[Lamprey]]s and sharks only possess a cartilaginous endocranium, with both the upper and lower [[jaw]]s being separate elements. Bony fishes have additional [[dermal bone]], forming a more or less coherent [[skull roof]] in [[lungfish]] and [[holost]] fish. The lower jaw defines a chin.\n\nThe simpler structure is found in [[jawless fish]], in which the cranium is normally represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only partially enclosing the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril. Distinctively, these fish have no jaws.<ref name=\"VB2\" />\n\n[[Cartilaginous fish]], such as [[shark]]s and rays, have also simple, and presumably primitive, skull structures. The cranium is a single structure forming a case around the brain, enclosing the lower surface and the sides, but always at least partially open at the top as a large [[fontanelle]]. The most anterior part of the cranium includes a forward plate of cartilage, the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], and capsules to enclose the [[olfactory]] organs. Behind these are the orbits, and then an additional pair of capsules enclosing the structure of the [[inner ear]]. Finally, the skull tapers towards the rear, where the foramen magnum lies immediately above a single [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]], articulating with the first [[vertebra]]. There are, in addition, at various points throughout the cranium, smaller [[Foramina of skull|foramina]] for the cranial nerves. The jaws consist of separate hoops of cartilage, almost always distinct from the cranium proper.<ref name=\"VB2\">{{cite book |last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |first2=Parsons |last2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA |pages=173\u2013177 |isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anarhichas lupus skull Iles de la Madeleine.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of an [[Atlantic wolffish]]]]\n\nIn [[ray-finned fish]]es, there has also been considerable modification from the primitive pattern. The roof of the skull is generally well formed, and although the exact relationship of its bones to those of tetrapods is unclear, they are usually given similar names for convenience. Other elements of the skull, however, may be reduced; there is little cheek region behind the enlarged orbits, and little, if any bone in between them. The upper jaw is often formed largely from the [[premaxilla]], with the [[maxilla]] itself located further back, and an additional bone, the symplectic, linking the jaw to the rest of the cranium.<ref name=\"VB\" />\n\nAlthough the skulls of fossil lobe-finned fish resemble those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living [[lungfish]]es. The [[skull roof]] is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the [[pterygoid bone|pterygoid]]s and [[vomer]]s alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from [[cartilage]], and its overall structure is reduced.<ref name=\"VB\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tetrapods===\n[[File:Tiktaalik skull front.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', an extinct genus transitional between [[lobe-finned fish]] and early tetrapods]]\n[[File:Chelydra-serpentina3.jpg|thumb|right|Common snapping turtle]]\nThe skulls of the earliest [[tetrapod]]s closely resembled those of their [[ancestor]]s amongst the [[lobe-finned fish]]es.

It is overlaying the [[endocranium]], corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in [[sharks]] and [[Batoidea|rays]]. The various separate bones that compose the [[temporal bone]] of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the [[vomer]] and [[palatine bone]]s. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the [[foramen magnum]] and a median bone lying further forward; these are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] with the [[occipital bone]] and parts of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] in mammals.

Depending on the lineage of a given animal, two, one, or no pairs of temporal fenestrae may be present, above or below the [[postorbital]] and [[squamosal]] bones. The upper temporal fenestrae are also known as the supratemporal fenestrae, and the lower temporal fenestrae are also known as the [[infratemporal fenestra]]e. The presence and morphology of the temporal fenestra are critical for taxonomic classification of the synapsids, of which mammals are part.\n\nPhysiological speculation associates it with a rise in metabolic rates and an increase in jaw musculature. The earlier amniotes of the Carboniferous did not have temporal fenestrae but two more advanced lines did: the [[synapsid]]s (mammal-like reptiles) and the [[diapsid]]s (most reptiles and later birds). As time progressed, diapsids' and synapsids' temporal fenestrae became more modified and larger to make stronger bites and more jaw muscles. Dinosaurs, which are diapsids, have large advanced openings, and their descendants, the birds, have temporal fenestrae which have been modified. Mammals, which are synapsids, possess one fenestral opening in the skull, situated to the rear of the orbit.\n\n====Classification====\n[[File:Chimpanzee skull.jpg|thumb|right|Chimpanzee skull|258x258px]]\n[[File:Goat skull-FMVZ USP-18.jpeg|thumb|Goat skull.]]\nThere are four types of amniote skull, classified by the number and location of their temporal fenestrae.

The membranous viscerocranium includes the [[mandible]].\n\nThe sutures are fairly rigid joints between bones of the neurocranium.\n\nThe facial skeleton is formed by the bones supporting the face.\n\n===Bones of human skull===\nExcept for the [[Human mandible|mandible]], all of the bones of the skull are joined together by [[Fibrous joint#Sutures|sutures]]\u2014[[synarthrosis|synarthrodial]] (immovable) [[joints]] formed by bony [[ossification]], with [[Sharpey's fibres]] permitting some flexibility. Sometimes there can be extra bone pieces within the suture known as [[wormian bone]]s or ''sutural bones''. Most commonly these are found in the course of the [[lambdoid suture]].\n\nThe human skull is generally considered to consist of twenty-two [[bone]]s\u2014eight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the neurocranium these are the [[occipital bone]], two [[temporal bone]]s, two [[parietal bone]]s, the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]] and [[frontal bone]]s.\n\nThe  bones of the [[facial skeleton]] (14) are the [[vomer]], two [[inferior nasal concha]]e, two [[nasal bone]]s, two [[maxilla]], the [[mandible]], two [[palatine bone]]s, two [[zygomatic bone]]s, and two [[lacrimal bone]]s. Some sources count a paired bone as one, or the maxilla as having two bones (as its parts); some sources include the [[hyoid bone]] or the three [[ossicles]] of the [[middle ear]] but the overall general consensus of the number of bones in the human skull is the stated twenty-two.\n\nSome of these bones\u2014the occipital, parietal, frontal, in the neurocranium, and the nasal, lacrimal, and vomer, in the facial skeleton are [[flat bone]]s.\n\n===Cavities and foramina===\n[[File:3d CT scan animation.gif|thumb|CT scan of a human skull in 3D]]\nThe skull also contains [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]], air-filled cavities known as [[paranasal sinuses]], and numerous [[List of foramina in the human body#Skull|foramina]]. The sinuses are lined with [[respiratory epithelium]]. Their known functions are the lessening of the weight of the skull, the aiding of resonance to the voice and the warming and moistening of the air drawn into the [[nasal cavity]].\n\nThe foramina are openings in the skull. The largest of these is the [[foramen magnum]] that allows the passage of the [[spinal cord]] as well as [[nerve]]s and [[blood vessel]]s.\n\n===Processes===\nThe many [[Process (anatomy)#Examples|processes]] of the skull include the [[mastoid process]] and the [[zygomatic process]]es.\n\n==Development of human skull==\n[[File:Sobo 1909 104.png|thumb|left|Skull of a new-born child from the side]]\nThe skull is a complex structure; its bones are formed both by [[intramembranous ossification|intramembranous]] and [[endochondral ossification]]. The [[skull roof]] bones, comprising the bones of the [[facial skeleton]] and the sides and roof of the neurocranium, are [[dermal bone]]s formed by intramembranous ossification, though the [[temporal bone]]s are formed by endochondral ossification. The [[endocranium]], the bones supporting the brain (the [[occipital bone|occipital]], [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], and [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]]) are largely formed by endochondral ossification. Thus frontal and parietal bones are purely membranous.<ref>{{cite book|url=|title=Human Embryology & Developmental Biology|last=Carlson|first=Bruce M.|publisher=Mosby|year=1999|isbn=0-8151-1458-3|edition=Second|location=|page=|pages=166\u2013170|accessdate=}}</ref> The geometry of the [[base of skull|skull base]] and its [[fossa (anatomy)|fossae]], the [[anterior cranial fossa|anterior]], [[middle cranial fossa|middle]] and [[posterior cranial fossa]]e changes rapidly.

During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the [[frontal bone]]). The bones of the [[skull roof|roof of the skull]] are initially separated by regions of dense [[connective tissue]] called [[fontanelles]]. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the \"obstetrical hinge\", which is where the [[Squama occipitalis|squamous]] and [[Lateral parts of occipital bone|lateral parts]] of the [[occipital bone]] meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the [[great cerebral vein]]. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating [[Suture (anatomical)|suture]]s. The five sutures are the two [[squamosal suture|squamous sutures]], one [[coronal suture|coronal]], one [[lambdoid suture|lambdoid]], and one [[sagittal suture]]. The posterior fontanelle usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a \"soft spot\" on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle.\n\nThe skull in the [[neonate]] is large in proportion to other parts of the body. The facial skeleton is one seventh of the size of the [[calvaria (skull)|calvaria]]. (In the adult it is half the size). The [[base of the skull]] is short and narrow, though the [[inner ear]] is almost adult size.<ref name=\"Human Anatomy Volume 3\">{{cite book|title=BD Chaurasia's Human Anatomy: Regional and Applied Dissection and Clinical|last1=Chaurasia|first=B.

In these cases the raised intracranial pressure can cause herniation of the brain out of the [[foramen magnum]] (\"coning\") because there is no space for the brain to expand; this can result in significant [[brain damage]] or death unless an urgent operation is performed to relieve the pressure. This is why patients with [[concussion]] must be watched extremely carefully.\n\nDating back to [[Neolithic]] times, a skull operation called [[trepanning]] was sometimes performed. This involved drilling a ''burr'' hole in the cranium. Examination of skulls from this period reveals that the patients sometimes survived for many years afterward. It seems likely that trepanning was also performed purely for ritualistic or religious reasons. Nowadays this procedure is still used but is normally called a [[craniectomy]].\n\nIn March 2013, for the first time in the U.S., researchers replaced a large percentage of a patient's skull with a precision, [[3D printing|3D-printed]] [[polymer]] [[Implant (medicine)|implant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-polymer-skull-implant-used-first-time-us-244583|title=3D-Printed Polymer Skull Implant Used For First Time in US|date=7 March 2013|website=Medical Daily|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928042619/http://www.medicaldaily.com/3d-printed-polymer-skull-implant-used-first-time-us-244583|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status=live|accessdate=24 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> About 9 months later, the first complete cranium replacement with a 3D-printed plastic insert was performed on a Dutch woman.
