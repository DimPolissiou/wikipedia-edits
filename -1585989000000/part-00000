The highly rated coach, hired from [[Ajax Amsterdam]], brought lethal striker [[Sonny Anderson]] and the attacking midfielder [[Rivaldo]] with him. But surprisedly [[Barcelona]] sold [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] to [[Inter Milan]] just before season begin and thus handed [[Sonny Anderson]] as main striker. He introduced Barcelona to his marvelous 4-3-3 formation, in which [[Rivaldo]] was a perfect centre forward, scoring 20 goals in the league. Under [[Louis van Gaal|van Gaal]] at helm on his first season, Barcelona won their 15th [[La Liga]] title, 2nd [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]] title as well as 24th [[Copa del Rey]] title (thus winning their domestic double) but Barcelona crashed out of the [[UEFA Champions League]], following a lackluster performance in the First Group Phase. In fact, Barcelona ended up last in the group, contributing only single victory, two draws and three defeats and thus preventing [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s first treble glory.\n\n[[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] had a marvelous second half of the season, in which it kept pace with [[La Liga]] championship leaders [[Real Madrid]], then passing the Madrids when they had a couple of slips. In the end, a win in the 36th round was more than enough to clinch Barcelona's first league title in four years.\n\n==Squad==\n:''Squad at end of season''<ref>{{cite web|title=FootballSquads -

It was created by first editor Jamie Maclean, who ceded control to [[Rowan Pelling]] in 1997. Pelling staged a management buyout from the Erotic Print Society in 2001, after a successful tenure that saw circulation figures rise to 30,000. As the magazine's parent company had been experiencing financial difficulties, Pelling was able to purchase ''Erotic Review'' for only \u00a31 plus liabilities. In mid-2003 Pelling sold ''Erotic Review'' to media mogul [[Felix Dennis]], whose company Dennis Publishing controlled titles including ''Maxim''. In late 2004 ''Erotic Review'' was sold again, this time to a top-shelf magazine publisher. When the new management attempted to transfer the editorial team to the ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' offices in Surrey, they resigned ''en masse'', and Pelling was replaced as editor by Penthouse UK's sub editor Catasha Kin.<ref>Vanora Bennett [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article1076216.ece \"Goodbye Soho, Hello Surrey\"], ''[[The Times]]'', 24 September 2004.

Timon revamped ''ER'' to be less elitist, aimed at the emerging neo-libertarian audiences who were feeding the Burlesque cabaret revival in the UK at the time. He reduced the size of the publication to A5 (a format he termed as 'hand bag sized') and significantly increased the page count. He laid out the blueprint for a fully online offering of freely available content, with some also available for purchase. Utilising the global nature of the internet, printing was moved from Spain to Hong Kong allowing for significant savings to be achieved, despite the need to have the magazine flown to Dubai and then shipped to Felixstowe.\n\nThe relaunch edition, Edition 69, featured burlesque performer Miss Lily White on the cover and a book review by famous comedian and raconteur [[Barry Humphries]].

The team was established in [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970]], along with the [[Vancouver Canucks]], when the league expanded to 14 teams. They have played at [[KeyBank Center]] since [[1996\u201397 Buffalo Sabres season|1996]]. Prior to that, the Buffalo Sabres played at the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] from the start of the franchise in 1970.

Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] variety store chain; along with [[Robert O. Swados]], a Buffalo attorney. On the team's inaugural board of directors were [[Robert E. Rich, Jr.]], later the owner of the [[Buffalo Bisons]] minor league baseball team; and [[George W. Strawbridge, Jr.]], an heir to the [[Campbell Soup Company]] fortune. Buffalo had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres' establishment, the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] were a pillar of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Bisons hockey team]] played from 1928 to 1936), winning the [[Calder Cup]] in their final season.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Early Years|url=http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|work=The 40th Anniversary site of the Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=April 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307143201/http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|archivedate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWanting a name other than \"[[bison]]\" (a generic stock name used by Buffalo sports teams for decades), the Knoxes commissioned a name-the-team contest.

Their first attempt was thwarted when [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner [[Art Rooney]] persuaded his [[horse racing]] friends [[James D. Norris|James]] and [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]] to select [[Pittsburgh]] over Buffalo,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/9GS4yb89OsI</ref> while the second attempt was due to the NHL not wanting an expansion market to give up on a team so soon. At the time of their creation, the Sabres exercised their option to create their own AHL [[farm team]], the [[Cincinnati Swords]]. Former [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] general manager and head coach [[Punch Imlach]] was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres.\n\nThe year the Sabres debuted (1970) was an important year for major league sports in Buffalo. In addition to the Sabres' debut, the [[Buffalo Bills]] [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|officially joined]] the [[National Football League]], and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Buffalo Braves]] also began to play, sharing Memorial Auditorium with the Sabres. The city of Buffalo went from having no teams in the established [[major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] to three in one off-season, a situation that proved to be unsustainable. Between the Braves and the Sabres, the Sabres would prove to be by far the more successful of the two; [[Paul Snyder (basketball)|Paul Snyder]], the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' Braves owner, publicly feuded with the [[old money]] Knoxes and the local [[college basketball]] scene, eventually losing those feuds and being forced to sell his team in 1976. Subsequent owners of the Braves, in a series of convoluted transactions tied to the [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]], moved the team out of Buffalo.\n\nWhen the Sabres debuted as an expansion team, they took the ice to [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s Armenian war dance, \"[[Sabre Dance]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artvoice.com/2017/11/01/hockey-sin-city-andrew-kulyk-peter-farrell/#.Ws-U_YjwZuU|title=Hockey in Sin City|work=[[Artvoice]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=November 1, 2017|author=Kulyk, Andrew and Peter Farrell}}</ref> The song has been associated with the team as an unofficial anthem ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://as.com/videos/2016/07/06/en/1467824254_902709.html|title=All about new Manchester United signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=July 6, 2016|work=[[Diario AS]]}}</ref> It is often played between periods and after goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/2222/20120620/teemu-sel-nne-keeps-nhl-94-roster.htm|title=Teemu Sel\u00e4nne Keeps NHL '94 Roster Alive|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=June 20, 2012|work=[[GameNGuide]]|author=Caulfield, Luke}}</ref>\n\nThe consensus was that first pick in the [[1970 NHL Amateur Draft]] would be [[junior hockey|junior]] phenomenon [[Gilbert Perreault]]. Either the Sabres or the Canucks would get the first pick, to be determined with the spin of a [[roulette wheel]]. Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the first year the [[Montreal Canadiens]] did not have a priority right to draft [[Quebec]]-born junior players.\n\nThe Canucks were allocated numbers 1\u201310 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11\u201320. When league president [[Clarence Campbell]] spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on one. While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation, Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11, effectively handing Perreault to the Sabres.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |authorlink= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref> Perreault scored 38 goals in his rookie season of [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970\u201371]], at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL rookie, and he received the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's rookie of the year. Despite Perreault's play, the Sabres finished well out of playoff contention.\n[[File:French connection statue.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of the [[The French Connection (ice hockey)|French Connection]] [[line (ice hockey)|line]] stands outside [[KeyBank Center]]. Consisting of [[Gilbert Perreault]], [[Rick Martin]], and [[Rene Robert]], they played together from 1972 to 1979.]]\nIn the team's second season, [[1971\u201372 NHL season|1971\u201372]], rookie [[Rick Martin]], drafted fifth overall by Buffalo in [[1971 NHL Amateur Draft|1971]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Robert|Rene Robert]], acquired in a late-season trade from the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], joined Perreault and would become one of the league's top forward lines in the 1970s. Martin broke Perreault's record at once with 44 [[rookie]] goals. They were nicknamed \"[[The French Connection (hockey)|The French Connection]]\" after [[The French Connection (film)|the movie of the same name]] and in homage to their [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] roots. The Sabres made the playoffs for the first time in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972\u201373]], just the team's third year in the league, but lost in the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual [[Stanley Cup]] champion Montreal Canadiens.\n\nAfter a subpar year in [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1974]] that saw them miss the playoffs (as well as aging defenseman [[Tim Horton]]'s death in a [[driving under the influence|DUI]]-induced car accident), the Sabres tied for the best record in the NHL in the [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1974\u201375]] regular season. Buffalo advanced to the [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time in team history to play against the rough [[Philadelphia Flyers]] (who had been recently nicknamed the \"[[Philadelphia Flyers#1972\u20131978: The Broad Street Bullies|Broad Street Bullies]]\"), a series which included the legendary Fog Game (Game 3 of the series). Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 and the lack of air conditioning in the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]], parts of the game were played in heavy fog that made players, officials, and the puck invisible to many spectators. During a face-off and through the fog, Sabres center [[Jim Lorentz]] spotted a [[bat]] flying across the rink, swung at it with his stick, killing it. It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game. The Sabres won that game thanks to Rene Robert's goal in overtime. However, Philadelphia would wind up taking the Stanley Cup in six games, winning the series 4\u20132.\n\nThe French Connection, joined by 50\u2013goal scorer [[Danny Gare]], continued to score prolifically for the Sabres in [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975\u201376]], but the team lost in the quarterfinals to the [[New York Islanders]]. The Sabres had success through the late 1970s behind Gare and the French Connection (Perreault, Martin and Robert), but they were unable to return to the Finals despite a [[Prince of Wales Trophy|Wales Conference championship]] in [[1979\u201380 NHL season|1980]] and being the first team to beat the Soviet Olympic Team when they toured the United States. The French Connection era ended with Robert's trade to the [[Colorado Rockies (ice hockey)|Colorado Rockies]] in 1979 and Martin's trade to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in 1981, by which time Martin's career was essentially finished as the result of a devastating knee injury in 1980.\n\n=== Adams/Northeast Division rivalries (1981\u20131996) ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nIn [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1981\u201382]], the NHL realigned its conferences and adopted an intra-divisional playoff format for the first two rounds. It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity, and then face the near-certainty of having to get past either the [[Boston Bruins]] or Canadiens to make it to the conference finals. Aside from first-round victories over Montreal in 1982\u201383 and Boston in 1992\u201393, the era saw the Sabres lose to division rivals Boston, the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and Montreal in the Adams Division semi-finals (first round) a combined eight times, and miss the playoffs altogether in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387\u2014only third and fourth times out of the playoffs in franchise history. Perrault reached the 500-goal mark in the 1985\u201386 season and retired after playing 20 games in 1986\u201387, 17 years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick.\n\nThe Sabres drafted [[Pierre Turgeon]] with the first pick in the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]], and he quickly made an impact with the team. During his rookie season in 1987\u201388, he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in three years. He was joined in 1989 by [[Alexander Mogilny]], who with the help of Sabres officials became the first Soviet player to defect to the NHL, and cleared the way for all other Russian players to follow. In the 1989\u201390 season, the Sabres would improve to finish with 98 points\u2014third-best in the NHL\u2014but the playoff futility continued with a first-round loss to Montreal. The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in 1991 as part of a blockbuster seven-player trade that brought [[Pat LaFontaine]] to Buffalo.\n\nIn 1992\u201393, goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]] joined the team in a trade from the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. In the [[1993 Stanley Cup playoffs|1993 playoffs]], the Sabres upset the Bruins in a four-game sweep in the Adams Division semi-finals, their first playoff series victory in ten years. [[Brad May]]'s series-winning goal in overtime of Game 4 in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret's \"May Day!\" call. However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the Sabres in the division final, with the Sabres losing all four games by a 4\u20133 score (the last three games in overtime).\n\nWith the NHL adopting a conference playoff format for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], the Sabres faced the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the Eastern Conference playoffs' first round. Despite Hasek winning a 1\u20130 (quadruple overtime) goaltending duel with the Devils' [[Martin Brodeur]] in Game 6\u2014the Sabres' longest game ever, which went into quadruple overtime\u2014Buffalo would lose the series in seven games. Another first-round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout-shortened [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1994\u201395 season]] was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Northeast Division in 1995\u201396, as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. It was the first season under head coach [[Ted Nolan]] and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Nolan brought an exciting brand of hockey to Buffalo. During his coaching tenure, Buffalo was referred to as the \"hardest-working team in hockey\".<ref name=BuffNews>{{Cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Budd |title=Ruff front-runner to coach Sabres |journal=The Buffalo News |date=July 18, 1997 |page=1B |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> This season also featured the debut of \"walk-on\" veteran [[Randy Burridge]], who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training camp on a try-out basis. He scored 25 goals that season and was second in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine. Burridge also earned the Tim Horton Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team [[Most Valuable Player]].\n\nThe final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April 14, 1996, a 4\u20131 victory over the [[Hartford Whalers]]. Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox died a month later, on May 22, 1996.\n\n=== The black and red era (1996\u20132006) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buffalo Sabres Logo 1996-2006.svg|thumb|In 1996 the Sabres' changed their logo as well as their color scheme to red and black. The logo was used until 2006.]] -->\n\nTed Nolan and the Sabres rebounded in [[1996\u201397 NHL season|1996\u201397]], their first at [[Marine Midland Arena]], by winning their first division title in 16 years, with Nolan winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as the NHL's top coach, Dominik Hasek winning both the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart]] and [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina]] Trophies (the first goaltender to do so since Montreal's [[Jacques Plante]] in 1962), [[Michael Peca]] taking home the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] as the best defensive forward in the NHL and general manager [[John Muckler]] honored as Executive of the Year.\n\nHowever, the regular season success was overshadowed by what had taken place during the playoffs. Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had been high for most of the season. After being scored upon in Game 3 of the first round against the [[Ottawa Senators]], Hasek left the game, forcing backup [[Steve Shields (hockey player)|Steve Shields]] to step in. Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' columnist [[Jim Kelley]] wrote a column that night for the next day's newspaper that detailed the day's events, which irked Hasek. After the Senators won Game 5, Hasek came out of the Sabres' training room and attacked Kelley, tearing his shirt. Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology, things went downhill after the incident. Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. But before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers, the NHL announced Hasek had been suspended for three games, with the Sabres informing the NHL Hasek was healthy (Hasek most likely would not have been suspended had he not been cleared to play). Set to return in Game 4 with the Sabres down by three games to none, Hasek told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre-game skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off elimination with a win in overtime. Again before Game 5, Hasek declared himself unfit to play and Buffalo lost 6\u20133 and the series.\n\nTeam president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]] fired general manager John Muckler, who had a noted feud with Nolan. Hasek, who supported Muckler, openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony he did not respect Nolan, placing new general manager [[Darcy Regier]] in a tough position. He offered Nolan just a one-year contract for a reported $500,000. Nolan refused on the grounds his previous contract was for two years. Regier then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one, ending Nolan's tenure as Sabres coach. Nolan was offered several jobs from the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and New York Islanders, which he turned down, and was out of the NHL until June 2006 when he was named coach of the Islanders. Former Sabres captain [[Lindy Ruff]] was hired as head coach on July 21, 1997, agreeing to a three-year contract. The Sabres organization, after having their most successful season in nearly two decades, had fired both the reigning NHL Executive of the Year (Muckler) and Coach of the Year (Nolan).\n\n==== New owners and return to the Finals ====\nDuring the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]], the Sabres, which had lost $32&nbsp;million over the previous three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December 1997,<ref>Knox Family to Sell Sabres, ''The Washington Post'', December 22, 1997</ref> were sold by Northrop Knox to [[John Rigas]], owner of [[Adelphia Communications]]. Shortly thereafter, Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John Rigas' son, Timothy Rigas. Behind Hasek, left-winger [[Miroslav \u0160atan|Miroslav Satan]] (who led the team in scoring), right-winger [[Donald Audette]], center Michael Peca and several role-playing journeymen including [[Matthew Barnaby]], the Sabres reached the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals]] that season, but lost to the [[Washington Capitals]] in six games.\n[[File:Full House at Buffalo's Former Marine Midland Arena for Buffalo Sabres Hockey, 1999.jpg|left|thumb|The Sabres playing a game during the [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]] season. The Sabres were later crowned the Eastern Conference champions following the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs]].]]\nIn [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], Miroslav Satan scored 40 goals. The Sabres would add centers [[Stu Barnes]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins and [[Jo\u00e9 Juneau|Joe Juneau]] from the Capitals. [[Michal Gro\u0161ek|Michal Grosek]] had the best season of his career, and the team finally returned to the [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], this time against the [[Presidents' Trophy]] winner, the [[Dallas Stars]]. In Game 6, Stars [[winger (sports)|winger]] [[Brett Hull]]'s triple-overtime goal ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player's skate entered the crease before the puck did. However, NHL officials maintained that Hull's two shots in the goal mouth constituted a single possession of the puck since the puck deflected off Hasek. The rule was changed for the following season, allowing players to be inside the goaltender's crease as long as they do not interfere with the goaltender.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|next year]] was a disappointing season. The team struggled in the regular season, due to injuries to Hasek as well as other tired and discouraged players. [[Doug Gilmour]] was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline and sparked the Sabres to a playoff berth. However, Gilmour was stricken by stomach flu during the post-season, and even the Hasek's return could not prevent a first-round playoff series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Like the previous season, there would be an officiating controversy. In Game 2, Flyers left wing [[John LeClair]] put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh. While replays appeared to show the puck entering through the \"side\" of the net, the goal was allowed to stand. The Flyers would win the game 2\u20131 and go on to win the series four games to one.\n\n[[Captain (hockey)|Captain]] Michael Peca sat out [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]] due to a contract dispute, and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June 2001 in exchange for [[Tim Connolly]] and [[Taylor Pyatt]]. Even so, the Sabres still defeated Philadelphia in six games in the first round of the playoffs (with a resounding 8\u20130 victory in the series-winning game). In the second round, they faced the underdog Pittsburgh Penguins, led by rejuvenated superstar [[Mario Lemieux]] and captain [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr|Jaromir Jagr]], who had won his fifth [[Art Ross Trophy]] that season, losing on a seventh-game overtime goal scored by defenseman [[Darius Kasparaitis]]. After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender, the Sabres traded Hasek to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the summer of 2001, bringing a five-year era of playoff success to a close. Without Hasek and Peca, the Sabres missed the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2002 playoffs]].\n\n==== Ownership turmoil and lockout ====\nIn May 2002, John Rigas and his sons were indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than $2&nbsp;billion from Adelphia. Rigas was later convicted and presently is appealing a sentence of 15 years in prison. The NHL took control of the team, though the Rigas family remained owners on paper. For a while, there were no interested buyers. After the two-year period of uncertainty, including rumors of relocating to another city or even straight out folding, the team was sold to a consortium led by [[Rochester, New York]], billionaire and former New York gubernatorial candidate [[Tom Golisano]] and former Sabres president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]], whose bid included no government funding. Golisano was introduced as team owner on March 19, 2003.\n\nWith the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]] having started under NHL control, general manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal moves. However, with the consultations of impending new ownership, the team began their rebuilding process around the March 2003 trade deadline by clearing out veteran players. The first to go was winger [[Rob Ray]], who was sent to the Ottawa Senators. The team then sent center and team captain Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars in exchange for young winger [[Michael Ryan (ice hockey)|Michael Ryan]] and a draft pick.\n\nA third deal sent center [[Chris Gratton]] to the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] with a draft pick for [[Daniel Bri\u00e8re|Daniel Briere]] and a draft pick, adding a player who would play a key role in the Sabres' resurgence in later years. The [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 season]] saw the team emerge from its financial struggles and, though the Sabres narrowly missed the playoffs, the development of prominent young players. Although the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] was canceled due to a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|labor]] dispute, the league and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) were able to agree on a new [[collective bargaining]] agreement in the summer of 2005, thus enabling NHL hockey to return for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n[[File:Lindyruff 2006nhlawards.jpg|thumb|[[Lindy Ruff]] was awarded the [[Jack Adams Award]] in 2006. He was the second Sabres coach to win the award.]]\nOn January 19, 2005, the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster, as the [[Empire Sports Network]] (which had been on the air since 1991) ceased operations in a cost-cutting move during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization. (Like the Sabres, Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL's seizure of the franchise.) Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts and for the 2005\u201306 campaign [[Madison Square Garden Network]] (MSG), a New York City-based channel which broadcasts [[New York Rangers]], New York Islanders and [[New Jersey Devils]] games, took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games to television viewers in [[western New York]], with the Sabres controlling all aspects of the broadcast. The agreement was later extended through 2017, then again through 2027.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 Buffalo Sabres season|2005\u201306]], the Sabres took off, finishing with their best record in over 20 years and clinching their first playoff berth since the 2000\u201301 season. The team finished the regular season with 52 wins, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also finished with 110 points, their first 100-point season in 23 years and tied the 1979\u201380 club for the second-best point total in franchise history. The Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and [[Carolina Hurricanes]] for the most wins in the Eastern Conference. They finished with the fifth-best record in the NHL, behind Detroit, Ottawa, Dallas and Carolina.\n\nBuffalo defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first-round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 playoffs]] in six games and top-seeded Ottawa in five games. The Sabres advanced to play Carolina in their first Eastern Conference Final since [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999]]. However, injuries began to mount. They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen ([[Teppo Numminen]], [[Dmitri Kalinin]], [[Jay McKee]] and [[Henrik Tallinder]]) and their top [[Power play (sporting term)|powerplay]] scorer (Tim Connolly) for much of the series. Despite this, the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina. The Sabres' impressive season was recognized on June 22, 2006, at the NHL Awards Ceremony when Lindy Ruff edged Hurricanes coach [[Peter Laviolette]] to win the Jack Adams Award as Coach of the Year in the closest vote in the award's history. Ruff was the second Sabres coach to win the award.\n\n=== Return to blue and gold (2006\u20132010) ===\n[[File:Thomas Vanek.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Vanek]] was re-signed in 2007 after the [[Edmonton Oilers]] offered him a seven-year offer sheet.]]\nThe Sabres started the [[2006\u201307 Buffalo Sabres season|2006\u201307 season]] 10\u20130, setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start a season, and becoming just the second team in NHL history (after the 1994 Toronto Maple Leafs) to open a season with a ten-game winning streak. They also set a new NHL record for consecutive road wins to start a season (eight), which was extended to ten games (tying the team record for consecutive road wins) with a 7\u20134 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on November 13, 2006. The team reached the 50-win plateau for the second time in franchise history. The Sabres won the presidents' Trophy for the first time in franchise history, giving them the home ice advantage for their entire run in the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007 playoffs]]. They also tied the [[1974\u201375 Buffalo Sabres season|1974\u201375 team]]'s franchise record for points in a season. The team defeated the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers to reach their second consecutive Eastern Conference Finals. However, on May 19, they were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators after five games.\n\nIn the April 9, 2007, issue of ''[[ESPN the Magazine]]'', the team ranked first of 122 major professional sports franchises in North America.

The Sabres nearly lost [[Thomas Vanek]] to the [[Edmonton Oilers]], which offered him a seven-year, $50&nbsp;million offer sheet, but the Sabres matched the offer on July 6. After these events, the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts during the regular season. Long-time Sabres broadcast color commentator [[Jim Lorentz]] announced his retirement during the pre-season.

The team was established in [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970]], along with the [[Vancouver Canucks]], when the league expanded to 14 teams. They have played at [[KeyBank Center]] since [[1996\u201397 Buffalo Sabres season|1996]]. Prior to that, the Buffalo Sabres played at the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] from the start of the franchise in 1970. The Sabres are owned by [[Terrence Pegula|Terry Pegula]], who purchased the club in 2011 from Tom Golisano.

Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] variety store chain; along with [[Robert O. Swados]], a Buffalo attorney. On the team's inaugural board of directors were [[Robert E. Rich, Jr.]], later the owner of the [[Buffalo Bisons]] minor league baseball team; and [[George W. Strawbridge, Jr.]], an heir to the [[Campbell Soup Company]] fortune. Buffalo had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres' establishment, the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] were a pillar of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Bisons hockey team]] played from 1928 to 1936), winning the [[Calder Cup]] in their final season.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Early Years|url=http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|work=The 40th Anniversary site of the Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=April 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307143201/http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|archivedate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWanting a name other than \"[[bison]]\" (a generic stock name used by Buffalo sports teams for decades), the Knoxes commissioned a name-the-team contest.

Their first attempt was thwarted when [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner [[Art Rooney]] persuaded his [[horse racing]] friends [[James D. Norris|James]] and [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]] to select [[Pittsburgh]] over Buffalo,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/9GS4yb89OsI</ref> while the second attempt was due to the NHL not wanting an expansion market to give up on a team so soon. At the time of their creation, the Sabres exercised their option to create their own AHL [[farm team]], the [[Cincinnati Swords]]. Former [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] general manager and head coach [[Punch Imlach]] was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres.\n\nThe year the Sabres debuted (1970) was an important year for major league sports in Buffalo. In addition to the Sabres' debut, the [[Buffalo Bills]] [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|officially joined]] the [[National Football League]], and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Buffalo Braves]] also began to play, sharing Memorial Auditorium with the Sabres. The city of Buffalo went from having no teams in the established [[major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] to three in one off-season, a situation that proved to be unsustainable. Between the Braves and the Sabres, the Sabres would prove to be by far the more successful of the two; [[Paul Snyder (basketball)|Paul Snyder]], the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' Braves owner, publicly feuded with the [[old money]] Knoxes and the local [[college basketball]] scene, eventually losing those feuds and being forced to sell his team in 1976. Subsequent owners of the Braves, in a series of convoluted transactions tied to the [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]], moved the team out of Buffalo.\n\nWhen the Sabres debuted as an expansion team, they took the ice to [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s Armenian war dance, \"[[Sabre Dance]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artvoice.com/2017/11/01/hockey-sin-city-andrew-kulyk-peter-farrell/#.Ws-U_YjwZuU|title=Hockey in Sin City|work=[[Artvoice]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=November 1, 2017|author=Kulyk, Andrew and Peter Farrell}}</ref> The song has been associated with the team as an unofficial anthem ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://as.com/videos/2016/07/06/en/1467824254_902709.html|title=All about new Manchester United signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=July 6, 2016|work=[[Diario AS]]}}</ref> It is often played between periods and after goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/2222/20120620/teemu-sel-nne-keeps-nhl-94-roster.htm|title=Teemu Sel\u00e4nne Keeps NHL '94 Roster Alive|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=June 20, 2012|work=[[GameNGuide]]|author=Caulfield, Luke}}</ref>\n\nThe consensus was that first pick in the [[1970 NHL Amateur Draft]] would be [[junior hockey|junior]] phenomenon [[Gilbert Perreault]]. Either the Sabres or the Canucks would get the first pick, to be determined with the spin of a [[roulette wheel]]. Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the first year the [[Montreal Canadiens]] did not have a priority right to draft [[Quebec]]-born junior players.\n\nThe Canucks were allocated numbers 1\u201310 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11\u201320. When league president [[Clarence Campbell]] spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on one. While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation, Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11, effectively handing Perreault to the Sabres.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |authorlink= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref> Perreault scored 38 goals in his rookie season of [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970\u201371]], at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL rookie, and he received the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's rookie of the year. Despite Perreault's play, the Sabres finished well out of playoff contention.\n[[File:French connection statue.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of the [[The French Connection (ice hockey)|French Connection]] [[line (ice hockey)|line]] stands outside [[KeyBank Center]]. Consisting of [[Gilbert Perreault]], [[Rick Martin]], and [[Rene Robert]], they played together from 1972 to 1979.]]\nIn the team's second season, [[1971\u201372 NHL season|1971\u201372]], rookie [[Rick Martin]], drafted fifth overall by Buffalo in [[1971 NHL Amateur Draft|1971]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Robert|Rene Robert]], acquired in a late-season trade from the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], joined Perreault and would become one of the league's top forward lines in the 1970s. Martin broke Perreault's record at once with 44 [[rookie]] goals. They were nicknamed \"[[The French Connection (hockey)|The French Connection]]\" after [[The French Connection (film)|the movie of the same name]] and in homage to their [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] roots. The Sabres made the playoffs for the first time in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972\u201373]], just the team's third year in the league, but lost in the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual [[Stanley Cup]] champion Montreal Canadiens.\n\nAfter a subpar year in [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1974]] that saw them miss the playoffs (as well as aging defenseman [[Tim Horton]]'s death in a [[driving under the influence|DUI]]-induced car accident), the Sabres tied for the best record in the NHL in the [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1974\u201375]] regular season. Buffalo advanced to the [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time in team history to play against the rough [[Philadelphia Flyers]] (who had been recently nicknamed the \"[[Philadelphia Flyers#1972\u20131978: The Broad Street Bullies|Broad Street Bullies]]\"), a series which included the legendary Fog Game (Game 3 of the series). Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 and the lack of air conditioning in the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]], parts of the game were played in heavy fog that made players, officials, and the puck invisible to many spectators. During a face-off and through the fog, Sabres center [[Jim Lorentz]] spotted a [[bat]] flying across the rink, swung at it with his stick, killing it. It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game. The Sabres won that game thanks to Rene Robert's goal in overtime. However, Philadelphia would wind up taking the Stanley Cup in six games, winning the series 4\u20132.\n\nThe French Connection, joined by 50\u2013goal scorer [[Danny Gare]], continued to score prolifically for the Sabres in [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975\u201376]], but the team lost in the quarterfinals to the [[New York Islanders]]. The Sabres had success through the late 1970s behind Gare and the French Connection (Perreault, Martin and Robert), but they were unable to return to the Finals despite a [[Prince of Wales Trophy|Wales Conference championship]] in [[1979\u201380 NHL season|1980]] and being the first team to beat the Soviet Olympic Team when they toured the United States. The French Connection era ended with Robert's trade to the [[Colorado Rockies (ice hockey)|Colorado Rockies]] in 1979 and Martin's trade to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in 1981, by which time Martin's career was essentially finished as the result of a devastating knee injury in 1980.\n\n=== Adams/Northeast Division rivalries (1981\u20131996) ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nIn [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1981\u201382]], the NHL realigned its conferences and adopted an intra-divisional playoff format for the first two rounds. It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity, and then face the near-certainty of having to get past either the [[Boston Bruins]] or Canadiens to make it to the conference finals. Aside from first-round victories over Montreal in 1982\u201383 and Boston in 1992\u201393, the era saw the Sabres lose to division rivals Boston, the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and Montreal in the Adams Division semi-finals (first round) a combined eight times, and miss the playoffs altogether in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387\u2014only third and fourth times out of the playoffs in franchise history. Perrault reached the 500-goal mark in the 1985\u201386 season and retired after playing 20 games in 1986\u201387, 17 years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick.\n\nThe Sabres drafted [[Pierre Turgeon]] with the first pick in the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]], and he quickly made an impact with the team. During his rookie season in 1987\u201388, he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in three years. He was joined in 1989 by [[Alexander Mogilny]], who with the help of Sabres officials became the first Soviet player to defect to the NHL, and cleared the way for all other Russian players to follow. In the 1989\u201390 season, the Sabres would improve to finish with 98 points\u2014third-best in the NHL\u2014but the playoff futility continued with a first-round loss to Montreal. The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in 1991 as part of a blockbuster seven-player trade that brought [[Pat LaFontaine]] to Buffalo.\n\nIn 1992\u201393, goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]] joined the team in a trade from the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. In the [[1993 Stanley Cup playoffs|1993 playoffs]], the Sabres upset the Bruins in a four-game sweep in the Adams Division semi-finals, their first playoff series victory in ten years. [[Brad May]]'s series-winning goal in overtime of Game 4 in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret's \"May Day!\" call. However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the Sabres in the division final, with the Sabres losing all four games by a 4\u20133 score (the last three games in overtime).\n\nWith the NHL adopting a conference playoff format for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], the Sabres faced the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the Eastern Conference playoffs' first round. Despite Hasek winning a 1\u20130 (quadruple overtime) goaltending duel with the Devils' [[Martin Brodeur]] in Game 6\u2014the Sabres' longest game ever, which went into quadruple overtime\u2014Buffalo would lose the series in seven games. Another first-round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout-shortened [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1994\u201395 season]] was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Northeast Division in 1995\u201396, as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. It was the first season under head coach [[Ted Nolan]] and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Nolan brought an exciting brand of hockey to Buffalo. During his coaching tenure, Buffalo was referred to as the \"hardest-working team in hockey\".<ref name=BuffNews>{{Cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Budd |title=Ruff front-runner to coach Sabres |journal=The Buffalo News |date=July 18, 1997 |page=1B |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> This season also featured the debut of \"walk-on\" veteran [[Randy Burridge]], who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training camp on a try-out basis. He scored 25 goals that season and was second in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine. Burridge also earned the Tim Horton Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team [[Most Valuable Player]].\n\nThe final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April 14, 1996, a 4\u20131 victory over the [[Hartford Whalers]]. Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox died a month later, on May 22, 1996.\n\n=== The black and red era (1996\u20132006) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buffalo Sabres Logo 1996-2006.svg|thumb|In 1996 the Sabres' changed their logo as well as their color scheme to red and black. The logo was used until 2006.]] -->\n\nTed Nolan and the Sabres rebounded in [[1996\u201397 NHL season|1996\u201397]], their first at [[Marine Midland Arena]], by winning their first division title in 16 years, with Nolan winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as the NHL's top coach, Dominik Hasek winning both the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart]] and [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina]] Trophies (the first goaltender to do so since Montreal's [[Jacques Plante]] in 1962), [[Michael Peca]] taking home the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] as the best defensive forward in the NHL and general manager [[John Muckler]] honored as Executive of the Year.\n\nHowever, the regular season success was overshadowed by what had taken place during the playoffs. Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had been high for most of the season. After being scored upon in Game 3 of the first round against the [[Ottawa Senators]], Hasek left the game, forcing backup [[Steve Shields (hockey player)|Steve Shields]] to step in. Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' columnist [[Jim Kelley]] wrote a column that night for the next day's newspaper that detailed the day's events, which irked Hasek. After the Senators won Game 5, Hasek came out of the Sabres' training room and attacked Kelley, tearing his shirt. Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology, things went downhill after the incident. Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. But before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers, the NHL announced Hasek had been suspended for three games, with the Sabres informing the NHL Hasek was healthy (Hasek most likely would not have been suspended had he not been cleared to play). Set to return in Game 4 with the Sabres down by three games to none, Hasek told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre-game skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off elimination with a win in overtime. Again before Game 5, Hasek declared himself unfit to play and Buffalo lost 6\u20133 and the series.\n\nTeam president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]] fired general manager John Muckler, who had a noted feud with Nolan. Hasek, who supported Muckler, openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony he did not respect Nolan, placing new general manager [[Darcy Regier]] in a tough position. He offered Nolan just a one-year contract for a reported $500,000. Nolan refused on the grounds his previous contract was for two years. Regier then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one, ending Nolan's tenure as Sabres coach. Nolan was offered several jobs from the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and New York Islanders, which he turned down, and was out of the NHL until June 2006 when he was named coach of the Islanders. Former Sabres captain [[Lindy Ruff]] was hired as head coach on July 21, 1997, agreeing to a three-year contract. The Sabres organization, after having their most successful season in nearly two decades, had fired both the reigning NHL Executive of the Year (Muckler) and Coach of the Year (Nolan).\n\n==== New owners and return to the Finals ====\nDuring the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]], the Sabres, which had lost $32&nbsp;million over the previous three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December 1997,<ref>Knox Family to Sell Sabres, ''The Washington Post'', December 22, 1997</ref> were sold by Northrop Knox to [[John Rigas]], owner of [[Adelphia Communications]]. Shortly thereafter, Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John Rigas' son, Timothy Rigas. Behind Hasek, left-winger [[Miroslav \u0160atan|Miroslav Satan]] (who led the team in scoring), right-winger [[Donald Audette]], center Michael Peca and several role-playing journeymen including [[Matthew Barnaby]], the Sabres reached the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals]] that season, but lost to the [[Washington Capitals]] in six games.\n[[File:Full House at Buffalo's Former Marine Midland Arena for Buffalo Sabres Hockey, 1999.jpg|left|thumb|The Sabres playing a game during the [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]] season. The Sabres were later crowned the Eastern Conference champions following the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs]].]]\nIn [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], Miroslav Satan scored 40 goals. The Sabres would add centers [[Stu Barnes]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins and [[Jo\u00e9 Juneau|Joe Juneau]] from the Capitals. [[Michal Gro\u0161ek|Michal Grosek]] had the best season of his career, and the team finally returned to the [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], this time against the [[Presidents' Trophy]] winner, the [[Dallas Stars]]. In Game 6, Stars [[winger (sports)|winger]] [[Brett Hull]]'s triple-overtime goal ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player's skate entered the crease before the puck did. However, NHL officials maintained that Hull's two shots in the goal mouth constituted a single possession of the puck since the puck deflected off Hasek. The rule was changed for the following season, allowing players to be inside the goaltender's crease as long as they do not interfere with the goaltender.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|next year]] was a disappointing season. The team struggled in the regular season, due to injuries to Hasek as well as other tired and discouraged players. [[Doug Gilmour]] was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline and sparked the Sabres to a playoff berth. However, Gilmour was stricken by stomach flu during the post-season, and even the Hasek's return could not prevent a first-round playoff series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Like the previous season, there would be an officiating controversy. In Game 2, Flyers left wing [[John LeClair]] put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh. While replays appeared to show the puck entering through the \"side\" of the net, the goal was allowed to stand. The Flyers would win the game 2\u20131 and go on to win the series four games to one.\n\n[[Captain (hockey)|Captain]] Michael Peca sat out [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]] due to a contract dispute, and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June 2001 in exchange for [[Tim Connolly]] and [[Taylor Pyatt]]. Even so, the Sabres still defeated Philadelphia in six games in the first round of the playoffs (with a resounding 8\u20130 victory in the series-winning game). In the second round, they faced the underdog Pittsburgh Penguins, led by rejuvenated superstar [[Mario Lemieux]] and captain [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr|Jaromir Jagr]], who had won his fifth [[Art Ross Trophy]] that season, losing on a seventh-game overtime goal scored by defenseman [[Darius Kasparaitis]]. After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender, the Sabres traded Hasek to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the summer of 2001, bringing a five-year era of playoff success to a close. Without Hasek and Peca, the Sabres missed the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2002 playoffs]].\n\n==== Ownership turmoil and lockout ====\nIn May 2002, John Rigas and his sons were indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than $2&nbsp;billion from Adelphia. Rigas was later convicted and presently is appealing a sentence of 15 years in prison. The NHL took control of the team, though the Rigas family remained owners on paper. For a while, there were no interested buyers. After the two-year period of uncertainty, including rumors of relocating to another city or even straight out folding, the team was sold to a consortium led by [[Rochester, New York]], billionaire and former New York gubernatorial candidate [[Tom Golisano]] and former Sabres president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]], whose bid included no government funding. Golisano was introduced as team owner on March 19, 2003.\n\nWith the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]] having started under NHL control, general manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal moves. However, with the consultations of impending new ownership, the team began their rebuilding process around the March 2003 trade deadline by clearing out veteran players. The first to go was winger [[Rob Ray]], who was sent to the Ottawa Senators. The team then sent center and team captain Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars in exchange for young winger [[Michael Ryan (ice hockey)|Michael Ryan]] and a draft pick.\n\nA third deal sent center [[Chris Gratton]] to the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] with a draft pick for [[Daniel Bri\u00e8re|Daniel Briere]] and a draft pick, adding a player who would play a key role in the Sabres' resurgence in later years. The [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 season]] saw the team emerge from its financial struggles and, though the Sabres narrowly missed the playoffs, the development of prominent young players. Although the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] was canceled due to a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|labor]] dispute, the league and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) were able to agree on a new [[collective bargaining]] agreement in the summer of 2005, thus enabling NHL hockey to return for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n[[File:Lindyruff 2006nhlawards.jpg|thumb|[[Lindy Ruff]] was awarded the [[Jack Adams Award]] in 2006. He was the second Sabres coach to win the award.]]\nOn January 19, 2005, the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster, as the [[Empire Sports Network]] (which had been on the air since 1991) ceased operations in a cost-cutting move during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization. (Like the Sabres, Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL's seizure of the franchise.) Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts and for the 2005\u201306 campaign [[Madison Square Garden Network]] (MSG), a New York City-based channel which broadcasts [[New York Rangers]], New York Islanders and [[New Jersey Devils]] games, took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games to television viewers in [[western New York]], with the Sabres controlling all aspects of the broadcast. The agreement was later extended through 2017, then again through 2027.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 Buffalo Sabres season|2005\u201306]], the Sabres took off, finishing with their best record in over 20 years and clinching their first playoff berth since the 2000\u201301 season. The team finished the regular season with 52 wins, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also finished with 110 points, their first 100-point season in 23 years and tied the 1979\u201380 club for the second-best point total in franchise history. The Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and [[Carolina Hurricanes]] for the most wins in the Eastern Conference. They finished with the fifth-best record in the NHL, behind Detroit, Ottawa, Dallas and Carolina.\n\nBuffalo defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first-round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 playoffs]] in six games and top-seeded Ottawa in five games. The Sabres advanced to play Carolina in their first Eastern Conference Final since [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999]]. However, injuries began to mount. They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen ([[Teppo Numminen]], [[Dmitri Kalinin]], [[Jay McKee]] and [[Henrik Tallinder]]) and their top [[Power play (sporting term)|powerplay]] scorer (Tim Connolly) for much of the series. Despite this, the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina. The Sabres' impressive season was recognized on June 22, 2006, at the NHL Awards Ceremony when Lindy Ruff edged Hurricanes coach [[Peter Laviolette]] to win the Jack Adams Award as Coach of the Year in the closest vote in the award's history. Ruff was the second Sabres coach to win the award.\n\n=== Return to blue and gold (2006\u20132010) ===\n[[File:Thomas Vanek.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Vanek]] was re-signed in 2007 after the [[Edmonton Oilers]] offered him a seven-year offer sheet.]]\nThe Sabres started the [[2006\u201307 Buffalo Sabres season|2006\u201307 season]] 10\u20130, setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start a season, and becoming just the second team in NHL history (after the 1994 Toronto Maple Leafs) to open a season with a ten-game winning streak. They also set a new NHL record for consecutive road wins to start a season (eight), which was extended to ten games (tying the team record for consecutive road wins) with a 7\u20134 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on November 13, 2006. The team reached the 50-win plateau for the second time in franchise history. The Sabres won the presidents' Trophy for the first time in franchise history, giving them the home ice advantage for their entire run in the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007 playoffs]]. They also tied the [[1974\u201375 Buffalo Sabres season|1974\u201375 team]]'s franchise record for points in a season. The team defeated the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers to reach their second consecutive Eastern Conference Finals. However, on May 19, they were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators after five games.\n\nIn the April 9, 2007, issue of ''[[ESPN the Magazine]]'', the team ranked first of 122 major professional sports franchises in North America. The Sabres were cited for their player accessibility, low ticket prices and exciting brand of hockey.<ref name=ESPNmag>{{Cite journal |last=Keating |first=Peter |title=Ultimate Standings: Buffalo Sabres Are No. 1! |journal=ESPN the Magazine |date=March 28, 2007 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=ultimatestandings07No1team}}</ref>\n\nThe Sabres lost both co-captains, Daniel Briere (who went to the Philadelphia Flyers) and [[Chris Drury]] (who went to the New York Rangers) during the free agency period. The Sabres nearly lost [[Thomas Vanek]] to the [[Edmonton Oilers]], which offered him a seven-year, $50&nbsp;million offer sheet, but the Sabres matched the offer on July 6. After these events, the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts during the regular season. Long-time Sabres broadcast color commentator [[Jim Lorentz]] announced his retirement during the pre-season. ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'''s [[Harry Neale]] took over the position in October 2007.\n\n==== Post-Briere\u2013Drury era ====\n[[File:NHL Winter Classic 2008.jpg|thumb|In 2008 the Sabres hosted the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in the inaugural [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]].]]\nDuring the [[2007\u201308 Buffalo Sabres season|2007\u201308 season]], the Sabres hosted a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 1, 2008, which was played outdoors at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], home of the National Football League's Buffalo Bills.<ref name=nhl>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/winterclassic/index.html |title=2008 Winter Classic |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514180538/http://www.nhl.com/winterclassic/index.html |archivedate=May 14, 2008  }}</ref> Officially, the game was called the [[AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic]], known colloquially as the \"Ice Bowl\" due to it taking place at the same time as [[college football]] [[bowl game]]s.

The Sabres failed to qualify for the [[2008 Stanley Cup playoffs|2008 playoffs]] and became only the third team in NHL history to go from finishing first overall in the regular season standings to finishing out of the playoffs the following year.\n\nOn June 10, the Sabres officially announced their new AHL affiliate, beginning in the [[2008\u201309 AHL season|2008\u201309 season]], would be the [[Portland Pirates]] from [[Portland, Maine]].

Three days later, the Sabres acquired [[Craig Rivet]] from the [[San Jose Sharks]] in exchange for a second round draft pick in each of the next two drafts. The Sabres also extended the contracts of three players: [[Paul Gaustad]] (four years), [[Ryan Miller]] (five years) and [[Jason Pominville]] (five years). Miller was slated to become an unrestricted free agent following the upcoming season while Pominville was set to become a restricted free agent.\n\nOn October 8, the Sabres named defenseman [[Craig Rivet]] team captain, the first single full-time captain since [[Stu Barnes]]' term from 2001 to 2003. The team was also active at the trade deadline. First, they signed Tim Connolly to a two-year, $4.2&nbsp;million extension, then acquired [[Mikael Tellqvist]] from the Phoenix Coyotes for a fourth round pick in the [[2010 NHL Entry Draft|2010 draft]]. [[Dominic Moore]] came from the Toronto Maple Leafs for a second-round pick in the [[2009 NHL Entry Draft|2009 draft]], then Buffalo received a second-round pick in the 2009 draft from the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for [[Ale\u0161 Kotal\u00edk|Ales Kotalik]].

The single parent of his clone, [[original trilogy]] character [[Boba Fett]], he made his debut in the 2002 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'', where he was portrayed by actor [[Temuera Morrison]].\n\nJango Fett was regarded as the best [[mercenary]] in the galaxy during the final years of the Republic. A naturally skilled warrior, he was eventually chosen to serve as the genetic template for the [[Clone trooper|Clone Army]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. These clone soldiers were genetically modified to age at twice the rate of a normal human, and be predisposed toward unquestioning obedience to the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], unlike their independent [[wikt:progenitor|progenitor]].\n{{toclimit|4}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Concept and creation===\nIn early drafts of ''Attack of the Clones'', Fett's first name was \"J'mee\".<ref name=\"Fett, Jango\"/> His name is a reference to the 1966 Corbucci film ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'', featuring a hyper-violent drifter played by [[Franco Nero]].\n\nJango is covered in a sleek armored suit that conceals his scarred face, largely based on Boba Fett's iconic outfit from the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original trilogy]], designed by Joe Johnston. However, Jango's suit is distinguished by color differences (it is primarily silver, blue and black), thigh shin and spat armor, and a comparative lack of accessories and trophies.<ref name=\"Fett, Jango\"/>\n\n===Portrayal===\nJango Fett was portrayed by [[Temuera Morrison]] in ''Attack of the Clones'', ''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'', ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' (the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version) and ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game]]'', Bob Marshall in a commercial (but the voice was provided by an unknown actor) ILM filmed for ''Star Wars: Bounty Hunter'', [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter]]'', and Andrew Chaikin in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Film and television===\n====''Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones''====\n[[File:Star Wars and the Power of Costume July 2018 29 (Jango Fett's costume, helmet, and jetpack from Episode II).jpg|thumb|Jango Fett's costume, helmet, and jetpack from ''Episode II'']]\n\nIn ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'', Jango is depicted as a bounty hunter who had been hired to be the genetic template for the Grand Army of the Republic, becoming entangled in a shady plot by [[Count Dooku|Darth Tyranus]]. Jango is later hired by Viceroy [[Nute Gunray]] of the Trade Federation to assassinate Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] in retaliation for her actions in [[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|the first prequel]].

The story begins shortly after the events of ''[[Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', with long flashbacks to earlier periods.\n\nTwenty-six years before the events of ''The Phantom Menace'', the Mandalorians split into two factions: the barbaric Death Watch, led by Tor Vizsla, and the True Mandalorians, honorable mercenaries led by [[Boba Fett#Jaster Mereel|Jaster Mereel]]. The two factions battle on Jango's home world of [[Concord Dawn (Star Wars)|Concord Dawn]]. Jango's family helps Jaster, inciting Vizsla and his men to kill Jango's relatives. The horrified Jango helps Jaster and his men escape and ambush Death Watch. Jaster welcomes Jango into his faction.\n\nYears later, Jango has become a full-fledged Mandalorian warrior under Jaster's tutelage. The Mandalorians are ambushed by Death Watch, and Jaster is killed by Vizsla. Wearing Jaster's armor, Jango becomes the leader of the True Mandalorians. A Jedi strike force led by [[Count Dooku]] slays Jango's warriors, and Jango is sold into slavery to the planet's governor.

In February 1969, Polak was arrested for a second time for distributing obscene materials and operating a [[peep show]] at one of his adult bookstores. In April 1969, Polak was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison which was reduced to two months.

In February 1969, Polak was arrested for a second time for distributing obscene materials and operating a [[peep show]] at one of his adult bookstores. In April 1969, Polak was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison which was reduced to two months.

They are believed to date from the 1st century AD or the beginning of the 2nd century.<ref>Kloss (2003); Kenney (1963).</ref> A traditional theory about their origin is that they are an anthology of poems written by various authors on the same subject. However, it has recently been argued that the 80 poems are in fact the work of a single author, presenting a kind of biography of Priapus from his vigorous youth to his impotence in old age.<ref>See Holzberg (2005) for a review of the literature.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nNot counting the last few poems, which seem not to be part of the original collection, the Priapeia consists of 80 [[epigrams]] (average length 6 to 8 lines) mainly written in either [[hendecasyllable]]s or [[elegiac couplet]]s, with a few also in [[choliamb|scazons]]. Many of the epigrams are written as though they were to be engraved on the walls of a shrine<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 468; cf. ''Priap.'' 2.10 ''templ\u012b parietibus''.</ref> containing a statue of the god [[Priapus]] that stood in the midst of gardens as the protector of the fruits that grew in them. These statues, usually carved from wood,<ref>But sometimes of marble: Virgil ''Eclogues'' 7.35; Martial 6.72.</ref> were in the form of a man with a huge phallus, carrying a sickle in one hand. The statues, painted red to signify sexual prowess, also promoted the gardens\u2019 fertility.\n\nMost<ref>Holzberg (2005) p. 370, note 14.</ref> of the poems in the collection are [[monologues]] by Priapus himself. In them the god congratulates and praises himself for the size and virility of his sexual parts and issues fearful warnings to those who would trespass upon his garden or attempt to steal its fruits, threatening such miscreants with various punishments of a sexual nature, such as [[irrumation]] and [[sodomy]]. The poems are notable for their use of obscene words and ideas in combination with refined and elegant diction.<ref>See Young (2015).</ref>\n\nIn the past one theory was that the ''Priapeia'' were the work of a group of poets who met at the house of [[Maecenas]], amusing themselves by writing tongue-in-cheek tributes to the garden Priapus.<ref>Elomaa (2015), pp. 9-10.</ref>  (Maecenas was [[Horace]]\u2019s patron.) Others, including [[Martial]] and [[Petronius]], were thought to have added more verses in imitation of the originals. However, since a study by the German scholar [[:de:Vinzenz Buchheit|Vinzenz Buchheit]] in 1962, the theory has gained ground that they are the work of a single poet illustrating Priapus's decline from a vigorous youth to an impotent old age.<ref>Kenney (1963); Holzberg (2005).</ref> The first two poems are a dedication by the author and the last one is a prayer to Priapus to increase the sexual prowess of the poet himself.<ref>Holzberg (2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1890, the ''Priapeia'' were translated into English by [[Leonard Smithers]] and [[Sir Richard Burton]]<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/ The Priapeia Index - Sacred Texts]</ref> (the latter of whom also freely translated ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]''), who provided numerous glosses concerning the sexual practices and proclivities that are referenced in the poems.  These explanatory notes address such diverse topics as [[oral sex]] ([[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]]), [[irrumation]], [[masturbation]], [[bestiality]], sexual positions, eunuchism, [[phalli]], [[religious prostitution]], [[aphrodisiacs]], [[pornography]], and sexual terminology, but are not always accurate scholarly reflections of ancient Roman practices.  A more recent translation titled ''The'' ''Priapus Poems'' has been carried out by Richard W. Hooper.<ref>Hooper (1999).</ref>\n\nIn the \"Introduction\" to the ''Priapeia'', the Smithers and Burton claim that \"The worship of Priapus amongst the Romans was derived from the [[Egypt]]ians, who, under the form of [[Apis (god)|Apis]], the Sacred Bull, adored the generative Power of Nature,\" adding that \"the Phallus was the ancient emblem of creation, and representative of the gods [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], Priapus, [[Hermaphroditus]], [[Hercules]], [[Shiva]], [[Osiris]], [[Baal]] and [[Asher]], who were all Phallic [[deities]].\"\n\n==Authorship==\nAlthough even today some scholars<ref>cf. Uden (2007), p. 8.</ref> hold that the Carmina Priapea are anthology of poems by different authors, others<ref>Buchheit (1962), Kenney (1963), Kloss (2003), Holzberg (2005).</ref> support the arguments for the single authorship of all 80 poems.\n\nAmong these arguments are the following. First, the poems seem to have been carefully arranged according to metre. Only three metres are used. There appear to be 5 groups of 14 poems each. The first fourteen poems alternate between elegiac couplets and hendecasyllables. In the second to fifth groups the alternation is not so regular, but each group contains exactly 7 poems in hendecasyllables and 7 poems in either elegiac couplets or [[choliamb|scazons]]. The scazon poems are arranged two in the 3rd group, two in the 4th, and two in the 5th. The last ten poems consist of a coda of 4 poems in elegiac couplets, 3 in hendecasyllables, 2 in scazons, and 1 poem in elegiac couplets.<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 472.</ref> Kloss argues that if the poems were a miscellaneous anthology, they would presumably have contained poems in other metres too, such as the iambic (84 and 87), aeolic (85, 89) or hexameter (95) metres used in the \"extra\" poems in Smithers and Burton's edition.<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 470-71.</ref>\n\nFurther, in the second dedicatory poem, the poet announces that he has written (not collected together) the poems:<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 467-8.</ref> \"Playfully, without taking too much trouble, I have written these poems, which as you can witness, Priapus, are more suitable for a garden than for a book of poems\":\n\n:''l\u016bd\u0113ns haec ego teste t\u0113, Pri\u0101pe,<br />hort\u014d carmina digna, n\u014dn libell\u014d,<br />scr\u012bps\u012b n\u014dn nimium lab\u014dri\u014ds\u0113''\n\nA third argument is based on the observation that pairs of consecutive or near-consecutive poems are often linked by the repetition of a word.<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 474-6.</ref> For example, the rare word ''erucarum'' ([[Eruca vesicaria|rocket]]) in 46.8 is repeated in ''erucis'' in 47.6; ''Maurae ... puellae'' in 45.3 is echoed by ''puella Mauro'' in 46.1; ''virgineum locum'' in 2.5 reappears as ''virgo ... loci'' in 3.7, and so on. There are also possibly wider links between the poems. For example, Laure Sandoz sees a connection between the words ''membr\u014dsior'' in 1.5, ''mentul\u0101tior'' in 36.11, and ''sarcin\u014dsior'' (or in some texts ''fascin\u014dsior'') in 79.4, all meaning \"endowed with a larger penis\", at the beginning, middle, and end of the collection, with the last two words both in the last line of a scazon poem.<ref>Sandoz (2011), p. 96.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the poet also clearly aims at variety. For example, in the first group of 14 poems, the god's oversized phallus is referred to in a number of different ways (''mentula'', ''part\u012b'', ''inguen'', ''t\u0113lum'', ''columna'' and so on).<ref>Holzberg (2005), p. 373.</ref>\n\nAnother argument concerns the subject matter of the poems themselves, which like the collections of love poetry of the poets of the time of [[Augustus]], show the course of an affair from its beginning to its end.<ref>Holzberg (2005).</ref> In the first group of fourteen poems, Priapus is shown as boastful and vigorous, but gradually problems set in. In poem 26 he confesses that he is worn out by sex (''effut\u016btus'') and thin and pale (''macerque pallidusque'') and complains that the neighbouring women give him no rest. In poem 33, on the other hand, he complains that he is compelled to relieve himself with his own hand for want of female companions among the nymphs. Towards the end of the book the problems multiply. In poem 56 he is mocked by a thief and shown the middle finger (''impud\u012bcum digitum'') because his phallus is only made of wood, and he is reduced to calling on his master to perform the punishment. In poem 70 he has become so impotent that he has to endure the humiliation of a dog performing ''fellatio'' on him all night. In poem 76 we learn that Priapus is now old and grey-haired and only good for penetrating old men. In 77 he complains that because of a hedge round the garden he is no longer getting any sex. Finally, in 79, an anonymous speaker informs Priapus that he is no better endowed than \"our poet\" \u2013 who, it appears from the final poem, has an unusually small penis.\n\n==Date==\nThe date of the ''Carmina Priapea'' is still disputed, though is generally assumed to be in the 1st century AD. One piece of evidence for the date of the collection is the phrase ''inepta loc\u012b'' (\"foolish ... of the place\") which occurs in poem 3.8 in connection with a girl who offers her backside to her husband on her wedding night instead of the usual place. The same phrase, in a similar context, is quoted in [[Seneca the Elder]] (''Contr.'' 1.2.22), where it is called ''Ovidi\u0101num illud'' (\"that Ovidian phrase\").<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 465.</ref> Some scholars have assumed therefore that poem 3 of the collection at least was composed by [[Ovid]].<ref>Uden (2007), p. 8.</ref> However, the German scholar [[:de:Gerrit Kloss|Gerrit Kloss]] argues that this is not necessarily so. It could be that ''inepta loc\u012b'' simply imitates a lost poem of Ovid, rather than being the first instance of its use. The same poem contains a number of other literary echoes of phrases used by Ovid, Virgil, and Horace.<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 466, note 11.</ref>\n\nAnother piece of evidence is that certain words in the poems, such as ''circitor'' (\"watchman\"), ''rubricatus'' (\"painted red\"), ''pr\u016br\u012bgo'' (\"sexual desire\") and so on, are not used until writers of the time of [[Nero]] or later. Assuming that all the poems are by a single author, then the whole collection can be dated to the time of Nero or later.<ref>Kloss (2003).</ref>\n\nA number of arguments from prosody have also been put forward by H. Tr\u00e4nkle (1998) in an attempt to date the poems.<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 481-2.</ref> For example, it has been argued that the long ''-\u014d'' in [[spondee|spondaic]] words like ''virg\u014d'' and ''erg\u014d'' (in 11 out of 13 cases in the ''Carmina Priapea'') is closer to Ovid's practice than that of [[Martial]], where the ''-o'' is usually short. However, Kloss points out that this argument is weak, since other writers later than Ovid, such as [[Petronius]] and [[Silius Italicus]] also preferred the long ''-\u014d''.\n\nBuchheit (1962) found sufficient echoes of [[Martial]] to argue that the poems must date from after Martial's time.<ref>Kenney (1963), p. 72.</ref> Kloss (2003) is less certain, but thinks that the poems date at the earliest to Nero's time, but more probably to a period after Martial.<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 485.</ref>\n\n==Other Priapic poems==\nThe 80 poems of the ''Carmina Priapea'' are by no means the only poems which survive from the ancient world in honour of Priapus. Kytzler's edition contains 37 poems in Greek excerpted from the [[Greek anthology]] dating from the 3rd century BC to the 6th century AD.<ref>Parker (1988); cf. Uden (2007), p. 4, note 9.</ref> \n\nIn Latin, outside the ''Corpus Priapeorum'' there are about 23 ''Priapea'' of various types, some of which are added as poems 83\u201395 in Smithers and Burton's edition of the ''Priapeia''.\n\nThe earliest extant Priapic poem in Latin (no. 89 in Smithers and Burton) appears to be [[Catullus]] fragment 1, which is written in the \"Priapean\" metre (a type of aeolic).<ref>Uden (2007), p. 6.</ref> It begins:\n\n:''hunc l\u016bcum tibi d\u0113dic\u014d c\u014dnsecr\u014dque, Pri\u0101pe''\n::\"I dedicate and consecrate this grove to you, Priapus\"\n\nThree poems in the collected works of Catullus (16, 47, and 56) are also judged to be Priapic in character.<ref>Uden (2007), p. 2.</ref> Catullus's famous threat to \"sodomise and irrumate\" (''[[Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo|p\u0113d\u012bc\u0101bo ego v\u014ds et irrum\u0101b\u014d]]'') his friends Aurelius and Furius (Catullus 16) is imitated in the passive voice in ''Priapea'' 35 (''p\u0113d\u012bc\u0101beris irrum\u0101berisque'').\n\nAmong works of other poets, Horace ''Satires'' 1.8 (included as no. 95 in Smithers and Burton's edition of the ''Priapeia'') is a 50-line poem in hexameters in which Priapus recounts how the garden he was guarding, a former graveyard, was plagued by witches until suddenly the wood of his backside split open with a loud farting noise and scared them off. \n\nFour anonymous poems in the [[Appendix Vergiliana]] (nos. 86, 87, 88, and 84 of Smithers and Burton's edition of the ''Priapeia'') are also Priapic.<ref>Uden (2007), p. 7.</ref> In the first, the god describes his sufferings in the winter; in the second he describes his guardianship of the farm throughout the seasons, and demands respect from a passer-by; in the third, he warns some boys not to steal from his farm but to go to the neighbour's farm instead. \n\nIn the fourth poem, the anonymous poet addresses Priapus and chides him for causing him to become impotent when sleeping with a boy. Both this and the short prayer to Priapus to protect a farm (no. 83 in Smithers and Burton) are sometimes, but for no good reason,<ref>Butrica, J.L. (1992) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/711883 Review of Tr\u00e4nkle's ''The Appendix Tibulliana'']</ref> attributed to Tibullus.\n\n[[Tibullus]] 1.4 is part of a series of 3 elegies about Tibullus's love for a certain boy called Marathus. In this 82-line poem, Priapus gives advice to the poet on how to seduce boys.\n\nThere are also some epigrams of [[Martial]] addressed to or written about Priapus; they include 85 and 90\u201394 in Smithers and Burton's ''Priapeia'', as well as Martial 1.40, in which the poet asks Priapus to guard a grove of trees from thieves, threatening to use the statue of the god for firewood if he fails.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Buchheit, Vinzenz (1962).

In them the god congratulates and praises himself for the size and virility of his sexual parts and issues fearful warnings to those who would trespass upon his garden or attempt to steal its fruits, threatening such miscreants with various punishments of a sexual nature, such as [[irrumation]] and [[sodomy]]. The poems are notable for their use of obscene words and ideas in combination with refined and elegant diction.<ref>See Young (2015).</ref>\n\nIn the past one theory was that the ''Priapeia'' were the work of a group of poets who met at the house of [[Maecenas]], amusing themselves by writing tongue-in-cheek tributes to the garden Priapus.<ref>Elomaa (2015), pp. 9-10.</ref>  (Maecenas was [[Horace]]\u2019s patron.) Others, including [[Martial]] and [[Petronius]], were thought to have added more verses in imitation of the originals. However, since a study by the German scholar [[:de:Vinzenz Buchheit|Vinzenz Buchheit]] in 1962, the theory has gained ground that they are the work of a single poet illustrating Priapus's decline from a vigorous youth to an impotent old age.<ref>Kenney (1963); Holzberg (2005).</ref> The first two poems are a dedication by the author and the last one is a prayer to Priapus to increase the sexual prowess of the poet himself.<ref>Holzberg (2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1890, the ''Priapeia'' were translated into English by [[Leonard Smithers]] and [[Sir Richard Burton]]<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/ The Priapeia Index - Sacred Texts]</ref> (the latter of whom also freely translated ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]''), who provided numerous glosses concerning the sexual practices and proclivities that are referenced in the poems.  These explanatory notes address such diverse topics as [[oral sex]] ([[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]]), [[irrumation]], [[masturbation]], [[bestiality]], sexual positions, eunuchism, [[phalli]], [[religious prostitution]], [[aphrodisiacs]], [[pornography]], and sexual terminology, but are not always accurate scholarly reflections of ancient Roman practices.  A more recent translation titled ''The'' ''Priapus Poems'' has been carried out by Richard W. Hooper.<ref>Hooper (1999).</ref>\n\nIn the \"Introduction\" to the ''Priapeia'', the Smithers and Burton claim that \"The worship of Priapus amongst the Romans was derived from the [[Egypt]]ians, who, under the form of [[Apis (god)|Apis]], the Sacred Bull, adored the generative Power of Nature,\" adding that \"the Phallus was the ancient emblem of creation, and representative of the gods [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], Priapus, [[Hermaphroditus]], [[Hercules]], [[Shiva]], [[Osiris]], [[Baal]] and [[Asher]], who were all Phallic [[deities]].\"\n\n==Authorship==\nAlthough even today some scholars<ref>cf. Uden (2007), p. 8.</ref> hold that the Carmina Priapea are anthology of poems by different authors, others<ref>Buchheit (1962), Kenney (1963), Kloss (2003), Holzberg (2005).</ref> support the arguments for the single authorship of all 80 poems.\n\nAmong these arguments are the following. First, the poems seem to have been carefully arranged according to metre. Only three metres are used. There appear to be 5 groups of 14 poems each. The first fourteen poems alternate between elegiac couplets and hendecasyllables. In the second to fifth groups the alternation is not so regular, but each group contains exactly 7 poems in hendecasyllables and 7 poems in either elegiac couplets or [[choliamb|scazons]]. The scazon poems are arranged two in the 3rd group, two in the 4th, and two in the 5th. The last ten poems consist of a coda of 4 poems in elegiac couplets, 3 in hendecasyllables, 2 in scazons, and 1 poem in elegiac couplets.<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 472.</ref> Kloss argues that if the poems were a miscellaneous anthology, they would presumably have contained poems in other metres too, such as the iambic (84 and 87), aeolic (85, 89) or hexameter (95) metres used in the \"extra\" poems in Smithers and Burton's edition.<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 470-71.</ref>\n\nFurther, in the second dedicatory poem, the poet announces that he has written (not collected together) the poems:<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 467-8.</ref> \"Playfully, without taking too much trouble, I have written these poems, which as you can witness, Priapus, are more suitable for a garden than for a book of poems\":\n\n:''l\u016bd\u0113ns haec ego teste t\u0113, Pri\u0101pe,<br />hort\u014d carmina digna, n\u014dn libell\u014d,<br />scr\u012bps\u012b n\u014dn nimium lab\u014dri\u014ds\u0113''\n\nA third argument is based on the observation that pairs of consecutive or near-consecutive poems are often linked by the repetition of a word.<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 474-6.</ref> For example, the rare word ''erucarum'' ([[Eruca vesicaria|rocket]]) in 46.8 is repeated in ''erucis'' in 47.6; ''Maurae ... puellae'' in 45.3 is echoed by ''puella Mauro'' in 46.1; ''virgineum locum'' in 2.5 reappears as ''virgo ... loci'' in 3.7, and so on. There are also possibly wider links between the poems. For example, Laure Sandoz sees a connection between the words ''membr\u014dsior'' in 1.5, ''mentul\u0101tior'' in 36.11, and ''sarcin\u014dsior'' (or in some texts ''fascin\u014dsior'') in 79.4, all meaning \"endowed with a larger penis\", at the beginning, middle, and end of the collection, with the last two words both in the last line of a scazon poem.<ref>Sandoz (2011), p. 96.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the poet also clearly aims at variety. For example, in the first group of 14 poems, the god's oversized phallus is referred to in a number of different ways (''mentula'', ''part\u012b'', ''inguen'', ''t\u0113lum'', ''columna'' and so on).<ref>Holzberg (2005), p. 373.</ref>\n\nAnother argument concerns the subject matter of the poems themselves, which like the collections of love poetry of the poets of the time of [[Augustus]], show the course of an affair from its beginning to its end.<ref>Holzberg (2005).</ref> In the first group of fourteen poems, Priapus is shown as boastful and vigorous, but gradually problems set in. In poem 26 he confesses that he is worn out by sex (''effut\u016btus'') and thin and pale (''macerque pallidusque'') and complains that the neighbouring women give him no rest. In poem 33, on the other hand, he complains that he is compelled to relieve himself with his own hand for want of female companions among the nymphs. Towards the end of the book the problems multiply. In poem 56 he is mocked by a thief and shown the middle finger (''impud\u012bcum digitum'') because his phallus is only made of wood, and he is reduced to calling on his master to perform the punishment. In poem 70 he has become so impotent that he has to endure the humiliation of a dog performing ''fellatio'' on him all night. In poem 76 we learn that Priapus is now old and grey-haired and only good for penetrating old men. In 77 he complains that because of a hedge round the garden he is no longer getting any sex. Finally, in 79, an anonymous speaker informs Priapus that he is no better endowed than \"our poet\" \u2013 who, it appears from the final poem, has an unusually small penis.\n\n==Date==\nThe date of the ''Carmina Priapea'' is still disputed, though is generally assumed to be in the 1st century AD. One piece of evidence for the date of the collection is the phrase ''inepta loc\u012b'' (\"foolish ... of the place\") which occurs in poem 3.8 in connection with a girl who offers her backside to her husband on her wedding night instead of the usual place. The same phrase, in a similar context, is quoted in [[Seneca the Elder]] (''Contr.'' 1.2.22), where it is called ''Ovidi\u0101num illud'' (\"that Ovidian phrase\").<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 465.</ref> Some scholars have assumed therefore that poem 3 of the collection at least was composed by [[Ovid]].<ref>Uden (2007), p. 8.</ref> However, the German scholar [[:de:Gerrit Kloss|Gerrit Kloss]] argues that this is not necessarily so. It could be that ''inepta loc\u012b'' simply imitates a lost poem of Ovid, rather than being the first instance of its use. The same poem contains a number of other literary echoes of phrases used by Ovid, Virgil, and Horace.<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 466, note 11.</ref>\n\nAnother piece of evidence is that certain words in the poems, such as ''circitor'' (\"watchman\"), ''rubricatus'' (\"painted red\"), ''pr\u016br\u012bgo'' (\"sexual desire\") and so on, are not used until writers of the time of [[Nero]] or later. Assuming that all the poems are by a single author, then the whole collection can be dated to the time of Nero or later.<ref>Kloss (2003).</ref>\n\nA number of arguments from prosody have also been put forward by H. Tr\u00e4nkle (1998) in an attempt to date the poems.<ref>Kloss (2003), pp. 481-2.</ref> For example, it has been argued that the long ''-\u014d'' in [[spondee|spondaic]] words like ''virg\u014d'' and ''erg\u014d'' (in 11 out of 13 cases in the ''Carmina Priapea'') is closer to Ovid's practice than that of [[Martial]], where the ''-o'' is usually short. However, Kloss points out that this argument is weak, since other writers later than Ovid, such as [[Petronius]] and [[Silius Italicus]] also preferred the long ''-\u014d''.\n\nBuchheit (1962) found sufficient echoes of [[Martial]] to argue that the poems must date from after Martial's time.<ref>Kenney (1963), p. 72.</ref> Kloss (2003) is less certain, but thinks that the poems date at the earliest to Nero's time, but more probably to a period after Martial.<ref>Kloss (2003), p. 485.</ref>\n\n==Other Priapic poems==\nThe 80 poems of the ''Carmina Priapea'' are by no means the only poems which survive from the ancient world in honour of Priapus. Kytzler's edition contains 37 poems in Greek excerpted from the [[Greek anthology]] dating from the 3rd century BC to the 6th century AD.<ref>Parker (1988); cf. Uden (2007), p. 4, note 9.</ref> \n\nIn Latin, outside the ''Corpus Priapeorum'' there are about 23 ''Priapea'' of various types, some of which are added as poems 83-95 in Smithers and Burton's edition of the ''Priapeia''.\n\nThe earliest extant Priapic poem in Latin (no. 89 in Smithers and Burton) appears to be [[Catullus]] fragment 1, which is written in the \"Priapean\" metre (a type of aeolic).<ref>Uden (2007), p. 6.</ref> It begins:\n\n:''hunc l\u016bcum tibi d\u0113dic\u014d c\u014dnsecr\u014dque, Pri\u0101pe''\n::\"I dedicate and consecrate this grove to you, Priapus\"\n\nThree poems in the collected works of Catullus (16, 47, and 56) are also judged to be Priapic in character.<ref>Uden (2007), p. 2.</ref> Catullus's famous threat to \"sodomise and irrumate\" (''[[Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo|p\u0113d\u012bc\u0101bo ego v\u014ds et irrum\u0101b\u014d]]'') his friends Aurelius and Furius (Catullus 16) is imitated in the passive voice in ''Priapea'' 35 (''p\u0113d\u012bc\u0101beris irrum\u0101berisque'').\n\nAmong works of other poets, Horace ''Satires'' 1.8 (included as no. 95 in Smithers and Burton's edition of the ''Priapeia'') is a 50-line poem in hexameters in which Priapus recounts how the garden he was guarding, a former graveyard, was plagued by witches until suddenly the wood of his backside split open with a loud farting noise and scared them off. \n\nFour anonymous poems in the [[Appendix Vergiliana]] (nos. 86, 87, 88, and 84 of Smithers and Burton's edition of the ''Priapeia'') are also Priapic.<ref>Uden (2007), p. 7.</ref> In the first, the god describes his sufferings in the winter; in the second he describes his guardianship of the farm throughout the seasons, and demands respect from a passer-by; in the third, he warns some boys not to steal from his farm but to go to the neighbour's farm instead. \n\nIn the fourth poem, the anonymous poet addresses Priapus and chides him for causing him to become impotent when sleeping with a boy. Both this and the short prayer to Priapus to protect a farm (no. 83 in Smithers and Burton) are sometimes, but for no good reason,<ref>Butrica, J.L. (1992) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/711883 Review of Tr\u00e4nkle's ''The Appendix Tibulliana'']</ref> attributed to Tibullus.\n\n[[Tibullus]] 1.4 is part of a series of 3 elegies about Tibullus's love for a certain boy called Marathus. In this 82-line poem, Priapus gives advice to the poet on how to seduce boys.\n\nThere are also some epigrams of [[Martial]] addressed to or written about Priapus; they include 85 and 90\u201394 in Smithers and Burton's ''Priapeia'', as well as Martial 1.40, in which the poet asks Priapus to guard a grove of trees from thieves, threatening to use the statue of the god for firewood if he fails.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Buchheit, Vinzenz (1962).

In recent years, there have been developments towards addressing these considerations.\n\n'''[https://www.bluefounder.in/website-development-services/which-is-the-top-10-website-company-of-india/ Web] engineering''' focuses on the methodologies, techniques, and tools that are the foundation of [[Web application development]] and which support their design, development, evolution, and evaluation. Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development.\n\nWeb engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas: [[systems analysis]] and [[systems design|design]], software engineering, hypermedia/hypertext engineering, [[requirements engineering]], [[human-computer interaction]], user interface, [[information engineering]], information indexing and [[information retrieval|retrieval]], testing, modelling and simulation, project management, and graphic design and presentation. Web engineering is neither a clone nor a subset of software engineering, although both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of [[Web application|Web-based application]]s.\n\n== As a discipline ==\nProponents of Web engineering supported the establishment of Web engineering as a discipline at an early stage of Web.

The prospect of Web as a platform will continue to grow and it is worth being treated specifically.\n\nHowever, it has been controversial, especially for people in other traditional disciplines such as software engineering, to recognize Web engineering as a new field.

In addition to their inherent multifaceted functionality, these Web applications exhibit complex behaviour and place some unique demands on their usability, performance, security, and ability to grow and evolve. However, a vast majority of these applications continue to be developed in an ad-hoc way, contributing to problems of usability, maintainability, quality and reliability.<ref name=\"ciabe\">{{cite journal | last1 = Pressman | first1 = Roger S | year = 1998 | title = Can Internet Applications be Engineered? | url = | journal = IEEE Software | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 104\u2013110 | doi=10.1109/ms.1998.714869}}</ref><ref name=\"tangled\">Roger S Pressman, \"What a Tangled Web we Weave,\" IEEE Software, Jan/Feb 2001, Vol. 18, No.1, pp 18-21</ref> While Web development can benefit from established practices from other related disciplines, it has certain distinguishing characteristics that demand special considerations. In recent years, there have been developments towards addressing these considerations.\n\n'''Web engineering''' focuses on the methodologies, techniques, and tools that are the foundation of [[Web application development]] and which support their design, development, evolution, and evaluation. Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development.\n\nWeb engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas: [[systems analysis]] and [[systems design|design]], software engineering, hypermedia/hypertext engineering, [[requirements engineering]], [[human-computer interaction]], user interface, [[information engineering]], information indexing and [[information retrieval|retrieval]], testing, modelling and simulation, project management, and graphic design and presentation. Web engineering is neither a clone nor a subset of software engineering, although both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of [[Web application|Web-based application]]s.\n\n== As a discipline ==\nProponents of Web engineering supported the establishment of Web engineering as a discipline at an early stage of Web. Major arguments for Web engineering as a new discipline are:\n\n* Web-based Information Systems (WIS) development process is different and unique.<ref>Gerti Kappel, Birgit Proll, Seiegfried, and Werner Retschitzegger, \"An Introduction to Web Engineering,\" in Web Engineering, Gerti Kappel, et al. (eds.) John Wiley and Sons, Heidelberg, Germany, 2003</ref>\n* Web engineering is multi-disciplinary; no single discipline (such as software engineering) can provide complete theory basis, body of knowledge and practices to guide WIS development.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Deshpande | first1 = Yogesh | last2 = Hansen | first2 = Steve | year = 2001 | title = Web Engineering: Creating Discipline among Disciplines | url = | journal = IEEE Multimedia | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 81\u201386 | doi = 10.1109/93.917974 }}</ref>\n* Issues of evolution and lifecycle management when compared to more 'traditional' applications.\n* Web-based information systems and applications are pervasive and non-trivial. The prospect of Web as a platform will continue to grow and it is worth being treated specifically.\n\nHowever, it has been controversial, especially for people in other traditional disciplines such as software engineering, to recognize Web engineering as a new field. The issue is how different and independent Web engineering is, compared with other disciplines.\n\nMain topics of Web engineering include, but are not limited to, the following areas:\n\n=== Modeling disciplines ===\n* Business Processes for Applications on the Web\n* Process Modelling of Web applications\n* Requirements Engineering for Web applications\n* B2B applications\n\n=== Design disciplines, tools, and methods ===\n* [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and the Web\n* Conceptual Modeling of Web Applications (aka. [[Web modeling]])\n* Prototyping Methods and Tools\n* [[Web design]] methods\n* CASE Tools for Web Applications\n* Web Interface Design\n* Data Models for Web Information Systems\n\n=== Implementation disciplines ===\n* Integrated Web Application Development Environments\n* Code Generation for Web Applications\n* Software Factories for/on the Web\n* Web 2.0, AJAX, E4X, ASP.NET, PHP and Other New Developments\n* [[Web Service]]s Development and Deployment\n\n=== Testing disciplines ===\n* Testing and Evaluation of Web systems and Applications.\n* Testing Automation, Methods, and Tools.\n\n=== Applications categories disciplines ===\n* [[Semantic Web]] applications\n* Document centric Web sites\n* Transactional Web applications\n* Interactive Web applications\n* Workflow-based Web applications\n* Collaborative Web applications\n* Portal-oriented Web applications\n* Ubiquitous and Mobile Web Applications\n* Device Independent Web Delivery\n* [[Internationalization and localization|Localization and Internationalization]] of Web Applications\n* [[Personalization]] of Web Applications\n\n== Attributes ==\n\n=== Web quality ===\n* Web Metrics, Cost Estimation, and Measurement\n* Personalisation and Adaptation of Web applications\n* Web Quality\n* [[Web usability|Usability of Web Applications]]\n* [[Web accessibility]]\n* Performance of Web-based applications\n\n=== Content-related ===\n* Web Content Management\n* Content Management System (CMS)\n* [[Multimedia]] Authoring Tools and Software\n* [[Authoring of adaptive hypermedia]]\n\n== Education ==\n* [[Master of Science]]: Web Engineering as a branch of study within the MSc program Web Sciences at the [[Johannes Kepler University Linz]], Austria <ref>[http://www.jku.at/content/e262/e242/e2380/e131292 JKU \u00bb Webwissenschaften - Master].
