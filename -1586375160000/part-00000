She has been criticized for her association with eugenics, a branch of science that seeks to improve the human species through selective mating. As grandson Alexander Sanger, chair of the International Planned Parenthood Council, explained, \"She believed that women wanted their children to be free of poverty and disease, that women were natural eugenicists, and that birth control, which could limit the number of children and improve their quality of life, was the panacea to accomplish this.\" Still, Sanger held some views that were common at the time, but now seem abhorrent, including support of sterilization for the mentally ill and mentally impaired. Despite her controversial comments, Sanger focused her work on one basic principle: \"Every child should be a wanted child.\"\n\n==Later Years and Death==\n\nSanger stepped out of the spotlight for a time, choosing to live in Tucson, Arizona. Her retirement did not last long, however. She worked on the birth control issue in other countries in Europe and Asia, and she established the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1952. Still seeking a \"magic pill,\" Sanger recruited Gregory Pincus, a human reproduction expert, to work on the problem in the early 1950s. She found the necessary financial support for the project from Katharine McCormick, the International Harvester heiress. This research project would yield the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1960.\n\n=== Periodicals ===\n* ''The Woman Rebel''&nbsp;\u2013 Seven issues published monthly from March 1914 to August 1914.

{"title_page": "Henry Beston", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2013}}\n'''Henry Beston''' (June 1, 1888 \u2013 April 15, 1968) was an American writer and naturalist, best known as the author of ''[[The Outermost House]]'', written in 1928.\n\n==Early life and work==\nBorn Henry Beston Sheahan, he was born and grew up in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]<ref>U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1923</ref> with his parents, Dr. Joseph Sheahan and Marie Louise (Maurice) Beston Sheahan, and brother George, a doctor.<ref>1920 United States Federal Census</ref> Beston attended [[Adams Academy]] in Quincy before earning his B.A. (1909) and M.A. (1911) from [[Harvard College]]. While at [[Harvard]], he lived at the historic [[Parson Capen House]] in [[Topsfield, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1912, Beston took up teaching at the [[University of Lyon]].<ref>U.S., Consular Registration Certificates, 1907-1918</ref> In 1914 he returned to Harvard as an English department assistant. Beston joined the French army in 1915 and served as an ambulance driver. His service in [[le Bois le Pretre]] and at the [[Battle of Verdun]] was described in his first book, ''A Volunteer Poilu''. In 1918, Beston became a press representative for the [[U.S. Navy]]. Highlights from this period include being the only American correspondent to travel with the [[British Grand Fleet]] and to be aboard an American destroyer during combat engagement and sinking. His second book of journalistic work, ''Full Speed Ahead'', described these experiences.\n\nFollowing the end of [[World War I]], Beston began writing [[fairy tales]] under the name \"Henry Beston\". In 1919, ''The Firelight Fairy Book'' was published, followed by ''The Starlight Wonder Book'' in 1923. During this time, he worked as an editor of ''The Living Age'', an offshoot of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. He also met his future wife [[Elizabeth Coatsworth]], a fellow author of children's literature with whom he had two daughters, Margaret and Catherine.[3]:97 They lived at [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], and Chimney Farm in [[Nobleboro, Maine]].[6], during this time.\n\n==''The Outermost House''==\n''The Outermost House'', now considered a [[Cape Cod]] nature literary classic, was written after Beston spent what he called \"a year of life on the Great Beach of Cape Cod\". Spiritually shaken by his experiences in [[World War I]], Beston retreated to the outer beach at [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]] in search of peace and solitude.\n\n\"Nature is part of our humanity, and without some awareness of that divine mystery man ceases to be man,\" Beston wrote.\n\nBeston, who dedicated himself as a \"writer/naturalist\", is considered one of the fathers of the modern environmental movement, and ''The Outermost House'' has been called one of the motivating factors behind the establishment of the [[Cape Cod National Seashore]]. Author [[Rachel Carson]] said that Beston was the only author who ever influenced her writing.\n\nThe 20x16 house, dubbed \"the Fo'castle\" by Beston, was built by Eastham carpenter Harvey Moore in the late spring of 1925. Beston stayed there, on and off, for about two years, leaving the beach occasionally, but was usually on the beach for the many severe storms that struck the Cape in the winter. His house was located two miles south of the Nauset Coast Guard Station, with the Atlantic Ocean near his front door and [[Nauset Marsh]] behind him.

While at [[Harvard]], he lived at the historic [[Parson Capen House]] in [[Topsfield, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1912, Beston took up teaching at the [[University of Lyon]].<ref>U.S., Consular Registration Certificates, 1907-1918</ref> In 1914 he returned to Harvard as an English department assistant. Beston joined the French army in 1915 and served as an ambulance driver. His service in [[le Bois le Pretre]] and at the [[Battle of Verdun]] was described in his first book, ''A Volunteer Poilu''. In 1918, Beston became a press representative for the [[U.S. Navy]]. Highlights from this period include being the only American correspondent to travel with the [[British Grand Fleet]] and to be aboard an American destroyer during combat engagement and sinking. His second book of journalistic work, ''Full Speed Ahead'', described these experiences.\n\nFollowing the end of [[World War I]], Beston began writing [[fairy tales]] under the name \"Henry Beston\". In 1919, ''The Firelight Fairy Book'' was published, followed by ''The Starlight Wonder Book'' in 1923. During this time, he worked as an editor of ''The Living Age'', an offshoot of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. He also met his future wife [[Elizabeth Coatsworth]], a fellow author of children's literature with whom he had two daughters, Margaret and Catherine.[3]:97 They lived at [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], and Chimney Farm in [[Nobleboro, Maine]].[6], during this time.\n\n==''The Outermost House''==\n''The Outermost House'', now considered a [[Cape Cod]] nature literary classic, was written after Beston spent what he called \"a year of life on the Great Beach of Cape Cod\". Spiritually shaken by his experiences in [[World War I]], Beston retreated to the outer beach at [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]] in search of peace and solitude.\n\n\"Nature is part of our humanity, and without some awareness of that divine mystery man ceases to be man,\" Beston wrote.\n\nBeston, who dedicated himself as a \"writer/naturalist\", is considered one of the fathers of the modern environmental movement, and ''The Outermost House'' has been called one of the motivating factors behind the establishment of the [[Cape Cod National Seashore]]. Author [[Rachel Carson]] said that Beston was the only author who ever influenced her writing.\n\nThe 20x16 house, dubbed \"the Fo'castle\" by Beston, was built by Eastham carpenter Harvey Moore in the late spring of 1925. Beston stayed there, on and off, for about two years, leaving the beach occasionally, but was usually on the beach for the many severe storms that struck the Cape in the winter. His house was located two miles south of the Nauset Coast Guard Station, with the Atlantic Ocean near his front door and [[Nauset Marsh]] behind him. His only neighbors were the Coast Guardsmen, who patrolled the beach.\n\n''The Outermost House'' was published in 1928, and has gone through dozens of printings since then. An audiobook version was released in 2007.\n\n==Leaving the Outermost House==\nBeston married writer [[Elizabeth Coatsworth]] in 1929, and the couple eventually bought a farmhouse called \"[[Chimney Farm]]\" in [[Nobleboro, Maine]].

A burnt-out, depressed alcoholic, she is estranged from her husband Adam and young daughter Marcie, and tormented by nightmares of the event that got her removed from the force four years earlier: Her manhunt in Maris Creek for [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] and suspected serial killer Victor Orbin led to a [[SWAT]] team gunning down an innocent man working at the site. Orbin, who was never at the scene, is presumed still at large.\n\nEllis reappears in [[Portland]], strangling and castrating [[Internal Affairs]] investigator Fred Tierney, who was responsible for Lucinda's removal.

He asks Lucinda to return to the force to head the case and track down Orbin for good, but she refuses, rattled when learning of Ellis's escape.\n\nEllis kills an insurance salesman, puts on his clothes, drives to a house and murders the man who answers the door. Both men are also strangled and castrated to [[copycat crime|copycat]] Orbin. Lucinda discovers that the house was her childhood home. She and Ellis were [[child abuse|abuse]]d by their alcoholic father, long dead of an ilness, and she always tried to take the brunt of it, swearing to always look after Ellis. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Arthur Fortis, Junior, brought on the case as an advisor, answers a phone call to Lucinda from Ellis, who reveals details of Tierney's murder and demands his sister be put on the case.\n\nLucinda finds a coded note from Ellis in the house's attic, revealing his apparent willingness to surrender to her that night. She figures out the location and stakes it out with Travis, Junior and their team. Ellis calls her, seemingly taunting her with riddles from their childhood, and his location is traced to a homeless shelter across the street. Everyone races there, but Lucinda realizes it is a setup. A booby trap in the room explodes, injuring Junior and several other officers.\n\nEllis escapes and later poses as a camper in [[Crater Lake National Park]], where he meets a boy named Kelly. Seeing that Kelly is being abused by his father, Ellis kidnaps him after murdering his father and tying up his mother.\n\nA clue left at the house murder leads Lucinda to her father's old office. In the basement, she finds a skeleton in a refrigerator. As the team converges on the park, they learn that the skeleton is Victor Orbin's, and he was dead before the events at Maris Creek, having in fact been previously buried there. Lucinda realizes that Ellis committed all the murders, killed Orbin and framed him, believing that Lucinda would find the body, figure out Ellis was responsible, and come after him. The innocent worker's death was an unforseen circumstance. With Lucinda pulled from duty and unable to protect Ellis, he was imprisoned on unrelated charges, which explains why \"Orbin\" stopped killing. Lucinda now knows that Ellis wants her to kill him, to spare her of always having to be her brother's keeper. She is determined to bring him in alive.\n\nAs Lucinda and Junior search the forest, she is injured by one of Ellis's traps.

More than 800 tickets were sold for the event at the Tape Club in Berlin, making it the biggest chessboxing title fight to that date.

In 2008, chessboxing clubs were founded in London and Krasnoyarsk.

The Boxer in Munich also opened in 2010 and offers chessboxing training. In addition to the WCBO's initially European and then later world championships taking place worldwide, the scene at the London Chessboxing Club grew where chessboxing events take place on a regular basis.

Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalization of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH\u2014called Chess Boxing Global, CBG\u2014was founded, that {{as of|2013|May|lc=y}}, is responsible for organizing all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\n\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professionals reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as [[Marco Huck]]'s and [[Yoan Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez]]' sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division-winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions.

Chess and boxing rounds alternate, and a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a [[time control]] of 9 minutes with no [[Fischer delay|increment]] to make all their moves ([[blitz chess]]). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.:)))(()()())((())((()(\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\n* Victory by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]] in boxing\n* Victory by [[checkmate]] in chess\n* Loss due to exceeding the chess game's [[time control]]\n* Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).\n**This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other\n* Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)\n\nIn the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]], the fighter who is ahead on boxing [[Points decision|points]] wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the [[White and Black in chess|black]] chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the [[first-move advantage in chess]]). This has not yet occurred in practice.\n\n=== Weight classes ===\nLike [[Weight class (boxing)|boxing]], chessboxers are divided into [[weight class]]es. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ({{as of|2014|October|lc=y}}):\n\n==== Men (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 154.324&nbsp;lbs (70 kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 176.37&nbsp;lbs (80&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 198.416&nbsp;lbs (90&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)<ref>Chess Boxing Global: [http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ CBG Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905052145/http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ |date=2016-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==== Women (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 121.254&nbsp;lbs (55&nbsp;kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 143.3&nbsp;lbs (65&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 165.347&nbsp;lbs (75&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg)\n\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.\n\n== Particular requirements and training ==\nA chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an [[Elo rating]] of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.\n\nIn order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout.  They will use exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\n\n== Champions ==\n{{further|List of Chess boxing champions}}\n\nBetween 2003\u20132013, the chessboxing world championships were organised by the WCBO. {{as of|2013}}, they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\n\n=== WCBO (2003\u20132012) ===\n\n==== World champions ====\n* 2003: Iepe Rubingh {{NLD}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Amsterdam against Jean Louis Veenstra {{NLD}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/you-thought-we-were-making-it-up- Chessboxing Amsterdam]</ref>\n* 2007: Frank Stoldt {{DEU}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against David Depto {{USA}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/cheboxing-world-championship-2008-in-berlin Stoldt vs. Depto]</ref>\n* 2008: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Frank Stoldt {{DEU}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-ruians-are-coming-in-cheboxing Stoldt vs. Sazhin]</ref>\n* 2009: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Krasnoyarsk against Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}}<ref>Iepe.net: [http://www.iepe.net/dada/mail.cgi/archive/WCBO/20091203163513/ Sazhin vs. Chernobaev]</ref>\n\n==== European champions ====\n* 2005: [[Tihomir Dovramadjiev]] {{BGR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Andreas Dilschneider {{DEU}}<ref>Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42736496.html Dilschneider Teasertext]</ref>\n* 2010: Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in London against Andrew Costello {{GBR}}\n* 2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Darius Rolkis {{LTU}}\n*2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Dmitri Pechurin {{RUS}}\n* 2016: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Daniel Wakeham  {{GBR}}\n\n=== CBG (starting 2013) ===\n{{update section|date=May 2017}}\n* 2013: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in Moscow against Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}}\n* 2013: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Moscow against Shaliesh Tripathi {{IND}}\n* 2013: Sven Rooch {{DEU}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Moscow against Jonathan Rodriguez Vega {{ESP}}\n\n== Major organizations ==\n\n=== World Chess Boxing Organisation ===\nThe [[World Chess Boxing Organisation|World Chess Boxing Organisation e.V.]] (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organisation for international amateur chessboxing.

Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalization of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH\u2014called Chess Boxing Global, CBG\u2014was founded, that {{as of|2013|May|lc=y}}, is responsible for organizing all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\n\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professionals reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as [[Marco Huck]]'s and [[Yoan Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez]]' sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division-winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions.

Chess and boxing rounds alternate, and a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a [[time control]] of 9 minutes with no [[Fischer delay|increment]] to make all their moves ([[blitz chess]]). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\n* Victory by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]] in boxing\n* Victory by [[checkmate]] in chess\n* Loss due to exceeding the chess game's [[time control]]\n* Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).\n**This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other\n* Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)\n\nIn the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]], the fighter who is ahead on boxing [[Points decision|points]] wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the [[White and Black in chess|black]] chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the [[first-move advantage in chess]]). This has not yet occurred in practice.\n\n=== Weight classes ===\nLike [[Weight class (boxing)|boxing]], chessboxers are divided into [[weight class]]es. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ({{as of|2014|October|lc=y}}):\n\n==== Men (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 154.324&nbsp;lbs (70 kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 176.37&nbsp;lbs (80&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 198.416&nbsp;lbs (90&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)<ref>Chess Boxing Global: [http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ CBG Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905052145/http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ |date=2016-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==== Women (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 121.254&nbsp;lbs (55&nbsp;kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 143.3&nbsp;lbs (65&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 165.347&nbsp;lbs (75&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg)\n\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.\n\n== Particular requirements and training ==\nA chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an [[Elo rating]] of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.\n\nIn order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout.  They will use exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\n\n== Champions ==\n{{further|List of Chess boxing champions}}\n\nBetween 2003\u20132013, the chessboxing world championships were organised by the WCBO. {{as of|2013}}, they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\n\n=== WCBO (2003\u20132012) ===\n\n==== World champions ====\n* 2003: Iepe Rubingh {{NLD}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Amsterdam against Jean Louis Veenstra {{NLD}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/you-thought-we-were-making-it-up- Chessboxing Amsterdam]</ref>\n* 2007: Frank Stoldt {{DEU}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against David Depto {{USA}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/cheboxing-world-championship-2008-in-berlin Stoldt vs. Depto]</ref>\n* 2008: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Frank Stoldt {{DEU}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-ruians-are-coming-in-cheboxing Stoldt vs. Sazhin]</ref>\n* 2009: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Krasnoyarsk against Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}}<ref>Iepe.net: [http://www.iepe.net/dada/mail.cgi/archive/WCBO/20091203163513/ Sazhin vs. Chernobaev]</ref>\n\n==== European champions ====\n* 2005: [[Tihomir Dovramadjiev]] {{BGR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Andreas Dilschneider {{DEU}}<ref>Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42736496.html Dilschneider Teasertext]</ref>\n* 2010: Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in London against Andrew Costello {{GBR}}\n* 2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Darius Rolkis {{LTU}}\n*2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Dmitri Pechurin {{RUS}}\n* 2016: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Daniel Wakeham  {{GBR}}\n\n=== CBG (starting 2013) ===\n{{update section|date=May 2017}}\n* 2013: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in Moscow against Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}}\n* 2013: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Moscow against Shaliesh Tripathi {{IND}}\n* 2013: Sven Rooch {{DEU}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Moscow against Jonathan Rodriguez Vega {{ESP}}\n\n== Major organizations ==\n\n=== World Chess Boxing Organisation ===\nThe [[World Chess Boxing Organisation|World Chess Boxing Organisation e.V.]] (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organisation for international amateur chessboxing.

[[Cheese]] is a [[milk]]-based food that is produced in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms. Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]], the [[butterfat]] content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.\n\n[[Herb]]s, [[spice]]s, or [[smoking (cooking)|wood smoke]] may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as [[Red Leicester]], is normally formed from adding [[annatto]]. While most current varieties of cheese may be traced to a particular locale, or culture, within a single country, some have a more diffuse origin, and cannot be considered to have originated in a particular place, but are associated with a whole region, such as [[queso blanco]] in [[Latin America]].\n\nCheese is an ancient food whose origins predate [[prehistory|recorded history]]. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where [[Cheesemaker|cheesemaking]] originated, either in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]] or [[the Middle East]], but the practice had spread within Europe prior to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times and, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the [[Ancient Rome|Roman Empire]] came into existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp|title=The History of Cheese: From An Ancient Nomad's Horseback To Today's Luxury Cheese Cart|work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct, Inc.|accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn this list, types of cheeses are included; [[brand name]]s are only included if they apply to a distinct variety of cheese.\n\n==Africa==\n{{See also|African cuisine}}\n\n===Benin===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!Region\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Wagasi]]\n|[[File:Waagashi.jpg|135px]]\n|Northern [[Benin]]\n|A soft cow's milk cheese commonly made by the [[Fula people|Fulani people]] that is sold in many units in [[Parakou]], a city in Central Benin.<ref name=\"Tourism\">{{cite web|url=http://www.benintourism.com/en/interne.php?idrub=2&id=12|title=Parakou|publisher=Benintourism.com|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n===Ethiopia===\n{{See also|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!Region\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Ethiopian cuisine#Ayibe|Ayibe]]\n|<!--[[File:EXAMPLE|135px]] --> \n|\n|A [[cottage cheese]] that is mild and crumbly.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kennedy | first=William | title=Addis Ethiopian Cuisine Opening | website=Eugene Weekly | date=23 August 2018 | url=https://www.eugeneweekly.com/2018/08/23/addis-ethiopian-cuisine-opening/ | access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref> It has little flavor on its own, and is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food.\n|}\n\n===Mauritania===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!Region\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Caravane cheese]]\n|<!--[[File:EXAMPLE|135px]] --> \n|\n|The brand name of a [[camel milk]] [[cheese]] produced in [[Mauritania]] by [[Tiviski]],<ref name=\"Donnelly Kehler 2016\">{{cite book | last=Donnelly | first=C.W. | last2=Kehler | first2=M. | title=The Oxford Companion to Cheese | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=Oxford Companions | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-19-933088-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRg1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA108 | access-date=28 December 2019 | page=108}}</ref> a company founded by Nancy Abeiderrhamane in 1987.

The attempts to make this cheese elsewhere following the same recipe have failed. The producers from this region are proud of their cheese, and for years have been trying to initialize the procedure for the protection of geographic origin.\nThis cheese is very valued as a delicacy in whole of Montenegro, and it is one of the most expensive fresh cheeses on the national market.\nThe name of this cheese is derived from its specific texture. Thin, sometimes almost transparent, layers create a leafy structure, and make strings when the cheese is pulled apart. It has a pleasant mild fragrance. It does not contain high levels of fat, so its taste is mild and light.All producers make it in a similar manner, although every family has their own small secret that distinguishes their cheese, of which they are rather protective. What is known is that this cheese is made by combining the skimmed and whole cow milk. After adding the rennet, which makes milk curd, the cheese is drained and then frequently turned and folded.

Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]], the [[butterfat]] content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging.\n\n[[Herb]]s, [[spice]]s, or [[smoking (cooking)|wood smoke]] may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as [[Red Leicester]], is normally formed from adding [[annatto]]. While most current varieties of cheese may be traced to a particular locale, or culture, within a single country, some have a more diffuse origin, and cannot be considered to have originated in a particular place, but are associated with a whole region, such as [[queso blanco]] in [[Latin America]].\n\nCheese is an ancient food whose origins predate [[prehistory|recorded history]]. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where [[Cheesemaker|cheesemaking]] originated, either in [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]] or [[the Middle East]], but the practice had spread within Europe prior to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times and, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the [[Ancient Rome|Roman Empire]] came into existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp|title=The History of Cheese: From An Ancient Nomad's Horseback To Today's Luxury Cheese Cart|work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct, Inc.|accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn this list, types of cheeses are included; [[brand name]]s are only included if they apply to a distinct variety of cheese.\n\n==Africa==\n{{See also|African cuisine}}\n\n===Benin===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!Region\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Wagasi]]\n|[[File:Waagashi.jpg|135px]]\n|Northern [[Benin]]\n|A soft cow's milk cheese commonly made by the [[Fula people|Fulani people]] that is sold in many units in [[Parakou]], a city in Central Benin.<ref name=\"Tourism\">{{cite web|url=http://www.benintourism.com/en/interne.php?idrub=2&id=12|title=Parakou|publisher=Benintourism.com|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n===Ethiopia===\n{{See also|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!Region\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Ethiopian cuisine#Ayibe|Ayibe]]\n|<!--[[File:EXAMPLE|135px]] --> \n|\n|A [[cottage cheese]] that is mild and crumbly.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kennedy | first=William | title=Addis Ethiopian Cuisine Opening | website=Eugene Weekly | date=23 August 2018 | url=https://www.eugeneweekly.com/2018/08/23/addis-ethiopian-cuisine-opening/ | access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref> It has little flavor on its own, and is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food.\n|}\n\n===Mauritania===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!Region\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Caravane cheese]]\n|<!--[[File:EXAMPLE|135px]] --> \n|\n|The brand name of a [[camel milk]] [[cheese]] produced in [[Mauritania]] by [[Tiviski]],<ref name=\"Donnelly Kehler 2016\">{{cite book | last=Donnelly | first=C.W. | last2=Kehler | first2=M. | title=The Oxford Companion to Cheese | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=Oxford Companions | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-19-933088-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRg1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA108 | access-date=28 December 2019 | page=108}}</ref> a company founded by Nancy Abeiderrhamane in 1987.

This is due to the specific composition of flora that free-ranging cows feed upon on the [[upland pasture]]s, as well as to the microclimatic conditions of the locality. The attempts to make this cheese elsewhere following the same recipe have failed. The producers from this region are proud of their cheese, and for years have been trying to initialize the procedure for the protection of geographic origin.\nThis cheese is very valued as a delicacy in whole of Montenegro, and it is one of the most expensive fresh cheeses on the national market.\nThe name of this cheese is derived from its specific texture. Thin, sometimes almost transparent, layers create a leafy structure, and make strings when the cheese is pulled apart. It has a pleasant mild fragrance. It does not contain high levels of fat, so its taste is mild and light.All producers make it in a similar manner, although every family has their own small secret that distinguishes their cheese, of which they are rather protective. What is known is that this cheese is made by combining the skimmed and whole cow milk. After adding the rennet, which makes milk curd, the cheese is drained and then frequently turned and folded. It is this manipulation that creates thin layers \u2013 leafs \u2013 that give it a characteristic texture.\n|-\n|[[Pljevaljski sir]]<ref name=\"Cheese from Pljevlja\">{{cite web |title=Cheese from Pljevlja (Pljevaljski cheese) |url=http://deliciousmontenegro.me/product/cheese-from-pljevlja-pljevaljski-cheese/ |website=Delicious Food Of Montenegro |accessdate=7 April 2019 |date=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n|\n|\n|A type of best semisoft cheese made of [[cow milk]], produced in Northern Montenegro town of Pljevlja.
