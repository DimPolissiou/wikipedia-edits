The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1962 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|1962]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champion is [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], which won its third title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 tournament]] defending the championship title.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 19 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> (as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]) have won six times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Championship winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], and [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], with three titles each; [[Czech Republic men's national volleyball team|Czech Republic]] (as [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]) with two titles; [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as  [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 World Championship]] was co-hosted by Italy and Bulgaria.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the [[Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://worldgrandprix.2017.fivb.com/en/finals-3/competition Competition introduction].</ref>.\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nThe history of the World Championship clearly demonstrates how volleyball was originally dominated by European nations.\n\nThe first two editions were won by the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. In 1956, twice runner-up [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]] took the gold. There followed two more consecutive wins for the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in both cases over [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]. The Czechs won a gold medal in the 1966 edition.\n\nIn 1970, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]] prevailed over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]] for their first and only title. In 1974, the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] threatened to take the lead once more, but ended up being defeated by [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] at the final. Nevertheless, they would confirm their leadership by winning, for the third time, two editions in a row.\n\n1986 saw the first relevant confrontation between [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], the rising major force of the decade, and the traditional leader [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] after the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984. As would be the case two years later at the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympic Games]], the issue was settled in favour of the Americans led by [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]]. [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] completely dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning all the editions that took place in this decade (1990, 1994, 1998), led by such players as [[Lorenzo Bernardi]] and [[Andrea Giani]].\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] became the leading force in the sport, winning three consecutive editions (2002, 2006 and 2010), the first of which in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the same stage where the Brazilians had been runners-up in 1982. In 2014, [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], playing in home, defeated [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in 4 sets at the final achieving their second gold medal and preventing what would be a historical fourth title in a row.\n\nAs of 2014, 18 editions of the men's Volleyball World Championship have been played: 14 went to European teams, and four to [[Americas|American]] teams (three times to [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and once to [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]]).\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB

The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1962 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|1962]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champion is [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], which won its third title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 tournament]] defending the championship title.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 19 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"Russia are\" instead of \"Russia is\".--> (as [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]) have won six times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Championship winners are [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], and [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], with three titles each; [[Czech Republic men's national volleyball team|Czech Republic]] (as [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]) with two titles; [[Germany men's national volleyball team|Germany]] (as  [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]]), and [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|2018 World Championship]] was co-hosted by Italy and Bulgaria.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, the event was expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the most important, alongside the [[Olympic Games]]<ref>[http://worldgrandprix.2017.fivb.com/en/finals-3/competition Competition introduction].</ref>.\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nThe history of the World Championship clearly demonstrates how volleyball was originally dominated by European nations.\n\nThe first two editions were won by the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. In 1956, twice runner-up [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]] took the gold. There followed two more consecutive wins for the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in both cases over [[Czechoslovakia men's national volleyball team|Czechoslovakia]]. The Czechs won a gold medal in the 1966 edition.\n\nIn 1970, [[East Germany men's national volleyball team|East Germany]] prevailed over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]] for their first and only title. In 1974, the [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] threatened to take the lead once more, but ended up being defeated by [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] at the final. Nevertheless, they would confirm their leadership by winning, for the third time, two editions in a row.\n\n1986 saw the first relevant confrontation between [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], the rising major force of the decade, and the traditional leader [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] after the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984. As would be the case two years later at the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympic Games]], the issue was settled in favour of the Americans led by [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]]. [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]] completely dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning all the editions that took place in this decade (1990, 1994, 1998), led by such players as [[Lorenzo Bernardi]] and [[Andrea Giani]].\n\nIn the 2000s, [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] became the leading force in the sport, winning three consecutive editions (2002, 2006 and 2010), the first of which in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the same stage where the Brazilians had been runners-up in 1982. In 2014, [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], playing in home, defeated [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in 4 sets at the final achieving their second gold medal and preventing what would be a historical fourth title in a row.\n\nAs of 2014, 18 editions of the men's Volleyball World Championship have been played: 14 went to European teams, and four to [[Americas|American]] teams (three times to [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] and once to [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]]).\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB

Poffo grew up in [[Downers Grove, Illinois]], and currently resides in [[Clearwater, Florida]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===All-South Wrestling Alliance (1974)===\nLanny Poffo made his debut in 1974, losing to [[Wayne Cowan]] in the opening match of a [[All-South Wrestling Alliance]] card held in Atlanta, GA on April 16th.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=21614</ref> The young rookie remained in the promotion for several months, defeating Cowan in a rematch and also gaining a win over [[The Great Fuji]]. At a card on July 9th, 1974 in Atlanta he teamed with his father Angelo Poffo for the first time, defeating the veteran team [[The Royal Kangaroos]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=1200</ref>\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance (1974 - 1978)===\nStill in his rookie year, Poffo and his father then headed to [[Big Time Wrestling (Detroit)|Big Time Wrestling]], one of the varied promotions affiliated with the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] at that time. In their initial match with BTW, Lanny and Angelo lost by disqualification to [[Lou Thesz]] and [[Mighty Igor]] on November 30th, 1974 at a house show in Detroit, MI.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=216344</ref> They quickly began a house show series against the team of [[Bobo Brazil]] and [[Fred Curry (wrestler)|Fred Curry]]. The two wrestled as heels, with Angelo Poffo wearing a graduation gown and cap that was similar to the attire that Lanny would one day adopt in the WWF.<ref>https://webzoom.freewebs.com/icwpoffouniverse/Angelo%20Graduate%20with%20Lanny%202.jpg</ref> That year they won the [[NWA World Tag-Team Championship]],<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=5&nr=3661</ref> and the father/son duo held it until 1975 with successful defenses over [[The Mongols]] and Brazil & Curry.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=1100</ref> While still tag-team champions, the Poffos moved on to [[NWA St. Louis]] and continued to defend their championship. In 1975 they lost the titles and then returned to Big Time Wrestling.\n\n1976 found Lanny wrestling primarily in singles matches, both in BTW, [[NWA Western States]], and NWA St Louis. On May 29th, 1976 Lanny received his first shot at the [[NWA World Heavyweight Title]], losing a televised match to [[Terry Funk]] on NWA St Louis [[Wrestling at the Chase]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=187364</ref> He would go on to defeat wrestlers such as [[Don Red Cloud]], [[Raoul Guzman]], and [[Gary Fulton]]. Lanny moved to [[Jim Crockett]]'s [[Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] in July 1976, and for the first time began teaming with his brother '''Randy Poffo'''([[Randy Savage]]). The Poffo Brothers immediately began touring on the MACW house show circuit, defeating such teams as [[Johnny Eagle]] & [[Manuel Soto]] and [[Danny Miller (wrestler)|Danny Miller]] & [[Johnny Weaver]] and continued to wrestle together for the remainder of the year.\n\nWith his brother Randy having departed MACW after February, Lanny proceeded into 1977 as a singles wrestler once more. After gaining victories over [[George Rossi]], [[Herb Gallant]], and [[Leroy Rochester]], Poffo gained another shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship when he faced off against [[Harley Race]] at an event in Chattanooga, TN on February 4th, 1978. This time Lanny was able to wrestle the champion to a draw.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=215676</ref>\n\n===Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling (1978)===\nIn April 1978 he moved on to [[Emile Dupr\u00e9e]]'s \"Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling\" which had a weekly television spot on ATV and toured the Maritimes doing shows seven days per week with some days hosting two shows in two different towns. That year became the first ever AGPW International Heavyweight Champion.<ref name=\"cagematch.net\">https://www.cagematch.net/?id=5&nr=4061</ref> On May 23, 1978 he wrestled his brother (now known as Randy Savage) for the very first time, defeating him by disqualification at an event held in Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada. Savage would later defeat his brother for the title, and the two would trade the championship in 1978 and 1979.<ref name=\"cagematch.net\"/> On July 18th, 1978 Lanny challenged his brother for the AGPW International Championship for a final time, wrestling him to a draw at a show in Hartland, New Brunswick, Canada.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=217803</ref>\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance (1978 - 1979)===\nLanny Poffo next moved to NWA affiliate [[Portland Championship Wrestling]] and made his debut on November 16, 1979 when he wrestled Kurt von Steiger to a draw at an event in Portland, OR. Poffo faced a variety of opponents in PNW, including [[Adrian Adonis]], [[Hiro Ota]], and [[Tully Blanchard]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=1000</ref> On February 22, 1979 he unsuccessfully challenged PNW Heavyweight Champion [[Roddy Piper]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=97466</ref> Following a defeat to [[Gene Kiniski]] the next month, he departed the promotion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=900</ref>\n\n===International Championship Wrestling (1979 - 1984)===\nIn 1978 Lanny's father Angelo founded [[International Championship Wrestling]] (ICW), a rival to NWA affiliates [[Southeastern Championship Wrestling]] and NWA [[Mid America]]. Eventually Angelo would further expand and began signing talent away from the [[World Wrestling Association]] and [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), forming a strong rivalry with the other territories. It was into the maelstrom that Lanny Poffo entered in the summer of 1979 as he jumped to his father's promotion. He became a star in ICW and eventually became the promotion's champion, where he wrestled with and against Randy Savage. The two brothers dominated the ICW Heavyweight Championship, and over the next six years the only other wrestler to hold it was [[Paul Christy]]. Lanny would remain a mainstay of the promotion until it folded in 1984.<ref name=\"nzpwi.co.nz\">[http://www.nzpwi.co.nz/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1410&Itemid=71 Remembering...Lanny Poffo/The Genius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016080907/http://www.nzpwi.co.nz/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1410&Itemid=71 |date=2008-10-16 }}</ref>\n\n===Mid-South Wrestling (1984)===\nShortly before the dissolution of ICW, Lanny began making appearances in [[Bill Watts]]' [[Mid South Wrestling]]. His first matches came on October 12th, 1983 when he defeated [[Art Crews]] and [[Doug Vines]] at a MSW television taping in Shreveport, LA.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In December he formed a team with [[Rick Rude]] and began a house show series with [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] that carried through January 1984. Lanny then moved back into singles competition and wrestled [[Buddy Landell]] in numerous matches.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=800</ref>\n\n===Continental Wrestling Association (1984 - 1985)===\nOn June 18th, 1984 Lanny joined his brother Randy Savage who had jumped to the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), defeating [[Bart Batten]] & [[Johnny Wilhoit]] at an event in Memphis, TN. They almost immediately entered into a feud with [[The Rock n Roll Express]], a series that lasted throughout the summer. On October 1, 1984 he unsuccessfully challenged CWA International Heavyweight Champion [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]]. That winter Poffo and Savage moved on to a house show series against Gilbert and [[Tommy Rich]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In January 1985 they entered a tournament to crown the AWA Southern Tag-Team Champions, but were defeated by [[The Interns (professional wrestling)|The Interns]] in the semi-finals.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=143129</ref> In the spring they began a feud with AWA Southern Champions [[The Fabulous Ones]], but were unable to capture the titles. In June 1984 his brother departed for the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), and Lanny was soon signed to a contract there as well.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1985\u20131992)===\n====\"Leaping Lanny\"====\nPoffo jumped to the burgeoning World Wrestling Federation and made his debut on July 13th episode of [[WWF Championship Wrestling]]. Teaming with [[Pedro Morales]], the duo defeated [[JA Rizzo]] and [[Barry O]] in a match taped in Poughkeepsie, NY. Although both brothers made appearances at the same point, the brother angle was never worked in the WWF and the relationship was never mentioned on-air. While Lanny was not a headlining WWF star like his brother, he initially built a niche for himself wrestling as a babyface. In his first role as '''Leaping Lanny Poffo''', he would bring frisbees to the ring, read a short poem written on one of them that he himself had penned, and then throw the frisbees into the crowd.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite book|title=[[WWE Encyclopedia]]|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/182 182]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}</ref> Each poem typically ridiculed the [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] who he was about to wrestle, or built [[heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] in favor of the [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] with whom the heel was feuding at the time.\n\nLanny was initially undefeated in WWF competition, rolling off victories against [[Dangerous Danny Davis|Mr. X]], [[Rene Goulet]], [[Terry Gibbs]], Barry O, and [[Moondog Spot]]. However he suffered his first defeat on July 27th edition of Chanmpionship Wrestling, teaming with Keith Diamond in a loss to [[The Iron Sheik]] and [[Nikolai Volkoff]]. This presages a series of losses to [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Big John Studd]], and [[The Missing Link (wrestler)|The Missing Link]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm</ref> During his early career in the WWF, he was not a main-eventer and wrestled primarily as enhancement talent on television shows. However, rather than being [[Squash match|squashed]] like most [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobbers]] at the time, he displayed a greater amount of offense in his matches. He found great success on house shows, where he continued to defeat other undercard wrestlers. Poffo performed an agile, athletic, high-flying style at a time when big, heavy power wrestlers still dominated the promotion. He was one of the first wrestlers in North America to use moves like the Senton Bomb and the [[moonsault]],<ref name=Encyclopedia/> though the announcers of the time referred to the latter as a \"leaping backflip\".\n\nHe made his first [[Saturday Night's Main Event]] appearance on October 5th, 1985 when he recited a poem at the wedding of [[Uncle Elmer]]. Entering 1986 he continued to be highly competitive against lower-level opposition, reeling off considerable house show or televised victories against Terry Gibbs, Barry O, Rene Goulet, [[Tiger Chung Lee]] and [[SD Jones]]. However he remained less successful against the upper tier of the roster and sustained losses to [[Hercules]], and [[Jim Neidhart]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/86.htm</ref> Lanny attained some infamy in late 1986 and early 1987 by competing in a series of [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)#Bunkhouse Stampede|Bunkhouse Battle Royals]] in full knight's armor.<ref name=\"nzpwi.co.nz\"/> He also is noted for competing in a Battle Royal on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event X]]'' at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]] in 1987, where he was headbutted and eliminated by [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], causing him to bleed heavily all over the floor and have to be carried out on a [[stretcher]]. Andr\u00e9, in his first televised match as a heel, had accidentally caught Poffo on the bridge of the nose with his headbutt and stitches were required to close the resulting wound.\n\nOn February 1987 he helped to participate in another famous angle, teaming with The Can-Am Connection in a match against Adorable Adrian Adonis & The Dream Team. During the match, Adonis accidentally cut the hair of Brutus Beefcake - an angle that would ultimately lead to the latter's face turn and assumption of \"The Barber\" gimmick. Poffo and the Can-Ams won this WWF Superstars of Wrestling match by disqualification.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm</ref>\n\nIn January 1988 Lanny defeated [[Sika Anoa\u02bbi|Sika]] the Savage Samoan on a series of upsets, and during the following month he began a lengthy house show series with the newly heel-turned [[Dan Spivey]]. Poffo continued to receive a strong push against lower level competition like [[Barry Horowitz]], but was unable to break through as a top tier member of the roster. He entered a house show series with Jim Neidhart following the temporary dissolution of The Hart Foundation, but was unsuccessful in these contests. His fortunes changed somewhat later in the summer when he feuded with \"Dangerous\" Danny Davis on the house show circuit, pinning David on multiple occasions. Entering the fall of 1988 he faced numerous preliminary opponents and embarked on a lengthy winning streak, defeating [[Barry Horowitz]], [[Sandy Beach]], and [[George Skaaland]]. He continued to compete against opening card talent for the remainder of the year and was largely successful.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm</ref>\n\nHowever as he entered 1989 his fortunes began to wane. Poffo began the year with a loss to Iron Mike Sharpe at a house show on January 1st in West Palm Beach, FL, and this was followed by a televised defeat on January 13th in Boston, MA to The Brooklyn Brawler. After a smattering of wins, he then lost to [[Conquistador#1]] on February 20th, 1989 in Worcester, MA. These were followed by a pair of defeats to Tim Horner in March 1989. Now approaching his fourth anniversary of his WWF tenure, Lanny Poffo found himself at a career crossroads.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe.com\">http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm</ref>\n\n====\"The Genius\"====\n\nOn March 18, 1989, still known as \"Leaping Lanny\", Poffo turned heel. He berated the local Boston sports teams, insulting them in his poetry, and instantly drew heat from the Boston crowd. Poffo was subsequently re-introduced as '''The Genius''', a highly intelligent,<ref name=Encyclopedia/> arrogant heel who wore an academic cap and gown to the ring. After weeks of giving poetry as The Genius, he had his debut against Sonny Rodgers and defeated him.<ref>{{Citation|last=SnakesSuck|title=The Genuis all 5 promos and first match as The Genuis vs jobber, WWF 1989|date=2019-07-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAMC1lDdHds|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> His poems now ridiculed the face wrestlers, and he adopted an exaggerated effeminate, showboating manner, similar to that employed by [[Gorgeous George]], to draw heat from the crowd. During his matches, the Genius would often write a mathematical equation on a clipboard that would \"tilt the balance of the match in his favor\". Poffo began a house show series against [[Jim Powers]] that spring and embarked on a lengthy winning streak. That summer who moved on to feud with Powers' former [[The Young Stallions]] partner [[Paul Roma]] and was also victorious. His first pinfall loss under his new heel persona finally came on August 12th, when he was defeated by [[Koko B. Ware]] at a house show in Richfield, OH.\n\nAside from the one untelevised loss, Poffo remained undefeated. He was featured on [[WWF Superstars]] during the coronation of Randy Savage as the new \"King of the WWF\"; Lanny read the proclamation for his real-life brother. He continued to win in his house show series with Koko B Ware and at the same time began to serve as \"executive consultant\" (and occasional tag team partner) for [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]].<ref name=\"oklafan.com\">[http://www.oklafan.com/news/760/article.html Lanny Poffo Interview Recap from WrestlingEpicenter.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402085523/http://www.oklafan.com/news/760/article.html |date=2012-04-02 }}</ref>\n\nOn the November 25, 1989 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXIV]]'', The Genius faced [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]] and spent much of the match taunting Hogan and drawing heat from the crowd with his absurd antics. Several minutes into the match, Mr. Perfect appeared at ringside where he goaded Hogan and defaced the championship belt by sticking chewing gum on it. Poffo then tricked Hogan into following him outside the ring, resulting in Mr. Perfect striking Hogan with the championship belt and Poffo climbing back into the ring to win the match by countout. Later in the show, Mr. Perfect and Poffo destroyed the stolen belt with a hammer. This marked the first time in several years that Hogan had sustained any form of defeat on WWF television.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe.com\"/>\n\nPoffo entered 1990 firmly entrenched as a main roster player. He suffered his first televised defeat when he teamed with Mr. Perfect in a losing effort against WWF World Champion Hulk Hogan and Intercontinental Champion [[The Ultimate Warrior]] on the January 29th episode of [[Prime Time Wrestling]]. That winter he entered a house show series against [[Jim Neidhart]] and was generally victorious here as well. Poffo made his first PPV appearance at the [[1990 Royal Rumble]] and wrestled [[Brutus Beefcake]] to a double disqualification after \"The Barber\" began cutting his hair and Hennig interfered.\n\nIn March his momentum began to cool as Poffo began suffering house show defeats to Jim Neidhart. He also teamed with Hennig in losing efforts against Hulk Hogan and various partners. At [[WrestleMania VI]] he had his hair cut by Brutus Beefcake after Mr. Perfect was pinned; backstage Randy Savage was legitimately irate over not being informed of the angle. Shortly after [[WrestleMania VI]], [[Bobby Heenan]] became Mr. Perfect's manager. In the meantime Poffo was programmed into a feud with Brutus Beefcake and took to wearing wigs and amateur wrestling headgear to cover the haircut that \"The Barber\" had given him.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm</ref>\n\nBy the summer of 1990 Poffo had lost his feud with Beefcake and started to move back down the card. In June he renewed his house show series with Koko B. Ware; this time \"The Birdman\" dominated on shows around the country. The feud continued through the summer and achieved national visibility on the August 27th, 1990 edition of Prime Time, where Ware defeated The Genius on television. Poffo made a guest appearance on the OCtober 13, 1990 episode of [[Saturday Night's Main Event XXVIII]], participating in Oktoberfest activities along with [[The Hart Foundation]], \n[[Jim Duggan]], [[Mr. Fuji]], and [[The Orient Express]]. That winter he engaged in opening match contests with [[Dustin Rhodes]], [[Shane Douglas]] and [[Jim Brunzell]].\n\nAfter being on sabbatical for several months, Poffo returned with a flurry in April 1991, wrestling Greg Valentine, Jim Duggan, and Bret Hart. He also participated in the joint WWF/[[Super World of Sports|SWS]] tour and faced Jim Powers on each show. On June 26th, 1991 he scored a major upset victory in his comeback when he defeated Jim Duggan at a house show in Lansing, MI. On the September 7th, 1991 edition of WWF Superstars he became the manager of [[The Beverly Brothers]] ([[Mike Enos]] and [[Wayne Bloom]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Unlike during his time as manager of Hennig, Poffo generally remained on the sidelines for much of the remainder of 1991 and wrestled very sporadically.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm</ref>\n\nIn December 1991 Poffo teamed with The Beverly Brothers in six-man matches against The [[Bushwhackers]] and Jim Neidhart. In the [[1992 Royal Rumble]] the Genius managed The Beverly Brothers to a win over The Bushwhackers. He also continued to occasionally wrestle, and picked up a televised win over [[Brian Costello]] on the July 6th episode of Prime Time Wrestling and wrestled house show matches against Jim Brunzell, [[Virgil]], and [[Bob Bradley]]. On the August 28th edition of Prime Time, he teamed with the Beverly Brothers in a unsuccessful effort against [[The Legion of Doom]] and [[Paul Ellering]]. At [[SummerSlam 92]] Poffo's charges were thwarted in their challenge of [[The Natural Disasters]] for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]]; he continued to manage them until making his final appearance at the [[1992 Survivor Series]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm</ref>\n\n===Independent Circuit (1993 - 1994)===\n\nAfter a six month break, Poffo returned to action in June 1993 and joined [[World Wrestling Superstars]] on a tour of Germany where he was matched against [[Demolition Ax]]. He would work later that year for the [[International Championship Wrestling Alliance]] and wrestled [[Manny Fernandez (wrestler)|Manny Fernandez]], [[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Jeff Bradley]], and [[Brutus Beefcake]]. In December 1993 he appeared for [[Andvil Promotions]] and Johnny West, [[B. Brian Blair]], and [[Al Hardimon]]. In March 12, 1994 he traveled to Brantford, CT to face [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4</ref>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1994)===\n\nAfter a nineteen-month absence, Poffo returned in May 1994 and defeated [[Koko B. Ware]] on two house shows in Florida. His final WWF match was a loss to [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] on June 11 at an event in Richmond, Virginia.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref>\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20131999)===\nPoffo signed a [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] contract in 1995, but may have wrestled only once during his time there (two sites record him as having defeated a preliminary wrestler in a dark match at a [[WCW Saturday Night]] taping on October 14, 1997 in Ft Myers, FL).<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw97.htm</ref><ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=117591</ref> In a later shoot interview, Poffo explained that he was contacted by his brother (Randy Savage), who was wrestling in WCW at the time, with the guarantee of a contract. Savage, who had purchased the [[Gorgeous George]] gimmick, offered the character to Poffo, feeling that his brother would generate heat as a heel. Poffo signed the contract with WCW, began an intense training regimen, and bleached his hair blonde in preparation for his return to the ring. However, as he recalled, despite being under contract for five years and receiving regular paychecks, he was never contacted with any bookings. His own repeated calls to the office went unreturned, and he was simply never used by WCW. Ultimately, Savage gave the Gorgeous George moniker to his then-girlfriend and valet [[Stephanie Bellars]].\n\n=== Independent circuit (2005\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Lanny Poffo vs. Koko B.

The two wrestled as heels, with Angelo Poffo wearing a graduation gown and cap that was similar to the attire that Lanny would one day adopt in the WWF.<ref>https://webzoom.freewebs.com/icwpoffouniverse/Angelo%20Graduate%20with%20Lanny%202.jpg</ref> That year they won the [[NWA World Tag-Team Championship]],<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=5&nr=3661</ref> and the father/son duo held it until 1975 with successful defenses over [[The Mongols]] and Brazil & Curry.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=1100</ref> While still tag-team champions, the Poffos moved on to [[NWA St. Louis]] and continued to defend their championship. In 1975 they lost the titles and then returned to Big Time Wrestling.\n\n1976 found Lanny wrestling primarily in singles matches, both in BTW, [[NWA Western States]], and NWA St Louis. On May 29th, 1976 Lanny received his first shot at the [[NWA World Heavyweight Title]], losing a televised match to [[Terry Funk]] on NWA St Louis [[Wrestling at the Chase]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=187364</ref> He would go on to defeat wrestlers such as [[Don Red Cloud]], [[Raoul Guzman]], and [[Gary Fulton]]. Lanny moved to [[Jim Crockett]]'s [[Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] in July 1976, and for the first time began teaming with his brother '''Randy Poffo'''([[Randy Savage]]). The Poffo Brothers immediately began touring on the MACW house show circuit, defeating such teams as [[Johnny Eagle]] & [[Manuel Soto]] and [[Danny Miller (wrestler)|Danny Miller]] & [[Johnny Weaver]] and continued to wrestle together for the remainder of the year.\n\nWith his brother Randy having departed MACW after February, Lanny proceeded into 1977 as a singles wrestler once more. After gaining victories over [[George Rossi]], [[Herb Gallant]], and [[Leroy Rochester]], Poffo gained another shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship when he faced off against [[Harley Race]] at an event in Chattanooga, TN on February 4th, 1978. This time Lanny was able to wrestle the champion to a draw.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=215676</ref>\n\n===Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling (1978)===\nIn April 1978 he moved on to [[Emile Dupr\u00e9e]]'s \"Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling\" which had a weekly television spot on ATV and toured the Maritimes doing shows seven days per week with some days hosting two shows in two different towns. That year became the first ever AGPW International Heavyweight Champion.<ref name=\"cagematch.net\">https://www.cagematch.net/?id=5&nr=4061</ref> On May 23, 1978 he wrestled his brother (now known as Randy Savage) for the very first time, defeating him by disqualification at an event held in Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada. Savage would later defeat his brother for the title, and the two would trade the championship in 1978 and 1979.<ref name=\"cagematch.net\"/> On July 18th, 1978 Lanny challenged his brother for the AGPW International Championship for a final time, wrestling him to a draw at a show in Hartland, New Brunswick, Canada.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=217803</ref>\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance (1978 - 1979)===\nLanny Poffo next moved to NWA affiliate [[Portland Championship Wrestling]] and made his debut on November 16, 1979 when he wrestled Kurt von Steiger to a draw at an event in Portland, OR. Poffo faced a variety of opponents in PNW, including [[Adrian Adonis]], [[Hiro Ota]], and [[Tully Blanchard]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=1000</ref> On February 22, 1979 he unsuccessfully challenged PNW Heavyweight Champion [[Roddy Piper]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=97466</ref> Following a defeat to [[Gene Kiniski]] the next month, he departed the promotion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=900</ref>\n\n===International Championship Wrestling (1979 - 1984)===\nIn 1978 Lanny's father Angelo founded [[International Championship Wrestling]] (ICW), a rival to NWA affiliates [[Southeastern Championship Wrestling]] and NWA [[Mid America]]. Eventually Angelo would further expand and began signing talent away from the [[World Wrestling Association]] and [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), forming a strong rivalry with the other territories. It was into the maelstrom that Lanny Poffo entered in the summer of 1979 as he jumped to his father's promotion. He became a star in ICW and eventually became the promotion's champion, where he wrestled with and against Randy Savage. The two brothers dominated the ICW Heavyweight Championship, and over the next six years the only other wrestler to hold it was [[Paul Christy]]. Lanny would remain a mainstay of the promotion until it folded in 1984.<ref name=\"nzpwi.co.nz\">[http://www.nzpwi.co.nz/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1410&Itemid=71 Remembering...Lanny Poffo/The Genius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016080907/http://www.nzpwi.co.nz/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1410&Itemid=71 |date=2008-10-16 }}</ref>\n\n===Mid-South Wrestling (1984)===\nShortly before the dissolution of ICW, Lanny began making appearances in [[Bill Watts]]' [[Mid South Wrestling]]. His first matches came on October 12th, 1983 when he defeated [[Art Crews]] and [[Doug Vines]] at a MSW television taping in Shreveport, LA.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In December he formed a team with [[Rick Rude]] and began a house show series with [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] that carried through January 1984. Lanny then moved back into singles competition and wrestled [[Buddy Landell]] in numerous matches.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4&s=800</ref>\n\n===Continental Wrestling Association (1984 - 1985)===\nOn June 18th, 1984 Lanny joined his brother Randy Savage who had jumped to the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA), defeating [[Bart Batten]] & [[Johnny Wilhoit]] at an event in Memphis, TN. They almost immediately entered into a feud with [[The Rock n Roll Express]], a series that lasted throughout the summer. On October 1, 1984 he unsuccessfully challenged CWA International Heavyweight Champion [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]]. That winter Poffo and Savage moved on to a house show series against Gilbert and [[Tommy Rich]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In January 1985 they entered a tournament to crown the AWA Southern Tag-Team Champions, but were defeated by [[The Interns (professional wrestling)|The Interns]] in the semi-finals.<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=143129</ref> In the spring they began a feud with AWA Southern Champions [[The Fabulous Ones]], but were unable to capture the titles. In June 1984 his brother departed for the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), and Lanny was soon signed to a contract there as well.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1985\u20131992)===\n====\"Leaping Lanny\"====\nPoffo jumped to the burgeoning World Wrestling Federation and made his debut on July 13th episode of [[WWF Championship Wrestling]]. Teaming with [[Pedro Morales]], the duo defeated [[JA Rizzo]] and [[Barry O]] in a match taped in Poughkeepsie, NY. Although both brothers made appearances at the same point, the brother angle was never worked in the WWF and the relationship was never mentioned on-air. While Lanny was not a headlining WWF star like his brother, he initially built a niche for himself wrestling as a babyface. In his first role as '''Leaping Lanny Poffo''', he would bring frisbees to the ring, read a short poem written on one of them that he himself had penned, and then throw the frisbees into the crowd.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite book|title=[[WWE Encyclopedia]]|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/182 182]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}</ref> Each poem typically ridiculed the [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] who he was about to wrestle, or built [[heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] in favor of the [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] with whom the heel was feuding at the time.\n\nLanny was initially undefeated in WWF competition, rolling off victories against [[Dangerous Danny Davis|Mr. X]], [[Rene Goulet]], [[Terry Gibbs]], Barry O, and [[Moondog Spot]]. However he suffered his first defeat on July 27th edition of Chanmpionship Wrestling, teaming with Keith Diamond in a loss to [[The Iron Sheik]] and [[Nikolai Volkoff]]. This presages a series of losses to [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Big John Studd]], and [[The Missing Link (wrestler)|The Missing Link]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm</ref> During his early career in the WWF, he was not a main-eventer and wrestled primarily as enhancement talent on television shows. However, rather than being [[Squash match|squashed]] like most [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobbers]] at the time, he displayed a greater amount of offense in his matches. He found great success on house shows, where he continued to defeat other undercard wrestlers. Poffo performed an agile, athletic, high-flying style at a time when big, heavy power wrestlers still dominated the promotion. He was one of the first wrestlers in North America to use moves like the Senton Bomb and the [[moonsault]],<ref name=Encyclopedia/> though the announcers of the time referred to the latter as a \"leaping backflip\".\n\nHe made his first [[Saturday Night's Main Event]] appearance on October 5th, 1985 when he recited a poem at the wedding of [[Uncle Elmer]]. Entering 1986 he continued to be highly competitive against lower-level opposition, reeling off considerable house show or televised victories against Terry Gibbs, Barry O, Rene Goulet, [[Tiger Chung Lee]] and [[SD Jones]]. However he remained less successful against the upper tier of the roster and sustained losses to [[Hercules]], and [[Jim Neidhart]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/86.htm</ref> Lanny attained some infamy in late 1986 and early 1987 by competing in a series of [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)#Bunkhouse Stampede|Bunkhouse Battle Royals]] in full knight's armor.<ref name=\"nzpwi.co.nz\"/> He also is noted for competing in a Battle Royal on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event X]]'' at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]] in 1987, where he was headbutted and eliminated by [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], causing him to bleed heavily all over the floor and have to be carried out on a [[stretcher]]. Andr\u00e9, in his first televised match as a heel, had accidentally caught Poffo on the bridge of the nose with his headbutt and stitches were required to close the resulting wound.\n\nOn February 1987 he helped to participate in another famous angle, teaming with The Can-Am Connection in a match against Adorable Adrian Adonis & The Dream Team. During the match, Adonis accidentally cut the hair of Brutus Beefcake - an angle that would ultimately lead to the latter's face turn and assumption of \"The Barber\" gimmick. Poffo and the Can-Ams won this WWF Superstars of Wrestling match by disqualification.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm</ref>\n\nIn January 1988 Lanny defeated [[Sika Anoa\u02bbi|Sika]] the Savage Samoan on a series of upsets, and during the following month he began a lengthy house show series with the newly heel-turned [[Dan Spivey]]. Poffo continued to receive a strong push against lower level competition like [[Barry Horowitz]], but was unable to break through as a top tier member of the roster. He entered a house show series with Jim Neidhart following the temporary dissolution of The Hart Foundation, but was unsuccessful in these contests. His fortunes changed somewhat later in the summer when he feuded with \"Dangerous\" Danny Davis on the house show circuit, pinning David on multiple occasions. Entering the fall of 1988 he faced numerous preliminary opponents and embarked on a lengthy winning streak, defeating [[Barry Horowitz]], [[Sandy Beach]], and [[George Skaaland]]. He continued to compete against opening card talent for the remainder of the year and was largely successful.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm</ref>\n\nHowever as he entered 1989 his fortunes began to wane. Poffo began the year with a loss to Iron Mike Sharpe at a house show on January 1st in West Palm Beach, FL, and this was followed by a televised defeat on January 13th in Boston, MA to The Brooklyn Brawler. After a smattering of wins, he then lost to [[Conquistador#1]] on February 20th, 1989 in Worcester, MA. These were followed by a pair of defeats to Tim Horner in March 1989. Now approaching his fourth anniversary of his WWF tenure, Lanny Poffo found himself at a career crossroads.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe.com\">http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm</ref>\n\n====\"The Genius\"====\n\nOn March 18, 1989, still known as \"Leaping Lanny\", Poffo turned heel. He berated the local Boston sports teams, insulting them in his poetry, and instantly drew heat from the Boston crowd. Poffo was subsequently re-introduced as '''The Genius''', a highly intelligent,<ref name=Encyclopedia/> arrogant heel who wore an academic cap and gown to the ring. After weeks of giving poetry as The Genius, he had his debut against Sonny Rodgers and defeated him.<ref>{{Citation|last=SnakesSuck|title=The Genuis all 5 promos and first match as The Genuis vs jobber, WWF 1989|date=2019-07-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAMC1lDdHds|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> His poems now ridiculed the face wrestlers, and he adopted an exaggerated effeminate, showboating manner, similar to that employed by [[Gorgeous George]], to draw heat from the crowd. During his matches, the Genius would often write a mathematical equation on a clipboard that would \"tilt the balance of the match in his favor\". Poffo began a house show series against [[Jim Powers]] that spring and embarked on a lengthy winning streak. That summer who moved on to feud with Powers' former [[The Young Stallions]] partner [[Paul Roma]] and was also victorious. His first pinfall loss under his new heel persona finally came on August 12th, when he was defeated by [[Koko B. Ware]] at a house show in Richfield, OH.\n\nAside from the one untelevised loss, Poffo remained undefeated. He was featured on [[WWF Superstars]] during the coronation of Randy Savage as the new \"King of the WWF\"; Lanny read the proclamation for his real-life brother. He continued to win in his house show series with Koko B Ware and at the same time began to serve as \"executive consultant\" (and occasional tag team partner) for [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]].<ref name=\"oklafan.com\">[http://www.oklafan.com/news/760/article.html Lanny Poffo Interview Recap from WrestlingEpicenter.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402085523/http://www.oklafan.com/news/760/article.html |date=2012-04-02 }}</ref>\n\nOn the November 25, 1989 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXIV]]'', The Genius faced [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]] and spent much of the match taunting Hogan and drawing heat from the crowd with his absurd antics. Several minutes into the match, Mr. Perfect appeared at ringside where he goaded Hogan and defaced the championship belt by sticking chewing gum on it. Poffo then tricked Hogan into following him outside the ring, resulting in Mr. Perfect striking Hogan with the championship belt and Poffo climbing back into the ring to win the match by countout. Later in the show, Mr. Perfect and Poffo destroyed the stolen belt with a hammer. This marked the first time in several years that Hogan had sustained any form of defeat on WWF television.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe.com\"/>\n\nPoffo entered 1990 firmly entrenched as a main roster player. He suffered his first televised defeat when he team with Mr. Perfect in a losing effort against WWF World Champion Hulk Hogan and Intercontinental Champion [[The Ultimate Warrior]] on the January 29th episode of [[Prime Time Wrestling]]. That winter he entered a house show series against [[Jim Neidhart]] and was generally victorious here as well. Poffo made his first PPV appearance at the [[1990 Royal Rumble]] and wrestled [[Brutus Beefcake]] to a double disqualification after \"The Barber\" began cutting his hair and Hennig interfered.\n\nIn March his momentum began to cool as Poffo began suffering house show defeats to Jim Neidhart. He also teamed with Hennig in losing efforts against Hulk Hogan and various partners. At [[WrestleMania VI]] he had his hair cut by Brutus Beefcake after Mr. Perfect was pinned; backstage Randy Savage was legitimately irate over not being informed of the angle. Shortly after [[WrestleMania VI]], [[Bobby Heenan]] became Mr. Perfect's manager. In the meantime Poffo was programmed into a feud with Brutus Beefcake and took to wearing wigs and amateur wrestling headgear to cover the haircut that \"The Barber\" had given him.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm</ref>\n\nBy the summer of 1990 Poffo had lost his feud with Beefcake and started to move back down the card. In June he renewed his house show series with Koko B. Ware; this time \"The Birdman\" dominated on shows around the country. The feud continued through the summer and achieved national visibility on the August 27th, 1990 edition of Prime Time, where Ware defeated The Genius on television. Poffo made a guest appearance on the OCtober 13, 1990 episode of [[Saturday Night's Main Event XXVIII]], participating in Oktoberfest activities along with [[The Hart Foundation]], \n[[Jim Duggan]], [[Mr. Fuji]], and [[The Orient Express]]. That winter he engaged in opening match contests with [[Dustin Rhodes]], [[Shane Douglas]] and [[Jim Brunzell]].\n\nAfter being on sabbatical for several months, Poffo returned with a flurry in April 1991, wrestling Greg Valentine, Jim Duggan, and Bret Hart. He also participated in the joint WWF/[[Super World of Sports|SWS]] tour and faced Jim Powers on each show. On June 26th, 1991 he scored a major upset victory in his comeback when he defeated Jim Duggan at a house show in Lansing, MI. On the September 7th, 1991 edition of WWF Superstars he became the manager of [[The Beverly Brothers]] ([[Mike Enos]] and [[Wayne Bloom]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Unlike during his time as manager of Hennig, Poffo generally remained on the sidelines for much of the remainder of 1991 and wrestled very sporadically.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm</ref>\n\nIn December 1991 Poffo teamed with The Beverly Brothers in six-man matches against The [[Bushwhackers]] and Jim Neidhart. In the [[1992 Royal Rumble]] the Genius managed The Beverly Brothers to a win over The Bushwhackers. He also continued to occasionally wrestle, and picked up a televised win over [[Brian Costello]] on the July 6th episode of Prime Time Wrestling and wrestled house show matches against Jim Brunzell, [[Virgil]], and [[Bob Bradley]]. On the August 28th edition of Prime Time, he teamed with the Beverly Brothers in a unsuccessful effort against [[The Legion of Doom]] and [[Paul Ellering]]. At [[SummerSlam 92]] Poffo's charges were thwarted in their challenge of [[The Natural Disasters]] for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]]; he continued to manage them until making his final appearance at the [[1992 Survivor Series]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm</ref>\n\n===Independent Circuit (1993 - 1994)===\n\nAfter a six month break, Poffo returned to action in June 1993 and joined [[World Wrestling Superstars]] on a tour of Germany where he was matched against [[Demolition Ax]]. He would work later that year for the [[International Championship Wrestling Alliance]] and wrestled [[Manny Fernandez (wrestler)|Manny Fernandez]], [[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Jeff Bradley]], and [[Brutus Beefcake]]. In December 1993 he appeared for [[Andvil Promotions]] and Johnny West, [[B. Brian Blair]], and [[Al Hardimon]]. In March 12, 1994 he traveled to Brantford, CT to face [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]].<ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=2355&page=4</ref>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1994)===\n\nAfter a nineteen-month absence, Poffo returned in May 1994 and defeated [[Koko B. Ware]] on two house shows in Florida. His final WWF match was a loss to [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] on June 11 at an event in Richmond, Virginia.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref>\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20131999)===\nPoffo signed a [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] contract in 1995, but may have wrestled only once during his time there (two sites record him as having defeated a preliminary wrestler in a dark match at a [[WCW Saturday Night]] taping on October 14, 1997 in Ft Myers, FL).<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw97.htm</ref><ref>https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=117591</ref> In a later shoot interview, Poffo explained that he was contacted by his brother (Randy Savage), who was wrestling in WCW at the time, with the guarantee of a contract. Savage, who had purchased the [[Gorgeous George]] gimmick, offered the character to Poffo, feeling that his brother would generate heat as a heel. Poffo signed the contract with WCW, began an intense training regimen, and bleached his hair blonde in preparation for his return to the ring. However, as he recalled, despite being under contract for five years and receiving regular paychecks, he was never contacted with any bookings. His own repeated calls to the office went unreturned, and he was simply never used by WCW. Ultimately, Savage gave the Gorgeous George moniker to his then-girlfriend and valet [[Stephanie Bellars]].\n\n=== Independent circuit (2005\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Lanny Poffo vs. Koko B.

On 1 November 1956 Travancore-Cochin was joined with Malabar District of Madras State, the taluk of [[Kasaragod]] and [[South Kanara]] to form the new state of [[Kerala]].\n\nAfter the first ever elections to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957, the [[Communist Party of India]] emerged as the single largest party. [[E M S Namboodiripad]] formed the first elected government with the support of 5 independent legislators. The government was not able to complete its full 5 years term. The Communist-led government collapsed as a consequence of the movement known as the ''[[Vimochana Samaram]]'' (Liberation Struggle). The Communist government was dismissed on 31 July 1959 and  President's rule was imposed in the state, under [[Article 356]] of the constitution. Fresh Elections were held in 1960 and Pattom A. Thanu Pillai became the second Chief Minister of Kerala, as head of a PSP-Congress coalition administration.<ref name=GovtKerala/> He assumed office on 22 February 1960. However, he resigned as chief minister of Kerala on 26 September 1962 to make way for [[R. Sankar]] of the Indian National Congress as the next Chief Minister of the state. He was appointed as Governor of Punjab on 1 October 1962 by the Central Government headed by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Later he became Governor of [[Andhra Pradesh]] on 4 May 1964 and remained in office till 11 April 1968.<ref name=GovtKerala/>\n\nTwo years after resigning as Governor of [[Andhra Pradesh]] Pattom Thanu Pillai died on 27 July 1970.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box | before = none | title = [[Chief Minister of Kerala|Prime Minister of Travancore]] | years = 1948&ndash; 1948 | after = [[Parur T.
