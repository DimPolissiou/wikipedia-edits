Around 900 CE, a [[Mississippian culture]] took root in western and central Kentucky; by contrast, a [[Fort Ancient culture]] appeared in eastern Kentucky. While the two had many similarities, the distinctive ceremonial earthwork mounds constructed in the former's centers were not part of the culture of the latter.\n\nIn about the 10th century, the Kentucky native people's variety of corn became highly productive, supplanting the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]], and replaced it with a maize-based agriculture in the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian era]]. French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the [[Beaver Wars]] in the 1670s; however, by the time that European colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region.\n\nAs of the 16th century, the area known as Kentucky was home to tribes from five different culture groups\u2014Iroquoian, Sioux, Algonquian, Muskogean & Yuchi. Around the Bluestone River was the Siouan [[Tutelo]]. North of the Tennessee River was the [[Yuchi]] & south of it was the [[Cherokee]]. Much of the interior of the state was controlled by the Algonquian [[Kispoko|Cisca]]<ref>louis, franquelin, jean baptiste. \"Franquelin's map of Louisiana.\". LOC.gov. Retrieved August 17, 2017.</ref> & the confluence region of the Mississippi & Ohio was home to the [[Chickasaw]]. During a period known as the [[Beaver Wars]], 1640\u20131680, another Algonquian tribe called the Maumee, or [[Mascouten]] was chased out of southern Michigan.<ref>\"EARLY INDIAN MIGRATION IN OHIO\". GenealogyTrails.com. Retrieved August 17, 2017.</ref> The vast majority of them moved to Kentucky, pushing the Kispoko east and war broke out with the Tutelo that pushed them deeper into Appalachia, where they merged with the [[Saponi]] & Moneton. The Maumee were closely related to the Miami of Indiana.

It leaned slightly toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since 1860, when the Whig Party dissolved. The state was not included as among the \"[[Solid South]]\" that prevailed in the former Confederacy after states disenfranchised blacks at the turn of the century. The southeastern section had aligned with the Union during the war and tended to support Republican candidates.\n\nIn a reversal of the demographics of party alignment in the post-Civil War nineteenth century, in the 21st century, state Democrats include liberal whites, African Americans, and other minorities. As of March 2020, 48.42% of the state's voters were officially registered as Democrats, 42.75% were registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], who tend to be conservative whites. Some 8.83% were registered with some other [[political party]] or as Independents.<ref name=\"kypartyreg\">{{cite web|url=https://elect.ky.gov/Resources/Pages/Registration-Statistics.aspx|title=Election Statistics Registration Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=elect.ky.gov|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Despite this, a majority of the state's voters have generally elected Republican candidates for federal office since around the turn of the 21st century.\n\nFrom 1964 through 2004, Kentucky voted for the eventual winner of the election for President of the United States; however, in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]] the state lost its [[bellwether]] status. Republican [[John McCain]] won Kentucky, but he lost the national popular and electoral vote to Democrat [[Barack Obama]] (McCain carried Kentucky 57% to 41%). 116 of Kentucky's 120 counties supported former [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2012 election while he lost to Barack Obama nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/kentucky/|title=2012 Kentucky Presidential Results|website=POLITICO|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/map/#/President/2012/|title=2012 Election Results Map by State \u2013 Live Voting Updates|last=POLITICO|website=POLITICO|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nVoters in the Commonwealth supported the previous three Democratic candidates elected to the White House in the late 20th century, all from Southern states: [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ([[Texas]]) in 1964, [[Jimmy Carter]] ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) in 1976, and [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Arkansas]]) in 1992 and 1996. In 21st-century presidential elections, the state has become a Republican stronghold, supporting that party's presidential candidates by double-digit margins from 2000 through 2016. At the same time, voters have continued to elect Democratic candidates to state and local offices in many jurisdictions.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! colspan = 6 | Voter registration and party enrollment as of March 2020<ref name=\"kypartyreg\" />\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

Growth has been especially rapid in Laurel County, which outgrew areas such as Scott and Jessamine counties around Lexington or Shelby and Nelson Counties around Louisville. London significantly grew in population in the 2000s, from 5,692 in 2000 to 7,993 in 2010. London also landed a [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] distribution center in 1997, bringing thousands of jobs to the community.\n\nIn northeast Kentucky, the greater [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]] area is an important transportation, manufacturing, and medical center. [[Iron and steel industry|Iron]] and [[petroleum]] production, as well as the transport of coal by rail and [[barge]], have been historical pillars of the region's economy. Due to a decline in the area's industrial base, Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990; however, the population of the area has since stabilized with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy. The Ashland area, including the counties of [[Boyd County, Kentucky|Boyd]] and [[Greenup County, Kentucky|Greenup]], are part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. More than 21,000 of those people ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}) reside within the city limits of Ashland.\n\nThe largest county in Kentucky by area is [[Pike County, Kentucky|Pike]], which contains [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]] and suburb [[Coal Run Village, Kentucky|Coal Run Village]].

Around 900 CE, a [[Mississippian culture]] took root in western and central Kentucky; by contrast, a [[Fort Ancient culture]] appeared in eastern Kentucky. While the two had many similarities, the distinctive ceremonial earthwork mounds constructed in the former's centers were not part of the culture of the latter.\n\nIn about the 10th century, the Kentucky native people's variety of corn became highly productive, supplanting the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]], and replaced it with a maize-based agriculture in the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian era]]. French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the [[Beaver Wars]] in the 1670s; however, by the time that European colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region.\n\nAs of the 16th century, the area known as Kentucky was home to tribes from five different culture groups\u2014Iroquoian, Sioux, Algonquian, Muskogean & Yuchi. Around the Bluestone River was the Siouan [[Tutelo]]. North of the Tennessee River was the [[Yuchi]] & south of it was the [[Cherokee]].

London also landed a [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] distribution center in 1997, bringing thousands of jobs to the community.\n\nIn northeast Kentucky, the greater [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]] area is an important transportation, manufacturing, and medical center. [[Iron and steel industry|Iron]] and [[petroleum]] production, as well as the transport of coal by rail and [[barge]], have been historical pillars of the region's economy. Due to a decline in the area's industrial base, Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990; however, the population of the area has since stabilized with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy. The Ashland area, including the counties of [[Boyd County, Kentucky|Boyd]] and [[Greenup County, Kentucky|Greenup]], are part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. More than 21,000 of those people ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}) reside within the city limits of Ashland.\n\nThe largest county in Kentucky by area is [[Pike County, Kentucky|Pike]], which contains [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]] and suburb [[Coal Run Village, Kentucky|Coal Run Village]]. The county and surrounding area is the most populated region in the state that is not part of a [[United States Micropolitan Statistical Area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]] or a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] containing nearly 200,000 people in five counties: [[Floyd County, Kentucky|Floyd County]], [[Martin County, Kentucky|Martin County]], [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher County]], and neighboring [[Mingo County, West Virginia]]. Pike County contains slightly more than 68,000 people.\n\nOnly three U.S. states have capitals with smaller populations than Kentucky's [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] (pop. 25,527), those being [[Augusta, Maine]] (pop. 18,560), [[Pierre, South Dakota]] (pop. 13,876), and [[Montpelier, Vermont]] (pop. 8,035).\n\n==Education==\n\n{{Main| Education in Kentucky}}\n{{See also|Education Reform in Kentucky|List of colleges and universities in Kentucky|List of high schools in Kentucky|List of school districts in Kentucky}}\n[[File:William T.

Major works from the state include [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], widely seen as one of the impetuses for the American Civil War; The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1908) by [[John Fox, Jr.]], which was the first novel to sell a million copies in the United States; [[All the King's Men]] by [[Robert Penn Warren]] (1946) [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|rated as the 36th greatest novel by Modern Library]]; The Dollmaker (1954) by [[Harriette Arnow]] later adapted into a popular film starring [[Jane Fonda]]; [[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]] (1962) by [[Harry Caudill]], which led to [[The War on Poverty]], and others. [[Thomas Merton]] lived most of his life and wrote most of his books during his time as a monk at the [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani]] near Bardstown, Kentucky. [[Hunter S. Thompson]] is also a native of the state. In recent years, several writers from Kentucky have published widely read and critically acclaimed books. These authors include [[Wendell Berry]], [[Silas House]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]], and [[Bobbie Ann Mason]].\n\nWell-known playwrights from Kentucky include [[Marsha Norman]] ('Night Mother) and [[Naomi Wallace]] (One Flea Spare).\n[[File:Hot Brown Kurtz.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.95| The [[Hot Brown]]]]\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{Main|Cuisine of Kentucky}}\n\nKentucky's cuisine is generally similar to traditional southern cooking, although in some areas of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Midwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southernfood.about.com/od/southernregionalfood/Southern_Recipes_and_Regional_Specialties.htm |title=Southern Recipes \u2013 Southern Food and Recipes |publisher=Southernfood.about.com |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iicaculinary.com/iica-ye2-sem1.htm#ac303 |title=International Institute of Culinary Arts |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106091226/http://www.iicaculinary.com/iica-curr.htm#ac303 |archivedate=January 6, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One original Kentucky dish is called the [[Hot Brown]], a dish normally layered in this order: toasted bread, turkey, bacon, tomatoes and topped with [[mornay sauce]].

They are also home to the [[Frontier League]]'s [[Florence Y'alls]] and several teams in the [[MCFL]].

It is not uncommon for fans to park in the city of [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]] and use the [[Newport Southbank Bridge|Newport Southbank Pedestrian Bridge]], locally known as the \"Purple People Bridge\", to walk to these games in Cincinnati.

This is especially true of the state's three [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) programs, including the [[Kentucky Wildcats]], the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and Lady Toppers|Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]], and the [[Louisville Cardinals]]. The [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Wildcats]], [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Hilltoppers]], and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Cardinals]] are among the most tradition-rich college men's basketball teams in the United States, combining for 11 National championships and 24 NCAA Final Fours;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} all three are high on the lists of total all-time wins, wins per season, and average wins per season.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe Kentucky Wildcats are particularly notable, leading all Division I programs in all-time wins, win percentage, NCAA tournament appearances, and being second only to [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in NCAA championships.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]] has also stepped onto the football scene in recent years, including winning the [[2007 Orange Bowl]] as well as the 2013 Sugar Bowl, and also producing [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2016]] [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Lamar Jackson]]. [[WKU Hilltoppers football|Western Kentucky]], the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|national champion in Division I-AA football]] (now [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS)), completed its transition to Division I FBS football in 2009.\n\nThe [[Kentucky Derby]] is a horse race held annually in Louisville on the first Saturday in May. The [[Valhalla Golf Club]] in Louisville has hosted several editions of the [[PGA Championship]], [[Senior PGA Championship]] and [[Ryder Cup]] since the 1990s.\n\nThe [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] has a race at the [[Kentucky Speedway]] in [[Sparta, Kentucky]], which is within an hour driving distance from Cincinnati, Louisville and Lexington. The race is called the [[Quaker State 400]]. The NASCAR [[Nationwide Series]] and the [[Camping World Truck Series]] also race there, and previously the [[IndyCar Series]].\n\n[[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] in Louisville was the primary location for training and rehab for [[WWE]] professional wrestlers from 2000 until 2008, when WWE moved its contracted talent to Florida Championship Wrestling. OVW later became the primary developmental territory for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) from 2011 to 2013.\n\nIn 2014 [[Louisville City FC]], a professional soccer team in the league then known as USL Pro and now as the [[United Soccer League]], was announced. The team made its debut in 2015, playing home games at Louisville Slugger Field. In its first season, Louisville City was the official reserve side for [[Orlando City SC]] while making its debut in [[Major League Soccer]] at the same time. That arrangement ended in 2016, when Orlando City established a [[Orlando City B|directly controlled reserve side]] in the USL.\n\n===State symbols===\n\n{{Main|List of Kentucky state

This may include [[data structures]] like [[String (computer science)|strings]], [[List (abstract data type)|lists]], and [[hash table]]s that are either built-in or result from combining variables using [[Pointer (computer programming)|memory pointers]].\n* Procedures \u2013 also known as functions, methods, routines, or [[subroutine]]s \u2013 that take input, generate output, and manipulate data.  Modern languages include [[structured programming]] constructs like [[Loop (computing)|loops]] and [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]].\n\n[[Modular programming]] support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules for organizational purposes.  Modules are [[namespace]]d so identifiers in one module will not conflict with a procedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.\n\n===Objects and classes===\nLanguages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either [[Class-based programming|classes]] or [[Prototype-based programming|prototypes]]. Those that use classes support two main concepts:\n* [[Class (computer science)|Classes]] \u2013 the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions\n* [[Object (computer science)|Objects]] \u2013 instances of classes\n\nObjects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as \"circle\", \"square\", \"menu\". An online shopping system might have objects such as \"shopping cart\", \"customer\", and \"product\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Software Engineering with Ada|year=1986|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0805306088|page=220|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grady_Booch|quote=Perhaps the greatest strength of an object-oriented approach to development is that it offers a mechanism that captures a model of the real world.}}</ref> Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Object-oriented programming is more than just classes and objects; it's a whole programming paradigm based around [''sic''] ''objects'' (data structures) that contain data fields and methods.

Procedures in object-oriented programming are known as [[Method (computer science)|methods]]; variables are also known as [[Field (computer science)|fields]], members, attributes, or properties.  This leads to the following terms:\n* [[Class variable]]s \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole''; there is only one copy of each one\n* [[Instance variable]]s or attributes \u2013 data that belongs to individual ''objects''; every object has its own copy of each one\n* [[Member variable]]s \u2013 refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class\n* Class methods \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole'' and have access only to class variables and inputs from the procedure call\n* Instance methods \u2013 belong to ''individual objects'', and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables\n\nObjects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack.  They provide a layer of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor]].  A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently.  This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data.\n\nObject-oriented programming that uses classes is sometimes called [[class-based programming]], while [[prototype-based programming]] does not typically use classes. As a result, a significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of ''object'' and ''instance''.\n\nIn some languages classes and objects can be composed using other concepts like [[Trait (computer programming)|traits]] and [[mixin]]s.\n\n===Class-based vs prototype-based===\nIn [[Class-based programming|class-based languages]] the ''classes'' are defined beforehand and the ''objects'' are instantiated based on the classes. If two objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' are instantiated from the class ''Fruit'', they are inherently fruits and it is guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way; e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of the same attributes such as ''color'' or ''sugar_content'' or ''is_ripe''.\n\nIn [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based languages]] the ''objects'' are the primary entities. No ''classes'' even exist. The ''prototype'' of an object is just another object to which the object is linked. Every object has one ''prototype'' link (and only one).  New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may call two different objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' a fruit, if the object ''fruit'' exists, and both ''apple'' and ''orange'' have ''fruit'' as their prototype. The idea of the ''fruit'' class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the [[equivalence class]] of the objects sharing the same prototype. The attributes and methods of the ''prototype'' are [[Delegation (computing)|delegated]] to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype. The attributes and methods ''owned'' individually by the object may not be shared by other objects of the same equivalence class; e.g. the attribute ''sugar_content'' may be unexpectedly not present in ''apple''. Only [[single inheritance]] can be implemented through the prototype.\n\n===Dynamic dispatch/message passing===\nIt is the responsibility of the object, not any external code, to select the procedural code to execute in response to a method call, typically by looking up the method at run time in a table associated with the object.  This feature is known as [[dynamic dispatch]], and distinguishes an object from an [[abstract data type]] (or module), which has a fixed (static) implementation of the operations for all instances.  If the call variability relies on more than the single type of the object on which it is called (i.e. at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice), one speaks of [[multiple dispatch]].\n\nA method call is also known as ''[[message passing]]''.  It is conceptualized as a message (the name of the method and its input parameters) being passed to the object for dispatch.\n\n===Encapsulation===\nEncapsulation is an object-oriented programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of [[Information hiding|data hiding]].\n\nIf a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only, this is a strong form of abstraction or information hiding known as [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]].  Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the <code>private</code> keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the <code>public</code> keyword.  Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as <code>protected</code> (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class).  In other languages (like Python) this is enforced only by convention (for example, <code>private</code> methods may have names that start with an [[underscore]]).  Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.  This facilitates [[code refactoring]], for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as \"public\" method calls work the same way).  It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers.  Encapsulation is a technique that encourages [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupling]].\n\n===Composition, inheritance, and delegation===\nObjects can contain other objects in their instance variables; this is known as [[object composition]].  For example, an object in the Employee class might contain (either directly or through a pointer) an object in the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables like \"first_name\" and \"position\".  Object composition is used to represent \"has-a\" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself, or at a separate location addressed via a pointer).\n\nLanguages that support classes almost always support [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].  This allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents \"is-a-type-of\" relationships.  For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person.  All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names.  For example, class Person might define variables \"first_name\" and \"last_name\" with method \"make_full_name()\".  These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables \"position\" and \"salary\".  This technique allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=978-0-201-54435-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43 43\u201369]|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43}}</ref>\n\nSubclasses can override the methods defined by superclasses. [[Multiple inheritance]] is allowed in some languages, though this can make resolving overrides complicated.  Some languages have special support for [[mixin]]s, though in any language with multiple inheritance, a mixin is simply a class that does not represent an is-a-type-of relationship.  Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes.  For example, class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method unicode_to_ascii() when included in class FileReader and class WebPageScraper, which don't share a common parent.\n\n[[Abstract class]]es cannot be instantiated into objects; they exist only for the purpose of inheritance into other \"concrete\" classes which can be instantiated.  In Java, the <code>[[final (Java)|final]]</code> keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed.\n\nThe doctrine of [[composition over inheritance]] advocates implementing has-a relationships using composition instead of inheritance.  For example, instead of inheriting from class Person, class Employee could give each Employee object an internal Person object, which it then has the opportunity to hide from external code even if class Person has many public attributes or methods.  Some languages, like [[Go (programming language)|Go]] do not support inheritance at all.\n\nThe \"[[open/closed principle]]\" advocates that classes and functions \"should be open for extension, but closed for modification\".\n\n[[Delegation (programming)|Delegation]] is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance.\n\n===Polymorphism===\n[[Subtyping]] \u2013 a form of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] \u2013 is when calling code can be agnostic as to which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on \u2013 the parent class or one of its descendants.  Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.\n\nFor example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.  The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn.\n\nThis is another type of abstraction which simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong [[separation of concerns]].\n\n===Open recursion===\nIn languages that support [[open recursion]], object methods can call other methods on the same object (including themselves), typically using a special variable or keyword called <code>this</code> or <code>self</code>.  This variable is ''[[name binding|late-bound]]''; it allows a method defined in one class to invoke another method that is defined later, in some subclass thereof.\n\n==History==\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for a class. This Button class has [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] for data, and [[Method (computer programming)|functions]]. Through inheritance a subclass can be created as subset of the Button class. Objects are instances of a class.]]\n\nTerminology invoking \"objects\" and \"oriented\" in the modern sense of object-oriented programming made its first appearance at [[MIT]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the environment of the [[artificial intelligence]] group, as early as 1960, \"object\" could refer to identified items ([[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] atoms) with properties (attributes);<ref>{{Cite journal\n |last=McCarthy\n |first=J.\n |editor-link=John McCarthy\n |last2=Brayton\n |first2=R.\n |author2-link=Robert Brayton (computer scientist)\n |last3=Edwards\n |first3=D.\n |author3-link=Daniel Edwards (programmer)\n |last4=Fox\n |first4=P.\n |author4-link=Phyllis Fox\n |last5=Hodes\n |first5=L.\n |author5-link=Louis Hodes\n |last6=Luckham\n |first6=D.\n |author6-link=David Luckham\n |last7=Maling\n |first7=K.\n |author7-link=Klim Maling (programmer)\n |last8=Park\n |first8=D.\n |author8-link=David Park (computer scientist)\n |last9=Russell\n |first9=S.\n |author9-link=Steve Russell (computer scientist)\n |title=LISP I Programmers Manual\n |place=[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]\n |publisher=Artificial Intelligence Group, [[M.I.T.

[[Ole-Johan Dahl]] formally joined the project and the Simula programming language was designed to run on the [[UNIVAC I|Universal Automatic Computer]] (UNIVAC) 1107. In the early stages Simula was supposed to be a procedure package for the programming language [[ALGOL]] 60.  Dissatisfied with the restrictions imposed by ALGOL the researchers decided to develop Simula into a fully-fledged programming language, which used the UNIVAC ALGOL 60 compiler. Simula launched in 1964, and was promoted by Dahl and Nygaard throughout 1965 and 1966, leading to increasing use of the programming language in Sweden, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1968, the language became widely available through the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5500 computers]], and was later also implemented on the [[Ural (computer)|URAL-16 computer]]. In 1966, Dahl and Nygaard wrote a Simula [[compiler]]. They became preoccupied with putting into practice [[Tony Hoare]]'s record class concept, which had been implemented in the free-form, English-like general-purpose simulation language [[SIMSCRIPT]]. They settled for a generalised process concept with record class properties, and a second layer of prefixes. Through prefixing a process could reference its predecessor and have additional properties. Simula thus introduced the class and subclass hierarchy, and the possibility of generating objects from these classes. The Simula 1 compiler and a new version of the programming language, Simula 67, was introduced to the wider world through the research paper \"Class and Subclass Declarations\" at a 1967 conference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmevik  |first = Jan Rune|title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis|journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume = 16  |issue = 4 |pages = 25\u201337 |year = 1994|url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf| doi =   10.1109/85.329756|accessdate =3 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\nA Simula 67 compiler was launched for the [[IBM System/360|System/360]] and [[IBM System/370|System/370]] [[IBM mainframe|IBM mainframe computers]] in 1972. In the same year a Simula 67 compiler was launched free of charge for the French [[CII 10070]] and [[CII Iris]] 80 [[mainframe computers]]. By 1974, the Association of Simula Users had members in 23 different countries. Early 1975 a Simula 67 compiler was released free of charge for the [[DECsystem-10]] mainframe family. By August the same year the DECsystem-10 Simula 67 compiler had been installed at 28 sites, 22 of them in North America. The object-oriented Simula programming language was used mainly by researchers involved with [[physical modelling]], such as models to study and improve the movement of ships and their content through cargo ports.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmevik  |first = Jan Rune|title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis|journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume = 16  |issue = 4 |pages = 25\u201337 |year = 1994|url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf| doi =   10.1109/85.329756|accessdate =3 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, the first version of the [[Smalltalk]] programming language was developed at [[Xerox PARC]] by [[Alan Kay]], [[Dan Ingalls]] and [[Adele Goldberg (computer scientist)|Adele Goldberg]].

Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp (such as LOOPS and [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]] introducing [[multiple inheritance]] and [[mixins]]) eventually led to the [[Common Lisp Object System]], which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allows extension via a [[Meta-object protocol]]. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examples include the [[Intel iAPX 432]] and the [[Linn Products|Linn Smart]] [[Rekursiv]].\n\nIn 1981, Goldberg edited the August 1981 issue of [[Byte Magazine]], introducing Smalltalk and object-oriented programming to a wider audience. In 1986, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] organised the first ''Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications'' (OOPSLA), which was unexpectedly attended by 1,000 people. In the mid-1980s [[Objective-C]] was developed by [[Brad Cox]], who had used Smalltalk at [[ITT Inc.]], and [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], who had used Simula for his PhD thesis, eventually went to create the object-oriented [[C++]].<ref name=\"Bertrand Meyer 2009 329\"/> In 1985, [[Bertrand Meyer]] also produced the first design of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel language]]. Focused on software quality, Eiffel is a purely object-oriented programming language and a notation supporting the entire software lifecycle. Meyer described the Eiffel software development method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computer science, in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer's reliability mechanism, [[Design by Contract]], which is an integral part of both the method and language.\n\n[[File:Tiobeindex.png|thumb|350px|The [[TIOBE index|TIOBE]] [[Measuring programming language popularity|programming language popularity index]] graph from 2002 to 2018.

These included Visual [[FoxPro]] 3.0,<ref>1995 (June) Visual [[FoxPro]] 3.0, FoxPro evolves from a procedural language to an object-oriented language. Visual FoxPro 3.0 introduces a database container, seamless client/server capabilities, support for ActiveX technologies, and OLE Automation and null support.

Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of [[graphical user interface]]s, which rely heavily upon object-oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]] frameworks on [[Mac OS X]], written in [[Objective-C]], an object-oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced the popularity of [[event-driven programming]] (although this concept is not limited to OOP).\n\nAt [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]], [[Niklaus Wirth]] and his colleagues had also been investigating such topics as [[data abstraction]] and [[modularity (programming)|modular programming]] (although this had been in common use in the 1960s or earlier). [[Modula-2]] (1978) included both, and their succeeding design, [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], included a distinctive approach to object orientation, classes, and such.\n\nObject-oriented features have been added to many previously existing languages, including [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[BASIC]], [[Fortran]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[COBOL]]. Adding these features to languages that were not initially designed for them often led to problems with compatibility and maintainability of code.\n\nMore recently, a number of languages have emerged that are primarily object-oriented, but that are also compatible with procedural methodology. Two such languages are [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]]. Probably the most commercially important recent object-oriented languages are [[Java (programming language)|Java]], developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], as well as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic.NET]] (VB.NET), both designed for Microsoft's [[.NET Framework|.NET]] platform. Each of these two frameworks shows, in its own way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction from implementation. VB.NET and C# support cross-language inheritance, allowing classes defined in one language to subclass classes defined in the other language.\n\n==OOP languages==\n{{\"Unreferenced section\"\n|date=August 2009}}\n{{See also|List of object-oriented programming languages}}\n\n[[Simula]] (1967) is generally accepted as being the first language with the primary features of an object-oriented language. It was created for making [[Computer simulation|simulation programs]], in which what came to be called objects were the most important information representation. [[Smalltalk]] (1972 to 1980) is another early example, and the one with which much of the theory of OOP was developed. Concerning the degree of object orientation, the following distinctions can be made:\n<!-- Order lists of examples based on [[TIOBE index]]-->\n* Languages called \"pure\" OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistently as an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to whole classes, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, even enforce, OO methods. Examples: [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Emerald (programming language)|Emerald]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldprogramminglanguage.org/|title=The Emerald Programming Language| date=26 February 2011}}</ref> [[JADE (programming language)|JADE]], [[Self (programming language)|Self]].\n* Languages designed mainly for OO programming, but with some procedural elements. Examples: [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi/Object Pascal]], [[VB.NET]].\n* Languages that are historically [[Procedural programming|procedural languages]], but have been extended with some OO features. Examples: [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Visual Basic]] (derived from BASIC), [[MATLAB]], [[COBOL 2002]], [[Fortran 2003]], [[ABAP]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada 95]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].\n* Languages with most of the features of objects (classes, methods, inheritance), but in a distinctly original form. Examples: [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] (Oberon-1 or Oberon-2).\n* Languages with [[abstract data type]] support which may be used to resemble OO programming, but without all features of object-orientation. This includes [[object-based|object-''based'']] and [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] languages. Examples: [[JavaScript]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Modula-2]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]].\n* Chameleon languages that support multiple paradigms, including OO. [[Tcl]] stands out among these for TclOO, a hybrid object system that supports both [[prototype-based programming]] and class-based OO.\n\n===OOP in dynamic languages===\nIn recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially popular in [[dynamic programming language]]s. [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, while [[Perl]] and [[PHP]] have been adding object-oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and [[ColdFusion]] since version 6.\n\nThe [[Document Object Model]] of [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], and [[XML]] documents on the Internet has bindings to the popular [[JavaScript]]/[[ECMAScript]] language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known [[prototype-based programming]] language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class (contrast to [[class-based programming]]). Another scripting language that takes this approach is [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].\n\n===OOP in a network protocol===\nThe messages that flow between computers to request services in a client-server environment can be designed as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server.  For example, a simple linearized object would consist of a length field, a code point identifying the class, and a data value.  A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters.  Each such command must be directed by the server to an object whose class (or superclass) recognizes the command and is able to provide the requested service. Clients and servers are best modeled as complex object-oriented structures. [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]] (DDM) took this approach and used class objects to define objects at four levels of a formal hierarchy:\n* Fields defining the data values that form messages, such as their length, code point and data values.\n* Objects and collections of objects similar to what would be found in a [[Smalltalk]] program for messages and parameters.\n* Managers similar to [[AS/400 object]]s, such as a directory to files and files consisting of metadata and records. Managers conceptually provide memory and processing resources for their contained objects.\n* A client or server consisting of all the managers necessary to implement a full processing environment, supporting such aspects as directory services, security and concurrency control.\n\nThe initial version of DDM defined distributed file services.  It was later extended to be the foundation of [[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA).\n\n==Design patterns==\nChallenges of object-oriented design are addressed by several approaches. Most common is known as the [[Design Patterns (book)|design patterns codified by Gamma ''et al.'']]. More broadly, the term \"[[design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]]\" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable, solution pattern to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-oriented development.\n\n===Inheritance and behavioral subtyping===\n{{See also|Object-oriented design}}<!-- not \"further\" because that article is mostly blather and does not even mention this -->\nIt is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a [[program semantics|semantic]] \"[[is a]]\" relationship, and thus to infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always be ''safely'' used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. This intuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow [[mutable]] objects. [[Subtype polymorphism]] as enforced by the [[type checker]] in OOP languages (with mutable objects) cannot guarantee [[behavioral subtyping]] in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannot be implemented by a program (compiler). Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed, considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the [[Liskov substitution principle]].\n\n===Gang of Four design patterns===\n{{Main|Design pattern (computer science)}}\n''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]]'' is an influential book published in 1994 by [[Erich Gamma]], [[Richard Helm]], [[Ralph Johnson (computer scientist)|Ralph Johnson]], and [[John Vlissides]], often referred to humorously as the \"Gang of Four\". Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them.\nAs of April 2007, the book was in its 36th printing.\n\nThe book describes the following patterns:\n* ''[[Creational pattern]]s'' (5): [[Factory method pattern]], [[Abstract factory pattern]], [[Singleton pattern]], [[Builder pattern]], [[Prototype pattern]]\n* ''[[Structural pattern]]s'' (7): [[Adapter pattern]], [[Bridge pattern]], [[Composite pattern]], [[Decorator pattern]], [[Facade pattern]], [[Flyweight pattern]], [[Proxy pattern]]\n* ''[[Behavioral pattern]]s'' (11): [[Chain-of-responsibility pattern]], [[Command pattern]], [[Interpreter pattern]], [[Iterator pattern]], [[Mediator pattern]], [[Memento pattern]], [[Observer pattern]], [[State pattern]], [[Strategy pattern]], [[Template method pattern]], [[Visitor pattern]]\n\n===Object-orientation and databases===\n{{Main|Object-relational impedance mismatch|Object-relational mapping|Object database}}\nBoth object-oriented programming and [[relational database management systems]] (RDBMSs) are extremely common in software {{As of|2006|alt=today}}. Since [[relational database]]s don't store objects directly (though some RDBMSs have object-oriented features to approximate this), there is a general need to bridge the two worlds. The problem of bridging object-oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases is known as [[object-relational impedance mismatch]]. There are a number of approaches to cope with this problem, but no general solution without downsides.<ref name=\"RDMDBobjectmis\">{{Cite web| first = Ted| last = Neward| title = The Vietnam of Computer Science| date = 26 June 2006| accessdate = 2 June 2010| publisher = Interoperability Happens| url = http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060704030226/http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-date = 4 July 2006| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One of the most common approaches is [[object-relational mapping]], as found in [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] languages such as [[Visual FoxPro]] and libraries such as [[Java Data Objects]] and [[Ruby on Rails]]' ActiveRecord.\n\nThere are also [[object database]]s that can be used to replace RDBMSs, but these have not been as technically and commercially successful as RDBMSs.\n\n===Real-world modeling and relationships===\nOOP can be used to associate real-world objects and processes with digital counterparts. However, not everyone agrees that OOP facilitates direct real-world mapping (see [[object-oriented programming#Criticism|Criticism]] section) or that real-world mapping is even a worthy goal; [[Bertrand Meyer]] argues in ''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]''<ref name=\"Meyer230\">Meyer, Second Edition, p. 230</ref> that a program is not a model of the world but a model of some part of the world; \"Reality is a cousin twice removed\".

This may include [[data structures]] like [[String (computer science)|strings]], [[List (abstract data type)|lists]], and [[hash table]]s that are either built-in or result from combining variables using [[Pointer (computer programming)|memory pointers]].\n* Procedures \u2013 also known as functions, methods, routines, or [[subroutine]]s \u2013 that take input, generate output, and manipulate data.  Modern languages include [[structured programming]] constructs like [[Loop (computing)|loops]] and [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditionals]].\n\n[[Modular programming]] support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules for organizational purposes.  Modules are [[namespace]]d so identifiers in one module will not conflict with a procedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.\n\n===Objects and classes===\nLanguages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either [[Class-based programming|classes]] or [[Prototype-based programming|prototypes]]. Those that use classes support two main concepts:\n* [[Class (computer science)|Classes]] \u2013 the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions\n* [[Object (computer science)|Objects]] \u2013 instances of classes\n\nObjects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as \"circle\", \"square\", \"menu\". An online shopping system might have objects such as \"shopping cart\", \"customer\", and \"product\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Software Engineering with Ada|year=1986|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=978-0805306088|page=220|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grady_Booch|quote=Perhaps the greatest strength of an object-oriented approach to development is that it offers a mechanism that captures a model of the real world.}}</ref> Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Object-oriented programming is more than just classes and objects; it's a whole programming paradigm based around [''sic''] ''objects'' (data structures) that contain data fields and methods.

Procedures in object-oriented programming are known as [[Method (computer science)|methods]]; variables are also known as [[Field (computer science)|fields]], members, attributes, or properties.  This leads to the following terms:\n* [[Class variable]]s \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole''; there is only one copy of each one\n* [[Instance variable]]s or attributes \u2013 data that belongs to individual ''objects''; every object has its own copy of each one\n* [[Member variable]]s \u2013 refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class\n* Class methods \u2013 belong to the ''class as a whole'' and have access only to class variables and inputs from the procedure call\n* Instance methods \u2013 belong to ''individual objects'', and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables\n\nObjects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack.  They provide a layer of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor]].  A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently.  This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data.\n\nObject-oriented programming that uses classes is sometimes called [[class-based programming]], while [[prototype-based programming]] does not typically use classes. As a result, a significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of ''object'' and ''instance''.\n\nIn some languages classes and objects can be composed using other concepts like [[Trait (computer programming)|traits]] and [[mixin]]s.\n\n===Class-based vs prototype-based===\nIn [[Class-based programming|class-based languages]] the ''classes'' are defined beforehand and the ''objects'' are instantiated based on the classes. If two objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' are instantiated from the class ''Fruit'', they are inherently fruits and it is guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way; e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of the same attributes such as ''color'' or ''sugar_content'' or ''is_ripe''.\n\nIn [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based languages]] the ''objects'' are the primary entities. No ''classes'' even exist. The ''prototype'' of an object is just another object to which the object is linked. Every object has one ''prototype'' link (and only one).  New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may call two different objects ''apple'' and ''orange'' a fruit, if the object ''fruit'' exists, and both ''apple'' and ''orange'' have ''fruit'' as their prototype. The idea of the ''fruit'' class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the [[equivalence class]] of the objects sharing the same prototype. The attributes and methods of the ''prototype'' are [[Delegation (computing)|delegated]] to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype. The attributes and methods ''owned'' individually by the object may not be shared by other objects of the same equivalence class; e.g. the attribute ''sugar_content'' may be unexpectedly not present in ''apple''. Only [[single inheritance]] can be implemented through the prototype.\n\n===Dynamic dispatch/message passing===\nIt is the responsibility of the object, not any external code, to select the procedural code to execute in response to a method call, typically by looking up the method at run time in a table associated with the object.  This feature is known as [[dynamic dispatch]], and distinguishes an object from an [[abstract data type]] (or module), which has a fixed (static) implementation of the operations for all instances.  If the call variability relies on more than the single type of the object on which it is called (i.e. at least one other parameter object is involved in the method choice), one speaks of [[multiple dispatch]].\n\nA method call is also known as ''[[message passing]]''.  It is conceptualized as a message (the name of the method and its input parameters) being passed to the object for dispatch.\n\n===Encapsulation===\nEncapsulation is an object-oriented programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of [[Information hiding|data hiding]].\n\nIf a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only, this is a strong form of abstraction or information hiding known as [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]].  Some languages (Java, for example) let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the <code>private</code> keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the <code>public</code> keyword.  Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as <code>protected</code> (which allows access from the same class and its subclasses, but not objects of a different class).  In other languages (like Python) this is enforced only by convention (for example, <code>private</code> methods may have names that start with an [[underscore]]).  Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.  This facilitates [[code refactoring]], for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code (as long as \"public\" method calls work the same way).  It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers.  Encapsulation is a technique that encourages [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupling]].\n\n===Composition, inheritance, and delegation===\nObjects can contain other objects in their instance variables; this is known as [[object composition]].  For example, an object in the Employee class might contain (either directly or through a pointer) an object in the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables like \"first_name\" and \"position\".  Object composition is used to represent \"has-a\" relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object (either directly embedded within itself, or at a separate location addressed via a pointer).\n\nLanguages that support classes almost always support [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].  This allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents \"is-a-type-of\" relationships.  For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person.  All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names.  For example, class Person might define variables \"first_name\" and \"last_name\" with method \"make_full_name()\".  These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables \"position\" and \"salary\".  This technique allows easy re-use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real-world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=978-0-201-54435-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43 43\u201369]|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43}}</ref>\n\nSubclasses can override the methods defined by superclasses. [[Multiple inheritance]] is allowed in some languages, though this can make resolving overrides complicated.  Some languages have special support for [[mixin]]s, though in any language with multiple inheritance, a mixin is simply a class that does not represent an is-a-type-of relationship.  Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes.  For example, class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method unicode_to_ascii() when included in class FileReader and class WebPageScraper, which don't share a common parent.\n\n[[Abstract class]]es cannot be instantiated into objects; they exist only for the purpose of inheritance into other \"concrete\" classes which can be instantiated.  In Java, the <code>[[final (Java)|final]]</code> keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed.\n\nThe doctrine of [[composition over inheritance]] advocates implementing has-a relationships using composition instead of inheritance.  For example, instead of inheriting from class Person, class Employee could give each Employee object an internal Person object, which it then has the opportunity to hide from external code even if class Person has many public attributes or methods.  Some languages, like [[Go (programming language)|Go]] do not support inheritance at all.\n\nThe \"[[open/closed principle]]\" advocates that classes and functions \"should be open for extension, but closed for modification\".\n\n[[Delegation (programming)|Delegation]] is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance.\n\n===Polymorphism===\n[[Subtyping]] \u2013 a form of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] \u2013 is when calling code can be agnostic as to which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on \u2013 the parent class or one of its descendants.  Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently.\n\nFor example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape.  The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn.\n\nThis is another type of abstraction which simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong [[separation of concerns]].\n\n===Open recursion===\nIn languages that support [[open recursion]], object methods can call other methods on the same object (including themselves), typically using a special variable or keyword called <code>this</code> or <code>self</code>.  This variable is ''[[name binding|late-bound]]''; it allows a method defined in one class to invoke another method that is defined later, in some subclass thereof.\n\n==History==\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for a class. This Button class has [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] for data, and [[Method (computer programming)|functions]]. Through inheritance a subclass can be created as subset of the Button class. Objects are instances of a class.]]\n\nTerminology invoking \"objects\" and \"oriented\" in the modern sense of object-oriented programming made its first appearance at [[MIT]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

[[Ole-Johan Dahl]] formally joined the project and the Simula programming language was designed to run on the [[UNIVAC I|Universal Automatic Computer]] (UNIVAC) 1107. In the early stages Simula was supposed to be a procedure package for the programming language [[ALGOL]] 60.  Dissatisfied with the restrictions imposed by ALGOL the researchers decided to develop Simula into a fully-fledged programming language, which used the UNIVAC ALGOL 60 compiler. Simula launched in 1964, and was promoted by Dahl and Nygaard throughout 1965 and 1966, leading to increasing use of the programming language in Sweden, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1968, the language became widely available through the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5500 computers]], and was later also implemented on the [[Ural (computer)|URAL-16 computer]]. In 1966, Dahl and Nygaard wrote a Simula [[compiler]]. They became preoccupied with putting into practice [[Tony Hoare]]'s record class concept, which had been implemented in the free-form, English-like general-purpose simulation language [[SIMSCRIPT]]. They settled for a generalised process concept with record class properties, and a second layer of prefixes. Through prefixing a process could reference its predecessor and have additional properties. Simula thus introduced the class and subclass hierarchy, and the possibility of generating objects from these classes. The Simula 1 compiler and a new version of the programming language, Simula 67, was introduced to the wider world through the research paper \"Class and Subclass Declarations\" at a 1967 conference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmevik  |first = Jan Rune|title = Compiling Simula: A historical study of technological genesis|journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume = 16  |issue = 4 |pages = 25\u201337 |year = 1994|url = http://www.idi.ntnu.no/grupper/su/publ/simula/holmevik-simula-ieeeannals94.pdf| doi =   10.1109/85.329756|accessdate =3 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\nA Simula 67 compiler was launched for the [[IBM System/360|System/360]] and [[IBM System/370|System/370]] [[IBM mainframe|IBM mainframe computers]] in 1972.

By 1974, the Association of Simula Users had members in 23 different countries. Early 1975 a Simula 67 compiler was released free of charge for the [[DECsystem-10]] mainframe family. By August the same year the DECsystem-10 Simula 67 compiler had been installed at 28 sites, 22 of them in North America.

Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp (such as LOOPS and [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]] introducing [[multiple inheritance]] and [[mixins]]) eventually led to the [[Common Lisp Object System]], which integrates functional programming and object-oriented programming and allows extension via a [[Meta-object protocol]]. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examples include the [[Intel iAPX 432]] and the [[Linn Products|Linn Smart]] [[Rekursiv]].\n\nIn 1981, Goldberg edited the August 1981 issue of [[Byte Magazine]], introducing Smalltalk and object-oriented programming to a wider audience. In 1986, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] organised the first ''Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications'' (OOPSLA), which was unexpectedly attended by 1,000 people. In the mid-1980s [[Objective-C]] was developed by [[Brad Cox]], who had used Smalltalk at [[ITT Inc.]], and [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], who had used Simula for his PhD thesis, eventually went to create the object-oriented [[C++]].<ref name=\"Bertrand Meyer 2009 329\"/> In 1985, [[Bertrand Meyer]] also produced the first design of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel language]]. Focused on software quality, Eiffel is a purely object-oriented programming language and a notation supporting the entire software lifecycle. Meyer described the Eiffel software development method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computer science, in [[Object-Oriented Software Construction]]. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer's reliability mechanism, [[Design by Contract]], which is an integral part of both the method and language.\n\n[[File:Tiobeindex.png|thumb|350px|The [[TIOBE index|TIOBE]] [[Measuring programming language popularity|programming language popularity index]] graph from 2002 to 2018.

Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of [[graphical user interface]]s, which rely heavily upon object-oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the [[Cocoa (software)|Cocoa]] frameworks on [[Mac OS X]], written in [[Objective-C]], an object-oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced the popularity of [[event-driven programming]] (although this concept is not limited to OOP).\n\nAt [[ETH Z\u00fcrich]], [[Niklaus Wirth]] and his colleagues had also been investigating such topics as [[data abstraction]] and [[modularity (programming)|modular programming]] (although this had been in common use in the 1960s or earlier). [[Modula-2]] (1978) included both, and their succeeding design, [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], included a distinctive approach to object orientation, classes, and such.\n\nObject-oriented features have been added to many previously existing languages, including [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[BASIC]], [[Fortran]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[COBOL]]. Adding these features to languages that were not initially designed for them often led to problems with compatibility and maintainability of code.\n\nMore recently, a number of languages have emerged that are primarily object-oriented, but that are also compatible with procedural methodology. Two such languages are [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]]. Probably the most commercially important recent object-oriented languages are [[Java (programming language)|Java]], developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], as well as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Visual Basic.NET]] (VB.NET), both designed for Microsoft's [[.NET Framework|.NET]] platform. Each of these two frameworks shows, in its own way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction from implementation. VB.NET and C# support cross-language inheritance, allowing classes defined in one language to subclass classes defined in the other language.\n\n==OOP languages==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\n{{See also|List of object-oriented programming languages}}\n\n[[Simula]] (1967) is generally accepted as being the first language with the primary features of an object-oriented language. It was created for making [[Computer simulation|simulation programs]], in which what came to be called objects were the most important information representation. [[Smalltalk]] (1972 to 1980) is another early example, and the one with which much of the theory of OOP was developed. Concerning the degree of object orientation, the following distinctions can be made:\n<!-- Order lists of examples based on [[TIOBE index]]-->\n* Languages called \"pure\" OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistently as an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to whole classes, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, even enforce, OO methods. Examples: [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Emerald (programming language)|Emerald]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldprogramminglanguage.org/|title=The Emerald Programming Language| date=26 February 2011}}</ref> [[JADE (programming language)|JADE]], [[Self (programming language)|Self]].\n* Languages designed mainly for OO programming, but with some procedural elements. Examples: [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi/Object Pascal]], [[VB.NET]].\n* Languages that are historically [[Procedural programming|procedural languages]], but have been extended with some OO features. Examples: [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Visual Basic]] (derived from BASIC), [[MATLAB]], [[COBOL 2002]], [[Fortran 2003]], [[ABAP]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada 95]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].\n* Languages with most of the features of objects (classes, methods, inheritance), but in a distinctly original form. Examples: [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] (Oberon-1 or Oberon-2).\n* Languages with [[abstract data type]] support which may be used to resemble OO programming, but without all features of object-orientation. This includes [[object-based|object-''based'']] and [[Prototype-based programming|prototype-based]] languages. Examples: [[JavaScript]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Modula-2]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]].\n* Chameleon languages that support multiple paradigms, including OO. [[Tcl]] stands out among these for TclOO, a hybrid object system that supports both [[prototype-based programming]] and class-based OO.\n\n===OOP in dynamic languages===\nIn recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially popular in [[dynamic programming language]]s. [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, while [[Perl]] and [[PHP]] have been adding object-oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and [[ColdFusion]] since version 6.\n\nThe [[Document Object Model]] of [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], and [[XML]] documents on the Internet has bindings to the popular [[JavaScript]]/[[ECMAScript]] language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known [[prototype-based programming]] language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class (contrast to [[class-based programming]]). Another scripting language that takes this approach is [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].\n\n===OOP in a network protocol===\nThe messages that flow between computers to request services in a client-server environment can be designed as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server.  For example, a simple linearized object would consist of a length field, a code point identifying the class, and a data value.  A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters.  Each such command must be directed by the server to an object whose class (or superclass) recognizes the command and is able to provide the requested service. Clients and servers are best modeled as complex object-oriented structures. [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]] (DDM) took this approach and used class objects to define objects at four levels of a formal hierarchy:\n* Fields defining the data values that form messages, such as their length, code point and data values.\n* Objects and collections of objects similar to what would be found in a [[Smalltalk]] program for messages and parameters.\n* Managers similar to [[AS/400 object]]s, such as a directory to files and files consisting of metadata and records. Managers conceptually provide memory and processing resources for their contained objects.\n* A client or server consisting of all the managers necessary to implement a full processing environment, supporting such aspects as directory services, security and concurrency control.\n\nThe initial version of DDM defined distributed file services.  It was later extended to be the foundation of [[DRDA|Distributed Relational Database Architecture]] (DRDA).\n\n==Design patterns==\nChallenges of object-oriented design are addressed by several approaches. Most common is known as the [[Design Patterns (book)|design patterns codified by Gamma ''et al.'']]. More broadly, the term \"[[design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]]\" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable, solution pattern to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object-oriented development.\n\n===Inheritance and behavioral subtyping===\n{{See also|Object-oriented design}}<!-- not \"further\" because that article is mostly blather and does not even mention this -->\nIt is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a [[program semantics|semantic]] \"[[is a]]\" relationship, and thus to infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always be ''safely'' used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. This intuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow [[mutable]] objects. [[Subtype polymorphism]] as enforced by the [[type checker]] in OOP languages (with mutable objects) cannot guarantee [[behavioral subtyping]] in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannot be implemented by a program (compiler). Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed, considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the [[Liskov substitution principle]].\n\n===Gang of Four design patterns===\n{{Main|Design pattern (computer science)}}\n''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]]'' is an influential book published in 1994 by [[Erich Gamma]], [[Richard Helm]], [[Ralph Johnson (computer scientist)|Ralph Johnson]], and [[John Vlissides]], often referred to humorously as the \"Gang of Four\". Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them.\nAs of April 2007, the book was in its 36th printing.\n\nThe book describes the following patterns:\n* ''[[Creational pattern]]s'' (5): [[Factory method pattern]], [[Abstract factory pattern]], [[Singleton pattern]], [[Builder pattern]], [[Prototype pattern]]\n* ''[[Structural pattern]]s'' (7): [[Adapter pattern]], [[Bridge pattern]], [[Composite pattern]], [[Decorator pattern]], [[Facade pattern]], [[Flyweight pattern]], [[Proxy pattern]]\n* ''[[Behavioral pattern]]s'' (11): [[Chain-of-responsibility pattern]], [[Command pattern]], [[Interpreter pattern]], [[Iterator pattern]], [[Mediator pattern]], [[Memento pattern]], [[Observer pattern]], [[State pattern]], [[Strategy pattern]], [[Template method pattern]], [[Visitor pattern]]\n\n===Object-orientation and databases===\n{{Main|Object-relational impedance mismatch|Object-relational mapping|Object database}}\nBoth object-oriented programming and [[relational database management systems]] (RDBMSs) are extremely common in software {{As of|2006|alt=today}}. Since [[relational database]]s don't store objects directly (though some RDBMSs have object-oriented features to approximate this), there is a general need to bridge the two worlds. The problem of bridging object-oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases is known as [[object-relational impedance mismatch]]. There are a number of approaches to cope with this problem, but no general solution without downsides.<ref name=\"RDMDBobjectmis\">{{Cite web| first = Ted| last = Neward| title = The Vietnam of Computer Science| date = 26 June 2006| accessdate = 2 June 2010| publisher = Interoperability Happens| url = http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060704030226/http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx| archive-date = 4 July 2006| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One of the most common approaches is [[object-relational mapping]], as found in [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] languages such as [[Visual FoxPro]] and libraries such as [[Java Data Objects]] and [[Ruby on Rails]]' ActiveRecord.\n\nThere are also [[object database]]s that can be used to replace RDBMSs, but these have not been as technically and commercially successful as RDBMSs.\n\n===Real-world modeling and relationships===\nOOP can be used to associate real-world objects and processes with digital counterparts.

A manor belonged to Englefield family, the lords of [[Englefield, Berkshire]], as part of the manor of [[Himley]].  This manor was demised to [[John de Somery, Baron Somery]] the tenant in chief ub c.1316 and by 1346 passed to his nephew [[John de Sutton II]], who had succeeded to the barony of [[Dudley Castle|Dudley]].

It was one of the hays (enclosed areas for hunting) of [[Kinver]] Forest.  The area passed into the hands of the lords of Dudley in the 15th century, initially as lesses of the herbage and [[pannage]].  It was granted to [[Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley]] when the family property was restored to him in 1555 and devolved as part of the family estates until 1947 in the same was as Swindon.  By 1600 there was a lodge (Chasepool Lodge), leased to Edward Green, who probably gave his name to the adjacent [[Greensforge]].  his son [[Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley|also Edward]] gave a lease for lives of it to his son [[Dud Dudley]].<ref>''Victoria County History, Staffordshire'' XX, 209-10.</ref>\n\n== Iron Works ==\nSwin or Swindon Forge was once a [[fulling]] mill then a corn mill belonging to [[Halesowen Abbey]].  This was converted into a [[finery forge]], perhaps in the 1620s.   This was leased to [[Thomas Foley (1616\u20131677)|Thomas Foley]] in 1647 and passed to his son [[Philip Foley|Philip]] with many of his other ironworks in 1669.  After he sold it in 1674, it passed through various hands, coming into the hands of [[Francis Homfray]] of [[Oldswinford]] by the 1720s, remaining in the hands of this family until 1820.  The works were much enlarged in the 19th century, so that in 1859 there were 13 puddling furnaces.  It was leased in 1866 to E. P. and W. Baldwin, the owners of the [[Wilden Ironworks]].

He participated in the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] on Liu Bang ([[Emperor Gaozu of Han]])'s side and contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty.\n\n==Early life==\nCao Shen was from [[Pei County]] in present-day [[Jiangsu]] and he served as a prison warden in his early days. He was a close friend of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]. Once, Liu Bang was tasked with escorting some convicts to [[Mount Li]] to become labourers, but some prisoners escaped and Liu was forced to become a fugitive. He sought refuge with his followers on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Henan]]) and maintained secret contact with Cao Shen and [[Xiao He]]. In 209 BC, after the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] broke out, the magistrate of Pei County considered rebelling against the [[Qin dynasty]] as well, so he heeded Cao Shen and Xiao He's advice to invite Liu Bang back to support him. However, the magistrate changed his mind later and denied Liu Bang entry into the city. He was worried that Xiao He and Cao Shen might open the city gates for Liu Bang so he planned to have them killed, but Xiao and Cao managed to escape and join Liu. The townsfolk rebelled against the magistrate and killed him and allowed Liu Bang and his men to enter. Liu Bang built up his rebel army in Pei County and Cao Shen served as one of his advisors.\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\nCao Shen defeated the Qin armies led by Xue Guo, Hu Ling and Fang Yu, and was promoted to a high rank by Liu Bang for his contributions. Cao Shen defeated [[Zhang Han (Qin dynasty)|Zhang Han]]'s army and drove Zhang towards [[Puyang]]. He returned to help Liu Bang, who was trapped at Yongqiu, and defeated Li You, the Qin general defending Sanchuan. By then, Cao Shen had conquered two fiefs and 122 counties in total. In the following battles against Qin, Cao Shen defeated the Qin generals Wang Li and Zhao Ben and captured the Wu and Yao passes leading to [[Xianyang]] (the Qin capital).\n\n==Chu\u2013Han Contention==\nAfter the fall of the Qin dynasty, Liu Bang received the title of \"King of [[Han Dynasty|Han]]\" from Xiang Yu, and was relocated to [[Hanzhong]]. Liu Bang granted Cao Shen the title of \"Marquis of Jiancheng\" (\u5efa\u6210\u4faf) and promoted him to a general rank. Cao Shen helped Liu Bang conquer the [[Three Qins]]. During the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]], a power struggle between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, Cao Shen joined [[Han Xin]]'s army in the campaigns on the northern front. They scored victories against [[Wei Bao]]'s forces, the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] army at the [[Battle of Jingxing]], and the combined forces of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] at the [[Battle of Wei River]]. During this time, Cao Shen was appointed as acting-Left [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] of Liu Bang's Han kingdom, and subsequently promoted to Right Chancellor. After the conquest of the Qi kingdom, Cao Shen left Han Xin and returned to Liu Bang's side to join him in resisting Xiang Yu. Liu Bang later sent Cao Shen to suppress the remnants of Qi.\n\nIn 202 BC, Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and unified China under his rule. Liu Bang became the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] and his dynasty was named \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\". He was historically known as \"Emperor Gao\" (or Emperor Gaozu). When rewarding his subjects, Gaozu named Cao Shen as the person who made the most contributions in battle. However, Cao Shen resigned from his post as Right [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]]. In 201 BC, Cao Shen was appointed as a chancellor to Liu Fei (Gaozu's eldest son). He was also conferred the title of \"Marquis of Pingyang\" (\u5e73\u967d\u4faf) and given 10,630 households in his marquisate.\n==As chancellor==\n[[File:Cao Shen Tomb.jpg|thumb|Cao Shen Tomb]]\n\nWhile serving as chancellor, Cao Shen sought the help of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars in governing Qi but was not impressed by their ideas. After discussing with a scholar called Gai Gong, Cao Shen was influenced by the [[Huang-Lao]] (\u9ec3\u8001) school of thought, which used a mix of persuasion and coercion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uGZIziWmlmsC&pg=PA49&dq=%22cao+can%22+%22han+dynasty%22&sig=fZ_1FXqGnJYkqhmCPDe0-fHDnbw ''Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics'' by Zhengyuan Fu, pg 49]</ref> Cao Shen followed Gai Gong's advice to implement policies to restore social stability and frequently consulted Gai Gong on how to govern Qi.\n\nIn 196{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, he commanded the Qi forces that assisted [[Emperor Gao of Han|the emperor]] in suppressing [[Chen Xi (rebel)|Chen Xi]]'s rebellion<ref name=heh>{{harvp|Hung|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ws7jZr7AriIC&pg=PA202 202]}}.</ref> in [[Dai (Han)|Dai]] (present-day northern [[Shanxi]] and northwestern [[Hebei]]).\n\nIn 193 BC, the chancellor [[Xiao He]] died and was succeeded by Cao Shen. Cao Shen spent his time drinking and feasting, and maintained well Xiao He's system of governance but did not implement any new changes.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPd1_j3pz-oC&pg=PA350&dq=%22cao+can%22+%22han+dynasty%22&sig=a_AQry2IXhmiIj4lBaUgWl2aQqA ''Social Power and Legal Culture: Litigation Masters in Late Imperial China'' by Melissa Ann Macauley, pg 350]</ref> When [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] asked him why he did not change the system, Cao Shen replied that he was not as good as Xiao He and did not want to make changes for fear of negatively affecting the system left behind by Xiao. This became the origin of a Chinese idiom, ''Xiao Gui Cao Sui'' (\u8427\u89c4\u66f9\u968f; lit. \"Cao following Xiao's rules\"), which is used to describe the continuation of the work of one's predecessor.\n\n==Appraisal==\nThe historian [[Sima Qian]] commented in ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' that he felt that among all of Liu Bang's subjects, Cao Shen's contributions in battle was second only to [[Han Xin]]. Commenting on Cao Shen's role as chancellor, Sima Qian mentioned that Cao had done well in preserving [[Xiao He]]'s system of governance and achieved the peace and stability desired by the people.\n==Family and descendants==\nCao Shen's son, Cao Zhu (\u66f9\u7a8b; died 161 BC), inherited his father's marquis title \"Marquis of Pingyang\". Cao Zhu was in turn succeeded by his son, Cao Qi (\u66f9\u5947; died 153 BC), who helped [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] suppress the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]]. Cao Qi's son, Cao Shi (\u66f9\u6642; died 131 BC), married [[Princess Pingyang (Han dynasty)|Princess Pingyang]], one of Emperor Jing's daughters. Cao Shi's son, Cao Xiang (\u66f9\u8944; died 115 BC), married Princess Wei (a daughter of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] and [[Empress Wei Zifu]]) and served as a general in the [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|Han campaigns against the Xiongnu]].

He participated in the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] on Liu Bang ([[Emperor Gaozu of Han]])'s side and contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty.\n\n==Early life==\nCao Shen was from [[Pei County]] in present-day [[Jiangsu]] and he served as a prison warden in his early days. He was a close friend of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]. Once, Liu Bang was tasked with escorting some convicts to [[Mount Li]] to become labourers, but some prisoners escaped and Liu was forced to become a fugitive. He sought refuge with his followers on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Henan]]) and maintained secret contact with Cao Shen and [[Xiao He]]. In 209 BC, after the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] broke out, the magistrate of Pei County considered rebelling against the [[Qin dynasty]] as well, so he heeded Cao Shen and Xiao He's advice to invite Liu Bang back to support him. However, the magistrate changed his mind later and denied Liu Bang entry into the city. He was worried that Xiao He and Cao Shen might open the city gates for Liu Bang so he planned to have them killed, but Xiao and Cao managed to escape and join Liu. The townsfolk rebelled against the magistrate and killed him and allowed Liu Bang and his men to enter. Liu Bang built up his rebel army in Pei County and Cao Shen served as one of his advisors.\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\nCao Shen defeated the Qin armies led by Xue Guo, Hu Ling and Fang Yu, and was promoted to a high rank by Liu Bang for his contributions. Cao Shen defeated [[Zhang Han (Qin dynasty)|Zhang Han]]'s army and drove Zhang towards [[Puyang]]. He returned to help Liu Bang, who was trapped at Yongqiu, and defeated Li You, the Qin general defending Sanchuan. By then, Cao Shen had conquered two fiefs and 122 counties in total. In the following battles against Qin, Cao Shen defeated the Qin generals Wang Li and Zhao Ben and captured the Wu and Yao passes leading to [[Xianyang]] (the Qin capital).\n\n==Chu\u2013Han Contention==\nAfter the fall of the Qin dynasty, Liu Bang received the title of \"King of [[Han Dynasty|Han]]\" from Xiang Yu, and was relocated to [[Hanzhong]]. Liu Bang granted Cao Shen the title of \"Marquis of Jiancheng\" (\u5efa\u6210\u4faf) and promoted him to a general rank. Cao Shen helped Liu Bang conquer the [[Three Qins]]. During the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]], a power struggle between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, Cao Shen joined [[Han Xin]]'s army in the campaigns on the northern front. They scored victories against [[Wei Bao]]'s forces, the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] army at the [[Battle of Jingxing]], and the combined forces of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] at the [[Battle of Wei River]]. During this time, Cao Shen was appointed as acting-Left [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] of Liu Bang's Han kingdom, and subsequently promoted to Right Chancellor. After the conquest of the Qi kingdom, Cao Shen left Han Xin and returned to Liu Bang's side to join him in resisting Xiang Yu. Liu Bang later sent Cao Shen to suppress the remnants of Qi.\n\nIn 202 BC, Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and unified China under his rule. Liu Bang became the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] and his dynasty was named \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\". He was historically known as \"Emperor Gao\" (or Emperor Gaozu). When rewarding his subjects, Gaozu named Cao Shen as the person who made the most contributions in battle. However, Cao Shen resigned from his post as Right [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]]. In 201 BC, Cao Shen was appointed as a chancellor to Liu Fei (Gaozu's eldest son). He was also conferred the title of \"Marquis of Pingyang\" (\u5e73\u967d\u4faf) and given 10,630 households in his marquisate.\n==As chancellor==\n[[File:Cao Shen Tomb.jpg|thumb|Cao Shen Tomb]]\n\nWhile serving as chancellor, Cao Shen sought the help of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars in governing Qi but was not impressed by their ideas. After discussing with a scholar called Gai Gong, Cao Shen was influenced by the [[Huang-Lao]] (\u9ec3\u8001) school of thought, which used a mix of persuasion and coercion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uGZIziWmlmsC&pg=PA49&dq=%22cao+can%22+%22han+dynasty%22&sig=fZ_1FXqGnJYkqhmCPDe0-fHDnbw ''Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics'' by Zhengyuan Fu, pg 49]</ref> Cao Shen followed Gai Gong's advice to implement policies to restore social stability and frequently consulted Gai Gong on how to govern Qi.\n\nIn 196{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, he commanded the Qi forces that assisted [[Emperor Gao of Han|the emperor]] in suppressing [[Chen Xi (rebel)|Chen Xi]]'s rebellion<ref name=heh>{{harvp|Hung|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ws7jZr7AriIC&pg=PA202 202]}}.</ref> in [[Dai (Han)|Dai]] (present-day northern [[Shanxi]] and northwestern [[Hebei]]).\n\nIn 193 BC, the chancellor [[Xiao He]] died and was succeeded by Cao Shen. Cao Shen spent his time drinking and feasting, and maintained well Xiao He's system of governance but did not implement any new changes.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPd1_j3pz-oC&pg=PA350&dq=%22cao+can%22+%22han+dynasty%22&sig=a_AQry2IXhmiIj4lBaUgWl2aQqA ''Social Power and Legal Culture: Litigation Masters in Late Imperial China'' by Melissa Ann Macauley, pg 350]</ref> When [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] asked him why he did not change the system, Cao Shen replied that he was not as good as Xiao He and did not want to make changes for fear of negatively affecting the system left behind by Xiao. This became the origin of a Chinese idiom, ''Xiao Gui Cao Sui'' (\u8427\u89c4\u66f9\u968f; lit. \"Cao following Xiao's rules\"), which is used to describe the continuation of the work of one's predecessor.\n\n==Appraisal==\nThe historian [[Sima Qian]] commented in ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' that he felt that among all of Liu Bang's subjects, Cao Shen's contributions in battle was second only to [[Han Xin]]. Commenting on Cao Shen's role as chancellor, Sima Qian mentioned that Cao had done well in preserving [[Xiao He]]'s system of governance and achieved the peace and stability desired by the people.\n==Family and descendants==\nCao Shen's son, Cao Zhu (\u66f9\u7a8b; died 161 BC), inherited his father's marquis title \"Marquis of Pingyang\". Cao Zhu was in turn succeeded by his son, Cao Qi (\u66f9\u5947; died 153 BC), who helped [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] suppress the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]]. Cao Qi's son, Cao Shi (\u66f9\u6642; died 131 BC), married [[Princess Pingyang (Han dynasty)|Princess Pingyang]], one of Emperor Jing's daughters. Cao Shi's son, Cao Xiang (\u66f9\u8944; died 115 BC), married Princess Wei (a daughter of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] and [[Empress Wei Zifu]]) and served as a general in the [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|Han campaigns against the Xiongnu]]. Cao Xiang's son, Cao Zong (\u66f9\u5b97; died 91 BC), was implicated in [[Emperor Wu of Han#Crown Prince Ju revolt|a plot to overthrow Emperor Wu]] in 91 BC and was stripped off the marquis title he inherited from his ancestor.

{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

the newspapers listing the match between North Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Arthur Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Iles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = Arthur Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = [[George Iles]] 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

the newspapers listing the match between North Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2-3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions.

It is spoken by the [[Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria]].<ref>[http://stewartspointrancheria.com/about-us.html About Us.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140947/http://stewartspointrancheria.com/about-us.html |date=2011-07-16 }} ''Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of Stewarts Point Rancheria.''

In the orthography established by Robert Oswalt, long vowels are represented by a [[interpunct#Letter|raised dot]] (\ua78f).\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Short]]&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Long]]&nbsp;\n|-\n! &nbsp;[[Front vowel|Front]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Back vowel|Back]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Front&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Back&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[High vowel|High]] (close)'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|i}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|i\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Mid vowel|Mid]]'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|e}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|e\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Low vowel|Low]] (open)'''&nbsp;\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a}}\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a\u02d0}}\n|}\nVowel length is contrastive in pairs such as ''\u0294ihya'' \"bone\" versus ''\u0294ihya:'' \"wind\", and ''dono'' \"hill, mountain\" versus ''dono:'' \"uphill\".\n\n===Consonants===\nKashaya has the consonants shown in the chart below, following the transcription style established by Oswalt (1961). The letter '''c''' represents the affricate {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}, which patterns phonologically as a palatal stop. The coronal stops differ not so much in the location of the contact against the top of the mouth as in the configuration of the tongue. The dental stop '''t''' is described by Oswalt (1961) as post-dental among older speakers but as interdental among younger speakers more heavily influenced by English, similar to the place of articulation of {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. This dental stop has a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] articulation perhaps best transcribed in IPA as {{IPA|/t\u033b/}}.

The voiced stops /b, d/ are the realization of /m\u02bc, n\u02bc/ in [[Syllable onset|onset position]].\n\n===Syllable structure===\nIn the normal case, every [[syllable]] requires a single [[Syllable onset|onset]] consonant; no onset [[Consonant cluster|clusters]] are permitted. In most contexts, the [[Syllable rime|rhyme]] consists of a vowel that may be long or followed by a single consonant in the [[Syllable coda|coda]], resulting in the possible syllables CV, CV\ua789, and CVC. Examples of these structures are ''duwi'' \"coyote\", ''mo\ua789de\ua789'' \"is running (non-final)\", and ''k\u02b0o\u0161ci\u0294'' \"to bow\".\n\nA few [[loanword]]s do have an onset cluster, such as ''fr\u00e9\ua789nu'' \"bridle\" and ''st\u00fa\ua789fa'' \"stove\" (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''freno'', ''estufa''). Loans may also have [[Syllable weight|superheavy]] CV\ua789C syllables, since [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] vowels in the source language are typically borrowed with a long vowel: ''p\u00f3\ua789spara'' \"match\", ''k\u00fa\ua789lpa'' \"fault\", ''p\u00e9\ua789\u010d\u02b0ka'' \"brick\" (Spanish ''f\u00f3sforo'', ''culpa''; [[Russian language|Russian]] ''p\u00e9\u010dka'' \"oven\"). An exceptional word with CVCC is ''hu\u0294\u00fay\u1e6d\u02bcbo\u1e6d\u02bcbo'' \"gnat\".\n\nSuperheavy CV\ua789C and CVCC syllables are well attested word-finally in specific verb forms. For example, the Suppositional suffix /ins\u02bc/ can be final as in /mo-ala-ins\u02bc/ yielding ''mo\ua789lans\u02bc'' \"he must have run down\". More typically a superheavy syllable occurs when the rightmost suffix is one of several evidential suffixes containing an /a/ vowel that deletes when no other suffix follows, such as the Circumstantial /qa/ in ''sinamq\u02b0'' \"he must have drowned\" and the Visual /ya/ in ''moma\ua789y'' \"I saw it run in\".\n\n===Stress===\nThe determination of [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] is quite complex and the main stress can fall on any of the first five syllables in a phrase, depending on various factors. According to the analysis in Buckley (1994), [[Iamb (foot)|iambs]] are constructed from left to right and the leftmost [[Metrical foot|foot]] generally receives the main stress: ''(mom\u00e1c\u02b0)(mela)'' \"I ran in\", ''(k\u00e9l)(mac\u02b0)'' \"he is peeking in there\". Non-initial feet do not receive secondary stress but lead to lengthening of vowels in open syllables (which however does not apply to word-final vowels nor to a large set of suffixes occurring toward the end of the word). The initial syllable is [[Extrametricality|extrametrical]] unless the word begins with a [[monosyllabic]] root, as in the case of /mo/ \"run\". For example, the footing in ''ca(q\u02b0am\u00e1\ua789)(lawi\ua789)(bi\u0294)'' \"start to cut downward\" with the root /caq\u02b0am/ \"cut\" skips the first syllable, while in ''(mom\u00fa\ua789)(lic\u02bce\ua789)(duce\ua789)du'' \"keep running all the way around\" this is blocked by the short root /mo/ \"run\".\n\nThe pattern is further complicated when the first foot begins on a syllable that has a long vowel, as in ''di\ua789c\u02bc-'' \"tell\". If the following syllable is closed, the stress shifts to the foot that contains that syllable: ''(di\ua789)(c\u02bc\u00e1h)(qaw)'' \"cause to bring a message out here\". If the long vowel is followed by a CV syllable, i.e. if the initial sequence to be footed is CV\ua789CV, the length moves rightward to create CVCV\ua789 and the stress similarly shifts to the next foot: ''(dic\u02bca\ua789)(qoc\u02bc\u00ed)'' \"bring a message out!\".  Combined with extrametricality, this can lead to stress as far in as the fifth syllable: ''mu(naci\ua789)(duc\u00e9\ua789)du'' \"always be too shy\" from the root /muna\ua789c/ \"be shy\"; this verb forms a minimal pair with /munac/ \"gather\", which lacks stress shift in ''mu(nac\u00ed\ua789)(duce\ua789)du'' \"always gather\".\n\nWhile iambic lengthening is determined by footing within a word, stress can be reassigned at the phrasal level across word boundaries: ''q\u02bco\u0294(di \u0294\u00ed)(ce\ua789)du'' \"be good!\" where ''q\u02bco\u0294di'' is the adjective \"good\" and the remainder is the imperative verb.\n\n===Phonological processes===\nA large number of processes affect the realization of underlying sounds in Kashaya. A representative sample is given here.\n* The glottalized nasals /m\u02bc, n\u02bc/ surface unchanged in the syllable coda, but change to voiced stops /b, d/ in the onset: cf. the root /can\u02bc/ \"see, look\" in ''can\u02bcp\u02b0i'' \"if he sees\" and ''cadu'' \"look!\".\n* The default vowel /i/ changes to /a/ after /m/, and to /u/ after /d/ (from underlying /n\u02bc/): cf. the Imperative /i/ in ''hanoy-i'' \"limp!\", ''p\u02b0a-nem-a'' \"punch him!\", ''cad-u'' \"look!\".<ref name=\"buckley2004origin\">{{Cite conference\n| title = The Origin of a Crazy Rule: \"du\" in the Southern Pomoan Group\n| last = Buckley\n| first = Eugene\n| authorlink = | conference = Annual Meeting of The Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas\n| conferenceurl = http://linguistlist.org/ssila/ \n| location = Boston\n| url = http://babel.ling.upenn.edu/~gene/papers/ssila2004.pdf\n| date = 2004\n}}</ref>\n* Any vowel changes to /a/ after a uvular: /\u0294usaq-in/ \u2192 ''\u0294us\u00e1\ua789qan'' \"while washing the face\", /sima\ua789q-eti/ \u2192 ''sima\ua789qat\u00ed'' \"although he's asleep\".\n* Plain stops are aspirated in the coda: /da-hyut-me\u0294/ \u2192 ''dahy\u00fat\u02b0me\u0294'' \"break it!\" (formal imperative); cf. /da-hyut-i/ \u2192 ''dahyut\u00ed'' \"break it!\" (informal).\n* A uvular stop in the coda generally loses its place of articulation: /sima\ua789q-ti/ \u2192 ''simahti'' \"about to fall asleep\". Exceptions exist before certain suffixes and in loanwords such as ''taq\u02b0ma'' \"dress\" (from [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]]). [[Debuccalization]] of other stops occurs in various contexts as well.\n* An aspirated stop in a prefix dissimilates from an /h/ or an aspirated stop at the beginning of the root, similar to [[Grassmann's law|Grassmann's Law]]: cf. the prefix /p\u02b0u/ \"by blowing\" with aspiration in ''p\u02b0u-de\ua789du'' \"be blown along\" but without it in ''pu-hcew'' \"a windbreak\".\n\n==Morphology==\n\nKashaya can be classified as a [[polysynthetic language]]; it is primarily suffixing but has an important set of instrumental prefixes on verbs.\n\n===Nouns===\n\nNoun morphology is modest. The main examples are prefixes that mark possession of kinship terms. The first person has several allomorphs including the prefix ''\u0294a\ua789-'' and CV\ua789 reduplication; the latter is informal and is associated with phonologically less marked stems, no doubt derived historically from child pronunciations. The prefixes ''mi-'', ''miya\ua789-'', ''ma-'' mark second, third, and reflexive (\"one's own\"). These prefixes occur with the suffixes ''-n\u02bc'', ''-s\u02bc'' depending on the stem and prefix. Examples with /qa/ \"grandmother\" are ''miqas\u02bc'' \"your ~\", ''miy\u00e1\ua789qas\u02bc'' \"his/her/their ~\", and informal ''ka\ua789kan\u02bc'' \"my grandma\", based on /ka/ simplified from /qa/.\n\n===Verbs===\n\nVerbs take a great variety of suffixes divided into many position classes. There are also instrumental prefixes that figure crucially in the use of many verb stems.\n\n====Position classes====\n\nOswalt (1961) identifies the following position classes; it can be seen that there is far more complexity in the set of suffixes than in the prefixes.\n\n* Prefixes\n** A \u2014 Instrumental\n** B \u2014 Plural Act\n* Root\n* Inner Group Suffixes\n** I \u2014 Plural Agent\n** II \u2014 Reduplication\n** III \u2014 Essive, Terrestrial\n** IV \u2014 Semelfactive, Inceptive, Plural Act, Plural Movement\n* Middle Group Suffixes\n** Va \u2014 Directionals\n** Vb \u2014 Directionals/Inceptives\n** VI \u2014 Reflexive, Reciprocal\n** VII \u2014 Causative\n** VIII \u2014 Locomotory\n** IX \u2014 Durative\n** X \u2014 Distributive\n* Outer Group Suffixes\n** XI \u2014 Defunctive\n** XII \u2014 Negative\n** XIII \u2014 First Person Object, Remote Past, Inferential\n** XIV \u2014 Evidentials, Modals, Imperatives, Futures, Absolutive, Adverbializers\n** XVv \u2014 Nonfinal Verb, Responsive, Interrogative\n** XVn \u2014 Subjective, Objective\n** XVb \u2014 Explanatory\n\nOnly a few of the most important categories can be illustrated here.\n\n====Instrumental prefixes====\n\nMany verbs cannot occur without a prefix that provides information about the manner of the action described. These 20 instrumental prefixes, all of the shape CV, are the following.\n\n* ''ba-'' \"with the lips, snout, or beak; by speech (or hearing)\"\n* ''bi-'' \"by encircling, e.g. with the arms; by sewing, eating (esp. with a spoon)\"\n* ''ca-'' \"with the rear end, a massive or bulky object, a knife\"\n* ''cu-'' \"with a round object, flowing water, the front end; by shooting\"\n* ''c\u02b0i-'' \"by holding a small part of a larger object, e.g. a handle\"\n* ''da-'' \"with the hand (palm), paw; by waves\"\n* ''du-'' \"with the finger\"\n* ''di-'' \"by gravity, falling, a heavy weight\"\n* ''ha-'' \"with a swinging motion\"\n* ''hi-'' \"with the body\"\n* ''ma-'' \"with the sole of the foot, claws, the butt of the hand\"\n* ''mi-'' \"with the small end of a long object, the toes, nose; by kicking, smelling, counting, reading\"\n* ''mu-'' \"with a quick movement, heat, light, mind or emotions\"\n* ''p\u02b0a-'' \"with the end of a long object, the fist; by wrapping\"\n* ''p\u02b0i-'' \"with the side of a long object, the eyes, an ax, a hammer\"\n* ''p\u02b0u-'' \"by blowing\"\n* ''qa-'' \"between forces: with the teeth, by chewing, eating\"\n* ''si-'' \"by water: wetting, dissolving, slipping, floating, rain, tongue\"\n* ''\u0161a-'' \"by a long object moving lengthwise; with a mesh\"\n* ''\u0161u-'' \"by pulling, pushing and pulling; with a long flexible object\"\n\nFor example, the root /hc\u02b0a/ \"knock over\" can occur unprefixed as \"fall over\" where no agency is indicated, but is typically prefixed to expand upon the meaning: ''ba-hc\u02b0a-'' \"knock over with snout\", ''bi-hc\u02b0a-'' \"throw someone in wrestling\", ''ca-hc\u02b0a-'' \"knock over by backing into\", ''da-hc\u02b0a-'' \"push over with the hand\", ''du-hc\u02b0a-'' \"push over with the finger\", ''di-hc\u02b0a-'' \"be knocked over by a falling object\", etc.\n\n====Suffixes====\n\nA sampling of verb suffixes:\n\n* Directionals include ''-ad'' \"along, here\", ''-mul'' \"around\", ''-mad'' \"in an enclosed or defined place\", ''-aq'' \"out from here; north or west from here\".\n* Directionals/Inceptives ''-ala'' \"down\" and ''-ibic'' \"up, away\" also mark the beginning of an action.\n* Causative ''-hqa''.\n* Durative ''-ad'' with many other allomorphs, such as ''-id'', ''-cid'', ''-med'', depending on the preceding segment and the length of the stem.\n* Evidentials include quotative ''-do'', circumstantial ''-qa'', and visual ''-ya''. The /a/ of the Evidentials deletes when no other suffix follows.\n* Absolutive ''-w'' after vowels, ''-u'' after /d/, and ''-\u0294'' after other consonants.\n\nPosition class XIV (Evidentials, Modals, Imperatives, Futures, Absolutive, Adverbializers) represents the largest set of suffixes and is the only slot that is obligatorily filled in every verb.\n\nA few examples of verbs with many affixes, the root shown in bold:\n* ''p\u02b0a-'''\u0294di'''-c-\u00e1\ua789d-ala-w'' \"to poke with the end of a stick while moving downhill\"\n* ''c\u02b0i-'''\u0294d\u00ed'''-ccic\u02bc-a\ua789dad-u'' \"to walk along picking up things and pulling them close to oneself\"\n* '''''nohp\u02b0o'''-y\u00ed\u0294-ci\u0294-do'' \"it's said that those former people used to live (like that)\"\n\n==Syntax==\n\nThe basic word order of Kashaya is quite flexible in main clauses; however, the default location for the verb is final, and this position is required in subordinate clauses. A notable feature is that when a verb does occur in non-final position, depending on other suffixes present it takes the Nonfinal Verb ending ''-e\ua789''. Some possible orders are illustrated here with the simple sentence \"I see that dog\", containing the elements ''\u0294a'' \"I (subj)\", ''mul'' \"that (obj)\", ''hayu'' \"dog\", ''can\u02bc-'' \"see\".\n* ''hayu mul \u0294a can\u02bc''\n* ''hayu \u0294a mul can\u02bc''\n* ''hayu \u0294a cade\ua789 mul''\n* ''cade\ua789 \u0294a hayu mul''\nOswalt (1961) reports that younger speakers tend to favor the SVO order typical of English.\n\n===Case marking===\n\nThe most important case markers are subjective and objective case. (Others are the vocative and comitative, of more limited application.) Most nouns are marked with the subjective ''\u0294em'' or the objective ''\u0294el''; these are morphologically complex and contain the actual case markers /m/ and /l/, found with verbal expressions. \n* ''\u0294acac\u02bc em \u0294ima\ua789ta \u0294\u00e9l cadu'' \u2014 \"the man (''\u0294acac'') sees the woman (''\u0294ima\ua789ta'')\"\n* ''\u0294ahca q\u00e1wiwa-l cad\u00e9\ua789 \u0294a'' \u2014 \"I see the house (''\u0294ahca'') he is building (''qawiwa-'')\"\nPersonal names take the suffix ''-to'' in the objective case, zero in the subjective.\n\nPronouns have distinct forms in subjective and objective case; the forms are not easily analyzed but the objective case generally ends in ''-(a)l'' or ''-to''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | Singular\n! colspan=2 | Plural\n|-\n! | Subjective\n! | Objective\n! | Subjective\n! | Objective\n|-\n| '''1st person'''\n| ''\u0294a(:)''\n| ''to(:)''\n| ''ya''\n| ''yal''\n|-\n| '''2nd person'''\n| ''ma''\n| ''mito''\n| ''maya''\n| ''mayal''\n|-\n| '''3rd person masc'''\n| ''mu\ua789kin\u02bc''\n| ''mu\ua789kito, mu\ua789bal''\n| rowspan=2 | ''ma\ua789cac''\n| rowspan=2 | ''ma\ua789cal''\n|-\n| '''3rd person fem'''\n| ''man\u02bc''\n| ''ma\ua789dal''\n|-\n| '''Reflexive'''\n| ''ti(\ua789)''\n| ''tito''\n| colspan=2 | same as singular\n|}\n\nDemonstratives are also distinguished for case; they are given here as subjective/objective:\n* ''mu(\ua789) / mul'' \u2014 \"that, this, it, those, these, they (vague demonstrative or anaphoric reference)\"\n* ''ma\u0294u / ma\u0294al'' \u2014 \"this, these (the closer object)\"\n* ''ha\u0294u / ha\u0294al'' \u2014 \"that, those (the further object)\"\n\n===Switch reference===\n\n[[Switch reference]] refers to markings according to whether a subordinate\nverb has the same or different subject as the main verb. In Kashaya it also marks whether the time of the\naction is the same, or preceding the main verb action in the\npast or future. There is no consistent expression of\nthese categories except for the element /p\u02b0i/ in both future\nsuffixes, but the remaining /la/ is not identifiable as a separate suffix.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! | &nbsp;\n! | Simultaneous\n! | Past\n! | Future\n|-\n| Same subject\n| ''-in''\n| ''-ba''\n| ''-p\u02b0i''\n|-\n| Different subject\n| ''-em''\n| ''-wli, -\u0294li''\n| ''-p\u02b0ila''\n|}\n\nThe suffix containing /li/ is realized as ''-wli'' after vowels, ''-u\ua789li'' (or /uwli/) after ''d'', and ''-\u0294li'' after other consonants; this [[allomorphy]] is related to that of the very common Absolutive suffix, ''-w, -u, -\u0294''.  A few examples of these morphemes:\n\n* ''t\u02bceti\ua789b\u00edc\u02b0-p\u02b0i maya miy\u00edc\u02bck\u02b0e'' \u2014 \"you should stand up and (then) speak\" [same subject, future tense]\n* ''p\u02b0ala c\u00f3hto\u0294, duwec\u00ed\ua789d-em'' \u2014 \"he left again as night was falling\" [different subject, simultaneous]\n* ''coht\u00f3\u0294 da\ua789qac\u02bc-ba coht\u00f3\ua789y'' \u2014 \"having wanting to go, he went\" [same subject, past tense]\n* ''\u0294ama: q\u02b0a\u0294a\ua789d\u00fa-\u0294li, cohto\u0294'' \u2014 \"after morning had come, she left\" [different subject, past tense]; consonant-final stem /q\u02b0a\u0294a-aduc/\n\n== Notable Kashaya Pomo speakers ==\n* Pomo speaker Langford \"Lanny\" Roger Pinola (April 25, 1938 \u2013 April 21, 2003) lived on the Kashaya Reservation until age six.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Fimrite, Peter\n| title = Langford Pinola -- Native American storyteller - SFGate\n| work = SFGate\n| accessdate = 2013-04-08\n| date = 2003-04-29\n| url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Langford-Pinola-Native-American-storyteller-2651864.php\n}}</ref>\n* [[Essie Pinola Parrish]] (1902\u20131979), a noted basketweaver, educated Kashaya children in the language, and \"compiled a Kashaya Pomo dictionary, working with Robert Oswalt, a Berkeley scholar well-known in the field of Indian linguistics.\"<ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pomoan languages]]\n* [[Pomo people]]\n* [[Fort Ross]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Buckley, Eugene (1994).

The name ''Kashaya'' corresponds to words in neighboring languages with meanings such as \"skillful\" and \"expert gambler\".  It is spoken by the [[Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria]].<ref>[http://stewartspointrancheria.com/about-us.html About Us.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140947/http://stewartspointrancheria.com/about-us.html |date=2011-07-16 }} ''Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of Stewarts Point Rancheria.''

In the orthography established by Robert Oswalt, long vowels are represented by a [[interpunct#Letter|raised dot]] (\ua78f).\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Short]]&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Long]]&nbsp;\n|-\n! &nbsp;[[Front vowel|Front]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Back vowel|Back]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Front&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Back&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[High vowel|High]] (close)'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|i}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|i\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|u\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Mid vowel|Mid]]'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPA|e}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|e\u02d0}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|o\u02d0}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Low vowel|Low]] (open)'''&nbsp;\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a}}\n| colspan=2 align=center | {{IPA|a\u02d0}}\n|}\nVowel length is contrastive in pairs such as ''\u0294ihya'' \"bone\" versus ''\u0294ihya:'' \"wind\", and ''dono'' \"hill, mountain\" versus ''dono:'' \"uphill\".\n\n===Consonants===\nKashaya has the consonants shown in the chart below, following the transcription style established by Oswalt (1961). The letter '''c''' represents the affricate {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}, which patterns phonologically as a palatal stop. The coronal stops differ not so much in the location of the contact against the top of the mouth as in the configuration of the tongue. The dental stop '''t''' is described by Oswalt (1961) as post-dental among older speakers but as interdental among younger speakers more heavily influenced by English, similar to the place of articulation of {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. This dental stop has a [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] articulation perhaps best transcribed in IPA as {{IPA|/t\u033b/}}. The alveolar stop '''\u1e6d''' is an [[Apical consonant|apical]] articulation, more precisely {{IPA|/t\u033a/}}. For younger speakers it resembles the English '''t''' in position. This chart treats aspirated and glottalized sonorants as single segments;<ref>Buckley, Eugene (1994). Theoretical aspects of Kashaya phonology and morphology. CSLI Publications, Stanford University.</ref> Oswalt analyzes them as sequences of a sonorant plus {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/\u0294/}}, from which they often derive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2|\n! align=\"center\"|[[Bilabial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! rowspan=4|[[Plosive]]\n! <small>[[Voiceless consonant|plain]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''p'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''t''' [t\u033b]\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u1e6d''' [t\u033a]\n| align=\"center\"|'''c''' [t\u0361\u0283]\n| align=\"center\"|'''k'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''q'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u0294'''\n|-\n! <small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''p\u02b0'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u02b0''' [t\u033b\u02b0]\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u1e6d\u02b0''' [t\u033a\u02b0]\n| align=\"center\"|'''c\u02b0''' [t\u0361\u0283\u02b0]\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02b0'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02b0'''\n| \n|-\n! <small>[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''p\u02bc'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u02bc''' [t\u033b\u02bc]\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u1e6d\u02bc''' [t\u033a\u02bc]\n| align=\"center\"|'''c\u02bc''' [t\u0361\u0283\u02bc]\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02bc'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02bc'''\n|\n|-\n!<small> [[Voiced consonant|voiced]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''b'''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''d''' [d\u033a]\n|\n| \n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Fricative]]\n! <small>[[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|('''f''')\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''s'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u0161''' [\u0283]\n|\n| \n| align=\"center\"|'''h'''\n|-\n! <small>[[Ejective consonant|ejective]]</small>\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''s\u02bc'''\n| \n|\n| \n| \n|-\n! rowspan=3|[[Nasal stop|Nasal]]\n! <small>[[Phonation|plain]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''m'''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''n'''\n| \n| \n|\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''m\u02b0'''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''n\u02b0'''\n| \n| \n|\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Glottalization|glottalized]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''m\u02bc'''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''n\u02bc'''\n| \n|\n| \n|\n|-\n! rowspan=3|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n! <small>[[Phonation|plain]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''w'''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''l''' ('''r''')\n| align=\"center\"|'''y''' [j]\n| \n|\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''w\u02b0'''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''l\u02b0''' ('''r\u02b0''')\n| align=\"center\"|'''y\u02b0''' [j\u02b0]\n| \n|\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Glottalization|glottalized]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''w\u02bc'''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''l\u02bc''' ('''r\u02bc''')\n| align=\"center\"|'''y\u02bc''' [j\u02bc]\n|\n| \n|\n|}\n\nThe consonants /f, r/ occur only in loanwords; due to the influence of English, loans from Spanish and Russian receive a pronunciation of /r/ like that in American English. The voiced stops /b, d/ are the realization of /m\u02bc, n\u02bc/ in [[Syllable onset|onset position]].\n\n===Syllable structure===\nIn the normal case, every [[syllable]] requires a single [[Syllable onset|onset]] consonant; no onset [[Consonant cluster|clusters]] are permitted. In most contexts, the [[Syllable rime|rhyme]] consists of a vowel that may be long or followed by a single consonant in the [[Syllable coda|coda]], resulting in the possible syllables CV, CV\ua789, and CVC. Examples of these structures are ''duwi'' \"coyote\", ''mo\ua789de\ua789'' \"is running (non-final)\", and ''k\u02b0o\u0161ci\u0294'' \"to bow\".\n\nA few [[loanword]]s do have an onset cluster, such as ''fr\u00e9\ua789nu'' \"bridle\" and ''st\u00fa\ua789fa'' \"stove\" (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''freno'', ''estufa''). Loans may also have [[Syllable weight|superheavy]] CV\ua789C syllables, since [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] vowels in the source language are typically borrowed with a long vowel: ''p\u00f3\ua789spara'' \"match\", ''k\u00fa\ua789lpa'' \"fault\", ''p\u00e9\ua789\u010d\u02b0ka'' \"brick\" (Spanish ''f\u00f3sforo'', ''culpa''; [[Russian language|Russian]] ''p\u00e9\u010dka'' \"oven\"). An exceptional word with CVCC is ''hu\u0294\u00fay\u1e6d\u02bcbo\u1e6d\u02bcbo'' \"gnat\".\n\nSuperheavy CV\ua789C and CVCC syllables are well attested word-finally in specific verb forms. For example, the Suppositional suffix /ins\u02bc/ can be final as in /mo-ala-ins\u02bc/ yielding ''mo\ua789lans\u02bc'' \"he must have run down\". More typically a superheavy syllable occurs when the rightmost suffix is one of several evidential suffixes containing an /a/ vowel that deletes when no other suffix follows, such as the Circumstantial /qa/ in ''sinamq\u02b0'' \"he must have drowned\" and the Visual /ya/ in ''moma\ua789y'' \"I saw it run in\".\n\n===Stress===\nThe determination of [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] is quite complex and the main stress can fall on any of the first five syllables in a phrase, depending on various factors. According to the analysis in Buckley (1994), [[Iamb (foot)|iambs]] are constructed from left to right and the leftmost [[Metrical foot|foot]] generally receives the main stress: ''(mom\u00e1c\u02b0)(mela)'' \"I ran in\", ''(k\u00e9l)(mac\u02b0)'' \"he is peeking in there\". Non-initial feet do not receive secondary stress but lead to lengthening of vowels in open syllables (which however does not apply to word-final vowels nor to a large set of suffixes occurring toward the end of the word). The initial syllable is [[Extrametricality|extrametrical]] unless the word begins with a [[monosyllabic]] root, as in the case of /mo/ \"run\". For example, the footing in ''ca(q\u02b0am\u00e1\ua789)(lawi\ua789)(bi\u0294)'' \"start to cut downward\" with the root /caq\u02b0am/ \"cut\" skips the first syllable, while in ''(mom\u00fa\ua789)(lic\u02bce\ua789)(duce\ua789)du'' \"keep running all the way around\" this is blocked by the short root /mo/ \"run\".\n\nThe pattern is further complicated when the first foot begins on a syllable that has a long vowel, as in ''di\ua789c\u02bc-'' \"tell\". If the following syllable is closed, the stress shifts to the foot that contains that syllable: ''(di\ua789)(c\u02bc\u00e1h)(qaw)'' \"cause to bring a message out here\". If the long vowel is followed by a CV syllable, i.e. if the initial sequence to be footed is CV\ua789CV, the length moves rightward to create CVCV\ua789 and the stress similarly shifts to the next foot: ''(dic\u02bca\ua789)(qoc\u02bc\u00ed)'' \"bring a message out!\".  Combined with extrametricality, this can lead to stress as far in as the fifth syllable: ''mu(naci\ua789)(duc\u00e9\ua789)du'' \"always be too shy\" from the root /muna\ua789c/ \"be shy\"; this verb forms a minimal pair with /munac/ \"gather\", which lacks stress shift in ''mu(nac\u00ed\ua789)(duce\ua789)du'' \"always gather\".\n\nWhile iambic lengthening is determined by footing within a word, stress can be reassigned at the phrasal level across word boundaries: ''q\u02bco\u0294(di \u0294\u00ed)(ce\ua789)du'' \"be good!\" where ''q\u02bco\u0294di'' is the adjective \"good\" and the remainder is the imperative verb.\n\n===Phonological processes===\nA large number of processes affect the realization of underlying sounds in Kashaya. A representative sample is given here.\n* The glottalized nasals /m\u02bc, n\u02bc/ surface unchanged in the syllable coda, but change to voiced stops /b, d/ in the onset: cf. the root /can\u02bc/ \"see, look\" in ''can\u02bcp\u02b0i'' \"if he sees\" and ''cadu'' \"look!\".\n* The default vowel /i/ changes to /a/ after /m/, and to /u/ after /d/ (from underlying /n\u02bc/): cf. the Imperative /i/ in ''hanoy-i'' \"limp!\", ''p\u02b0a-nem-a'' \"punch him!\", ''cad-u'' \"look!\".<ref name=\"buckley2004origin\">{{Cite conference\n| title = The Origin of a Crazy Rule: \"du\" in the Southern Pomoan Group\n| last = Buckley\n| first = Eugene\n| authorlink = | conference = Annual Meeting of The Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas\n| conferenceurl = http://linguistlist.org/ssila/ \n| location = Boston\n| url = http://babel.ling.upenn.edu/~gene/papers/ssila2004.pdf\n| date = 2004\n}}</ref>\n* Any vowel changes to /a/ after a uvular: /\u0294usaq-in/ \u2192 ''\u0294us\u00e1\ua789qan'' \"while washing the face\", /sima\ua789q-eti/ \u2192 ''sima\ua789qat\u00ed'' \"although he's asleep\".\n* Plain stops are aspirated in the coda: /da-hyut-me\u0294/ \u2192 ''dahy\u00fat\u02b0me\u0294'' \"break it!\" (formal imperative); cf. /da-hyut-i/ \u2192 ''dahyut\u00ed'' \"break it!\" (informal).\n* A uvular stop in the coda generally loses its place of articulation: /sima\ua789q-ti/ \u2192 ''simahti'' \"about to fall asleep\". Exceptions exist before certain suffixes and in loanwords such as ''taq\u02b0ma'' \"dress\" (from [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]]). [[Debuccalization]] of other stops occurs in various contexts as well.\n* An aspirated stop in a prefix dissimilates from an /h/ or an aspirated stop at the beginning of the root, similar to [[Grassmann's law|Grassmann's Law]]: cf. the prefix /p\u02b0u/ \"by blowing\" with aspiration in ''p\u02b0u-de\ua789du'' \"be blown along\" but without it in ''pu-hcew'' \"a windbreak\".\n\n==Morphology==\n\nKashaya can be classified as a [[polysynthetic language]]; it is primarily suffixing but has an important set of instrumental prefixes on verbs.\n\n===Nouns===\n\nNoun morphology is modest. The main examples are prefixes that mark possession of kinship terms. The first person has several allomorphs including the prefix ''\u0294a\ua789-'' and CV\ua789 reduplication; the latter is informal and is associated with phonologically less marked stems, no doubt derived historically from child pronunciations. The prefixes ''mi-'', ''miya\ua789-'', ''ma-'' mark second, third, and reflexive (\"one's own\"). These prefixes occur with the suffixes ''-n\u02bc'', ''-s\u02bc'' depending on the stem and prefix. Examples with /qa/ \"grandmother\" are ''miqas\u02bc'' \"your ~\", ''miy\u00e1\ua789qas\u02bc'' \"his/her/their ~\", and informal ''ka\ua789kan\u02bc'' \"my grandma\", based on /ka/ simplified from /qa/.\n\n===Verbs===\n\nVerbs take a great variety of suffixes divided into many position classes. There are also instrumental prefixes that figure crucially in the use of many verb stems.\n\n====Position classes====\n\nOswalt (1961) identifies the following position classes; it can be seen that there is far more complexity in the set of suffixes than in the prefixes.\n\n* Prefixes\n** A \u2014 Instrumental\n** B \u2014 Plural Act\n* Root\n* Inner Group Suffixes\n** I \u2014 Plural Agent\n** II \u2014 Reduplication\n** III \u2014 Essive, Terrestrial\n** IV \u2014 Semelfactive, Inceptive, Plural Act, Plural Movement\n* Middle Group Suffixes\n** Va \u2014 Directionals\n** Vb \u2014 Directionals/Inceptives\n** VI \u2014 Reflexive, Reciprocal\n** VII \u2014 Causative\n** VIII \u2014 Locomotory\n** IX \u2014 Durative\n** X \u2014 Distributive\n* Outer Group Suffixes\n** XI \u2014 Defunctive\n** XII \u2014 Negative\n** XIII \u2014 First Person Object, Remote Past, Inferential\n** XIV \u2014 Evidentials, Modals, Imperatives, Futures, Absolutive, Adverbializers\n** XVv \u2014 Nonfinal Verb, Responsive, Interrogative\n** XVn \u2014 Subjective, Objective\n** XVb \u2014 Explanatory\n\nOnly a few of the most important categories can be illustrated here.\n\n====Instrumental prefixes====\n\nMany verbs cannot occur without a prefix that provides information about the manner of the action described. These 20 instrumental prefixes, all of the shape CV, are the following.\n\n* ''ba-'' \"with the lips, snout, or beak; by speech (or hearing)\"\n* ''bi-'' \"by encircling, e.g. with the arms; by sewing, eating (esp. with a spoon)\"\n* ''ca-'' \"with the rear end, a massive or bulky object, a knife\"\n* ''cu-'' \"with a round object, flowing water, the front end; by shooting\"\n* ''c\u02b0i-'' \"by holding a small part of a larger object, e.g. a handle\"\n* ''da-'' \"with the hand (palm), paw; by waves\"\n* ''du-'' \"with the finger\"\n* ''di-'' \"by gravity, falling, a heavy weight\"\n* ''ha-'' \"with a swinging motion\"\n* ''hi-'' \"with the body\"\n* ''ma-'' \"with the sole of the foot, claws, the butt of the hand\"\n* ''mi-'' \"with the small end of a long object, the toes, nose; by kicking, smelling, counting, reading\"\n* ''mu-'' \"with a quick movement, heat, light, mind or emotions\"\n* ''p\u02b0a-'' \"with the end of a long object, the fist; by wrapping\"\n* ''p\u02b0i-'' \"with the side of a long object, the eyes, an ax, a hammer\"\n* ''p\u02b0u-'' \"by blowing\"\n* ''qa-'' \"between forces: with the teeth, by chewing, eating\"\n* ''si-'' \"by water: wetting, dissolving, slipping, floating, rain, tongue\"\n* ''\u0161a-'' \"by a long object moving lengthwise; with a mesh\"\n* ''\u0161u-'' \"by pulling, pushing and pulling; with a long flexible object\"\n\nFor example, the root /hc\u02b0a/ \"knock over\" can occur unprefixed as \"fall over\" where no agency is indicated, but is typically prefixed to expand upon the meaning: ''ba-hc\u02b0a-'' \"knock over with snout\", ''bi-hc\u02b0a-'' \"throw someone in wrestling\", ''ca-hc\u02b0a-'' \"knock over by backing into\", ''da-hc\u02b0a-'' \"push over with the hand\", ''du-hc\u02b0a-'' \"push over with the finger\", ''di-hc\u02b0a-'' \"be knocked over by a falling object\", etc.\n\n====Suffixes====\n\nA sampling of verb suffixes:\n\n* Directionals include ''-ad'' \"along, here\", ''-mul'' \"around\", ''-mad'' \"in an enclosed or defined place\", ''-aq'' \"out from here; north or west from here\".\n* Directionals/Inceptives ''-ala'' \"down\" and ''-ibic'' \"up, away\" also mark the beginning of an action.\n* Causative ''-hqa''.\n* Durative ''-ad'' with many other allomorphs, such as ''-id'', ''-cid'', ''-med'', depending on the preceding segment and the length of the stem.\n* Evidentials include quotative ''-do'', circumstantial ''-qa'', and visual ''-ya''. The /a/ of the Evidentials deletes when no other suffix follows.\n* Absolutive ''-w'' after vowels, ''-u'' after /d/, and ''-\u0294'' after other consonants.\n\nPosition class XIV (Evidentials, Modals, Imperatives, Futures, Absolutive, Adverbializers) represents the largest set of suffixes and is the only slot that is obligatorily filled in every verb.\n\nA few examples of verbs with many affixes, the root shown in bold:\n* ''p\u02b0a-'''\u0294di'''-c-\u00e1\ua789d-ala-w'' \"to poke with the end of a stick while moving downhill\"\n* ''c\u02b0i-'''\u0294d\u00ed'''-ccic\u02bc-a\ua789dad-u'' \"to walk along picking up things and pulling them close to oneself\"\n* '''''nohp\u02b0o'''-y\u00ed\u0294-ci\u0294-do'' \"it's said that those former people used to live (like that)\"\n\n==Syntax==\n\nThe basic word order of Kashaya is quite flexible in main clauses; however, the default location for the verb is final, and this position is required in subordinate clauses. A notable feature is that when a verb does occur in non-final position, depending on other suffixes present it takes the Nonfinal Verb ending ''-e\ua789''. Some possible orders are illustrated here with the simple sentence \"I see that dog\", containing the elements ''\u0294a'' \"I (subj)\", ''mul'' \"that (obj)\", ''hayu'' \"dog\", ''can\u02bc-'' \"see\".\n* ''hayu mul \u0294a can\u02bc''\n* ''hayu \u0294a mul can\u02bc''\n* ''hayu \u0294a cade\ua789 mul''\n* ''cade\ua789 \u0294a hayu mul''\nOswalt (1961) reports that younger speakers tend to favor the SVO order typical of English.\n\n===Case marking===\n\nThe most important case markers are subjective and objective case. (Others are the vocative and comitative, of more limited application.) Most nouns are marked with the subjective ''\u0294em'' or the objective ''\u0294el''; these are morphologically complex and contain the actual case markers /m/ and /l/, found with verbal expressions. \n* ''\u0294acac\u02bc em \u0294ima\ua789ta \u0294\u00e9l cadu'' \u2014 \"the man (''\u0294acac'') sees the woman (''\u0294ima\ua789ta'')\"\n* ''\u0294ahca q\u00e1wiwa-l cad\u00e9\ua789 \u0294a'' \u2014 \"I see the house (''\u0294ahca'') he is building (''qawiwa-'')\"\nPersonal names take the suffix ''-to'' in the objective case, zero in the subjective.\n\nPronouns have distinct forms in subjective and objective case; the forms are not easily analyzed but the objective case generally ends in ''-(a)l'' or ''-to''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | Singular\n! colspan=2 | Plural\n|-\n! | Subjective\n! | Objective\n! | Subjective\n! | Objective\n|-\n| '''1st person'''\n| ''\u0294a(:)''\n| ''to(:)''\n| ''ya''\n| ''yal''\n|-\n| '''2nd person'''\n| ''ma''\n| ''mito''\n| ''maya''\n| ''mayal''\n|-\n| '''3rd person masc'''\n| ''mu\ua789kin\u02bc''\n| ''mu\ua789kito, mu\ua789bal''\n| rowspan=2 | ''ma\ua789cac''\n| rowspan=2 | ''ma\ua789cal''\n|-\n| '''3rd person fem'''\n| ''man\u02bc''\n| ''ma\ua789dal''\n|-\n| '''Reflexive'''\n| ''ti(\ua789)''\n| ''tito''\n| colspan=2 | same as singular\n|}\n\nDemonstratives are also distinguished for case; they are given here as subjective/objective:\n* ''mu(\ua789) / mul'' \u2014 \"that, this, it, those, these, they (vague demonstrative or anaphoric reference)\"\n* ''ma\u0294u / ma\u0294al'' \u2014 \"this, these (the closer object)\"\n* ''ha\u0294u / ha\u0294al'' \u2014 \"that, those (the further object)\"\n\n===Switch reference===\n\n[[Switch reference]] refers to markings according to whether a subordinate\nverb has the same or different subject as the main verb. In Kashaya it also marks whether the time of the\naction is the same, or preceding the main verb action in the\npast or future. There is no consistent expression of\nthese categories except for the element /p\u02b0i/ in both future\nsuffixes, but the remaining /la/ is not identifiable as a separate suffix.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! | &nbsp;\n! | Simultaneous\n! | Past\n! | Future\n|-\n| Same subject\n| ''-in''\n| ''-ba''\n| ''-p\u02b0i''\n|-\n| Different subject\n| ''-em''\n| ''-wli, -\u0294li''\n| ''-p\u02b0ila''\n|}\n\nThe suffix containing /li/ is realized as ''-wli'' after vowels, ''-u\ua789li'' (or /uwli/) after ''d'', and ''-\u0294li'' after other consonants; this [[allomorphy]] is related to that of the very common Absolutive suffix, ''-w, -u, -\u0294''.  A few examples of these morphemes:\n\n* ''t\u02bceti\ua789b\u00edc\u02b0-p\u02b0i maya miy\u00edc\u02bck\u02b0e'' \u2014 \"you should stand up and (then) speak\" [same subject, future tense]\n* ''p\u02b0ala c\u00f3hto\u0294, duwec\u00ed\ua789d-em'' \u2014 \"he left again as night was falling\" [different subject, simultaneous]\n* ''coht\u00f3\u0294 da\ua789qac\u02bc-ba coht\u00f3\ua789y'' \u2014 \"having wanting to go, he went\" [same subject, past tense]\n* ''\u0294ama: q\u02b0a\u0294a\ua789d\u00fa-\u0294li, cohto\u0294'' \u2014 \"after morning had come, she left\" [different subject, past tense]; consonant-final stem /q\u02b0a\u0294a-aduc/\n\n== Notable Kashaya Pomo speakers ==\n* Pomo speaker Langford \"Lanny\" Roger Pinola (April 25, 1938 \u2013 April 21, 2003) lived on the Kashaya Reservation until age six.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Fimrite, Peter\n| title = Langford Pinola -- Native American storyteller - SFGate\n| work = SFGate\n| accessdate = 2013-04-08\n| date = 2003-04-29\n| url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Langford-Pinola-Native-American-storyteller-2651864.php\n}}</ref>\n* [[Essie Pinola Parrish]] (1902\u20131979), a noted basketweaver, educated Kashaya children in the language, and \"compiled a Kashaya Pomo dictionary, working with Robert Oswalt, a Berkeley scholar well-known in the field of Indian linguistics.\"<ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pomoan languages]]\n* [[Pomo people]]\n* [[Fort Ross]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Buckley, Eugene (1994).
