The ''jaraff'', who was the most important person after the king ([[Maad a Sinig]] or [[Maad Saloum]]) came from the jambur caste. The Jaraff was the equivalent of a prime minister. He was responsible for organising the coronation ceremony and for crowning the Serer kings. Where a king dies without nominating an heir ([[buumi]]), the Jaraff would step in and reign as regent until a suitable candidate can be found from the royal line. The noble council that was responsible for advising the king was also made up of jamburs as well as the ''bur kuvel/guewel'' (the chief griot of the king) who was extremely powerful and influential, and very rich in land and other assets. The buur kevel who also came from the griot caste were so powerful that they could influence a king's decision as to whether he goes to war or not. They told the king what to eat, and teach them how to eat, how to walk, to talk and to behave in society. They always accompany the king to the battlefield and recount the glory or bravery of his ancestors in battle. They retain and pass down the genealogy and family history of the king. The bur Kevel could make or break a king, and destroy the entire royal dynasty if they so wish. The abdication of Fakha Boya Fall from the throne of Saloum was led and driven by his own bur kevel. After being forced to abdicate, he was chased out of Saloum. During the reign of Sanou Mon Faye \u2013 king of Sine, one of the key notables who plotted to dethrone the king was the king's own bur kevel. After influencing the king's own estranged nephew Prince Semou Mak Joof to take up arms against his uncle, the Prince who despised his uncle took up arms with the support of the bur kevel and other notables. The Prince was victorious and was crowned [[Maad a Sinig]] (King of Sine). That is just a sample of the power of the bur kevel who was also a member of the griot caste.<ref>Sarr, Alioune, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et Notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n\u00b0 3\u20134, 1986\u20131987. pp 28\u201330, 46, 106\u20139</ref><ref>Klein, Martin A.

If a Moor dies in a Serer kingdom, his body was dragged out of the country and left for the [[vultures]] to feast on if there is no family or friend to claim the body and bury it elsewhere.  They were also never accompanied by [[grave goods]].  No matter how long a Mauritanian Moor has lived in the area as a migrant, he could never achieve high status within the Serer aristocracy.  The best position he could ever wish for within Serer high society was to work as a ''Bissit'' (Bissik). Apart from spying for the Serer Kings, the ''Bissit's''  main job was to be a [[clown]] \u2013 for the sole entertainment of the Serer King, the Serer aristocracy and the common people.  He was expected to dance in ceremonies before the king and liven up the king's mood and the king's subjects.  This position was always given to the Moors.  It was a humiliating job and not a title of honour. According to some, the history of this position goes back to an early Moor in Serer country who had a child by his own daughter.<ref>Abdou Bouri B\u00e2.

This is a tradition common to many ethnic groups of [[West Africa]] known as ''Maasir'' (var : ''Massir'') in [[Serer language]] ([[Joking relationship]]) or ''kal'', which comes from ''kalir'' (a deformation of the Serer word ''kucarla'' meaning paternal lineage or paternal inheritance). This joking relationship enables one group to criticise another, but also obliges the other with mutual aid and respect. The Serers call this ''Maasir'' or ''Kalir''. This is because the Serers and the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]] are related \u2013 according to Wiliam J. foltz ''\"Tukulor are a mixture of Fulani and Serer\"''<ref>William J. Foltz.

They both died in 1969. After their deaths, the Serer Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum were incorporated into independent Senegal which gained its independence from France in 1960.

A marriage between the noble Guelowar maternal clan and the noble [[lamane|Serer patriclans]].

With the exception of [[Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh|Maysa Wali]], this would explain why none of the kings of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]] and [[Kingdom of Saloum|Saloum]] (two of the Serer precolonial kingdoms) bore Mandinka surnames, but Serer surname throughout the 600 years reign of the Guelwar maternal dynasty. The Serer noble patriclans simply married Guelowar women, and their offsprings bearing Serer surnames reigned in Sine and Saloum. The Guelowars also viewed themselves as Serer and assimilated in Serer culture. The alliance was an alliance based on marriage.<ref name=\"Biram Ngom=Babacr Diouf\"/><ref>[[Alioune Sarr|Sarr, Alioune]], ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'' (S\u00e9n\u00e9gal) .

Although matrilineality (''tim'' in [[Serer language|Serer]]) is very important in Serer culture, the Serer follow a bilineal system. Both matrilineality and patrilineality are important in Serer custom. Inheritance depends on the nature of the asset being inherited.

The third status, and the largest strata came to be the ''jambur'', or free peasants who lacked the power of the nobles. Below the ''jambur'' were the artisan castes, who inherited their occupation. These castes included blacksmiths, weavers, jewelers, leatherworkers, carpenters, griots who kept the [[oral tradition]] through songs and music. Of these, all castes had a taboo in marrying a griot, and they could not be buried like others. Below the artisan castes in social status have been the slaves, who were either bought at slave markets, seized as captives, or born to a slave parent.<ref name=klein11>{{cite book|author=Martin A.

The ''jaraff'', who was the most important person after the king ([[Maad a Sinig]] or [[Maad Saloum]]) came from the jambur caste. The Jaraff was the equivalent of a prime minister. He was responsible for organising the coronation ceremony and for crowning the Serer kings. Where a king dies without nominating an heir ([[buumi]]), the Jaraff would step in and reign as regent until a suitable candidate can be found from the royal line. The noble council that was responsible for advising the king was also made up of jamburs as well as the ''bur kuvel/guewel'' (the chief griot of the king) who was extremely powerful and influential, and very rich in land and other assets. The buur kevel who also came from the griot caste were so powerful that they could influence a king's decision as to whether he goes to war or not. They told the king what to eat, and teach them how to eat, how walk, talk and behave in society. They always accompany the king to the battlefield and recount the glory or bravery of his ancestors in battle. They retain and pass down the genealogy and family history of the king. The bur Kevel could make or break a king, and destroy the entire royal dynasty if they so wish. The abdication of Fakha Boya Fall from the throne of Saloum was led and driven by his own bur kevel. After being forced to abdicate, he was chased out of Saloum. During the reign of Sanou Mon Faye \u2013 king of Sine, one of the key notables who plotted to dethrone the king was the king's own bur kevel. After influencing the king's own estranged nephew Prince Semou Mak Joof to take up arms against his uncle, the Prince who despised his uncle took up arms with the support of the bur kevel and other notables. The Prince was victorious and was crowned [[Maad a Sinig]] (King of Sine). That is just a sample of the power of the bur kevel who was also a member of the griot caste.<ref>Sarr, Alioune, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et Notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n\u00b0 3\u20134, 1986\u20131987. pp 28\u201330, 46, 106\u20139</ref><ref>Klein, Martin A.

The  people would sing then interweave it with a Tassu. The late Serer [[Diva]] [[Yand\u00e9 Codou S\u00e8ne]] who was the [[griot]] of the late and former president of Senegal ([[Leopold Sedar Senghor]]) was proficient in the \"Tassu\".  She was the best ''Tassukat'' (one who Tassu) of her generation.  Originally religious in nature, the griots of Senegambia regardless of ethnic group or religion picked it up from Serer religious practices and still use it in different occasions e.g. marriages, naming ceremonies or when they are just singing the praises of their patrons. Most Senegalese and Gambian artists use it in their songs even the younger generation like \"[http://www.baaybia.com Baay Bia]\". The Senegalese music legend [[Youssou N'Dour]] who is also a Serer, uses \"Tassu\" in many of his songs.<ref name=\"Ali Colleen Neff 2010\">Ali Colleen Neff. Tassou: the Ancient Spoken Word of African Women. 2010.</ref>\n\n====Serer relations to Moors====\nIn the pre-colonial era, [[Moors]] from [[Mauritania]] who came to settle in the Serer kingdoms such as the [[Kingdom of Sine]], etc., were ill-treated by their Serer masters. If a Moor dies in a Serer kingdom, his body was dragged out of the country and left for the [[vultures]] to feast on if there is no family or friend to claim the body and bury it elsewhere.  They were also never accompanied by [[grave goods]].  No matter how long a Mauritanian Moor has lived in the area as a migrant, he could never achieve high status within the Serer aristocracy.  The best position he could ever wish for within Serer high society was to work as a ''Bissit'' (Bissik). Apart from spying for the Serer Kings, the ''Bissit's''  main job was to be a [[clown]] \u2013 for the sole entertainment of the Serer King, the Serer aristocracy and the common people.  He was expected to dance in ceremonies before the king and liven up the king's mood and the king's subjects.  This position was always given to the Moors.  It was a humiliating job and not a title of honour. According to some, the history of this position goes back to an early Moor in Serer country who had a child by his own daughter.<ref>Abdou Bouri B\u00e2. Essai sur l\u2019histoire du Saloum et du Rip. Avant-propos par Charles Becker et Victor Martin, p4</ref>\n\n===Joking relationship (Maasir or Kalir)===\nSerers and Toucouleurs are linked by a bond of \"cousinage\".  This is a tradition common to many ethnic groups of [[West Africa]] known as ''Maasir'' (var : ''Massir'') in [[Serer language]] ([[Joking relationship]]) or ''kal'', which comes from ''kalir'' (a deformation of the Serer word ''kucarla'' meaning paternal lineage or paternal inheritance). This joking relationship enables one group to criticise another, but also obliges the other with mutual aid and respect. The Serers call this ''Maasir'' or ''Kalir''. This is because the Serers and the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]] are related \u2013 according to Wiliam J. foltz ''\"Tukulor are a mixture of Fulani and Serer\"''<ref>William J. Foltz. From French West Africa to the Mali Federation, Volume 12 of Yale studies in political science, p136. Published by Yale University Press, 1965</ref> The Serers also maintain the same bond with the [[Jola people]] with whom they have an ancient relationship.<ref>According to both Serer and Jola tradition, they trace their descend to ''Jamboo\u00f1'' (also spelt : Jambonge, Jambon, etc.) and ''Agaire'' (variantes : Ougeney, Eugeny, Eugene, etc.).

This is spoken in [[Sine-Saloum]], [[Kaolack]], [[Diourbel]], [[Dakar]], and in [[Gambia]], and is part of the national curriculum of Senegal. Historically the Serer people's unwillingness to trade directly during the colonial era was a double edged sword to the [[Serer language]] as well as the [[Cangin languages]].  That resulted in the [[Wolof language]] being the dominant language in the market place as well as the factories.<ref>Martin A,\nKlein, p7</ref> However, the Serer language, among other local languages, is now part of the national [[curriculum]] of Senegal.\n\nAbout 200,000 Serer speak various [[Cangin languages]], such as [[Ndut language|Ndut]] and [[Saafi language|Saafi]], which are not closely related to Serer proper ([[Serer language|Serer-Sine language]]). There are clear [[lexicon|lexical]] similarities among the Cangin languages. However, they are more closely related to other languages than to Serer, and vice versa.<ref>Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009.

He crash-landed on the elementary school playground where he beat up the fifth-graders who were bullying Blue and instantly became friends with him. Red's antics often get him and Blue into trouble and he frequently insults Blue for his \"nerdy\" status, though he has on occasion shown how much he cares for Blue and values him as a friend, and always helps him out when needed. The special \"Figured Out\" episode reveals that his full name is Redward.\n*'''Blue''' (voiced by Zack Keller) is Red's depressed, levelheaded roommate and his best (and only) friend. Red's actions frequently annoy and exasperate Blue, though he is secretly envious of Red and wishes to be more like him. His hobbies include ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', comics and video games (which leads Red to frequently call Blue a \"nerd\"), and he displays a skill for hacking computers. Blue lives with Red in an apartment, and is often looking for jobs to pay the bills and rent, since Red never does. In the episode \"Flame War\", Blue gets a girlfriend named Pink. Their relationship becomes strained several times, usually through Red's actions, though they remain together for the rest of the series. The special \"Figured Out\" episode reveals that his full name is Blewis.\n*'''Lord Tourettes''' (voiced by Ben Tuller) is a whimsical and effeminate larper with [[Tourette's syndrome]], hence his name. He is a recurring character on the show who made his first appearance in the episode \"Role Playas\". He has constant outbursts of profane rage in his sentences, which he does not seem to care about. In the episode \"Lord Tourette's Syndrome\", it is revealed that him wearing his hat is the reason he constantly swears.\n*'''Pink''' (voiced by Shea Logsdon) is Blue's girlfriend. She is a recurring character who made her first appearance in the episode \"Flame War\" where she and Blue start a romantic relationship. Pink seems to be as serious as Blue is and has expressed her fair share of depression. She has a job and rarely gets time off. She constantly runs into problems with Blue, which mostly stem from Red ruining their dates together. It has been implied that Pink [[On-again, off-again relationship|breaks up with him multiple times]] because of this. Pink is also easily fooled by Blue's attempts to be cultural (like passing off Japanese for French, and claiming [[chow mein]] is Chinese for spaghetti.) They did not share their first kiss until the end of the movie before confessing their love for each other, later getting married and having children. In the episode \"A Hobbit of Thrones\", it is revealed that Pink is best friends with Stacy and their relationship is similar to Red and Blue's.\n*'''Stacy''' (voiced by Lauren Kay Sokolov) is Red's girlfriend. She is a recurring character who made her first appearance in \"Trouble Date\". Stacy is a ditzy, promiscuous woman who has sex with many different men. Red and Stacy began their relationship in \"Trouble Date\" where they annoyed Pink and Blue on their date and ended up having sex on the restaurant table. Afterwards, Stacy did not appear again until the episode \"Modern Flame War 3\" where she had a different hairstyle and a job at Cybertime Systems. In the episode \"Robot Frog\", it was revealed that Stacy had dated Blue for two years before she started dating Red. In this episode, she was shown to be a sane, mature woman who dumped Blue because she believed that he was holding her back from what she truly wanted to be, which was a lascivious party girl, which is exactly what she became. In the episode \"First Day of Cool\", it was implied that her promiscuous nature came about after she consumed large amounts of [[Pixy Stix]] as a young child.\n*'''Mr. Dingleberry''' (named '''Nickelberry''' in \"Kitty Amazing\") (voiced by Ed Skudder) is Red and Blue's elderly landlord who made his first appearance in \"Flame War\". Dingleberry was a soldier in [[World War II]] and was a part of the [[Normandy landings]]. He is extremely frail, often seen hunched over and using a walking stick, and as such he is forgetful and suffers medical complications. He is annoyed by Red and Blue's antics, and often tries to get them to pay rent (but they never do). Despite being old, he attempts to be part of the cool kids, as he regularly joins raves and takes drugs. One of the main gags in the series is for Mr. Dingleberry to die in almost every episode he appears in.\n*'''Broseph''' (voiced by Mike Nassar) is an obnoxious, arrogant bully and nemesis of Red and Blue. Broseph made his first appearance in the episode \"Zombies & Shotguns\" where he was chainsawed to death by Red. Similar to Mr. Dingleberry, a running gag is for Broseph to die in almost every episode he appears in, which is usually caused by Red. In the episode \"First Day of Cool\", Broseph was shown to be the leader of a gang of fifth-graders as a child who bullied Blue. In this episode, Broseph and the rest of the fifth-graders were attacked and killed by Red when the latter debuted, saving Blue's life.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Dick Figures episodes}}\n{{:List of Dick Figures episodes}}\n\n==Spin-off==\n''Chick Figures'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series that premiered in June 2015.

Reducing prejudice through simulated social contact. American Psychologist, 64, 231-240.</ref> and a major contributor to the field of [[social psychology]].\n\n==Life ==\nRichard Crisp was born in London (UK), and educated at [http://www.sirjosephwilliamson.medway.sch.uk/page/default.asp?title=Home&pid=1 The Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School] in Rochester, Kent. He went on to read Experimental Psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and completed his PhD in Social Psychology at University of Wales. After his doctoral work was appointed to a Lectureship in Psychology at the [[University of Birmingham]] (1999). In 2007 he was appointed Full Professor of Psychology in the [[Centre for the Study of Group Processes]] at the [[University of Kent]]. He was Head of the School of Psychology from 2008-2011. From 2012 to 2014 he was Professor of Social Psychology at the [[University of Sheffield]] and from 2014 to 2017 Professor of Social Psychology and Associate Dean for Research and Enterprise at the [[Aston Business School]]. Since 2017 he has been Professor of Social Psychology and Head of the Department of Psychology at [[Durham University]].\n\n== Work ==\nRichard Crisp has published widely on [[Cultural diversity|diversity]], [[multiculturalism]], [[prejudice]], [[stereotyping]], [[social cognition]] and [[contact hypothesis|intergroup contact]]. His scholarly contributions are particularly known for their application of cutting-edge advances in psychological science to pervasive and problematic social issues. In 2007 he developed a new cognitive intervention for reducing prejudice and promoting tolerance based on the application of theory and research into mental imagery (the [[The Imagined Contact Hypothesis|imagined contact hypothesis]]). More recently, he has uncovered evidence that living in diverse, multicultural societies can produce a wide range of benefits associated with 'flexible thinking' - including enhanced creativity, problem solving and negotiation skills (\"cognitive adaptation to diversity]\").<ref>Crisp, R. J. & Turner, R. N. (2011). Cognitive adaptation to the experience of social and cultural diversity. Psychological Bulletin, 137, 242-266.</ref>\n\nIn 2011 he was elected Fellow of the [[British Psychological Society]] in recognition of his 'outstanding contribution to the advancement or dissemination of psychological knowledge'.

Most of the other lead cast members were hired throughout the rest of the year, and filming took place from August to December 2018 in [[Australia]] and [[Peru]]. This film is set after the events of the animated original television series.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on August 9, 2019, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Moner's performance and the self-aware humor, and grossed $120 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nDeep in the [[Peru|Peruvian]] jungle, Dora (Madelyn Miranda), daughter of jungle explorers Cole ([[Michael Pe\u00f1a]]) and Elena ([[Eva Longoria]]), spends her days going on adventures with her monkey friend Boots (voiced by [[Danny Trejo]]), her cousin Diego (Malachi Barton), and imaginary friends Backpack (voiced by Sasha Toro) and Map (voiced by [[Marc Weiner]]) while thwarting Swiper (voiced by [[Benicio del Toro]]) the thieving fox. 7-year-old Diego and his family leave to Los Angeles while 6-year-old Dora and her parents remain searching for the hidden [[Inca]] city of gold Parapata.\n\nAfter 10 years of exploring, Dora's parents decipher the location of Parapata and choose to send Dora ([[Isabela Moner]]) to Diego's high school in [[Los Angeles]] while they travel to the lost city. Staying with Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) and his family, Dora meets fellow students Sammy ([[Madeleine Madden]]) and Randy (Nicholas Coombe), but Diego considers her an embarrassment.\n\nOn a class field trip to a museum, Dora and the others are lured to its off-exhibit archives, where they are captured by mercenaries led by Powell ([[Temuera Morrison]]) who fly them to Peru. When they land, a man named Alejandro ([[Eugenio Derbez]]), who claims to be a friend of Dora's parents, helps them escape. In the process, the mercenaries, aided by Swiper, steal Dora's map. Alejandro reports that Dora's parents have gone missing and that the mercenaries are searching for them in hopes of getting into Parapata and stealing its treasures. Dora resolves to find her parents first with Alejandro's help, while the other teens come along in hopes of being rescued.\n\nThe group travels through numerous obstacles, including quicksand, Inca ruin puzzles, and attacks from forest guards of Parapata. After numerous hazards, Dora reaches her parents just outside the borders of Parapata, but Alejandro reveals he was the mercenaries leader all along and captures them. The other teens are caught as well, but Boots helps them escape. With Dora's parents still prisoners, the teens decide to find the way inside Parapata in hopes of acquiring treasure that they can use to bargain for Elena and Cole's release.\n\nInside the hidden city, Dora and the others solve its temple's puzzles and dodge its traps, bringing them to the central shrine. Alejandro secretly follows them and attempts to steal its central idol himself, but instead falls into a trap. The soldiers guarding Parapata, led by their queen ([[Q'orianka Kilcher]]), defeat the mercenaries, and confront the teens. Dora speaks to them in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], assuring that the kids only came for her parents and to learn. The Inca permit the teens and Dora's family to leave, allowing them a glimpse of their greatest treasure.\n\nDora's parents and the teens arrive at her jungle home. Her parents discuss going on another expedition as a whole family, but Dora decides to return to school in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the credits, Dora celebrates with her friends at the school dance.

Most of the other lead cast members were hired throughout the rest of the year, and filming took place from August to December 2018 in [[Australia]] and [[Peru]]. This film is set after the events of the animated original television series.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on August 9, 2019, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Moner's performance and the self-aware humor, and grossed $120 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nDeep in the [[Peru|Peruvian]] jungle, Dora (Madelyn Miranda), daughter of jungle explorers Cole ([[Michael Pe\u00f1a]]) and Elena ([[Eva Longoria]]), spends her days going on adventures with her monkey friend Boots (voiced by [[Danny Trejo]]), her cousin Diego (Malachi Barton), and imaginary friends Backpack (voiced by Sasha Toro) and Map (voiced by [[Marc Weiner]]) while thwarting Swiper (voiced by [[Benicio del Toro]]) the thieving fox. 7-year-old Diego and his family leave to Los Angeles while 6-year-old Dora and her parents remain searching for the hidden [[Inca]] city of gold Parapata.\n\nAfter 10 years of exploring, Dora's parents decipher the location of Parapata and choose to send Dora ([[Isabela Moner]]) to Diego's high school in [[Los Angeles]] while they travel to the lost city. Staying with Diego (Jeff Wahlberg) and his family, Dora meets fellow students Sammy ([[Madeleine Madden]]) and Randy (Nicholas Coombe), but Diego considers her an embarrassment.\n\nOn a class field trip to a museum, Dora and the others are lured to its off-exhibit archives, where they are captured by mercenaries led by Powell ([[Temuera Morrison]]) who fly them to Peru. When they land, a man named Alejandro ([[Eugenio Derbez]]), who claims to be a friend of Dora's parents, helps them escape. In the process, the mercenaries, aided by Swiper, steal Dora's map. Alejandro reports that Dora's parents have gone missing and that the mercenaries are searching for them in hopes of getting into Parapata and stealing its treasures. Dora resolves to find her parents first with Alejandro's help, while the other teens come along in hopes of being rescued.\n\nThe group travels through numerous obstacles, including quicksand, Inca ruin puzzles, and attacks from forest guards of Parapata. After numerous hazards, Dora reaches her parents just outside the borders of Parapata, but Alejandro reveals he was the mercenaries leader all along and captures them. The other teens are caught as well, but Boots helps them escape. With Dora's parents still prisoners, the teens decide to find the way inside Parapata in hopes of acquiring treasure that they can use to bargain for Elena and Cole's release.\n\nInside the hidden city, Dora and the others solve its temple's puzzles and dodge its traps, bringing them to the central shrine. Alejandro secretly follows them and attempts to steal its central idol himself, but instead falls into a trap. The soldiers guarding Parapata, led by their queen ([[Q'orianka Kilcher]]), defeat the mercenaries, and confront the teens. Dora speaks to them in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], assuring that the kids only came for her parents and to learn. The Inca permit the teens and Dora's family to leave, allowing them a glimpse of their greatest treasure.\n\nDora's parents and the teens arrive at her jungle home. Her parents discuss going on another expedition as a whole family, but Dora decides to return to school in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the credits, Dora celebrates with her friends at the school dance. Alejandro remains a prisoner along with the other mercenaries in Parapata. Cole and Elena prevent Swiper from making off with one of their items.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Isabela Moner]] as Dora M\u00e1rquez, a formal jungle explorer.

The independent list of the Greens in Warsaw received 11 210 votes (1.68%) and 7th place out of 14. Less than 1% of support was obtained in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[Gda\u0144sk]] by the local committees co-created by the Greens with [[Young Socialists (Poland)|Young Socialists]]. In other cities, people associated with the party were candidates from local, mainly non-party lists or the Left and Democrats coalition.\n\n=== Polish parliamentary election of 2007 ===\nIn the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], the Greens contested one district in the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senate]].\n\n=== European Parliament election of 2009 ===\nIn February 2009, the Greens formed a coalition called [[Alliance for the Future (Poland)|Alliance for the Future]] ''(Porozumienie dla Przysz\u0142o\u015bci - CentroLewica)'' with the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] [[Democratic Party - demokraci.pl|Democratic Party]] and the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Social Democracy of Poland|SDPL]], forming a common list for the [[2009 European Parliament election in Poland|2009 European Parliament election]].\n\n=== Polish presidential election of 2010 ===\nIn the [[2010 Polish presidential election|2010 presidential election]], the Greens supported [[Grzegorz Napieralski]] based on the analysis of the programs of the most important candidates. The [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]] candidate obtained the highest score in the Green Index ranking: 78 on a scale from -200 to +200 points. In the second round, the party members encouraged to vote, but they did not support any of the candidates, pointing to their [[conservatism]] and economic [[neoliberalism]].\n\n=== Polish local elections of 2010 ===\nIn the [[2010 Polish local elections|2010 local elections]], members of the Greens ran in most cases from the lists of [[Democratic Left Alliance]]. In these elections, the Greens won five seats in local councils and regional parliaments.\n\n=== Polish parliamentary election of 2011 ===\nIn the [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]], representatives of the party again found themselves on the lists of the [[Democratic Left Alliance]], but they did not obtain any seats in the [[Sejm]]. The Green candidates themselves gained 23 421 votes, which gave 0.16% of the votes. The only one of the Greens was their chairman [[Dariusz Szwed]] opening the list in the [[Chrzan\u00f3w]] constituency, in which he obtained 3 842 votes.\n\n=== European Parliament election of 2014 ===\nIn the [[2014 European Parliament election in Poland|2014 European Parliament election]], the Greens formed their own Election Committee of the Greens. The representatives of the [[Feminist Initiative (Poland)|Women's Party]], the [[Polish Socialist Party]] and [[Young Socialists (Poland)|Young Socialists]] have announced the start of the Green Committee's lists. The Committee registered lists in five districts. The Committee of the Greens obtained 22 221 votes (0.32%) in the elections, taking the 10th place (ahead of, among others, the Direct Democracy committee, whose lists were registered in six districts).\n\n=== Polish local elections of 2014 ===\nIn the [[2014 Polish local elections|2014 local elections]], the Greens issued their own letters to the city council in [[Warsaw]] and [[Wroc\u0142aw]], in Warsaw, issuing [[Joanna Erbel]] as their own candidate for the city's presidency, and in Wroc\u0142aw supporting the SLD candidate. In [[Krak\u00f3w]], together with trade unions and city movements, they co-founded the [[Krak\u00f3w Against the Olympic Committee]]. In [[Opole]], the current councilor of the Greens, [[Beata Kubica]] (elected in 2010 from the SLD list) ran for the city council from the list of [[German Minority Electoral Committee|German Minorities]]. In the [[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubuskie voivodeship]], the Greens together with the [[Social Justice Movement]], trade unions and civic movements, co-founded the [[Nowy \u0141ad Committee]] in the elections to the regional council. The Greens also issued a dozen or so candidates in the One-National Electoral Circumscriptions in Poland.\n\nAs a result of the elections, the independent lists of the Green Party in Warsaw received 2.55% of votes to the city council. A similar result (2.48%) was received by the candidate for the mayor of the city, Joanna Erbel. The Wroc\u0142aw Green list received 1.97% of the votes to the city council. In Krak\u00f3w, the Krak\u00f3w Against the Olympic Committee, co-created by the Greens, received 6.7% of the votes, which did not translate into mandates, with [[Tomasz Le\u015bniak]] receiving 4.84% of the votes in the elections for the city president. The [[Electoral Committee New Deal]], co-created by the Greens, received 0.62% of support in the elections to the [[Lubusz Regional Assembly]] (it was the 10th result from among 11 committees). No Green candidate for a councilor in the [[single-member district]] has obtained a seat.\n\n=== Polish presidential election of 2015 ===\nIn the [[2015 Polish presidential election|2015 presidential election]], the candidate for the party was the deputy [[Anna Grodzka]], who, however, did not collect the required number of 100 000 signatures.\n\n=== Polish parliamentary election of 2015 ===\nGreens joined the [[United Left (Poland)|Zjednoczona Lewica]] (United Left) [[electoral alliance]] for the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]] in July 2015. In the election the alliance received 7.6% of the vote, below the 8% electoral threshold leaving the alliance with no parliamentary representation. It was officially dissolved in February 2016.\n\n=== Polish local elections of 2018 ===\nIn the [[2018 Polish local elections|2018 local elections]], the Greens, without any [[electoral alliance]], managed to obtain the highest ever result in their party history of 1.15% of the votes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/partiazieloni/photos/a.348895927694/10156109039242695/?type=3&theater|title=Partia Zieloni|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref> with their highest result as a percentage in [[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubusz voivodeship]] (2.62%), and the highest local [[Gmina]] result being in [[Gmina \u017bary]] (10.0%).\n\nThis concludes that the Greens achieved better overall results in [[Western Poland]] areas which are near to the [[Germany\u2013Poland border|borders of Germany]].\n\n=== Sejm and European Parliament elections of 2019 ===\nOn 6 November 2018, at a press conference, the Greens officially announced preparations for the 2019 elections both at the national and European level.

Brainwashed through the use of a gold collar, the Zarbi use Barbara to find the Menoptra. The Zarbi take Barbara and the Menoptra called Hrostar to the Crater of Needles, where the Zarbi force them to gather vegetation and drop it into rivers of acid which feed the Animus.\n\nThe Zarbi capture the Doctor and Ian and take them to the Carsinome. There they find Vicki and the TARDIS. They also meet the Animus who forces the Doctor to help it track down the Menoptra invasion force. Ian escapes, whilst the Doctor and Vicki try to bide their time.\n[[File:Menoptra (28807516473).jpg|thumb|left|A Menoptra, on display at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nIan meets with a Menoptra called Vrestin. He learns that the Menoptra were native to the planet Vortis along with the Zarbi, until a great evil force, the Animus, slowly and gradually took control of the planet through the Zarbi. By the time the Menoptra noticed the danger it was too late, and they had to flee the planet to one of the moons the Animus pulled into orbit around Vortis.\n\nBack in the Carsinome, the Doctor accidentally reveals that the Menoptra spearhead plans to land at a place near the Crater of Needles. The Animus uses this information to ambush them.\n\nThe Zarbi soon locate Ian and Vrestin, but they escape when they fall into a tunnel. Inside they meet the Optera, descendants of the Menoptra who fled the Animus underground. Ian and Vrestin convince the Optera to join them in fighting the Animus.\n\nAt the Crater of Needles, Barbara and Hrostar escape and try to meet up with the spearhead to warn them, but the spearhead is massacred.\n\nAt the Carsinome, the Doctor works out that the Animus uses gold as a conductor to channel its mesmerising force. He counteracts this force to control one of the Zarbi. The Doctor and Vicki escape. They meet up with Barbara and the Menoptra and devise a plan to attack the Carsinome.\n\nThe Doctor and Vicki return to the Carsinome, where the Zarbi take them to the Animus, a great spider-like creature, which mesmerises them. Meanwhile, Barbara and the Menoptra launch their attack on the Carsinome from outside whilst Ian and Vrestin with the Optera reach the Animus from below. They eventually defeat the Animus with a bomb.\n\n==Production==\nThe story had the working title of ''The Webbed Planet''. Episode six was initially titled \"Centre of Terror\".

A special credit for de Winter, \"Insect Movement by...\" was included on the closing credits of \"The Zarbi\" to \"The Centre\".\n\nThis serial marked the television debut of Martin Jarvis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/shakespeare/muchadoaboutnothing/martin_jarvis.shtml|title=BBC - Drama - Shakespeare - Much Ado About Nothing - Martin Jarvis as Leonard|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He later appeared as Butler in ''[[Invasion of the Dinosaurs]]'' (1974)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/invasiondinosaurs/detail.shtml|title=BBC - Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Invasion of the Dinosaurs - Details|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and as the Governor of Varos in ''[[Vengeance on Varos]]'' (1985).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/vengeancevaros/detail.shtml|title=BBC - Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Vengeance on Varos - Details|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n{{Episode table\n |background =\n |series = 6 |title = 20 | aux1=6 | airdate = 10 | viewers = 6 | aux4 = 16 | country = UK\n |seriesT    = Episode\n |aux1T      = Run time\n |aux4T      = Archive\n |aux4R      = <ref name=\"ArchiveStatus\" />\n |viewersR   = <ref name=\"AllRatings\" />\n |episodes   = \n{{Episode list/sublist|The Web Planet\n |EpisodeNumber      = 1\n |Title              = The Web Planet\n |RTitle             = \n |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1965|2|13|df=y}}\n |Viewers            = 13.5\n |Aux1               = 23:57\n |Aux4               = 16mm t/r\n |LineColor          = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Web Planet\n |EpisodeNumber      = 2\n |Title              = The Zarbi\n |RTitle             = \n |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1965|2|20|df=y}}\n |Viewers            = 12.5\n |Aux1               = 23:20\n |Aux4               = 16mm t/r\n |LineColor          = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Web Planet\n |EpisodeNumber      = 3\n |Title              = Escape to Danger\n |RTitle             = \n |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1965|2|27|df=y}}\n |Viewers            = 12.5\n |Aux1               = 22:52\n |Aux4               = 16mm t/r\n |LineColor          = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Web Planet\n |EpisodeNumber      = 4\n |Title              = Crater of Needles\n |RTitle             = \n |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1965|3|6|df=y}}\n |Viewers            = 13.0\n |Aux1               = 25:50\n |Aux4               = 16mm t/r\n |LineColor          = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Web Planet\n |EpisodeNumber      = 5\n |Title              = Invasion\n |RTitle             = \n |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1965|3|13|df=y}}\n |Viewers            = 12.0\n |Aux1               = 26:04\n |Aux4               = 16mm t/r\n |LineColor          = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Web Planet\n |EpisodeNumber      = 6\n |Title              = The Centre\n |RTitle             = \n |OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|1965|3|20|df=y}}\n |Viewers            = 11.5\n |Aux1               = 24:28\n |Aux4               = 16mm t/r\n |LineColor          = \n}}\n}}\nThe first episode of the serial was watched by 13.5 million viewers, the highest number for any ''Doctor Who'' episode in the 1960s.\n\nThe serial was believed lost in the [[Doctor Who missing episodes|BBC's early 1970s purge]] until negative film prints of all six episodes were recovered from BBC Enterprises in the late 1970s. Unedited prints of all six episodes were also discovered in [[Nigeria]] in 1984. The BBC holds two different versions of episode six; one in which the \"Next Episode\" caption referred to \"The Lion\" and the other with the caption naming \"[[The Space Museum]]\", which was the only story still available for sale by the BBC in 1974. (The different caption is ''not'' due to ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|The Crusade]]'' being withheld from sale to Arab countries as is commonly thought, since the package of serials sold to Arabic countries did not extend beyond ''[[The Rescue (Doctor Who)|The Rescue]]''.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Molesworth |first=Richard |title=Wiped!
