The band is fronted by [[Jon McClure]], nicknamed \"The Reverend\"and his best mate Gaynor Burton was 40 yesterday. Their debut album, ''[[The State of Things (album)|The State of Things]]'' (2007), helped them gain success in Britain and spawned the UK top 10 single \"[[Heavyweight Champion of the World (song)|Heavyweight Champion of the World]]\". The band released their second album, ''[[A French Kiss in the Chaos]]'' (2009), which led to them being invited to support [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] on their [[Dig Out Your Soul Tour|final tour]], playing venues such as [[Wembley Stadium]]. The band's third studio album, ''[[@Reverend_Makers]]'', was released in 2012, and their fourth studio album, ''[[ThirtyTwo (album)|ThirtyTwo]]'', was released in 2014.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn late 2005, McClure brought several musicians together for Reverend and The Makers. Like his previous bands, The Makers included co-songwriter Ed Cosens, this time playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The rest of The Makers consisted of Dave Sanderson (guitars), Joe Moskow ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Richy Westley (drums, formerly of Hoggboy) and Laura Manuel ([[Singing|vocals]]), and occasionally Simon Stafford on trombone. Sanderson was dismissed in July 2006 after the band completed their first headline UK tour and replaced by Gledhill guitarist Tom Jarvis.\n\nLate in 2005, fellow Sheffield band [[Arctic Monkeys]] released their debut single, and McClure was hounded by major record labels, reportedly offering him sums of up to \u00a3150,000 to make an album like Arctic Monkeys.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} McClure declined the offer, and decided to do everything his own way, managing to sell out The Plug in Sheffield twice, a venue with a capacity of 1,000 people, while still unsigned. It was not until the following year that McClure met Mark Jones in a club in London when he asked him for a lighter. The two got talking and Mark Jones came to see Reverend and the Makers at the next show. Jones reportedly proclaimed the band as the \"best band in the world\" and signed them to his label [[Wall of Sound Records]].\n\nReverend and The Makers released a 9-track demo in 2006, entitled \"Ten Songs\". The artwork included a track list with ten songs, track 10 being \"Paris at Night\". However this song was not made available for download; it only surfaced on the internet in August 2007. The demos were recorded at 2Fly Studios, and produced by [[Alan Smyth]], McClure acknowledges the work Smyth put into the demos by accrediting the debut single; \"Heavyweight Champion of The World\" as McClure/Cosens/Smyth. Reverend and the Makers' music is a mix of indie guitar pop, [[electronica]] and a touch of [[Madchester]]-esque funk. Some of the internet demos feature members of other notable Sheffield musicians such as [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] ([[Arctic Monkeys]]), Tim Hampton ([[Bromheads Jacket]]) and Mike Hughes (Little Ze). One of Reverend's inspirations is [[Manchester]] [[performance poet]] [[John Cooper Clarke]] and Reverend often performs his own poems, of a similar style, in between songs during his live sets. One of the B-sides to the debut single \"Heavyweight Champion of the World\" is a poem entitled \"Last Resort\" in which John Cooper Clarke and McClure read alternate stanzas. This poem was also duetted live when the band played live at Shoreditch's Spread Eagle in the first tour in May 2006.\n\nIn April 2006, Reverend and The Makers were support to the [[Arctic Monkeys]] on their sold out UK tour, exposing the band to larger audiences and bigger venues. This was followed by their own first UK tour in May and June, selling out dates in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]] and The Plug in home-town [[Sheffield]] on the final night. A second tour followed in October 2006, showing great progression as a band. The sound was much tighter and far more advanced than on their previous tour.\n\n===''The State of Things'' and breakthrough (2007\u201308)===\n[[File:RevmakersSSW08.JPG|thumb|right|Performing at [[Summer Sundae]] in 2008]]\nIn 2008, Reverend and The Makers set a date for their first release and undertook a UK tour, including several festivals over the summer period including [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Carling Weekend]], [[T in the Park]] and [[T4 on the Beach]] as well as supporting the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] at [[Hampden Park]], [[Glasgow]].

The single takes its name from a line in ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' a novel by [[Barry Hines]] and a favourite book of McClure. The single is available on both CD and 7\" vinyl formats, including a limited edition \"White Vinyl\" release. The single was released for download on 6 May and reached #38 in the UK single chart on download only.

The band released a second single, \"[[No Soap (in a Dirty War)]]\" in October.\n\nMcClure was in the media spotlight for his personal views in July 2009, after an interview in which he commented on [[Jade Goody]]'s death earlier in the year; \"it's sad she died and it's good more girls are getting smear tests but let's not forget she was a talentless racist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/showbiz/111985-jon-mcclure-calls-jade-goody-a-talentless-racist/|title=Shows|work=STV Shows}}</ref>\nHe has also been in the media recently speaking out about the UK's involvement in the [[Iraq War]], requesting that fellow musicians, particularly the Arctic Monkeys, his contemporaries from Sheffield, focus on real issues and to \"not write songs about girls at bus stops any more like me and Monkeys used to do, let's start talking about what's happening man as otherwise you know where we gonna go, we're going down the toilet aren't we?\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/celebrity/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=148532110&GT1=61504|title=MSN Entertainment UK - Latest Celebrity News, Gossip, Photos & Videos|work=msn.com|access-date=26 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716195505/http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/celebrity/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=148532110&GT1=61504|archive-date=16 July 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn December, it was announced via McClure's Twitter that [[Andy Nicholson]], his fellow member in Mongrel and ex-[[Arctic Monkeys]] bassist would join the band for their third album.

The band is fronted by [[Jon McClure]], nicknamed \"The Reverend\". Their debut album, ''[[The State of Things (album)|The State of Things]]'' (2007), helped them gain success in Britain and spawned the UK top 10 single \"[[Heavyweight Champion of the World (song)|Heavyweight Champion of the World]]\". The band released their second album, ''[[A French Kiss in the Chaos]]'' (2009), which led to them being invited to support [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] on their [[Dig Out Your Soul Tour|final tour]], playing venues such as [[Wembley Stadium]]. The band's third studio album, ''[[@Reverend_Makers]]'', was released in 2012, and their fourth studio album, ''[[ThirtyTwo (album)|ThirtyTwo]]'', was released in 2014.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nIn late 2005, McClure brought several musicians together for Reverend and The Makers. Like his previous bands, The Makers included co-songwriter Ed Cosens, this time playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The rest of The Makers consisted of Dave Sanderson (guitars), Joe Moskow ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Richy Westley (drums, formerly of Hoggboy) and Laura Manuel ([[Singing|vocals]]), and occasionally Simon Stafford on trombone. Sanderson was dismissed in July 2006 after the band completed their first headline UK tour and replaced by Gledhill guitarist Tom Jarvis.\n\nLate in 2005, fellow Sheffield band [[Arctic Monkeys]] released their debut single, and McClure was hounded by major record labels, reportedly offering him sums of up to \u00a3150,000 to make an album like Arctic Monkeys.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} McClure declined the offer, and decided to do everything his own way, managing to sell out The Plug in Sheffield twice, a venue with a capacity of 1,000 people, while still unsigned. It was not until the following year that McClure met Mark Jones in a club in London when he asked him for a lighter. The two got talking and Mark Jones came to see Reverend and the Makers at the next show. Jones reportedly proclaimed the band as the \"best band in the world\" and signed them to his label [[Wall of Sound Records]].\n\nReverend and The Makers released a 9-track demo in 2006, entitled \"Ten Songs\". The artwork included a track list with ten songs, track 10 being \"Paris at Night\". However this song was not made available for download; it only surfaced on the internet in August 2007. The demos were recorded at 2Fly Studios, and produced by [[Alan Smyth]], McClure acknowledges the work Smyth put into the demos by accrediting the debut single; \"Heavyweight Champion of The World\" as McClure/Cosens/Smyth. Reverend and the Makers' music is a mix of indie guitar pop, [[electronica]] and a touch of [[Madchester]]-esque funk. Some of the internet demos feature members of other notable Sheffield musicians such as [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] ([[Arctic Monkeys]]), Tim Hampton ([[Bromheads Jacket]]) and Mike Hughes (Little Ze). One of Reverend's inspirations is [[Manchester]] [[performance poet]] [[John Cooper Clarke]] and Reverend often performs his own poems, of a similar style, in between songs during his live sets. One of the B-sides to the debut single \"Heavyweight Champion of the World\" is a poem entitled \"Last Resort\" in which John Cooper Clarke and McClure read alternate stanzas. This poem was also duetted live when the band played live at Shoreditch's Spread Eagle in the first tour in May 2006.\n\nIn April 2006, Reverend and The Makers were support to the [[Arctic Monkeys]] on their sold out UK tour, exposing the band to larger audiences and bigger venues. This was followed by their own first UK tour in May and June, selling out dates in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]] and The Plug in home-town [[Sheffield]] on the final night. A second tour followed in October 2006, showing great progression as a band. The sound was much tighter and far more advanced than on their previous tour.\n\n===''The State of Things'' and breakthrough (2007\u201308)===\n[[File:RevmakersSSW08.JPG|thumb|right|Performing at [[Summer Sundae]] in 2008]]\nIn 2008, Reverend and The Makers set a date for their first release and undertook a UK tour, including several festivals over the summer period including [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Carling Weekend]], [[T in the Park]] and [[T4 on the Beach]] as well as supporting the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] at [[Hampden Park]], [[Glasgow]].

The single takes its name from a line in ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' a novel by [[Barry Hines]] and a favourite book of McClure. The single is available on both CD and 7\" vinyl formats, including a limited edition \"White Vinyl\" release. The single was released for download on 6 May and reached #38 in the UK single chart on download only. The album, entitled ''[[The State of Things (2007 album)|The State of Things]]'', was recorded over the Christmas period and was released on Wall of Sound on 17 September 2007. The album features songs co-written and performed with [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] of [[Arctic Monkeys]] and one track co-written and with guest vocals from Tim Hampton of [[Bromheads Jacket]], other tracks include vocals by [[Steve Edwards (singer)|Steve Edwards]].\n\nIn June 2008, drummer Richy Westley left the group to form his own band [[Strange and Partners]]. In August 2008 frontman Jon McClure said he would quit music after their next album,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7569838.stm | work=BBC News | title=Reverend and the Makers to split | date=19 August 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> although a month later he changed his mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/46096/jon-mcclure-im-not-quitting-the-music-industry|title=Jon McClure: 'I'm Not Quitting The Music Industry'|author=Jason Gregory|work=gigwise.com}}</ref> The inconsistency of McClure's actions has led many critics in the music press to report negatively towards the move.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Welsh band [[Future of the Left]] joked of their delight at the band's split at live shows on their tour at the time, as can be heard on their live album ''[[Last Night I Saved Her from Vampires]]''.<ref>''[[Last Night I Saved Her From Vampires]]'', [[4AD]], 2009</ref> McClure has a new project, [[Mongrel (band)|Mongrel]], with a single \"Hit from the Morning Sun\" due to be released in February 2009.<ref>''Playlist'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 18 January 2009</ref>\n\n===''A French Kiss in the Chaos'' (2009\u20132010)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rev at reading.jpg|thumb|alt=Band Reverend and The Makers play Reading Festival 2007.|The band at [[Reading Festival]] 2007.]] -->\nEarly 2009, it was announced that Tom Jarvis has left the band, and has been replaced by Tom Rowley (ex-[[Milburn (band)|Milburn]]), Rowley was already a good friend of McClure, and contributed to the first album by co-writing the tracks \"Bandits\" and \"Miss Brown\".\n\nThe band supported Oasis, along with [[Kasabian]] and [[The Enemy (UK rock band)|The Enemy]] for their sold out summer tour in 2009.

The album was released in June and the opening single, \"[[Silence Is Talking]]\" was featured during the band's three night run at [[Wembley Stadium]]. The band released a second single, \"[[No Soap (in a Dirty War)]]\" in October.\n\nMcClure was in the media spotlight for his personal views in July 2009, after an interview in which he commented on [[Jade Goody]]'s death earlier in the year; \"it's sad she died and it's good more girls are getting smear tests but let's not forget she was a talentless racist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/showbiz/111985-jon-mcclure-calls-jade-goody-a-talentless-racist/|title=Shows|work=STV Shows}}</ref>\nHe has also been in the media recently speaking out about the UK's involvement in the [[Iraq War]], requesting that fellow musicians, particularly the Arctic Monkeys, his contemporaries from Sheffield, focus on real issues and to \"not write songs about girls at bus stops any more like me and Monkeys used to do, let's start talking about what's happening man as otherwise you know where we gonna go, we're going down the toilet aren't we?\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/celebrity/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=148532110&GT1=61504|title=MSN Entertainment UK - Latest Celebrity News, Gossip, Photos & Videos|work=msn.com|access-date=26 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716195505/http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/celebrity/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=148532110&GT1=61504|archive-date=16 July 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn December, it was announced via McClure's Twitter that [[Andy Nicholson]], his fellow member in Mongrel and ex-[[Arctic Monkeys]] bassist would join the band for their third album.

Benassi also remixes music of his contemporaries, such as [[Tomcraft]] and [[Fischerspooner]].\n\nIn 2005, Benassi founded the record label Pump-Kin Music. The focus of the label is primarily new and unsigned producers. The stated aim of the venture is to give exposure to some of the lesser known DJ/production talent across the world.\n\nIn August 2007, Benassi released a remix of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy's]] \"Bring the Noise\". The video for the track was created by [[Eclectic Method]] and features a montage of live footage from Public Enemy. It premiered on imeem.com. In February 2008, \"Bring the Noise\" won a Grammy for best Remix (Dance).\n\n===2008\u201309: ''Rock 'n' Rave''===\nHis album ''[[Rock 'n' Rave]]'' was released on 16 June 2008.

Accessed 19 Dec 2010.</ref>) was an important [[city state]] of ancient [[Sumer]], the center of the [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of the [[sun god]] [[Utu]].  It lies some {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Uruk]] in [[Iraq]]'s [[Dhi Qar Governorate]], near the east bank of the Shatt-en-Nil canal at the site of the modern settlement '''Tell as-Senkereh''' or '''Sankarah'''.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Isin-Larsa period}}\nThe historical \"Larsa\" was already in existence as early as the reign of [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], who annexed it to his empire.\n\nThe city became a political force during the [[Isin-Larsa period]]. After the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] collapsed c. 2000 BC, [[Ishbi-Erra]], an official of [[Ibbi-Sin]], the last king of the Ur III Dynasty, relocated to [[Isin]] and set up a government which purported to be the successor to the Ur III dynasty. From there, Ishbi-Erra recaptured [[Ur]] as well as the cities of [[Uruk]] and Lagash, which Larsa was subject to. Subsequent Isin rulers appointed governors to rule over Larsa; one such governor was an [[Amorite]] named [[Gungunum]]. He eventually broke with Isin and established an independent dynasty in Larsa. To legitimize his rule and deliver a blow to Isin, Gungunum captured the city of Ur.  As the region of Larsa was the main center of trade via the [[Persian Gulf]], Isin lost an enormously profitable trade route, as well as a city with much cultic significance.\n\nGungunum's two successors, [[Abisare]] (c. 1841\u20131830 BC) and [[Sumuel]] (c. 1830\u20131801 BC), both took steps to cut Isin completely off from access to canals. Isin quickly lost political and economic force.\n\nLarsa grew powerful, but never accumulated a large territory. At its peak under king [[Rim-Sin I]] (c. 1758\u20131699 BC), Larsa controlled only about 10-15 other city-states &mdash; nowhere near the territory controlled by other dynasties in Mesopotamian history.  Nevertheless, huge building projects and agricultural undertakings can be detected archaeologically. After the defeat of Rim-Sin I by [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], Larsa became a minor site, though it has been suggested that it was the home of the First [[Sealand Dynasty]] of Babylon.<ref>W. G.

It lies some {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Uruk]] in [[Iraq]]'s [[Dhi Qar Governorate]], near the east bank of the Shatt-en-Nil canal at the site of the modern settlement '''Tell as-Senkereh''' or '''Sankarah'''.\n\n==History==\n{{main|Isin-Larsa period}}\nThe historical \"Larsa\" was already in existence as early as the reign of [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], who annexed it to his empire.\n\nThe city became a political force during the [[Isin-Larsa period]]. After the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] collapsed c. 2000 BC, [[Ishbi-Erra]], an official of [[Ibbi-Sin]], the last king of the Ur III Dynasty, relocated to [[Isin]] and set up a government which purported to be the successor to the Ur III dynasty. From there, Ishbi-Erra recaptured [[Ur]] as well as the cities of [[Uruk]] and Lagash, which Larsa was subject to. Subsequent Isin rulers appointed governors to rule over Larsa; one such governor was an [[Amorite]] named [[Gungunum]]. He eventually broke with Isin and established an independent dynasty in Larsa. To legitimize his rule and deliver a blow to Isin, Gungunum captured the city of Ur.  As the region of Larsa was the main center of trade via the [[Persian Gulf]], Isin lost an enormously profitable trade route, as well as a city with much cultic significance.\n\nGungunum's two successors, [[Abisare]] (c. 1841\u20131830 BC) and [[Sumuel]] (c. 1830\u20131801 BC), both took steps to cut Isin completely off from access to canals. Isin quickly lost political and economic force.\n\nLarsa grew powerful, but never accumulated a large territory. At its peak under king [[Rim-Sin I]] (c. 1758\u20131699 BC), Larsa controlled only about 10-15 other city-states &mdash; nowhere near the territory controlled by other dynasties in Mesopotamian history.  Nevertheless, huge building projects and agricultural undertakings can be detected archaeologically. After the defeat of Rim-Sin I by [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], Larsa became a minor site, though it has been suggested that it was the home of the First [[Sealand Dynasty]] of Babylon.<ref>W. G.

Olson, a [[United States Army]] biochemist and [[biological weapon]]s researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.<ref name=\"olson\"/>\n\nThe Olson family disputes the official version of events. They maintain that Frank Olson was murdered because, especially in the aftermath of his LSD experience, he had become a security risk who might divulge state secrets associated with highly classified CIA programs, about many of which he had direct personal knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |title=The Olson File |publisher=Frankolsonproject.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010804055955/http://www.frankolsonproject.org/Articles/LondonMail.html |archivedate=2001-08-04 |df= }}</ref> A few days before his death, Frank Olson quit his position as acting chief of the Special Operations Division at Detrick, Maryland (later Fort Detrick) because of a severe moral crisis concerning the nature of his biological weapons research.

Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director [[William Colby]] met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.\n\nPreviously, the CIA and the army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine\u2014known as the [[Feres doctrine]], after a 1950 Supreme Court case, ''[[Feres v. United States]]''\u2014that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for any harms that were inflicted \"incident to service.\"\n\nIn 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed this defense in a 5\u20134 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: ''[[United States v. Stanley]]''.<ref>''[[United States v. Stanley]]'', {{ussc|483|669|1987}}</ref> The majority argued that \"a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.\" In dissent, Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of [[United States Bill of Rights|constitutional rights]]:\n\n<blockquote>The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects.... [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.</blockquote>\n\nJustice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], writing a separate dissent, stated:\n\n<blockquote>No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.</blockquote>\n\nIn another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former [[United States Marshal]], after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/commons/5c/Ritchie.pdf |title=Ritchie v.

Since its effects were temporary, he believed one could give it to high-ranking officials and in this way affect the course of important meetings, speeches, etc. Since he realized there was a difference in testing the drug in a laboratory and using it in clandestine operations, he initiated a series of experiments where LSD was given to people in \"normal\" settings without warning. At first, everyone in Technical Services tried it; a typical experiment involved two people in a room where they observed each other for hours and took notes. As the experimentation progressed, a point arrived where outsiders were drugged with no explanation whatsoever and surprise acid trips became something of an occupational hazard among CIA operatives.

The committee noted that the \"experiments sponsored by these researchers ... call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for experiments.\"\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the Church Committee, President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited \"experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject\" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission.

Olson, a [[United States Army]] biochemist and [[biological weapon]]s researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another bed in a New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.<ref name=\"olson\"/>\n\nThe Olson family disputes the official version of events.

Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director [[William Colby]] met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.\n\nPreviously, the CIA and the army had actively and successfully sought to withhold incriminating information, even as they secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine\u2014known as the [[Feres doctrine]], after a 1950 Supreme Court case, ''[[Feres v. United States]]''\u2014that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for any harms that were inflicted \"incident to service.\"\n\nIn 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed this defense in a 5\u20134 decision that dismissed Stanley's case: ''[[United States v. Stanley]]''.<ref>''[[United States v. Stanley]]'', {{ussc|483|669|1987}}</ref> The majority argued that \"a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decision making would itself require judicial inquiry into, and hence intrusion upon, military matters.\" In dissent, Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] argued that the need to preserve military discipline should not protect the government from liability and punishment for serious violations of [[United States Bill of Rights|constitutional rights]]:\n\n<blockquote>The medical trials at Nuremberg in 1947 deeply impressed upon the world that experimentation with unknowing human subjects is morally and legally unacceptable. The United States Military Tribunal established the Nuremberg Code as a standard against which to judge German scientists who experimented with human subjects.... [I]n defiance of this principle, military intelligence officials ... began surreptitiously testing chemical and biological materials, including LSD.</blockquote>\n\nJustice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], writing a separate dissent, stated:\n\n<blockquote>No judicially crafted rule should insulate from liability the involuntary and unknowing human experimentation alleged to have occurred in this case. Indeed, as Justice Brennan observes, the United States played an instrumental role in the criminal prosecution of Nazi officials who experimented with human subjects during the Second World War, and the standards that the Nuremberg Military Tribunals developed to judge the behavior of the defendants stated that the 'voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential ... to satisfy moral, ethical, and legal concepts.' If this principle is violated, the very least that society can do is to see that the victims are compensated, as best they can be, by the perpetrators.</blockquote>\n\nIn another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former [[United States Marshal]], after hearing about the project's existence in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/commons/5c/Ritchie.pdf |title=Ritchie v.

Additionally, every five years the Annual Action Plan is submitted alongside a Consolidated Plan that outlines the area's long-term community development needs, priorities, and strategic plan.

UDAG, along with [[urban renewal]] and other previous federal attempts to alleviate poverty and blight in US cities, was criticized as being a \"top-down\" approach. For these programs, federal planners would dictate how and where funds were spent. In contrast, CDBG was constructed to be a \"bottom-up\" approach.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn order to receive CDBG funds, applicants must identify urgent needs of the community, and solicit project ideas and plans from citizens and local organizations that address those needs. Thus, the CDBG program represents a significant shift in how the federal government addresses poverty and blight. Some researchers argue that because CDBG is a bottom-up program it is significantly more successful than previous programs. Others have said CDBG's scope of allowed activities is too broad, making it difficult to measure program performance.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[First time home buyer grant]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090208200733/http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/communitydevelopment/programs/ Community Development Block Grant Program - CDBG] - HUD website\n\n{{HUD agencies}}\n{{Contemporary social welfare programs in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]\n[[Category:Affordable housing]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|U.S. federal aid program}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = March 2019}}\n\nThe '''Community Development Block Grant''' ('''CDBG'''), one of the longest-running programs of the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]], funds local [[community development]] activities with the stated goal of providing [[affordable housing]], [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s, and infrastructure development.

The 1978 re-authorization also required HUD to award a \"rural set-aside\" of at least 30% of all CDBG funds to states for projects in rural areas. Smaller local governments receive CDBG funding through the Small Cities CDBG program, which is administered by states.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/hudprograms/entitlement |title=Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) (Entitlement) |website=HUD Portal |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development |access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref> Other programs include the CDBG Insular Area Program (for American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), the CDBG Program Colonias Set-Aside, and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/communitydevelopment/programs|title=Community Development Block Grant Program - CDBG|website=HUD.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nNominal levels of CDBG funding have remained fairly constant over time, but they have dramatically declined over the course of the program's existence in inflation-adjusted terms, as can be seen in the figure to the right.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hudexchange.info/onecpd/assets/File/CDBG-Allocations-History-FYs-1975-2014.pdf|title=CDBG Funding and Number of Metro Cities & Urban Counties, by Fiscal Year|website=HUD Exchange|publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CDBG Allocation.png|thumb|CDBG Allocation by Year from 1975-2014 in 2016 Dollars, taken from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, inflation adjustments from the Bureau of Labor Statistics]]\n\nFurthermore, President Donald Trump has called for eliminating the program entirely in both his 2018 and 2019 proposed budgets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbpp.org/blog/trump-budget-eliminates-housing-and-community-development-block-grants|title=Trump Budget Eliminates Housing and Community Development Block Grants|last=Flores|first=Lissette|date=June 8, 2017|website=CBPP.org|publisher=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbpp.org/blog/states-cant-afford-trump-budgets-massive-cost-shift|title=States Can\u2019t Afford Trump Budget\u2019s Massive Cost Shift|last=Leachman|first=Michael|date=February 15, 2018|website=CBPP.org|publisher=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nProposed CDBG projects must be consistent with broad national priorities for CDBG: activities that benefit low- and moderate-income people, the prevention or [[slum clearance|elimination of slums]] or blight, or other community development activities to address an urgent threat to health or safety. CDBG funds may be used for community development activities (such as real estate acquisition, relocation, demolition, rehabilitation of housing and commercial buildings), construction of public facilities and improvements (such as water, sewer, and other utilities, street paving, and sidewalks), construction and maintenance of neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings, public services, and economic development and job creation/retention activities. CDBG funds can also be used for preservation and restoration of historic properties in low-income neighborhoods.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nFrom the federal level, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has set three goals for Community Planning and Development (CPD) Programs \u2013 \u201cTo ensure decent housing; To create and maintain a suitable living environment; and To expand economic opportunities\u201d,<ref>{{cite report|authors=Beverly Johnson and Benita DeFrank|date=2017|title=City of Pomona Fiscal Year 17-18 Annual Action Plan|url=http://www.ci.pomona.ca.us/mm/FY_17-18_Annual_Action_Plan_APPROVED.pdf |publisher=City of Pomona, California|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> that are taken directly from the Housing and Community Development Act. On the local level, however, each city is allowed to select their own objectives and priorities underneath each of those goals that they believe will best meet the needs of their community.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nLocal governments receiving CDBG funds must submit two annual performance and evaluation reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title42/html/USCODE-2010-title42-chap69-sec5304.htm|title=U.S.C.

Statement of activities and review|website=gpo.gov|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> First, an Annual Action Plan for the upcoming fiscal year that also serves as an application for funds is due to HUD in mid-May. This plan includes the area's expected funding resources and stated community development goals and provides information about planned projects including their geographic distribution and the activity categories and development objectives they fall under. The creation of the Action Plans includes community outreach, public meetings, and the solicitation of Requests for Proposals from city government departments and local nonprofits of activities that could be funded. Additionally, every five years the Annual Action Plan is submitted alongside a Consolidated Plan that outlines the area's long-term community development needs, priorities, and strategic plan. Second, a Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER) covering the previous fiscal year is submitted to HUD at the end of September to ensure the cities are meeting objectives. The CAPER includes \u201ca description of the progress made in accomplishing the objectives\u201d of the CDBG, and \u201ca summary of the use of such funds during the preceding fiscal year\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title42/html/USCODE-2010-title42-chap69-sec5313.htm|title=U.S.C.

UDAG, along with [[urban renewal]] and other previous federal attempts to alleviate poverty and blight in US cities, was criticized as being a \"top-down\" approach. For these programs, federal planners would dictate how and where funds were spent. In contrast, CDBG was constructed to be a \"bottom-up\" approach.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn order to receive CDBG funds, applicants must identify urgent needs of the community, and solicit project ideas and plans from citizens and local organizations that address those needs. Thus, the CDBG program represents a significant shift in how the federal government addresses poverty and blight. Some researchers argue that because CDBG is a bottom-up program it is significantly more successful than previous programs. Others have said CDBG's scope of allowed activities is too broad, making it difficult to measure program performance.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[First time home buyer grant]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090208200733/http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/communitydevelopment/programs/ Community Development Block Grant Program - CDBG] - HUD website\n\n{{HUD agencies}}\n{{Contemporary social welfare programs in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]\n[[Category:Affordable housing]]\n", "name_user": "105.112.179.32", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Development_Block_Grant"}
