With the exception of Winnipeg, which is the largest city in Manitoba, all other provincial capitals of the Western Provinces are located in the second-largest metropolitan areas of their respective province.\n\n== Constitutional history ==\n{{main|Constitutional history of Canada}}\nWestern Canada is the traditional territory of numerous First Nations predating the arrival of Europeans. As Britain colonized the west, it established treaties with various First Nations, took control of other areas without opposition and fought with other First Nations to take control of Western Canada. Not all lands were ceded by the First Nations to British control and land claims are still ongoing.\n\nIn 1858, the British government established the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858\u20131866)|Colony of British Columbia]], governing that part of Canada still known as British Columbia. The British government also established the Hudson's Bay Company which controlled most of the current area of Western Canada, northern Ontario and northern Quebec, the area known as [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]]. In 1870, the British government transferred the lands of the company to Canada. The area of Western Canada not within British Columbia was established as the [[Northwest Territories]] under Canadian control. The Western Canadian provinces other than British Columbia were established from areas of the Northwest Territories:\n\n*[[Manitoba]] established as a province of Canada in 1870, following the enacting of the ''[[Manitoba Act]]''.<ref name=\"Dodek2013\">{{cite book|author=Adam Dodek|title=The Canadian Constitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SE-k3CGNaW4C&pg=PA19|year=2013|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-0932-4|page=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=W.P.M|title=Statutes, treaties and documents of the Canadian Constitution, 1713- 1929|url=http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_03428/669?r=0&s=1|website=Early Canadiana Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n*[[British Columbia]]: Under terms that Canada would absorb the colony's debt, would begin to subsidize public work, and would begin to construct a railway allowing travel from British Columbia to [[Ontario]], British Columbia agreed to join [[Canadian confederation]] in 1871.<ref name=\"Dodek2013\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=British Columbia|url=http://www.canadiana.ca/citm/themes/constitution/constitution14_e.html#bc|website=Canada in the Making: Constitutional History|publisher=Early Canadiana Online|accessdate=10 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516013056/http://www.canadiana.ca/citm/themes/constitution/constitution14_e.html#bc|archivedate=16 May 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Saskatchewan]]: Established as province in 1905, with the implementation of the ''[[Saskatchewan Act]]''.<ref name=\"Dodek2013\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Saskatchewan|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/saskatchewan/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Alberta]]: In 1905, the same year as Saskatchewan, Alberta also was established as province.

It covers 2.9 million square kilometres \u2013 almost 29% of Canada's land area. British Columbia adjoins the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, while Manitoba has a coastline on [[Hudson Bay]] in its northeast of the province. Both Alberta and Saskatchewan are [[landlocked]] between British Columbia and Manitoba.\n\nThe [[Canadian Prairies]] are part of a vast [[sedimentary]] [[Great Plains|plain]] covering much of [[Alberta]], southern Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba. The prairies form a significant portion of the land area of Western Canada. The plains generally describes the expanses of largely flat, arable agricultural land which sustain extensive grain farming operations in the southern part of the provinces. Despite this, some areas such as the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] and Alberta Badlands are quite hilly and the prairie provinces contain large areas of forest such as the [[Mid-Continental Canadian forests]].\n\nIn Alberta and British Columbia, the [[Canadian Cordillera]] is bounded by the Rocky Mountains to the east and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.\n\nThe [[Canadian Rockies]] are part of a major [[continental divide]] that extends north and south through western North America and western [[South America]]. The continental divide also defines much of the border between Alberta and British Columbia. The [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and the [[Fraser River]]s have their headwaters in the Canadian Rockies and are the second- and third-largest rivers, respectively, to drain to the west coast of North America. To the west of their headwaters, across the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]], is a second belt of mountains, the [[Columbia Mountains]], comprising the [[Selkirk Mountains|Selkirk]], [[Purcell Mountains|Purcell]], [[Monashee Mountains|Monashee]] and [[Cariboo Mountains]] sub-ranges.\n\n{{wide image|Peyto Lake Panorama.jpg|800px|[[Peyto Lake]] in Banff National Park, Alberta}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Western Canada K\u00f6ppen.svg|400px|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in Western Canada]]\nThe [[British Columbia Coast|coast of British Columbia]] enjoys a moderate [[oceanic climate]] because of the influence of the Pacific Ocean. Winters are typically wet and summers relatively dry. These areas enjoy the mildest winter weather in all of Canada, as temperatures rarely fall much below the freezing mark. The mountainous Interior of the province is drier and has colder winters, but experiences hotter summers than the more moderate coastal areas. [[Lytton, British Columbia]], a small town that sits at the confluence of the Thompson River and Fraser River recorded the second-hottest temperature in Canada at {{convert|44.4|C}} observed on July 16 and 17, 1941,<ref>[http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=&StationID=966&Year=1941&Month=7&Day=26 Daily Data Report for July 1941]</ref> and is regularly referred as Canada's hot spot in summer with temperatures easily reaching the mid to high 30&nbsp;\u00b0C 's (upper 90s to low 100s&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July and August and sometimes top {{convert|40|C}}.\n\nAlberta has a dry continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold Arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. Winters are generally quite cold, though some areas can experience a phenomenon known as the \"[[Chinook wind]],\" wherein warm winds raise the winter temperatures temporarily. In contrast, summers can fluctuate from cool to hot and are generally wetter.\n\n[[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] have a continental climate and experience extremes in weather. Winters in both provinces can be classified as harsh with [[Arctic]] winds and {{convert|\u221240|C}} temperatures possible. Winter temperatures in both provinces average between {{convert|\u221210|and|\u221215|C}}. In contrast, summers can be hot with temperatures exceeding {{convert|35|C}} at least once per year in most locations. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Canada was {{convert|45|C}}, observed in 1937 at the weather stations of [[Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan]] and neighbouring [[Midale]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:60%; font-size:95%;\"\n|+'''Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for 7 largest cities in Western Canada'''\n|-\n!City\n!July (\u00b0C)\n!July (\u00b0F)\n!January (\u00b0C)\n!January (\u00b0F)\n|-\n| [[Calgary]]<ref name=\"ccncalgary\">{{cite web |url= http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=2205&lang=e&dCode=1&province=ALTA&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 |title= Calgary International Airport |work= Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 |publisher= [[Environment Canada]] |accessdate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref> || 23/9 || 73/48 || {{sort|2715|\u22121/\u221213}} || {{sort|5735|27/5}}\n|-\n| [[Edmonton]]<ref name=\"ccnedmonton\">{{cite web | title = Edmonton City Centre Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u22122010 | publisher = Environment Canada | date = August 19, 2013 | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=1867&lang=e&dCode=0&province=ALTA&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | accessdate = September 10, 2013}}</ref> || 23/12 || 73/54 || {{sort|2213|\u22126/\u221214}} || {{sort|4831|21/5}}\n|-\n| [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]<ref name=\"ccnregina\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3002&lang=e&dCode=1&province=SASK&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Regina International Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = 12 May 2014}}</ref> || 26/11 || 79/52 || -10/-22 || 14/-8\n|-\n| [[Saskatoon]]<ref name=\"ccnsaskatoon\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3328&lang=e&dCode=1&province=SASK&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Saskatoon Diefenbaker International Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = May 12, 2014}}</ref> || 25/11 || 77/52 || -12/-22 || 10/-8\n|-\n| [[Winnipeg]]<ref name=\"ccnwinnipeg\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&dCode=1&province=MAN&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Winnipeg Richardson International Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = May 7, 2014}}</ref> || 26/13 || 79/55 || \u221213/\u221220 || 9/\u22124\n|-\n| [[Vancouver]]<ref name =\"ccnvancouver\">{{cite web | url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1 | title=1981 to 2010 Canadian Climate Normals | publisher=Environment Canada | id = Climate ID: 1108447 | date=2015-09-22 | accessdate=2016-05-09}}</ref> || 22/13 || 71/54 || 6/1 || 43/33\n|-\n| [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]<ref name=\"ccnvictoria\">{{cite web | publisher = Environment Canada | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&province=BC&provSubmit=go&page=276&dCode=0 | title = Victoria Gonzales Heights | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 | accessdate = 29 April 2016}}</ref> || 22/11 || 71/51 || 7/1 || 44/33\n|-\n|}\n\n== Politics ==\n=== Federal politics ===\nIn Canadian politics, the term \"the West\" is used misleadingly in Canadian media style guides as shorthand for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leanings of Western Canadians, as contrasted with the greater likelihood for candidates from either the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) to be elected in [[Central Canada]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

Following the 2017 provincial election in British Columbia, the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] formed a minority government with the support of the [[British Columbia Green Party]], following the defeat of [[Christy Clark]]'s BC Liberal Party government by a confidence vote in the legislature. Manitoba holds a majority [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Conservative]] government as does Saskatchewan with the [[Saskatchewan Party]]. The [[United Conservative Party]] holds a landslide majority government in Alberta. \n\nSince at least the 1930s, economic conditions have contributed to a net emigration from Manitoba and Saskatchewan to Alberta and British Columbia, which have generally provided greater employment opportunities and higher living standards. The population of Saskatchewan is only slightly larger than it was in 1931. This trend of net emigration in both provinces is reversing because of a lower cost of living than Alberta and BC.\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"400px\" heights=\"350px\" caption=\"Provincial Legislatures\">\nFile:British Columbia 41st Legislature Seating Plan.svg|British Columbia's legislature.

The population of Ontario alone (13.1 million) exceeds that of all the Western provinces combined. The total population of Atlantic Canada, however, is 2.3 million, and this region is represented by 30 senators. Thus, Ontario is under-represented, Quebec has representation proportional to its population and the Atlantic provinces are over-represented. Westerners have advocated the so-called [[Triple-E Senate]], which stands for \"equal, elected, effective.\" They feel if all 10 provinces were allotted an equal number of senators, if those senators were elected instead of appointed, and if the Senate were a body that had more direct political power (for example via an arrangement more similar to the structure of the [[Australian Senate]] or the [[United States Senate]] rather than the UK model), then their region would have more of its concerns addressed at the federal level. Other westerners find this approach simplistic and either advocate keeping the status quo or may support other models for senate reform. The combination of all of these issues has led to the concept known as [[Western alienation]], as well as calls for [[Secessionist movements of Canada#Western Canada|Western Canada independence]] by various fringe groups.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Pipes for keystone pipeline in 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Pipelines allow Western Canada to export oil and gas.]]\n[[File:Vineyards Lake Okanagan.jpg|thumb|Vineyards in British Columbia]]\n\nEnergy and agriculture are Western Canada's dominant industries \u2013 and this region, with only 11 million inhabitants, is one of the world's largest net exporters of both energy and agricultural commodities.

sometimes grouped together as the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie Provinces]] and most commonly known as \"The Prairies\".{{clear left}}\n\n== Capital cities ==\nThe capital cities of the four western provinces, from west to east, are [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] (British Columbia), [[Edmonton]] (Alberta), [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] (Saskatchewan) and [[Winnipeg]] (Manitoba). With the exception of Winnipeg, which is the largest city in Manitoba, all other provincial capitals of the Western Provinces are located in the second-largest metropolitan areas of their respective province.\n\n== Constitutional history ==\n{{main|Constitutional history of Canada}}\nWestern Canada is the traditional territory of numerous First Nations predating the arrival of Europeans. As Britain colonized the west, it established treaties with various First Nations, took control of other areas without opposition and fought with other First Nations to take control of Western Canada. Not all lands were ceded by the First Nations to British control and land claims are still ongoing.\n\nIn 1858, the British government established the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858\u20131866)|Colony of British Columbia]], governing that part of Canada still known as British Columbia. The British government also established the Hudson's Bay Company which controlled most of the current area of Western Canada, northern Ontario and northern Quebec, the area known as [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]]. In 1870, the British government transferred the lands of the company to Canada.

It covers 2.9 million square kilometres \u2013 almost 29% of Canada's land area. British Columbia adjoins the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, while Manitoba has a coastline on [[Hudson Bay]] in its northeast of the province. Both Alberta and Saskatchewan are [[landlocked]] between British Columbia and Manitoba.\n\nThe [[Canadian Prairies]] are part of a vast [[sedimentary]] [[Great Plains|plain]] covering much of [[Alberta]], southern Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba. The prairies form a significant portion of the land area of Western Canada. The plains generally describes the expanses of largely flat, arable agricultural land which sustain extensive grain farming operations in the southern part of the provinces. Despite this, some areas such as the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] and Alberta Badlands are quite hilly and the prairie provinces contain large areas of forest such as the [[Mid-Continental Canadian forests]].\n\nIn Alberta and British Columbia, the [[Canadian Cordillera]] is bounded by the Rocky Mountains to the east and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.\n\nThe [[Canadian Rockies]] are part of a major [[continental divide]] that extends north and south through western North America and western [[South America]]. The continental divide also defines much of the border between Alberta and British Columbia. The [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and the [[Fraser River]]s have their headwaters in the Canadian Rockies and are the second- and third-largest rivers, respectively, to drain to the west coast of North America. To the west of their headwaters, across the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]], is a second belt of mountains, the [[Columbia Mountains]], comprising the [[Selkirk Mountains|Selkirk]], [[Purcell Mountains|Purcell]], [[Monashee Mountains|Monashee]] and [[Cariboo Mountains]] sub-ranges.\n\n{{wide image|Peyto Lake Panorama.jpg|800px|[[Peyto Lake]] in Banff National Park, Alberta}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Western Canada K\u00f6ppen.svg|400px|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] in Western Canada]]\nThe [[British Columbia Coast|coast of British Columbia]] enjoys a moderate [[oceanic climate]] because of the influence of the Pacific Ocean, with temperatures similar to those of the [[British Isles]] (though Vancouver receives more precipitation than London and most of the Coast is much wetter).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Winters are typically wet and summers relatively dry. These areas enjoy the mildest winter weather in all of Canada, as temperatures rarely fall much below the freezing mark. The mountainous Interior of the province is drier and has colder winters, but experiences hotter summers than the more moderate coastal areas. [[Lytton, British Columbia]], a small town that sits at the confluence of the Thompson River and Fraser River recorded the second-hottest temperature in Canada at {{convert|44.4|C}} observed on July 16 and 17 1941,<ref>[http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=&StationID=966&Year=1941&Month=7&Day=26 Daily Data Report for July 1941]</ref> and is regularly referred as Canada's hot spot in summer with temperatures easily reaching the mid to high 30&nbsp;\u00b0C 's (upper 90s to low 100s&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July and August and sometimes top {{convert|40|C}}.\n\nAlberta has a dry continental climate with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold Arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. Winters are generally quite cold, though some areas can experience a phenomenon known as the \"[[Chinook wind]],\" wherein warm winds raise the winter temperatures temporarily. In contrast, summers can fluctuate from cool to hot and are generally wetter.\n\n[[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] have a continental climate and experience extremes in weather. Winters in both provinces can be classified as harsh with [[Arctic]] winds and {{convert|\u221240|C}} temperatures possible. Winter temperatures in both provinces average between {{convert|\u221210|and|\u221215|C}}. In contrast, summers can be hot with temperatures exceeding {{convert|35|C}} at least once per year in most locations. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Canada was {{convert|45|C}}, observed in 1937 at the weather stations of [[Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan]] and neighbouring [[Midale]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:60%; font-size:95%;\"\n|+'''Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for 7 largest cities in Western Canada'''\n|-\n!City\n!July (\u00b0C)\n!July (\u00b0F)\n!January (\u00b0C)\n!January (\u00b0F)\n|-\n| [[Calgary]]<ref name=\"ccncalgary\">{{cite web |url= http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=2205&lang=e&dCode=1&province=ALTA&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 |title= Calgary International Airport |work= Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 |publisher= [[Environment Canada]] |accessdate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref> || 23/9 || 73/48 || {{sort|2715|\u22121/\u221213}} || {{sort|5735|27/5}}\n|-\n| [[Edmonton]]<ref name=\"ccnedmonton\">{{cite web | title = Edmonton City Centre Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u22122010 | publisher = Environment Canada | date = August 19, 2013 | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=1867&lang=e&dCode=0&province=ALTA&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | accessdate = September 10, 2013}}</ref> || 23/12 || 73/54 || {{sort|2213|\u22126/\u221214}} || {{sort|4831|21/5}}\n|-\n| [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]<ref name=\"ccnregina\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3002&lang=e&dCode=1&province=SASK&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Regina International Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = 12 May 2014}}</ref> || 26/11 || 79/52 || -10/-22 || 14/-8\n|-\n| [[Saskatoon]]<ref name=\"ccnsaskatoon\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3328&lang=e&dCode=1&province=SASK&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Saskatoon Diefenbaker International Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = May 12, 2014}}</ref> || 25/11 || 77/52 || -12/-22 || 10/-8\n|-\n| [[Winnipeg]]<ref name=\"ccnwinnipeg\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&lang=e&dCode=1&province=MAN&provBut=Go&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Winnipeg Richardson International Airport | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = May 7, 2014}}</ref> || 26/13 || 79/55 || \u221213/\u221220 || 9/\u22124\n|-\n| [[Vancouver]]<ref name =\"ccnvancouver\">{{cite web | url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&lang=e&StationName=Vancouver&SearchType=Contains&stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=1 | title=1981 to 2010 Canadian Climate Normals | publisher=Environment Canada | id = Climate ID: 1108447 | date=2015-09-22 | accessdate=2016-05-09}}</ref> || 22/13 || 71/54 || 6/1 || 43/33\n|-\n| [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]<ref name=\"ccnvictoria\">{{cite web | publisher = Environment Canada | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&province=BC&provSubmit=go&page=276&dCode=0 | title = Victoria Gonzales Heights | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 | accessdate = 29 April 2016}}</ref> || 22/11 || 71/51 || 7/1 || 44/33\n|-\n|}\n\n== Politics ==\n=== Federal politics ===\nIn Canadian politics, the term \"the West\" is used misleadingly in Canadian media style guides as shorthand for the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leanings of Western Canadians, as contrasted with the greater likelihood for candidates from either the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) to be elected in [[Central Canada]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

Following the 2017 provincial election in British Columbia, the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] formed a minority government with the support of the [[British Columbia Green Party]], following the defeat of [[Christy Clark]]'s BC Liberal Party government by a confidence vote in the legislature. Manitoba holds a majority [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba|Conservative]] government as does Saskatchewan with the [[Saskatchewan Party]]. The [[United Conservative Party]] holds a landslide majority government in Alberta. \n\nSince at least the 1930s, economic conditions have contributed to a net emigration from Manitoba and Saskatchewan to Alberta and British Columbia, which have generally provided greater employment opportunities and higher living standards. The population of Saskatchewan is only slightly larger than it was in 1931.

The population of Ontario alone (13.1 million) exceeds that of all the Western provinces combined. The total population of Atlantic Canada, however, is 2.3 million, and this region is represented by 30 senators. Thus, Ontario is under-represented, Quebec has representation proportional to its population and the Atlantic provinces are over-represented. Westerners have advocated the so-called [[Triple-E Senate]], which stands for \"equal, elected, effective.\" They feel if all 10 provinces were allotted an equal number of senators, if those senators were elected instead of appointed, and if the Senate were a body that had more direct political power (for example via an arrangement more similar to the structure of the [[Australian Senate]] or the [[United States Senate]] rather than the UK model), then their region would have more of its concerns addressed at the federal level. Other westerners find this approach simplistic and either advocate keeping the status quo or may support other models for senate reform. The combination of all of these issues has led to the concept known as [[Western alienation]], as well as calls for [[Secessionist movements of Canada#Western Canada|Western Canada independence]] by various fringe groups.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Pipes for keystone pipeline in 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Pipelines allow Western Canada to export oil and gas.]]\n[[File:Vineyards Lake Okanagan.jpg|thumb|Vineyards in British Columbia]]\n\nEnergy and agriculture are Western Canada's dominant industries \u2013 and this region, with only 11 million inhabitants, is one of the world's largest net exporters of both energy and agricultural commodities.

It was originally named '''Bonnington Park Academy''' in 1858. Since then, it has expanded and is now attended by 1,500 pupils from all over the Tweeddale area.\n\nThe school was expanded In 2000 when The Millennium Wing was added. This expansion meant a great increase in size and capacity including a Learning Resource Centre and entire business suite. A new sports centre was completed in 2014.\n\nIn 2013, the school was ranked 1st in England for Higher exam passes.<ref name=\"Herald Scotland\">heraldscotland.com \"[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/revealed-scotland-s-best-50-schools-for-higher-exam-passes.1387466220 Revealed: Scotland's best 50 schools for Higher exam passes]\" December 19th, 2013</ref>\n\nThe school was damaged severely by a serious fire which was caused by two S1 rats who lit Gym mats on fire as it spread across the School on the 28th of November 2019, which forced its closure for several weeks.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe school follows the standard Scottish curriculum with subjects ranging from Mathematics and English to newer subjects such as Business Management and Child Care.\n\n==Sports==\nRugby and Javelin are popular sports at the school. However, students are encouraged to participate in a wide range of other sports including football, netball, mountain biking, swimming athletics and Fox hunting .\n\n==History of the School==\n\n=== Incipience ===\n\nThe very first origins of Peebles High School date as far back as 1464 when a \u201cscule and sculmaster\u201d were appointed. Two centuries later there is evidence of \u201cthe establishment of the English School and the Grammar School of Peebles on Tweed Green\u201d. More recent history suggests the most immediate origins of Peebles High School was in 1858 when a private school, known then as Bonnington Park Academy for boys, was established. A private school for girls called St Leonards existed around that time and was hosted within the Parish Church Manse.\n\nBy 1873 the roll of children in the local community totalled 538 between the ages of 5-13, 85% of whom were at school. To accommodate this increasing roll, an application was made to make the existing school a \u201cHigher Class School\u201d i.e. to teach beyond elementary level. In 1876 it was only one of 20 in Scotland to achieve this. Also in this year \u201cyoung ladies\u201d were finally allowed to enrol. This led to a change of name to\u201d Peebles High School-Bonnington Park.\u201d Students came from all over the county. It was, however, a private school that consisted of a preparatory and upper school, the latter requiring an examination to permit a pupil to access.\n\n=== Twentieth Century ===\n\nIn 1901 there were about 100 students in the \u201cupper part of the school\u201d now known as \u201cPeebles and County High school\u201d. The Education Act of 1908 finally allowed grants to children allowing them to remain in school. By 1910 the school was a single story building consisting of a number of rooms off of a single corridor, where the science labs now exist.\n\nBy 1927 there were approximately 200 pupils in the school and 12 staff, however by 1935 the Preparation department was closed and pupils transferred to Kingsland and Halyrude. Lack of accommodation beyond the age of 14 at these schools meant that a decision was made to expand the Burgh and County School in 1936. The new addition to the school known as the \u201c36 block\u201d was completed in 1938, This now meant all pupils over the age of 12 were expected to attend. There were extensive sports fields around the school, allowing a wide access to sport.\n\nThe beginning of World War Two saw a large influx of evacuees to \u201csafe\u201d Peebles, adding six air raid shelters to the school playground and a necessity to turn playing fields into vegetable allotments. The Education Act of 1947 saw the roll increase to 400, as students were now to remain at school until age 15. At this time there was also an increase of students remaining into the 6th year.\n\nThe next significant structural change, due to the pressure on accommodation and the leaving age increasing to age 16, was the \u201cTower, dining room and technical block\u201d. These were added at a cost of \u00a3443,000 in 1970. Even then Modern studies and History resided in Huts which remained until 1999. There were as many as 13 huts at Peebles High School at this time.\n\n=== Twenty-First Century ===\n\nDue to the aforesaid pressure for space, the Millennium Wing was born, built behind the 36 block. This modern building consisted of an innovative two level development with an open and bright congregational space known as the \u201cAtrium\u201d.  By 2000 the school had over 80 teachers and in excess of 1000 pupils.\n \nBy 2014, in an effort to increase access to sport, the school led an extensive campaign by the Head teacher and its community to generate a new, state of the art sports facility, funded in partnership with SBC and Sports Scotland, costing \u00a34.8m. This extended the sports curriculum and resulted in a Gold Level Award in recognition of what was now on offer not just to students but the whole community. \n\n=== Fire in November, 2019 ===\n\nOn 28 November 2019, the art and the P.E. department was destroyed in a fire, reportedly caused by a kiln becoming overheated and exploding.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-50591241</ref><ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-50600016</ref> All staff and students were evacuated safely. Later the same day, the fire was brought under control.\n \nExtensive reconstruction of the damaged parts of the school will be required. The affected buildings date back to the 1930s and therefore offered little resistance to an such an intense blaze.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{See also|Category:People educated at Peebles High School, Peeblesshire}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scottishschoolsonline/schools/peebleshighschoolscottishborders.asp Peebles High's page on Scottish Schools Online]\n*[http://peebleshighschool.org.uk/ Peebles High School Official Webpage]\n\n{{coord missing|Scottish Borders}}\n\n[[Category:Secondary schools in the Scottish Borders]]\n[[Category:Peebles]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox school \n| name          = Peebles High School\n| image         = \n| image_size          = \n| caption       = \n| motto         = Mente et Manu\n| established   = 1858\n| closed        = \n| type          = [[Secondary School]]\n| religious_affiliation      = \n| president     = \n| head_label    = Rector\n| head          = Campbell Wilson\n| r_head_label  = \n| r_head        = \n| chair_label   = \n| chair         = \n| founder       = \n| specialist    = \n| address        = Springwood Road\n| city          = [[Peebles]]\n| county        = [[Scottish Borders]]\n| country       = [[Scotland]]\n| postcode      = EH45 9HB\n| local_authority           = [[Scottish Borders Council]]\n| dfeno         = \n| urn           = \n| ofsted        = \n| staff         = \n| enrolment    = \n| gender        = Mixed\n| lower_age     = 11\n| upper_age     = 18\n| houses        = \n| colours       = \n| publication   = \n| free_label_1  = School years\n| free_1        = S1-S6\n| free_label_2  = Telephone\n| free_2        = 01721 720291\n| free_label_3  = \n| free_3        = \n| website       = {{url|http://peebleshighschool.org.uk}}\n}}\n'''Peebles High School''' was a state run comprehensive school for girls and boys aged 12\u201318, located in [[Peebles]] in the [[Scottish Borders]].

Short plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played (together with other plays in the cycle) to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> Among Coward's earlier one-act plays are ''[[The Better Half (play)|The Better Half]]'' (1921) and ''[[Post Mortem (Coward play)|Post Mortem]]'' (1930). In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in a revival of ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref><!-- TIM, is this the right source for this?

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he is somewhat attached.<!-- ATTRACTED? --> Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\", about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There\", finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena<!-- WHO IS LENA, a maid? --> is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back to the house because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\n\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

Short plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played (together with other plays in the cycle) to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> Among Coward's earlier one-act plays are ''[[The Better Half (play)|The Better Half]]'' (1921) and ''[[Post Mortem (Coward play)|Post Mortem]]'' (1930). In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in a revival of ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref><!-- TIM, is this the right source for this?

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he is somewhat attached.<!-- ATTRACTED? --> Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\", about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There\", finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena<!-- WHO IS LENA, a maid? --> is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back to the house because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\n\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

It was the first stack interchange in the world.]]\n\nA '''stack interchange''', or [[colloquial]]ly '''butterfly junction''', is a particular, free-flowing type of design for [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]], meaning [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] road junctions. It is referred to as a '''directional interchange''' in the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] ''Policy on [[Geometric design of roads|Geometric Design]] of Highways and Streets''.<ref>{{cite book |author = [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] |title = A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets |year = 2011 |publisher = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |location = Washington, DC |isbn = 978-1-56051-508-1 |pages = 10\u201353 }}</ref>\n\nIn countries where one drives [[Right- and left-hand traffic|on the right]], left turns are handled by semi-directional flyovers or under ramps. Vehicles first exit the main carriageway to the right, then complete the turn via a ramp that crosses both highways, eventually merging with the traffic turning right from the opposite side of the interchange. A stack interchange therefore has two pairs of left-turning ramps, which may be \"stacked\" in various configurations above or below the two interchanging highways. In countries where one drives [[Right- and left-hand traffic|on the left]], the appearance of the junction is topologically identical, but [[traffic flow]]s are reversed.\n\nStacks eliminate the problems of [[Grade separation#Weaving|weaving]] and have the highest vehicle capacity among different types of four-way interchanges. However, they require considerable and expensive construction work for their flyover ramps, as well as having a larger footprint. Stack interchanges are also widely considered to be an eyesore among residents of homes near existing or proposed interchanges, leading to considerable [[NIMBY]] opposition.\n\n==Four-level stack==\n[[File:Stackinterchange.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Four-level stack]]\nThe four-level stack (or simply ''four-stack'') has one major freeway crossing another freeway with a viaduct, with connector flyover ramps crossing on two further levels. This type of interchange does not usually permit [[U-turn]]s.

Most of the I\u2011291 beltway was later cancelled, and the sprawling stack lay dormant for almost 25 years. In 1992 the extension of [[Connecticut Route&nbsp;9]] to I-84 used the I\u2011291 right-of-way and some sections of the abandoned interchange. Several ramps still remain unused, including abandoned roadbed for I-291 both north and south of the complex.\n\nFour-level stacks are used for the interchanges between:\n* [[Interstate 77 in North Carolina|I-77]] and [[Interstate 485|I-485]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]];\n* [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] and [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]];\n* [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] and [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|I-405]] in [[Bellevue, Washington]];\n* [[Interstate 110 (Louisiana)|I\u2011110]] and [[U.S. Route 61 in Louisiana|US&nbsp;61]]/[[U.S. Route 190 in Louisiana|US&nbsp;190]] in Louisiana;\n* [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] and [[Interstate 696|I-696]] near [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]];\n* [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] and [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] in [[Flint, Michigan]];\n* [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I\u201170]]/[[Interstate 270 (Missouri\u2013Illinois)|I\u2011270]] and I\u2011270/[[Interstate 64 in Missouri|I\u201164]] [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]];\n* The [[Marquette Interchange]] between [[Interstate 794|I-794]], [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|I-94]], and [[Interstate 43|I-43]] in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]; and\n* The [[Zoo Interchange]] between [[Interstate 894|I-894]], I-94, [[Interstate 41|I-41]], and [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;41]]/[[U.S. Route 45 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;45]] [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].\n\nAnother well-known stack interchange lies west of [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], serving as the junction between [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] and [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]]. It was originally built for a planned extension of I\u201170 into the city, but because of heavy opposition, I\u201170 ends at a [[park and ride]] {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} east. As a result, the road east of I\u2011695 sees very little traffic compared to the high volumes to and from the west.\n\nAnother four-level stack interchange in the Baltimore area is located at the northeastern junction between I-695 and [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]]. The stack was built as part of a massive I-95 reconstruction project that includes [[high-occupancy toll lane]]s (HOT lanes), designed to relieve congestion between Baltimore and its northeastern suburbs.\n\nIn [[Lone Tree, Colorado]], there is a four-level stack serving [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|I-25]], the eastern end of [[Colorado State Highway 470|C-470]] and the southern end of [[E-470]]. In [[Thornton, Colorado]], there is another stack serving I-25 and E-470 at its northern end as it continues west as the [[Northwest Parkway]].\n\n===Canada===\nThe junction between [[Anthony Henday Drive]] and [[Yellowhead Highway]] east of [[Edmonton, Alberta]] is almost a stack interchange with three semi-directional flyover/underpass ramps. Two new semi-directional flyovers and one loop ramp for the eastbound to northbound movement were added during the interchange reconstruction, while also accommodating an existing semi-directional underpass ramp for the westbound to southbound movement that runs parallel to the railway line that bisects the interchange. Due to the wide spacing between the underpass ramp and the flyover ramps, this is a three level interchange.\n\n====Ontario====\nThe initial design of [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway&nbsp;407]] had several four-level stack interchanges planned at junctions with existing 400-series highways, but ending up only one example was built&ndash;the interchange at [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]] in [[Vaughan, Ontario]], which is also the only true four-level stack in all of Canada. Highway&nbsp;407's other proposed four-level stacks at [[Ontario Highway 410|Highway&nbsp;410]] and [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway&nbsp;404]] were reduced to three-level [[Interchange_(road)#Cloverstack_interchange|cloverstack interchanges]] with loop ramps instead of a fourth level of semi-directional ramps. Similarly the Highway&nbsp;407 interchange with [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway&nbsp;427]] has four levels but only two semi-directional flyover ramps (that cross each other) connecting to Highway&nbsp;427 south of that junction, while two loop ramps link Highway&nbsp;407 with Highway&nbsp;427 north of that junction. \n\nThe junction between [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway&nbsp;401]], [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway&nbsp;403]], and Highway&nbsp;410 is almost a stack interchange, albeit for the loop ramp in the northeast quadrant (which was opened in 2018 along with a directional ramp in the southwest quadrant for the opposite movement, making it a four-way interchange). However the only point of that interchange that has truly has four levels is where the Highway&nbsp;401 EB to Highway&nbsp;410 NB ramp crosses the Highway&nbsp;410 SB to Highway&nbsp;401 EB ramp, which is a considerable distance from the semi-directional ramps linking Highway&nbsp;401 WB to Highway&nbsp;403 WB.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.401expansion-mississauga.ca/updates/RPT-2014-01-29%20DCR%2060213979.pdf |title = Design and Construction Report - Highway 401 Widening }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.401expansion-mississauga.ca/updates/PN-2014%2001%2020-NoticeofDCRFiling%2060213979%20FINAL.pdf |title = NOTICE OF SUBMISSION DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REPORT }}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] there are three four-level stacks: at the junction of the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[M25 motorway|M25]] near [[Heathrow Airport]] in [[London]], at the junction of the [[M23 motorway|M23]] and M25 to the south of London, and at the junction of the M4 and [[M5 motorway|M5]] near [[Bristol]] (the [[Almondsbury Interchange]]). The M4/M25 junction is particularly unusual as it also has a railway line bisecting it at its lowest level. The M4/M25 junction is slightly offset so there is no point where all four levels are directly above each other. M25 (a north\u2013south road at this junction) is offset to the east by approximately {{convert|60|m|feet}}. The junction of the [[A19 road|A19]] and [[A66 road|A66]] in [[Teesside]] uses a three-level variant, with a 270-degree loop allowing southbound A19 traffic to exit to the westbound A66.\n\nIn [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] there is currently one four-level stack interchange: the Prins Clausplein near [[The Hague]]. It forms the junction of the A4 and A12.\n\nIn [[Greece]], there is also one four stack interchange near [[Metamorfosi]], which connects the [[Motorway 1 (Greece)|A1 Highway]] with [[Attiki Odos]].\n\n===Southern Hemisphere===\n[[File:Light Horse Interchange (aerial view).jpg|thumb|The [[Light Horse Interchange]] in Sydney is the largest in the southern hemisphere.]]\nThe [[Light Horse Interchange]] at the junction of the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4]] and [[Westlink M7|M7]] is a four-level stack interchange in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia.

The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] is the busiest highway in South Africa and a very busy truck route. Because [[Johannesburg]] is not located near a body of water, most of the city's exports travel through the [[Port of Durban]]. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2]] connects [[Cape Town]] with Durban and serves the South African cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Plettenberg Bay]], and [[Margate, KwaZulu-Natal|Margate]], and the [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park]]. Two busy roads intersect at the junction. A four-level stack interchange was chosen to serve the high volumes of traffic.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Five-level stack==\n\n===Texas-style stack===\n[[File:High Five.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[High Five Interchange]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, United States, is a five-level interchange.]]\nIn [[Texas]], many stacks contain five levels. They usually have the same configuration as four-level stacks, but [[frontage road]]s add a fifth level. The frontage roads usually intersect with [[traffic light]]s and are similar to a grid of nearby [[one-way street]]s. A common setup is for one mainline to go below grade and another to go above grade. The intersection of the frontage roads is typically at grade or close to it. Two pairs of left-turn connectors are built above these.\n\nThe [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]] has several five-level stacks, most notably the [[High Five Interchange]] between [[U.S. Route 75 in Texas|US&nbsp;75]] and [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]]; completed in 2005 and currently the tallest interchange in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://uk.chryso.com/upload/t_documents/Fichier_L1/48827/High%20Five%20Interchange.pdf|title =High Five Interchange, Dallas - Texas|publisher =Chryso|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085950/http://uk.chryso.com/upload/t_documents/Fichier_L1/48827/High%20Five%20Interchange.pdf|archivedate =April 26, 2012|df =mdy-all}}</ref> Others can be found at the interchanges between [[Texas State Highway 121|State Highway 121]] (SH&nbsp;121) and the [[Dallas North Tollway]], SH&nbsp;121 and [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]]/[[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|US&nbsp;77]], [[Interstate 30|I-30]] and [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]], I-30 and [[President George Bush Turnpike]] and others which are technically five levels but do not fit under a Texas-style stack configuration (i.e. the extra level being located away from the central stack or existing in only one direction).\n\nThe [[Greater Houston|Houston]] area has seven five-level stack interchanges along [[Sam Houston Tollway|Beltway 8]]: at [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] east and west of downtown, [[Interstate 69 in Texas|I-69]] northeast and southwest of downtown, [[Interstate 45|I-45]] north and south of downtown, and [[U.S. Route 290|US&nbsp;290]] in the beltway's northwest quadrant.<ref>[http://www.texasfreeway.com/Houston/photos/bw8/bw8.shtml TexasFreeway > Houston > Photo Gallery > Beltway 8 Photos<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The newly reconstructed interchange of [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|I-610]] and I-69, with the new I\u2011610 northbound feeder road built underground and the new I-610 southbound feeder road overpass, is also a five-level stack interchange.<ref>{{google maps |url = http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&q=&z=18&ll=29.728873,-95.460173&spn=0.002227,0.003626&t=k&om=1 |title = Interstate&nbsp;610 at U.S.&nbsp;59 in Houston, Texas |access-date = November 19, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThough not a Texas-style stack in the above sense, an unusual stack is nonetheless found in Houston that features more than four levels of traffic but whose fifth level exists in only one direction.

An example of this exists in [[Los Angeles, California]], at the [[Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange]]. The connector from HOV southbound 110 to HOV westbound 105 can be at the same level as the connector from mixed eastbound 105 to mixed northbound 110, but the connector from HOV southbound 110 to HOV eastbound 105 needs to be higher level, since it crosses over the former connector.\n\nAnother case is where connection to nearby arterials suggests that another level may be useful, thus making the interchange more complicated but easier to use. In the Atlanta area, a side ramp forms the fifth level of the [[Tom Moreland Interchange]], colloquially known as ''[[Spaghetti Junction]]'', found in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]].\n\n==Six-level stack==\n[[File:Shanghai, China (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Yan'an East Road Interchange, a six-level urban stack interchange in [[Puxi]], [[Shanghai]], [[China]] (Nanbei Elevated Road and Yan'an Elevated Road)]]\n{{Expand section|date=September 2013}}\nThere is a six-level stack on the Yan'an East Road Interchange (Chinese: \u5ef6\u5b89\u4e1c\u8def\u7acb\u4ea4) in Puxi, Shanghai, with no dedicated HOV/bus/truck lanes.

Vehicles first exit the main carriageway to the right, then complete the turn via a ramp that crosses both highways, eventually merging with the traffic turning right from the opposite side of the interchange. A stack interchange therefore has two pairs of left-turning ramps, which may be \"stacked\" in various configurations above or below the two interchanging highways. In countries where one drives [[Right- and left-hand traffic|on the left]], the appearance of the junction is topologically identical, but [[traffic flow]]s are reversed.\n\nStacks eliminate the problems of [[Grade separation#Weaving|weaving]] and have the highest vehicle capacity among different types of four-way interchanges. However, they require considerable and expensive construction work for their flyover ramps, as well as having a larger footprint. Stack interchanges are also widely considered to be an eyesore among residents of homes near existing or proposed interchanges, leading to considerable [[NIMBY]] opposition.\n\n==Four-level stack==\n[[File:Stackinterchange.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Four-level stack]]\nThe four-level stack (or simply ''four-stack'') has one major freeway crossing another freeway with a viaduct, with connector flyover ramps crossing on two further levels.

Several ramps still remain unused, including abandoned roadbed for I-291 both north and south of the complex.\n\nFour-level stacks are used for the interchanges between:\n* [[Interstate 77 in North Carolina|I-77]] and [[Interstate 485|I-485]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]];\n* [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] and [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]];\n* [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] and [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|I-405]] in [[Bellevue, Washington]];\n* [[Interstate 110 (Louisiana)|I\u2011110]] and [[U.S. Route 61 in Louisiana|US&nbsp;61]]/[[U.S. Route 190 in Louisiana|US&nbsp;190]] in Louisiana;\n* [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] and [[Interstate 696|I-696]] near [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]];\n* [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] and [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] in [[Flint, Michigan]];\n* [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I\u201170]]/[[Interstate 270 (Missouri\u2013Illinois)|I\u2011270]] and I\u2011270/[[Interstate 64 in Missouri|I\u201164]] [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]];\n* The [[Marquette Interchange]] between [[Interstate 794|I-794]], [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|I-94]], and [[Interstate 43|I-43]] in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]; and\n* The [[Zoo Interchange]] between [[Interstate 894|I-894]], I-94, [[Interstate 41|I-41]], and [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;41]]/[[U.S. Route 45 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;45]] [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].\n\nAnother well-known stack interchange lies west of [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], serving as the junction between [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]] and [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]]. It was originally built for a planned extension of I\u201170 into the city, but because of heavy opposition, I\u201170 ends at a [[park and ride]] {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} east. As a result, the road east of I\u2011695 sees very little traffic compared to the high volumes to and from the west.\n\nAnother four-level stack interchange in the Baltimore area is located at the northeastern junction between I-695 and [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]]. The stack was built as part of a massive I-95 reconstruction project that includes [[high-occupancy toll lane]]s (HOT lanes), designed to relieve congestion between Baltimore and its northeastern suburbs.\n\nIn [[Lone Tree, Colorado]], there is a four-level stack serving [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|I-25]], the eastern end of [[Colorado State Highway 470|C-470]] and the southern end of [[E-470]]. In [[Thornton, Colorado]], there is another stack serving I-25 and E-470 at its northern end as it continues west as the [[Northwest Parkway]].\n\n===Canada===\nThe junction between [[Anthony Henday Drive]] and [[Yellowhead Highway]] east of [[Edmonton, Alberta]] is almost a stack interchange with three semi-directional flyover/underpass ramps. Two new semi-directional flyovers and one loop ramp for the eastbound to northbound movement were added during the interchange reconstruction, while also accommodating an existing semi-directional underpass ramp for the westbound to southbound movement that runs parallel to the railway line that bisects the interchange. Due to the wide spacing between the underpass ramp and the flyover ramps, this is a three level interchange.\n\n====Ontario====\nThe initial design of [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway&nbsp;407]] had several four-level stack interchanges planned at junctions with existing 400-series highways, but ending up only one example was built&ndash;the interchange at [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway&nbsp;400]] in [[Vaughan, Ontario]], which is also the only true four-level stack in all of Canada. Highway&nbsp;407's other proposed four-level stacks at [[Ontario Highway 410|Highway&nbsp;410]] and [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway&nbsp;404]] were reduced to three-level [[Interchange_(road)#Cloverstack_interchange|cloverstack interchanges]] with loop ramps instead of a fourth level of ramps. Similarly the Highway&nbsp;407 interchange with [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway&nbsp;427]] has four levels but only two semi-directional ramps (that cross each other) connecting to Highway&nbsp;427 south of that junction, while two loop ramps were for movements to and from Highway&nbsp;427 north of that junction. \n\nThe interchange between [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway&nbsp;401]], [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway&nbsp;403]], and Highway&nbsp;410 is almost a stack interchange, albeit for the loop ramp in the northeast quadrant (which was opened in 2018 along with a directional ramp in the southwest quadrant for the opposite movement, making it a four-way interchange). However the only point of that interchange that has truly has four levels is where the Highway&nbsp;401 EB to Highway&nbsp;410 NB crosses the ramp from Highway&nbsp;410 SB to Highway&nbsp;401 EB, which is a considerable distance from the semi-directional ramps linking Highway&nbsp;401 WB to Highway&nbsp;403 WB.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.401expansion-mississauga.ca/updates/RPT-2014-01-29%20DCR%2060213979.pdf |title = Design and Construction Report - Highway 401 Widening }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.401expansion-mississauga.ca/updates/PN-2014%2001%2020-NoticeofDCRFiling%2060213979%20FINAL.pdf |title = NOTICE OF SUBMISSION DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REPORT }}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] there are three four-level stacks: at the junction of the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[M25 motorway|M25]] near [[Heathrow Airport]] in [[London]], at the junction of the [[M23 motorway|M23]] and M25 to the south of London, and at the junction of the M4 and [[M5 motorway|M5]] near [[Bristol]] (the [[Almondsbury Interchange]]). The M4/M25 junction is particularly unusual as it also has a railway line bisecting it at its lowest level. The M4/M25 junction is slightly offset so there is no point where all four levels are directly above each other. M25 (a north\u2013south road at this junction) is offset to the east by approximately {{convert|60|m|feet}}. The junction of the [[A19 road|A19]] and [[A66 road|A66]] in [[Teesside]] uses a three-level variant, with a 270-degree loop allowing southbound A19 traffic to exit to the westbound A66.\n\nIn [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] there is currently one four-level stack interchange: the Prins Clausplein near [[The Hague]]. It forms the junction of the A4 and A12.\n\nIn [[Greece]], there is also one four stack interchange near [[Metamorfosi]], which connects the [[Motorway 1 (Greece)|A1 Highway]] with [[Attiki Odos]].\n\n===Southern Hemisphere===\n[[File:Light Horse Interchange (aerial view).jpg|thumb|The [[Light Horse Interchange]] in Sydney is the largest in the southern hemisphere.]]\nThe [[Light Horse Interchange]] at the junction of the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4]] and [[Westlink M7|M7]] is a four-level stack interchange in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia. Opened in late 2005, it is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westlinkm7.com.au/cmsAdmin/uploads/Fact_Sheet_Light_Horse_Interchange.pdf|title=Fact Sheet - Light Horse Interchange|publisher=Westlink Motorway Limited|date=May 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe [[EB Cloete Interchange]] just outside [[Durban, South Africa]], is another four-level stack interchange. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] is the busiest highway in South Africa and a very busy truck route. Because [[Johannesburg]] is not located near a body of water, most of the city's exports travel through the [[Port of Durban]]. The [[N2 road (South Africa)|N2]] connects [[Cape Town]] with Durban and serves the South African cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Plettenberg Bay]], and [[Margate, KwaZulu-Natal|Margate]], and the [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park]]. Two busy roads intersect at the junction. A four-level stack interchange was chosen to serve the high volumes of traffic.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Five-level stack==\n\n===Texas-style stack===\n[[File:High Five.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[High Five Interchange]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, United States, is a five-level interchange.]]\nIn [[Texas]], many stacks contain five levels. They usually have the same configuration as four-level stacks, but [[frontage road]]s add a fifth level. The frontage roads usually intersect with [[traffic light]]s and are similar to a grid of nearby [[one-way street]]s. A common setup is for one mainline to go below grade and another to go above grade. The intersection of the frontage roads is typically at grade or close to it. Two pairs of left-turn connectors are built above these.\n\nThe [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]] has several five-level stacks, most notably the [[High Five Interchange]] between [[U.S. Route 75 in Texas|US&nbsp;75]] and [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]]; completed in 2005 and currently the tallest interchange in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://uk.chryso.com/upload/t_documents/Fichier_L1/48827/High%20Five%20Interchange.pdf|title =High Five Interchange, Dallas - Texas|publisher =Chryso|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085950/http://uk.chryso.com/upload/t_documents/Fichier_L1/48827/High%20Five%20Interchange.pdf|archivedate =April 26, 2012|df =mdy-all}}</ref> Others can be found at the interchanges between [[Texas State Highway 121|State Highway 121]] (SH&nbsp;121) and the [[Dallas North Tollway]], SH&nbsp;121 and [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]]/[[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|US&nbsp;77]], [[Interstate 30|I-30]] and [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|I-35W]], I-30 and [[President George Bush Turnpike]] and others which are technically five levels but do not fit under a Texas-style stack configuration (i.e. the extra level being located away from the central stack or existing in only one direction).\n\nThe [[Greater Houston|Houston]] area has seven five-level stack interchanges along [[Sam Houston Tollway|Beltway 8]]: at [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] east and west of downtown, [[Interstate 69 in Texas|I-69]] northeast and southwest of downtown, [[Interstate 45|I-45]] north and south of downtown, and [[U.S. Route 290|US&nbsp;290]] in the beltway's northwest quadrant.<ref>[http://www.texasfreeway.com/Houston/photos/bw8/bw8.shtml TexasFreeway > Houston > Photo Gallery > Beltway 8 Photos<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The newly reconstructed interchange of [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|I-610]] and I-69, with the new I\u2011610 northbound feeder road built underground and the new I-610 southbound feeder road overpass, is also a five-level stack interchange.<ref>{{google maps |url = http://www.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&q=&z=18&ll=29.728873,-95.460173&spn=0.002227,0.003626&t=k&om=1 |title = Interstate&nbsp;610 at U.S.&nbsp;59 in Houston, Texas |access-date = November 19, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThough not a Texas-style stack in the above sense, an unusual stack is nonetheless found in Houston that features more than four levels of traffic but whose fifth level exists in only one direction.

It is the latter ramp which gives the interchange the fifth level, as US 90 to I-10 westbound merges onto I-10 before crossing I-610. (None of the frontage roads for these highways cross the interchange itself, and thus do not factor into the complexity of the stack.)<ref>{{google maps |link = no |title=East Fwy at North Loop |url = https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=30.345,-95.083611&spn=0.1,0.1&t=m&q=30.345,-95.083611 |access-date = October 16, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nMore than 40 bridges make up the five-level stack interchange known as the [[Big&nbsp;I]] between [[Interstate 40 in New Mexico|I-40]] and [[Interstate 25|I-25]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].\n\nChina is also home to many Texas-style stack interchanges. For example the Nanjing's Yingtian Street Elevated has one each where it intersects the Inner Ring Road twice.\n\n===Other five-level stacks===\n[[File:La city hwys.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange]] in Los Angeles, California, United States.]]\nSometimes a fifth level is added for [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV]] connectors. An example of this exists in [[Los Angeles, California]], at the [[Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange]]. The connector from HOV southbound 110 to HOV westbound 105 can be at the same level as the connector from mixed eastbound 105 to mixed northbound 110, but the connector from HOV southbound 110 to HOV eastbound 105 needs to be higher level, since it crosses over the former connector.\n\nAnother case is where connection to nearby arterials suggests that another level may be useful, thus making the interchange more complicated but easier to use. In the Atlanta area, a side ramp forms the fifth level of the [[Tom Moreland Interchange]], colloquially known as ''[[Spaghetti Junction]]'', found in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]].\n\n==Six-level stack==\n[[File:Shanghai, China (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Yan'an East Road Interchange, a six-level urban stack interchange in [[Puxi]], [[Shanghai]], [[China]] (Nanbei Elevated Road and Yan'an Elevated Road)]]\n{{Expand section|date=September 2013}}\nThere is a six-level stack on the Yan'an East Road Interchange (Chinese: \u5ef6\u5b89\u4e1c\u8def\u7acb\u4ea4) in Puxi, Shanghai, with no dedicated HOV/bus/truck lanes. It is six-level stack because it is formed by two elevated highways, [[North\u2013South Elevated Road (Shanghai)|Nanbei Elevated Road]] and [[Yan'an Elevated Road]] with service roads and a [[footbridge]] underneath. The centrally located interchange has a central pillar known as the Nine-Dragon Pillar (Chinese: \u4e5d\u9f99\u67f1). The story is that after several construction accidents, a monk suggested the nine-dragon be welcomed with a bas relief sculpture depicting the dragon.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAn unusual six-level stack is located at the junction between [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] and [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], and does not contain any service or frontage roads. The interchange features two levels of highway with the top three levels consisting of direct connection ramps and HOV connectors. A single ramp leading from I-635 westbound to I-35E southbound weaves underneath the I-635 eastbound bridge, making the interchange six levels.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Phase 2 Entrance and Exit Points {{!}} LBJ TEXpress Lanes|url = http://www.lbjtexpress.com/using-lbj-texpress-lanes/lbj-texpress-lanes-overview/phase-2-entrance-and-exit-points|website = www.lbjtexpress.com|access-date = January 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe interchange between [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] and the [[Sam Rayburn Tollway]] in [[Lewisville, Texas]], although similar in design to five-level stacks elsewhere in Texas, also qualifies as a six-level stack, since the ramp connecting the eastbound Sam Rayburn Tollway with northbound I-35E goes over the fifth-level ramps connecting I-35E in both directions with the Sam Rayburn Tollway.

It premiered on [[BBC One]] on 18 December 2018. Produced by [[Heyday Television]], its three episodes were adapted by [[Sarah Williams (screenwriter)|Sarah Williams]] and directed by [[Mahalia Belo]]. The story is set in early-nineteenth-century [[Colony of Jamaica|colonial Jamaica]], focusing on the final years of [[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|slavery]] on the island, and the transition to freedom that took place after its abolition [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|in 1833]]. It follows the life of July ([[Tamara Lawrance]]), a slave on a [[sugarcane]] [[plantation]]. [[Hayley Atwell]] plays Caroline Mortimer, the owner of the plantation, who eventually marries an idealistic overseer, Robert Goodwin ([[Jack Lowden]]). The cast also included [[Jordan Bolger]], [[Sharon Duncan-Brewster]], [[Gordon Brown (actor)|Gordon Brown]], [[Ayesha Antoine]], [[Leo Bill]], Sir [[Lenny Henry]], and [[Madeleine Mantock]] in supporting roles.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/thelongsong \"The Long Song\"], ''BBC Media Centre''.
