Jews living in the United Kingdom at this time experienced religious discrimination and it is thought that the [[blood libel]] which accused Jews of ritual murder originated in Northern England, leading to [[York Massacre|massacres]] and increasing discrimination.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> The Jewish presence continued until [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]'s [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>\n\nJews were readmitted to the United Kingdom by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1655, though it is believed that [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] lived in England during the expulsion.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup> Jews were regularly subjected to discrimination and humiliation which waxed and waned over the centuries, gradually declining.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the number of Jews in Britain greatly increased due to the exodus of Jews from [[Russia]], which resulted in a large community of Jews forming in the [[East End of London]].<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-6|[6]]]</sup> Popular sentiment against immigration was used by the [[British Union of Fascists]] to incite hatred against Jews, leading to the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936, when the fascists were forced to abandon their march through an area with a large Jewish population when the police clearing the way were unable to remove barricades defended by trade unionists, left wing groups and residents.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-7|[7]]]</sup>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], undisguised racial hatred of [[Jews]] became unacceptable in [[British society]].

Jews living in the United Kingdom at this time experienced religious discrimination and it is thought that the [[blood libel]] which accused Jews of ritual murder originated in Northern England, leading to [[York Massacre|massacres]] and increasing discrimination.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> The Jewish presence continued until [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]'s [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>\n\nJews were readmitted to the United Kingdom by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1655, though it is believed that [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] lived in England during the expulsion.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup> Jews were regularly subjected to discrimination and humiliation which waxed and waned over the centuries, gradually declining.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the number of Jews in Britain greatly increased due to the exodus of Jews from [[Russia]], which resulted in a large community of Jews forming in the [[East End of London]].<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-6|[6]]]</sup> Popular sentiment against immigration was used by the [[British Union of Fascists]] to incite hatred against Jews, leading to the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936, when the fascists were forced to abandon their march through an area with a large Jewish population when the police clearing the way were unable to remove barricades defended by trade unionists, left wing groups and residents.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-7|[7]]]</sup>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], undisguised racial hatred of [[Jews]] became unacceptable in [[British society]]. Outbursts of antisemitism emanating from [[Far right in the United Kingdom|far right groups]] continued, however, leading to the formation of the [[43 Group]] led by Jewish ex-servicemen which broke up fascist meetings from 1945 to early 1950.\n\nThe Communal Security Trust (CST) was formed in 1994 to \"[protect] British Jews from antisemitism and related threats\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cst.org.uk/about-cst|title=About CST \u2013 CST \u2013 Protecting Our Jewish Community|website=cst.org.uk|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the police and other authorities to protect Jewish schools, Synagogues, and other community institutions.\n\nWhile records of antisemitic incidents have been compiled since 1984, changing reporting practices and levels of reporting make comparison over time difficult.\n\n==Communal institutions==\n<!--more specific inclusion criteria useful: include only Jewish orgs based in UK that have articles (no redlinks or EXT), sorted alphabetically, these can be found in [[Category:Jewish organisations based in the United Kingdom]] (and sub cats), and other cats-->\nBritish Jewish communal organisations include:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]]\n* [[Association of Jewish Refugees]]\n* [[Board of Deputies of British Jews|Board of Deputies]] (1760)\n* [[CCJO Ren\u00e9 Cassin]]\n* [[Community Security Trust]]\n* [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]]\n* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]\n* [[Jewish Book Week|Jewish Book Council]]\n* [[Jewish Care]]\n* [[Jewish Council for Racial Equality]]\n* [[Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain]]\n* [[Jewish Leadership Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejlc.org/members|title=Members|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[JW3]] \u2013 a London venue\n* [[Kisharon]]\n* [[League of British Jews]]\n* [[League of Jewish Women]]\n* [[Leo Baeck Institute London]]\n* [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]]\n* [[Limmud]]\n* [[London Jewish Forum]]\n* [[London Jewish Cultural Centre]]\n* [[Maccabaeans]]\n* [[Mitzvah Day International]]\n* [[Movement for Reform Judaism]]\n* [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]]\n* [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]]\n* [[Tzelem]]\n* [[UCL Institute of Jewish Studies]]\n* [[UK Jewish Film Festival]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Students]]\n* [[United Restitution Organization]]\n* [[United Synagogue]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Women]]\n* [[World Jewish Relief]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Judaism}}\n* [[List of British Jews]]\n* [[List of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the Jews in England]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Scotland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group= n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |title= Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190807/http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |archivedate= 22 August 2013 }}&nbsp;{{small|(430&nbsp;KB)}}.
