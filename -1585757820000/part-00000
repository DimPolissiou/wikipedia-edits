It was part of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] between the Dutch Republic and her allies\u2014the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]]\u2014and France.{{sfn|Ogg|1934|pp=357\u2013388}}\n\nIn comparison to [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], political reasons were more important as causes for this war than economic ones. In 1667, [[Charles II of England]] had been humiliated by the Dutch [[Raid on the Medway]], and in 1668, [[Louis XIV of France]] had been offended by the Dutch preventing his conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] through the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]. Charles' main political consideration was that the strength of his ministry and the security of his throne would be improved by a new war against the Dutch Republic. As Louis wished to gain control of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1670 the two kings concluded the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]], intending to destroy the Dutch Republic. This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had difficulty obtaining the necessary money. He relied on secret French subsidies, deceiving Parliament and refusing to pay the Crown debts and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict.\n \nThe Treaty of Dover granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, and made reference to the interest of the Prince of Orange. Its intended has been interpreted as allowing its two signatories to defeat and then abolish the Dutch republican regime, granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, with friendly regime under English influence headed by Prince William III controlling the remainder of Dutch territory, and with France gaining the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=180}}{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}} This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army of the Dutch was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had to rely on secret French subsidies and refusing to pay the Crown debts to finance it and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict. The large French subsidy promised under the treaty nay have been at least as much about freeing Charles from parliamentary control as to benefit England's economy.The English commercial and mercantile community was generally against the war before it started and opposed it more strongly when Charles failed to secure a quick victory, favouring action against French protectionist tariffs instead.{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}}\n\nThe French offensive in May and June 1672 was very successful. They quickly advanced to the north, causing the collapse of the weak eastern border defences of the Republic. An attempt to blockade the Dutch coast failed because Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] surprised and heavily damaged the Anglo-French fleet in the [[Battle of Solebay]]. When French troops penetrated into the heart of the Republic, the Dutch asked for peace terms. Riots brought down [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and [[William III of Orange]] was appointed [[stadtholder]]. William was Charles's nephew, so the king attempted to make the province of [[Holland]] an English protectorate [[rump state]] with William as its [[monarch]]. To his surprise, the Prince of Orange refused the English demands to occupy strategic ports. Negotiations were protracted, allowing the Dutch to flood [[Dutch Water Line|a water barrier]] blocking further French advance.\n\nIn 1673, the [[Royal Navy]] again joined a French squadron, trying to defeat the Dutch fleet and invade the Republic from the sea. This was prevented by three strategic victories by De Ruyter. Meanwhile, several German states had become worried by the French conquests and with Dutch subsidies began to operate large armies on the Rhine. Louis was forced to retreat from most of the territory of the Republic. He prepared a conquest of the Spanish Netherlands which would be harmful to English interests. William launched a propaganda campaign convincing the English people that the alliance with France was part of a plot to make their country Roman Catholic. Anti-Catholic sentiment and the prospect that the [[Parliament of England]] would refuse a war budget, forced Charles to abandon the costly and fruitless war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=67\u201394}} The [[Second Peace of Westminster]] largely confirmed the situation as it was before the war. The larger conflict between the Republic and France would be protracted until 1678.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Charles II (Lely).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles II of England]]; the war was driven by his desire for the French subsidies that offered financial freedom from Parliament]]\nThe 1652-1654 [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was the result of commercial rivalry and [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] support for the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], uncle of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Peace terms]] agreed in 1654 with the [[The Protectorate|English Protectorate]] included the permanent [[Act of Seclusion|exclusion]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] from public office, ensuring Republican political control. When Charles [[Restoration (England)|regained the English throne]] in 1660, his Orangist links meant [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] opposed negotiations for an Anglo-Dutch alliance; after these broke down, he agreed a treaty of assistance with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1662.<ref>{{cite web |title=The first stadtholderless period |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Netherlands/The-first-stadtholderless-period#ref414091 |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsing France as a barrier against England and the Orangists also had risks, since despite their alliance against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], French objectives in the [[Low Countries]] threatened Dutch commercial interests. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] permanently closed the [[Scheldt]] estuary, benefiting De Witt's power base of [[Amsterdam]] by eliminating their closest rival, [[Antwerp]]; ensuring it remained shut was a vital objective. Changes in this region also concerned England, since control of ports on the [[Flanders|North Flemish coast]] allowed a hostile power to blockade the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nIn 1665, an attack by [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] on the [[West-Indische Compagnie]] led to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]; in the first 18 months, the Dutch suffered a serious naval defeat at [[Battle of Lowestoft|Lowestoft]], an invasion by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and an attempted Orangist coup, both financed by England. The prospect of an English victory led Louis to activate the 1662 treaty, although the Dutch considered the support provided inadequate. When the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] blocked his requests for territorial compensation, Louis launched the [[War of Devolution]] in May 1667 and rapidly occupied much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} \n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|right|The [[Low Countries]] ca 1700; French expansion threatened both England and the Dutch Republic ]]\nCharles refused to recall [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to obtain funding, obliging him to pay off his fleet in early 1667, leading to the humiliating [[Raid on the Medway]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=70}} The Dutch were more worried by French gains; they [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|quickly negotiated an end to the war]] in July 1667, then started talks in London on a shared approach for reversing them.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}} Sensing an opportunity, Charles proposed an Anglo-French agreement to Louis, who, however, was unwilling to pay the subsidies he demanded and preferred to rely on De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}}\n\nCharles sent envoys to [[The Hague]] to continue discussions, publicly supported by De Witt, both seeing it as a way to put pressure on Louis.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}} French tariffs on imports imposed in early 1667 increased opposition in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], who in any case preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. On 23 January 1668, the Republic, England and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] signed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], committing to mutual support in the event of an attack on one by France or Spain. A secret clause agreed to provide Spain military assistance if France continued the war.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n[[File:Van Soest, Attack on the Medway.jpg|thumb|left|The 1667 [[Raid on the Medway]] severely damaged Charles' prestige]]\nLouis returned most of his acquisitions in the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], although he retained towns like [[Charleroi]] and [[Tournai]]. As Dutch and French aims in the Spanish Netherlands could not be reconciled, it made sense to eliminate the Dutch Republic first.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lesaffer |first1=Randall |title=The Wars of Louis XIV in Treaties (Part III): The Secret Alliance of Dover (1 June 1670) |url=https://opil.ouplaw.com/page/secret-alliance-dover/the-wars-of-louis-xiv-in-treaties-part-iii-the-secret-alliance-of-dover-1-june-1670 |website=OPIL |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref> Detaching Sweden from the Triple Alliance was straightforward, since the subsidies promised by the Dutch remained unpaid; the next target was England. In June 1670 the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] was negotiated between Louis and Charles  using his sister [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta of Orl\u00e9ans]]; very few English statesmen were aware of its provisions. While it is generally accepted that Charles wanted financial independence from Parliament, his motives remain obscure even today.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=301}}\n\nThe terms agreed to an Anglo-French military alliance against the Republic, creation of a state for his nephew William and a British [[brigade]] for the French army.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}} In December 1670, a public treaty of Dover was signed which omitted the more controversial articles of the real version. Apart from the war pact, secret clauses not revealed until 1771 included payment to Charles of \u00a3230,000 per year for the brigade, \u00a31&nbsp;million for the navy and \u00a3200,000 for his public conversion to Catholicism, payable in advance.{{sfn|Kenyon|1993|pp=67-68}} Significantly, the timing of the announcement was up to Charles, with a declaration of war 'no more than six months later'; this gave him an informal, open-ended agreement with France, while preserving the Triple Alliance. Aware of French negotiations with the Dutch over dividing the Spanish Netherlands, Charles demanded [[Walcheren]], [[Cadzand]] and [[Sluys]], whose possession would give him control of Dutch sea routes.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=302}}\n\nDespite the recent war, tensions between England and the Republic significantly diminished after 1667 and there was minimal support for a French alliance against them. The exchange of [[New Amsterdam|New York]] for the spice island of [[Run (island)|Run]] settled two major areas of dispute, both were concerned by French aims in the Low Countries, and English merchants were also affected by French tariffs.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=70}} Most Dutch and English politicians considered the Triple Alliance an essential protection against French expansion; in early 1671, Parliament specifically allocated money to ensure the Royal Navy could fulfil its obligations under the treaty.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=71}}\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:1672 Dutch War.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agreements with M\u00fcnster and Cologne allowed the French to bypass the Spanish Netherlands]]\nLouis instructed his [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador]] in the Hague to continue negotiations with De Witt as a delaying tactic, while he finalised invasion plans. Since Dutch defences were concentrated along the border with the Spanish Netherlands, Louis agreed an alliance with [[Electorate of Cologne|Electoral Cologne]], allowing his army to use the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Principality of Li\u00e8ge]] (see Map). It also complied with an undertaking to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] not to use the Spanish Netherlands as an invasion route.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=309}} In April 1672, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising military support if 'threatened' by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]; this offset an agreement of 6 May between the Republic and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], whose territories included the [[Duchy of Cleves]] on their eastern border.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=209}}\n\nHoping to gain English support, on 25 February 1672 the States General appointed 22-year old William [[Captain-General]] of the [[Dutch States Army|federal army]], an authorised total of 83,000 men.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=75}} Uncertainty over French strategy meant most of these were based in the wrong place, while actual numbers were very different; on 12 June, one commander reported his official garrison of eighteen companies only had enough men for four.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=440-441}}\n\nThe Republic was better prepared for a naval war, although to avoid provoking the English, on 4 February the States General reduced the naval budget from 7.9&nbsp;million to 4.8&nbsp;million guilders.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=26}} After the 1667 Medway raid, their navy was the largest in Europe; by 1672, the combined Anglo-French fleet outnumbered them by over a third. However, the French were inexperienced, their ships badly designed and co-operation with the English plagued by suspicion.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=38-39}} While Dutch numbers were further reduced by [[Admiralty of Friesland|Friesland]] retaining ships for defence against M\u00fcnster, better training gave them operational equality.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=231}} \n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]], whose training compensated for numerical inferiority]]\nIn the battles of 1666, the Dutch were hampered by lack of familiarity with their new, much heavier, warships, the complex federal command system and conflict between [[Michiel de Ruyter]] and [[Cornelis Tromp]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=181}} By 1672, these had been corrected, and De Ruyter's intensive training of his fleet in [[line-of-battle]] manoeuvres installed a new sense of coherence and discipline.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=278-279}}\n \nDutch ships were generally better gun platforms, whose shallow draft suited operations close to shore but were slow and less effective in open seas.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002 |pp=40-41}} Their maritime power was past its peak by the time of the [[Peace of Nijmegen]] in 1678: it had substantially declined in the preceding four years under the continuing stress of the [[Franco-Dutch War|Franco-Dutch]] and [[Scanian War]]s which had prevented it strengthening its fleet, and because of qualitative improvements among its rivals.{{sfn|Hemingway|2002|pp=43-44, 68}}\n\nEngland provided two-thirds of an Anglo-French fleet of 98 'great ships and frigates', whose role was to gain control of Dutch waters, land an expeditionary force and attack its shipping. Parliament generally approved naval expenditure, seen as protecting English trade, but refused to fund land forces. The British brigade was largely composed of [[Royal Scots|Dumbarton's]], a mercenary unit in French service since 1631, and very few members saw service before the war ended.{{sfn|Childs|2014|p=16}}\n\nOpposition forced Charles to seek other sources of finance; in January 1672, he suspended [[Stop of the Exchequer|repayment of Crown debts]], which produced \u00a31.3&nbsp;million but had disastrous economic effects. Many [[City of London|London merchants]] were ruined and it shut off the short-term financing essential to international trade.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=80}} Shortly before the declaration of war, in late March he ordered an attack on a Dutch Levant Company convoy in the Channel, which was beaten off by its escort.{{sfn|Clodfelter|1992|p=46}}\n\nCharles and his ministers appreciated that an unprovoked war against the Protestant Netherlands an alliance with Catholic France would probably be unpopular, and that the [[Stop of the Exchequer]] of 2 January 1672 would make financiers in the City of London cautious about providing funds to the government to prosecute such a war. It was partly to increase the government's popularity among [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] merchants he issued [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] in 15 March.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=74}} In the event, the Declaration of Indulgence, which removed restrictions on Catholics as well as Nonconformists, did little to decrease hostility to the French alliance. This increased when Charles appointed his Catholic, pro-French brother [[James II of England|James]] was  naval commander, in place of his Protestant, anti-French uncle, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]].{{sfn|Kitson |1994|p=248}} Not only were merchants and Nonconformists unenthusiastic about the prospect of war, but the Royal Navy found it difficult to  recruit sufficient sailors to fully man the fleet.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=75}}\n\nHis chief minister, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], was instructed to \"break with (the Dutch), yet to lay the breach at their door\".{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}} This was done using manufactured incidents, including the [[HMS Merlin (1666)|Merlin affair]], which took place near [[Brielle|Brill]] in August 1671. The royal yacht {{HMS|Merlin|1666|2}} was ordered to sail through the Dutch fleet, who duly struck their flag in salute, but failed to fire white smoke, an honour afforded only to warships.{{sfn|Rowen|1978|pp=755-756}} A formal complaint to the States General was dismissed and few in England were even aware of the incident; its use as a pretext, combined with the attack on the Dutch convoy, led some English politicians to declare the conflict 'unjust'.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=74-75}} France declared war on 6 April, followed by England on 7 April.{{efn|Many sources incorrectly state the English were the first to declare war on 27 March, a mistake caused by the fact that they were still using the [[Julian calendar]], then ten days behind the [[Gregorian calendar]] in use at the Continent.

On 7 May, a French army of around 80,000 entered Li\u00e8ge; accompanied by Louis, they bypassed the Dutch stronghold of [[Maastricht]], crossed the [[Meuse]] and besieged the Dutch-held Rhine fortress towns of [[Rheinberg]], [[Orsoy]], Buderich and [[Wesel]].

Cheered by crowds who believed they brought promises of English support against the French, they arrived at William's headquarters in [[Nieuwerbrug]] on 5 July.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=89}} The mood changed when their terms were made public; France and M\u00fcnster would retain their conquests, with William appointed Prince of Holland. For this, he would pay England ten million guilders, \u00a310,000 per annum for North Sea herring rights, and allow military occupation of Brill, [[Sluys]] and [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], as had been the case until 1616 after the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=81}}\n[[File:Gaspar Fagel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]], appointed Grand Pensionary in August 1672]]\nThe terms offered the Dutch nothing they did not already hold and resistance hardened as a result. William was well-informed on English opposition and had assurances of Imperial support from Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's envoy in the Hague. Lisola arranged for Spanish troops to hold [['s-Hertogenbosch]] and [[Breda]], releasing their Dutch garrisons for the field army.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|pp=57-58}}\n\nWilliam rejected this offer, although he held out the possibility of a deal if Arlington and Buckingham could ease French demands. They met with Louis at [[Heeswijk Castle]], but as the Dutch expected, made no progress; the Heeswijk Accord on 16 July agreed a minimal list of shared demands and undertook not to conclude a separate peace. Neither side placed any reliance on this; by this stage, only French subsidies kept Charles in the war.{{sfn|Grose|1929|pp=181-182}}\n\nA second letter from Charles on 18 July urged William to accept his terms, claiming the De Witts were the only obstacle to peace. He responded by offering the herring rights, \u00a3400,000, Sluys and [[Surinam]], in return for recognition as Prince of Holland and England agreeing a separate peace; the latter was clearly unacceptable.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=91}} Based on the Heeswijk Accord, Louis now required England also be ceded the islands of [[Voorne]], which contained the Dutch main naval port of [[Hellevoetsluis]], and [[Goeree]]. These were rejected on 20 July and ended negotiations; Arlington and Buckingham returned to London.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2005|p=435}}\n\nJohan de Witt had resigned as Grand Pensionary in June, while Cornelis was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder William. On 15 August, Charles' letter blaming the De Witts was published in Holland; motives are still debated but the effect was to inflame tensions and the two brothers were lynched by an Orangist civil militia on 20th.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=94-95}} Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]] became Grand Pensionary; on 27 August, the States of Holland passed legislation removing their political opponents from local office and securing William's political position.{{sfn|Edwards|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Dutch recovery: July to December ===\n[[File:Assault on Coevorden in 1672 - De bestorming van Coevorden, 30 december 1672 (Pieter Wouwerman).jpg|thumb|right|The recapture of [[Coevorden]] on 30 December 1672 was a significant boost to Dutch morale]]\nOn 7 July, the inundations were fully set; their effectiveness would be reduced when the waters froze in winter but for now, Holland was secure from French advance.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=196}} This allowed time for the States army to enact military reforms approved on 16 July, while their numbers were boosted by the return of 20,000 prisoners ransomed from the French.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=442-444}}\n\nA later French analyst suggested the offensive was arguably too successful; it united the opposition and distracted Louis from his primary objective of the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Le Blond|1758|p=452}} The French field army was drastically reduced by the need to garrison captured towns, while it also strained their supply lines; with the active phase of the war ended, Louis returned to Versailles on 26 July.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to unofficial Spanish support, on 25 July Leopold agreed to supply 16,000 men to help the Dutch, joined by the 20,000 originally promised by Frederick William in May. Although the Imperial troops were ordered to avoid combat, Louis was forced to divert 20,000 troops under Turenne to the Rhineland, and 18,000 to Alsace; this left some 50,000 men around the Republic, most distributed in garrisons.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nThe situation was far worse for Charles, who had no clear [[exit strategy]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=283}} Hopes of a quick victory vanished after Solebay, which ensured a vital supply of Baltic grain. The disasters that removed the De Witts also secured William's position and ended his dependence on Charles. The M\u00fcnster army disintegrated due to lack of supplies and on 27 August, von Galen abandoned the siege of Groningen. The defenders suffered less than 100 casualties, the besiegers over 11,000, which included nearly 6,000 deserters; many of these enrolled with the Dutch.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nWilliam led a number of offensives, including attacks on [[Woerden]] and Charleroi; while over-ambitious and unsuccessful, these restored Dutch morale. Coevorden was recaptured on 31 December and although their position remained precarious, by the end of 1672 the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May. Louis found himself involved in a wider European war of attrition. Despite his French subsidies, Charles had run out of money and faced considerable domestic opposition to continuing the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nOn the 13th of December, the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] dispatched an expedition force to [[Saint Helena]] under the leadership of Jacob de Geus and took possession of the English outpost on the island on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>History of South Africa 1486 -1691, G.M Theal, London 1888, P226</ref>\n\n== 1673 ==\n===Overview===\nAs the French again failed to cross the Holland Water Line, it was hoped that the Anglo-French fleet might defeat the Dutch navy, by a blockade of the Dutch coast forcing the Republic to capitulate to avoid starvation, or landing an invasion force. Because the allies did not cooperate very well, De Ruyter could competently exploit the shoals off the coast of Zealand to prevent his fleet being overwhelmed by their superior numbers. In August, the Dutch fleet was more to the north forced to defend [[Marsdiep|the Texel]] and clashed with the allies in open battle. De Ruyter managed to obtain a tactical draw which implied a strategic Dutch victory because the damaged English fleet could no longer continue operations. The failure of the naval campaign in the summer of 1673 completed the English disillusionment with the war, and with the alliance with the French who they blamed for this failure.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=89}}\n\nThe war, never popular with Parliament to begin with, now quickly lost any remaining support there. A final victory over the Dutch seemed unlikely. In late 1673, the French were forced to gradually abandon most of the Dutch territory. At the same time they prepared to conquer the Spanish Netherlands at last, which was a frightening prospect for most British politicians. However, the main opposition against the war was caused by Dutch propaganda. William convinced the English people that Charles had plotted with Louis to make their country Roman Catholic again. This caused such an uproar that Charles thought it best to preserve his hold on the throne by quickly agreeing to the [[Second Peace of Westminster]], which was greeted with popular enthusiasm on both sides of the North Sea, least by the commercial interests of Amsterdam and London, and it was ratified by both parties with exceptional speed.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=91}}\n\n===Naval battles===\n[[File:Van de Velde, Battle of Schooneveld.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Battle of Schooneveld'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|Van de Velde the Elder]]]]\nIn comparison with the first two wars, where both sides, and particularly the Dutch, often relied on aggressive tactics that resulted in the loss of a significant numbers of ships to the defeated fleet,{{sfn|Palmer|1997|pp=130,138}} in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, both sides adopted line-ahead formations in mist battles, an essentially defensive formation that resulted in far fewer ship losses and, in the Battle of Texel, to no ships lost on either side.{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn the winter of 1673, the French failed to cross the Water Line over the ice,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=100}} thwarted both by thaws and special Dutch sailor companies moving on [[ice skate]]s,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} organised by temporary Lieutenant-Admiral [[Johan de Liefde]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} In the spring, attempts to drain the northern part of the line or to cross on rafts, proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=337-343}} The attack from the east thus being considered impractical, the activities of the Royal Navy gained much more importance. It was ordered, in co-operation with a French squadron, to at least blockade the Dutch coast and, if possible, execute a landing on it, conquering the Republic from the west. How this should be accomplished exactly, was not very clear.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=81}} The English navy, in contrast to the Dutch fleet, had little experience in shore landings. It was expected therefore, to directly take some Dutch port by assault, despite having insufficient recent information about the dangerous, constantly shifting shoals.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=169}}\n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|left|thumb|Michiel de Ruyter prevented a sea invasion of the Republic]]\nBefore this could be achieved, the Allies would have to defeat the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=346}} Although the English deliberately created the impression&nbsp;\u2013 to frighten the Dutch population into an invasion scare{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}}\u2013 that transports, carrying an army, were sailing immediately behind the war fleet, in fact the\u2014rather small\u2014invasion force formed by the [[Blackheath Army]] was left in [[Great Yarmouth]], to be shipped only after a full control over the seas had been attained.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=260}} In this the French would be of little help; they had received clear orders by Louis to give absolute priority to the survival of their vessels{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=172}} and inform him personally about what knowledge they had gained by observing the English and Dutch tactics. This meant that the French navy considered the campaign first of all to be a great learning opportunity; the French admirals afterwards declared that De Ruyter had given them some \"beautiful lessons\".{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}}\n\nIn May, Rupert advanced to the Dutch coast with a superior force of 81 ships; De Ruyter, with 55 ships took up a defensive position in the [[Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=83}} Rupert sent a light squadron toward the smaller Dutch fleet hoping either to tempt it into an unequal battle,{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} or to force it to seek refuge in the naval port fortress of [[Hellevoetsluis]], where it could be blocked while the transport fleet would be brought over to storm either Brill in Holland or Flushing on Walcheren in Zealand.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}} De Ruyter attacked the light squadron very quickly, before the main allied fleet was in good order starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|First Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} In the battle of Solebay of the previous year, the French squadron had, on sight of the approaching Dutch fleet, sailed in a direction opposite to that of the English fleet. To counter English accusations that this had been done on purpose to let the English bear the brunt of the fighting, the French now formed the centre squadron. When a gap formed in the French line after a number of French ships had moved forward out of position, De Ruyter suddenly tacked with his own centre and sailed through it.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} After a while the French disengaged&nbsp;\u2013 later writing enthusiastic reports to Louis about feeling honoured to witness the tactical genius shown by De Ruyter by this manoeuvre{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}}\u2013 exposing the Allied rear to encirclement by the Dutch rear and centre. On perceiving the danger, its commander, Spragge, abandoned the remainder of the rear with his flotilla to seek out Tromp, who was rather hesitantly attacked by Rupert in the van, fearing the shoals. Thus being outmanoeuvred and divided, the Allied fleet managed to reunite only because De Ruyter decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp, who had to shift his flag, with the remainder of the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} but In view if the continuing disorder to his fleet, Rupert was content to withdraw at nightfall,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=263}} as De Ruyter had manoeuvred his weaker fleet with great skill.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}\n[[File:BattleOfTexel.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The ''Gouden Leeuw'' duelling the ''Royal Prince'' near the Texel]]\nThe allied fleet remained of the coast, as Rupert was unwilling to enter the dangerous Schooneveld again, he could only hope either to lure the Dutch out or that the Dutch fleet would attack him.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} On 14 June, taking advantage of a favourable wind, De Ruyter and the resupplied and reinforced Dutch fleet surprised the allies by leaving his ideal blocking position, and attacked their unprepared fleet, starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|Second Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} and Sir [[Edward Spragge]], commanding the rear squadron was visiting Rupert at the time of the Dutch attack, Rupert was forced to invert his squadron order without properly informing the French, causing such a chaos in the Allied fleet, which the Dutch exploited by severely damaging many of their ships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264-265}} Spragge added to this disorder by again seeking out Tromp, without success.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}} Much damaged and with its morale shaken, the Allied fleet returned to the [[Thames]] for repairs.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}}\n\nIn late July, Rupert sailed out again, trying to lure the Dutch fleet to the north, pretending to attempt a landing at The Hague or [[Den Helder]]. De Ruyter at first decided not to leave his Schooneveld position,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}} but, under pressure from Amsterdam merchants to prevent the capture of a valuable returning [[Dutch East India Company]] fleet,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=263}} he was ordered by William to defend the incoming fleet{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}} as its loss would given Charles the funds to continue the war.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|pp=268-269}} This resulted in the final [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]]. The conduct of the French fleet and its commander, D'Estr\u00e9es is a matter of dispute. While Prud'homme states that they French fought hard,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}} Jenkins argues that, either through  poor seamanship, or because D'Estr\u00e9es had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet, should England make peace with the Dutch, it failed to engage the Dutch closely for much of the day with D'Estr\u00e9es disobeying Rupert's orders to attack the Dutch, claiming the wind was too weak.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} Davies accepts that, by the admission of several French officers, their fleet was not prominent in the action, attributing in part to inexperience,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} and Prud'homme accepts that the French allowed themselves to get separated from the English fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}}\n\nWhat is clear is that the sheer size of the allied fleet and the length of its battle line together with inadequacies in the fighting instructions and signaling that were remedied after the battle made the task of controlling it difficult.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} Spragge action in breaking formation for the second time to duel with Tromp, and losing his life as a result, as well as D'Estr\u00e9es ignoring or misunderstanding Rupert's signals allowed an inferior but better managed fleet to succeed.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=53}}{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=84}} Having incurred enormous damage, both fleets retreated.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}}\n\nThis tactical draw was a complete strategic victory for the Dutch,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} even though four ships of the Spice Fleet had fallen into Allied hands.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=274}} For De Ruyter, the successful campaign, by repelling attacks by much superior fleets to save his homeland, had been the highlight of his career, as the English readily acknowledged: [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] concluded that among admirals, \"he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world\".{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had to abandon their plans for an invasion from the sea,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} and the large costs of repair troubled Parliament.\n\n===Growing anti-war sentiment in England===\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]] was one of the English politicians to become pro-Dutch and anti-Stuart]]\nOverall the war had been far from profitable to the English. In previous conflicts many in England had gained riches by joining privateering enterprises; in this war Dutch raiders captured more English ships (over 550 merchantmen; 2,800 vessels of all Allies{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=282}}) than vice versa. The province of Zealand alone operated 120 privateers.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=167}} Being well aware that the war was waged by English and French nobles who disdained the Dutch as, in the words of Louis, a nation of \"cheesemongers\", at least three privateers sailed under the name of the ''Getergde Kaasboer'' (provoked cheesemonger).{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had failed to blockade the Dutch coast and were themselves largely blocked from the vital Baltic trade in wood and tar. The fact that the Dutch under [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] had retaken New York City\u2014formerly [[New Amsterdam]]\u2014in 1673 mattered little financially, nor did the temporary loss of [[Saint Helena]], but it hurt the English reputation. In the East, on 1 September 1673, a Dutch East India Company fleet of thirteen vessels commanded by [[Cornelis van Quaelberg]]en defeated an [[East India Company]] squadron of ten ships under [[William Basse]] off [[Masulipatam]], capturing two and sinking one British vessel. The material damage compounded a moral unease about the justifiability of the war; [[John Evelyn]] already after Solebay wrote: \"the loss of my Lord Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, as well the folly of hazarding so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation in the world but because the Hollander exceeded us in industry, and all things else but envy.\"{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=86}} In November 1673, parliament voted to deny Charles a war budget for 1674. Conversely, the Dutch had been able to restore international credit. For 1673, their war budget could be increased to a hundred million guilders, three times the normal annual tax revenues of the Republic.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=83}} This allowed them to operate large fleets, rebuild their army and find and subsidise allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the developments in the land war had also become very unfavourable to Charles. The ultimate goal of the French, and their deeper rationale for this war, was to conquer the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Olaf van Nimwegen, 2006, ''\"Deser landen crijchsvolck\". Het Staatse leger en de militaire revoluties 1588-1688'' Amsterdam, p 360</ref> Such a conquest would be very detrimental to the English strategic position: should the province of Holland capitulate to them also, the French would control the entire continental coast opposite England, as they would later achieve in the 19th-century [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=34}} For this reason Charles had in the Treaty of Dover explicitly reserved his rights to come to the aid of the Spanish Netherlands should his interests demand so; Louis had to delay the execution of his plans in this region until the Dutch affair was finished. Now that a deadlock had been reached, Louis' patience was severely tried. Emperor Leopold had promised in 1668 that after the death of the sickly [[Charles II of Spain]], the area would be ceded to France, but against expectations he survived until 1700.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=32}} Eventually the temptation to take possession of the Southern Netherlands while they were so vulnerable became too great. Louis gradually turned his attention to this area, first by the [[Siege of Maastricht (1673)|capture of Maastricht]] in July 1673, in which elements of Monmouth's brigade played an honourable r\u00f4le. Though this could be justified as improving the supply situation of the northern French army, its potential as a starting point for a Flemish campaign was not lost on the Spanish who had provided troops to help defend the city.\n\nOn 30 August, the Republic, the Empire, and Spain agreed the Alliance of The Hague.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=372}} In October, they were joined by [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine]] (who wanted his duchy back from Louis) forming the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=383}}{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=95}} William made sure peace negotiations held with France and England in Cologne failed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=123}} In November, [[Bonn]] was taken by the alliance forces commanded by William; this forced the French army to abandon almost all occupied Dutch territory,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=126}} with the exception of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and Maastricht.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=97}} A final French victory over the Dutch at this point appeared most implausible; the war was changed into one about the dominion of Flanders and on this issue, the natural interests of England were opposed to those of France. The changed international situation was an important consideration for Parliament's decision to withhold funding, but internal events were even more decisive.\n\nThe Treaty of Dover was not only aimed at the Dutch Republic but also at the domination of Protestantism in England; Charles had promised Louis to try to end it. In accordance, on 25 March 1672, he had issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], as a first step to complete [[religious tolerance]]. Parliament was shocked by this,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=123}} but at first was unaware of the connection with the French alliance; in February 1673 it voted to start funding the alliance, to an amount of \u00a31,260,000,{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=87}} in exchange for a suspension of the Indulgence (and an issuing of the [[Test Act]] in March), not as yet seeing any contradiction in such policies.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=130}} This would soon change, however. Arlington's former secretary, [[Peter du Moulin|Pierre du Moulin]], had after fleeing to the Republic begun to work for William;{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} in the summer of 1673 he exploited the fears of the English population by starting a propaganda campaign,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} using one of the Dutch main assets: the world's largest per capita printing capacity.\n\nSoon, England was flooded with tens of thousands of pamphlets accusing Charles of wanting to make the country Catholic again in conspiracy with the French king.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} The campaign was a complete success, convincing the English people that such a plan really existed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=127}} It was greatly aided by the decision in June 1673 by Charles's brother [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]], to lay down his position as Lord High Admiral, which was generally (and correctly) interpreted as a sign that James had in secret become a Catholic and was therefore unable to abjure the [[transubstantiation]] doctrine, as the Test Act demanded of all officials.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} In September James married the Catholic [[Mary of Modena]], a beautiful young girl especially selected for him by King Louis. As Charles had no legitimate offspring, this marriage presented the strong prospect of a Catholic dynasty ruling England in the future.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=131}}\n\nReacting to the change in the public mood, Buckingham, who had learned of it during his trip to the Republic the previous year, began to leak the Dover Treaty to many fellow politicians, and Arlington soon followed. Thus in a short time Charles' own cabinet, the [[Cabal Ministry]], went over to the \"Dutch\" peace party; [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], much shocked by the revelation, began to consider driving out the troublesome [[House of Stuart]] entirely. He induced his secretary, [[John Locke]], to develop further the legal concepts which would later be the basis of the [[Two Treatises of Government]], which justified the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\n\n== Second Peace of Westminster ==\nIn this situation Charles felt that continuing the alliance was a grave threat to his personal position and that Parliament would no longer fund a war.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He informed the French ambassador [[Colbert de Croissy]] that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} that, his main war aim to install his noble nephew as stadtholder having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations, if only some minor \"indemnities\" could be paid. At first the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles's demands: as England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was, in their opinion, not entitled to any reward. But William convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war ''against'' France eventually. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace, because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=291}}\n\nAfter a short exchange of proposals by means of trumpeters, the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] was publicly proclaimed in London on 17 February Old Style.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} It was approved by the States of Holland and West Frisia on 4 March,{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} (New Style), and ratified by the States General on 5 March.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}}\n\nThe treaty stipulated that New York\u2014formerly [[New Netherland]]\u2014would henceforth be an English possession and that [[Suriname]], captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, confirming the status quo of 1667.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=275}} An \"indemnity\" of two million guilders was to be paid by the Dutch.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=292}} Eventually, William would force Charles to [[Set-off (law)|set off]] these indemnities against the debts he owed to the [[House of Orange]], so the English king actually received very little. Despite the peace, Monmouth's brigade would not be withdrawn from the French army and it would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War.{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=33}} In April that year, William attempted to convince his uncle to enter the war against Louis but failed.

It was part of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] between the Dutch Republic and her allies\u2014the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]]\u2014and France.{{sfn|Ogg|1934|pp=357\u2013388}}\n\nIn comparison to [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], political reasons were more important as causes for this war than economic ones. In 1667, [[Charles II of England]] had been humiliated by the Dutch [[Raid on the Medway]], and in 1668, [[Louis XIV of France]] had been offended by the Dutch preventing his conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] through the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]]. Charles' main political consideration was that the strength of his ministry and the security of his throne would be improved by a new war against the Dutch Republic. As Louis wished to gain control of the Spanish Netherlands, in 1670 the two kings concluded the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]], intending to destroy the Dutch Republic. This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had difficulty obtaining the necessary money. He relied on secret French subsidies, deceiving Parliament and refusing to pay the Crown debts and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict.\n \nThe Treaty of Dover granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, and made reference to the interest of the Prince of Orange. Its intended has been interpreted as allowing its two signatories to defeat and then abolish the Dutch republican regime, granted England control over the Scheldt Estuary, with friendly regime under English influence headed by Prince William III controlling the remainder of Dutch territory, and with France gaining the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=180}}{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}} This outcome seemed achievable as the Dutch land army of the Dutch was weak and, although their navy was strong, the combined English and French fleets outnumbered it. The prospect of war was unpopular in England, so Charles had to rely on secret French subsidies and refusing to pay the Crown debts to finance it and fabricated diplomatic incidents to justify a conflict. The large French subsidy promised under the treaty nay have been at least as much about freeing Charles from parliamentary control as to benefit England's economy.The English commercial and mercantile community was generally against the war before it started and opposed it more strongly when Charles failed to secure a quick victory, favouring action against French protectionist tariffs instead.{{sfn|Romelse|2010|pp=606-607}}\n\nThe French offensive in May and June 1672 was very successful. They quickly advanced to the north, causing the collapse of the weak eastern border defences of the Republic. An attempt to blockade the Dutch coast failed because Lieutenant-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] surprised and heavily damaged the Anglo-French fleet in the [[Battle of Solebay]]. When French troops penetrated into the heart of the Republic, the Dutch asked for peace terms. Riots brought down [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and [[William III of Orange]] was appointed [[stadtholder]]. William was Charles's nephew, so the king attempted to make the province of [[Holland]] an English protectorate [[rump state]] with William as its [[monarch]]. To his surprise, the Prince of Orange refused the English demands to occupy strategic ports. Negotiations were protracted, allowing the Dutch to flood [[Dutch Water Line|a water barrier]] blocking further French advance.\n\nIn 1673, the [[Royal Navy]] again joined a French squadron, trying to defeat the Dutch fleet and invade the Republic from the sea. This was prevented by three strategic victories by De Ruyter. Meanwhile, several German states had become worried by the French conquests and with Dutch subsidies began to operate large armies on the Rhine. Louis was forced to retreat from most of the territory of the Republic. He prepared a conquest of the Spanish Netherlands which would be harmful to English interests. William launched a propaganda campaign convincing the English people that the alliance with France was part of a plot to make their country Roman Catholic. Anti-Catholic sentiment and the prospect that the [[Parliament of England]] would refuse a war budget, forced Charles to abandon the costly and fruitless war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=67\u201394}} The [[Second Peace of Westminster]] largely confirmed the situation as it was before the war. The larger conflict between the Republic and France would be protracted until 1678.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Charles II (Lely).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles II of England]]; the war was driven by his desire for the French subsidies that offered financial freedom from Parliament]]\nThe 1652-1654 [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was the result of commercial rivalry and [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]] support for the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], uncle of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Peace terms]] agreed in 1654 with the [[The Protectorate|English Protectorate]] included the permanent [[Act of Seclusion|exclusion]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] from public office, ensuring Republican political control. When Charles [[Restoration (England)|regained the English throne]] in 1660, his Orangist links meant [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] opposed negotiations for an Anglo-Dutch alliance; after these broke down, he agreed a treaty of assistance with [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1662.<ref>{{cite web |title=The first stadtholderless period |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Netherlands/The-first-stadtholderless-period#ref414091 |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nUsing France as a barrier against England and the Orangists also had risks, since despite their alliance against [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], French objectives in the [[Low Countries]] threatened Dutch commercial interests. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] permanently closed the [[Scheldt]] estuary, benefiting De Witt's power base of [[Amsterdam]] by eliminating their closest rival, [[Antwerp]]; ensuring it remained shut was a vital objective. Changes in this region also concerned England, since control of ports on the [[Flanders|North Flemish coast]] allowed a hostile power to blockade the [[English Channel|Channel]].{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nIn 1665, an attack by [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] on the [[West-Indische Compagnie]] led to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]; in the first 18 months, the Dutch suffered a serious naval defeat at [[Battle of Lowestoft|Lowestoft]], an invasion by [[Prince-Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]] and an attempted Orangist coup, both financed by England. The prospect of an English victory led Louis to activate the 1662 treaty, although the Dutch considered the support provided inadequate. When the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] blocked his requests for territorial compensation, Louis launched the [[War of Devolution]] in May 1667 and rapidly occupied much of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} \n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|right|The [[Low Countries]] ca 1700; French expansion threatened both England and the Dutch Republic ]]\nCharles refused to recall [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to obtain funding, obliging him to pay off his fleet in early 1667, leading to the humiliating [[Raid on the Medway]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=70}} The Dutch were more worried by French gains; they [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|quickly negotiated an end to the war]] in July 1667, then started talks in London on a shared approach for reversing them.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}} Sensing an opportunity, Charles proposed an Anglo-French agreement to Louis, who, however, was unwilling to pay the subsidies he demanded and preferred to rely on De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=5}}\n\nCharles sent envoys to [[The Hague]] to continue discussions, publicly supported by De Witt, both seeing it as a way to put pressure on Louis.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}} French tariffs on imports imposed in early 1667 increased opposition in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], who in any case preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour to a strong France. On 23 January 1668, the Republic, England and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] signed the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]], committing to mutual support in the event of an attack on one by France or Spain. A secret clause agreed to provide Spain military assistance if France continued the war.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n[[File:Van Soest, Attack on the Medway.jpg|thumb|left|The 1667 [[Raid on the Medway]] severely damaged Charles' prestige]]\nLouis returned most of his acquisitions in the 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], although he retained towns like [[Charleroi]] and [[Tournai]]. As Dutch and French aims in the Spanish Netherlands could not be reconciled, it made sense to eliminate the Dutch Republic first.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lesaffer |first1=Randall |title=The Wars of Louis XIV in Treaties (Part III): The Secret Alliance of Dover (1 June 1670) |url=https://opil.ouplaw.com/page/secret-alliance-dover/the-wars-of-louis-xiv-in-treaties-part-iii-the-secret-alliance-of-dover-1-june-1670 |website=OPIL |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref> Detaching Sweden from the Triple Alliance was straightforward, since the subsidies promised by the Dutch remained unpaid; the next target was England. In June 1670 the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] was negotiated between Louis and Charles  using his sister [[Henrietta of England|Henrietta of Orl\u00e9ans]]; very few English statesmen were aware of its provisions. While it is generally accepted that Charles wanted financial independence from Parliament, his motives remain obscure even today.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=301}}\n\nThe terms agreed to an Anglo-French military alliance against the Republic, creation of a state for his nephew William and a British [[brigade]] for the French army.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}} In December 1670, a public treaty of Dover was signed which omitted the more controversial articles of the real version. Apart from the war pact, secret clauses not revealed until 1771 included payment to Charles of \u00a3230,000 per year for the brigade, \u00a31&nbsp;million for the navy and \u00a3200,000 for his public conversion to Catholicism, payable in advance.{{sfn|Kenyon|1993|pp=67-68}} Significantly, the timing of the announcement was up to Charles, with a declaration of war 'no more than six months later'; this gave him an informal, open-ended agreement with France, while preserving the Triple Alliance. Aware of French negotiations with the Dutch over dividing the Spanish Netherlands, Charles demanded [[Walcheren]], [[Cadzand]] and [[Sluys]], whose possession would give him control of Dutch sea routes.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=302}}\n\nDespite the recent war, tensions between England and the Republic significantly diminished after 1667 and there was minimal support for a French alliance against them. The exchange of [[New Amsterdam|New York]] for the spice island of [[Run (island)|Run]] settled two major areas of dispute, both were concerned by French aims in the Low Countries, and English merchants were also affected by French tariffs.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|pp=70}} Most Dutch and English politicians considered the Triple Alliance an essential protection against French expansion; in early 1671, Parliament specifically allocated money to ensure the Royal Navy could fulfil its obligations under the treaty.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=71}}\n\n==Preparations==\n[[File:1672 Dutch War.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agreements with M\u00fcnster and Cologne allowed the French to bypass the Spanish Netherlands]]\nLouis instructed his [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador]] in the Hague to continue negotiations with De Witt as a delaying tactic, while he finalised invasion plans. Since Dutch defences were concentrated along the border with the Spanish Netherlands, Louis agreed an alliance with [[Electorate of Cologne|Electoral Cologne]], allowing his army to use the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Principality of Li\u00e8ge]] (see Map). It also complied with an undertaking to [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] not to use the Spanish Netherlands as an invasion route.{{sfn|Hutton|1986|p=309}} In April 1672, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising military support if 'threatened' by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]; this offset an agreement of 6 May between the Republic and [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], whose territories included the [[Duchy of Cleves]] on their eastern border.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=209}}\n\nHoping to gain English support, on 25 February 1672 the States General appointed 22-year old William [[Captain-General]] of the [[Dutch States Army|federal army]], an authorised total of 83,000 men.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=75}} Uncertainty over French strategy meant most of these were based in the wrong place, while actual numbers were very different; on 12 June, one commander reported his official garrison of eighteen companies only had enough men for four.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=440-441}}\n\nThe Republic was better prepared for a naval war, although to avoid provoking the English, on 4 February the States General reduced the naval budget from 7.9&nbsp;million to 4.8&nbsp;million guilders.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=26}} After the 1667 Medway raid, their navy was the largest in Europe; by 1672, the combined Anglo-French fleet outnumbered them by over a third.

Louis originally agreed but success meant he no longer considered this compromise necessary.{{sfn|'t Hart|2014|pp=30-33}}\n\nOn 14 June, the States of Holland decided to ask peace terms from England and France, offering Louis the key fortresses in the south and ten million guilders.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=86}} He responded with additional demands; either religious freedom for Catholics or sovereignty over [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Guelders]]. This was a deliberate delaying tactic; he knew the envoys were not authorised to negotiate on religion or the territorial integrity of the provinces and would have to request further instructions.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}} The English were to be ceded [[Delfzijl]], in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], already besieged by M\u00fcnster.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=80}}\n\nDepicting Charles as the one man who could save them from the French, Orangist pressure led to William's appointment as stadtholder of Holland on 4 July. Hoping for a quick win, Charles sent Arlington, one of the few English politicians privy to the full content of Treaty of Dover, and [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Buckingham]] to Brill, accompanied by Orangist exiles who had fled the Republic after their failed coup in 1666. Cheered by crowds who believed they brought promises of English support against the French, they arrived at William's headquarters in [[Nieuwerbrug]] on 5 July.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=89}} The mood changed when their terms were made public; France and M\u00fcnster would retain their conquests, with William appointed Prince of Holland. For this, he would pay England ten million guilders, \u00a310,000 per annum for North Sea herring rights, and allow military occupation of Brill, [[Sluys]] and [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], as had been the case until 1616 after the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]].{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=81}}\n[[File:Gaspar Fagel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]], appointed Grand Pensionary in August 1672]]\nThe terms offered the Dutch nothing they did not already hold and resistance hardened as a result.

They met with Louis at [[Heeswijk Castle]], but as the Dutch expected, made no progress; the Heeswijk Accord on 16 July agreed a minimal list of shared demands and undertook not to conclude a separate peace. Neither side placed any reliance on this; by this stage, only French subsidies kept Charles in the war.{{sfn|Grose|1929|pp=181-182}}\n\nA second letter from Charles on 18 July urged William to accept his terms, claiming the De Witts were the only obstacle to peace. He responded by offering the herring rights, \u00a3400,000, Sluys and [[Surinam]], in return for recognition as Prince of Holland and England agreeing a separate peace; the latter was clearly unacceptable.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=91}} Based on the Heeswijk Accord, Louis now required England also be ceded the islands of [[Voorne]], which contained the Dutch main naval port of [[Hellevoetsluis]], and [[Goeree]]. These were rejected on 20 July and ended negotiations; Arlington and Buckingham returned to London.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2005|p=435}}\n\nJohan de Witt had resigned as Grand Pensionary in June, while Cornelis was arrested for allegedly plotting to murder William. On 15 August, Charles' letter blaming the De Witts was published in Holland; motives are still debated but the effect was to inflame tensions and the two brothers were lynched by an Orangist civil militia on 20th.{{sfn|Troost|2001|pp=94-95}} Orangist [[Gaspar Fagel]] became Grand Pensionary; on 27 August, the States of Holland passed legislation removing their political opponents from local office and securing William's political position.{{sfn|Edwards|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Dutch recovery: July to December ===\n[[File:Assault on Coevorden in 1672 - De bestorming van Coevorden, 30 december 1672 (Pieter Wouwerman).jpg|thumb|right|The recapture of [[Coevorden]] on 30 December 1672 was a significant boost to Dutch morale]]\nOn 7 July, the inundations were fully set; their effectiveness would be reduced when the waters froze in winter but for now, Holland was secure from French advance.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=196}} This allowed time for the States army to enact military reforms approved on 16 July, while their numbers were boosted by the return of 20,000 prisoners ransomed from the French.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|pp=442-444}}\n\nA later French analyst suggested the offensive was arguably too successful; it united the opposition and distracted Louis from his primary objective of the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Le Blond|1758|p=452}} The French field army was drastically reduced by the need to garrison captured towns, while it also strained their supply lines; with the active phase of the war ended, Louis returned to Versailles on 26 July.{{sfn|Young|2004|p=131}}\n\nIn addition to unofficial Spanish support, on 25 July Leopold agreed to supply 16,000 men to help the Dutch, joined by the 20,000 originally promised by Frederick William in May. Although the Imperial troops were ordered to avoid combat, Louis was forced to divert 20,000 troops under Turenne to the Rhineland, and 18,000 to Alsace; this left some 50,000 men around the Republic, most distributed in garrisons.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nThe situation was far worse for Charles, who had no clear [[exit strategy]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=283}} Hopes of a quick victory vanished after Solebay, which ensured a vital supply of Baltic grain. The disasters that removed the De Witts also secured William's position and ended his dependence on Charles. The M\u00fcnster army disintegrated due to lack of supplies and on 27 August, von Galen abandoned the siege of Groningen. The defenders suffered less than 100 casualties, the besiegers over 11,000, which included nearly 6,000 deserters; many of these enrolled with the Dutch.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2010|p=446}}\n\nWilliam led a number of offensives, including attacks on [[Woerden]] and Charleroi; while over-ambitious and unsuccessful, these restored Dutch morale. Coevorden was recaptured on 31 December and although their position remained precarious, by the end of 1672 the Dutch had regained much of the territory lost in May. Louis found himself involved in a wider European war of attrition. Despite his French subsidies, Charles had run out of money and faced considerable domestic opposition to continuing the war.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=72}}\n\nOn the 13th of December, the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] dispatched an expedition force to [[Saint Helena]] under the leadership of Jacob de Geus and took possession of the English outpost on the island on behalf of the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref>History of South Africa 1486 -1691, G.M Theal, London 1888, P226</ref>\n\n== 1673 ==\n===Overview===\nAs the French again failed to cross the Holland Water Line, it was hoped that the Anglo-French fleet might defeat the Dutch navy, by a blockade of the Dutch coast forcing the Republic to capitulate to avoid starvation, or landing an invasion force. Because the allies did not cooperate very well, De Ruyter could competently exploit the shoals off the coast of Zealand to prevent his fleet being overwhelmed by their superior numbers. In August, the Dutch fleet was more to the north forced to defend [[Marsdiep|the Texel]] and clashed with the allies in open battle. De Ruyter managed to obtain a tactical draw which implied a strategic Dutch victory because the damaged English fleet could no longer continue operations. The failure of the naval campaign in the summer of 1673 completed the English disillusionment with the war, and with the alliance with the French who they blamed for this failure.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=89}}\n\nThe war, never popular with Parliament to begin with, now quickly lost any remaining support there. A final victory over the Dutch seemed unlikely. In late 1673, the French were forced to gradually abandon most of the Dutch territory. At the same time they prepared to conquer the Spanish Netherlands at last, which was a frightening prospect for most British politicians. However, the main opposition against the war was caused by Dutch propaganda. William convinced the English people that Charles had plotted with Louis to make their country Roman Catholic again. This caused such an uproar that Charles thought it best to preserve his hold on the throne by quickly agreeing to the [[Second Peace of Westminster]], which was greeted with popular enthusiasm on both sides of the North Sea, least by the commercial interests of Amsterdam and London, and it was ratified by both parties with exceptional speed.{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=91}}\n\n===Naval battles===\n[[File:Van de Velde, Battle of Schooneveld.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''Battle of Schooneveld'' by [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|Van de Velde the Elder]]]]\nIn comparison with the first two wars, where both sides, and particularly the Dutch, often relied on aggressive tactics that resulted in the loss of a significant numbers of ships to the defeated fleet,{{sfn|Palmer|1997|pp=130,138}} in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, both sides adopted line-ahead formations in mist battles, an essentially defensive formation that resulted in far fewer ship losses and, in the Battle of Texel, to no ships lost on either side.{{sfn|Palmer|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn the winter of 1673, the French failed to cross the Water Line over the ice,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=100}} thwarted both by thaws and special Dutch sailor companies moving on [[ice skate]]s,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} organised by temporary Lieutenant-Admiral [[Johan de Liefde]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=255}} In the spring, attempts to drain the northern part of the line or to cross on rafts, proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=337-343}} The attack from the east thus being considered impractical, the activities of the Royal Navy gained much more importance. It was ordered, in co-operation with a French squadron, to at least blockade the Dutch coast and, if possible, execute a landing on it, conquering the Republic from the west. How this should be accomplished exactly, was not very clear.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=81}} The English navy, in contrast to the Dutch fleet, had little experience in shore landings. It was expected therefore, to directly take some Dutch port by assault, despite having insufficient recent information about the dangerous, constantly shifting shoals.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=169}}\n[[File:Bol, Michiel de Ruyter.jpg|left|thumb|Michiel de Ruyter prevented a sea invasion of the Republic]]\nBefore this could be achieved, the Allies would have to defeat the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=346}} Although the English deliberately created the impression&nbsp;\u2013 to frighten the Dutch population into an invasion scare{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}}\u2013 that transports, carrying an army, were sailing immediately behind the war fleet, in fact the\u2014rather small\u2014invasion force formed by the [[Blackheath Army]] was left in [[Great Yarmouth]], to be shipped only after a full control over the seas had been attained.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=260}} In this the French would be of little help; they had received clear orders by Louis to give absolute priority to the survival of their vessels{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=172}} and inform him personally about what knowledge they had gained by observing the English and Dutch tactics. This meant that the French navy considered the campaign first of all to be a great learning opportunity; the French admirals afterwards declared that De Ruyter had given them some \"beautiful lessons\".{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}}\n\nIn May, Rupert advanced to the Dutch coast with a superior force of 81 ships; De Ruyter, with 55 ships took up a defensive position in the [[Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=83}} Rupert sent a light squadron toward the smaller Dutch fleet hoping either to tempt it into an unequal battle,{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} or to force it to seek refuge in the naval port fortress of [[Hellevoetsluis]], where it could be blocked while the transport fleet would be brought over to storm either Brill in Holland or Flushing on Walcheren in Zealand.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}} De Ruyter attacked the light squadron very quickly, before the main allied fleet was in good order starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|First Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} In the battle of Solebay of the previous year, the French squadron had, on sight of the approaching Dutch fleet, sailed in a direction opposite to that of the English fleet. To counter English accusations that this had been done on purpose to let the English bear the brunt of the fighting, the French now formed the centre squadron. When a gap formed in the French line after a number of French ships had moved forward out of position, De Ruyter suddenly tacked with his own centre and sailed through it.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} After a while the French disengaged&nbsp;\u2013 later writing enthusiastic reports to Louis about feeling honoured to witness the tactical genius shown by De Ruyter by this manoeuvre{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=261}}\u2013 exposing the Allied rear to encirclement by the Dutch rear and centre. On perceiving the danger, its commander, Spragge, abandoned the remainder of the rear with his flotilla to seek out Tromp, who was rather hesitantly attacked by Rupert in the van, fearing the shoals. Thus being outmanoeuvred and divided, the Allied fleet managed to reunite only because De Ruyter decided not to take any unnecessary risks but to join Tromp, who had to shift his flag, with the remainder of the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=262}} but In view if the continuing disorder to his fleet, Rupert was content to withdraw at nightfall,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=263}} as De Ruyter had manoeuvred his weaker fleet with great skill.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}}\n[[File:BattleOfTexel.jpg|{{largethumb}}|The ''Gouden Leeuw'' duelling the ''Royal Prince'' near the Texel]]\nThe allied fleet remained of the coast, as Rupert was unwilling to enter the dangerous Schooneveld again, he could only hope either to lure the Dutch out or that the Dutch fleet would attack him.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} On 14 June, taking advantage of a favourable wind, De Ruyter and the resupplied and reinforced Dutch fleet surprised the allies by leaving his ideal blocking position, and attacked their unprepared fleet, starting the [[Battle of Schooneveld|Second Battle of the Schooneveld]].{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264}} and Sir [[Edward Spragge]], commanding the rear squadron was visiting Rupert at the time of the Dutch attack, Rupert was forced to invert his squadron order without properly informing the French, causing such a chaos in the Allied fleet, which the Dutch exploited by severely damaging many of their ships.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=264-265}} Spragge added to this disorder by again seeking out Tromp, without success.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}} Much damaged and with its morale shaken, the Allied fleet returned to the [[Thames]] for repairs.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=265}}\n\nIn late July, Rupert sailed out again, trying to lure the Dutch fleet to the north, pretending to attempt a landing at The Hague or [[Den Helder]]. De Ruyter at first decided not to leave his Schooneveld position,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=266}} but, under pressure from Amsterdam merchants to prevent the capture of a valuable returning [[Dutch East India Company]] fleet,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=263}} he was ordered by William to defend the incoming fleet{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=268}} as its loss would given Charles the funds to continue the war.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|pp=268-269}} This resulted in the final [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]]. The conduct of the French fleet and its commander, D'Estr\u00e9es is a matter of dispute. While Prud'homme states that they French fought hard,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}} Jenkins argues that, either through  poor seamanship, or because D'Estr\u00e9es had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet, should England make peace with the Dutch, it failed to engage the Dutch closely for much of the day with D'Estr\u00e9es disobeying Rupert's orders to attack the Dutch, claiming the wind was too weak.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=52}} Davies accepts that, by the admission of several French officers, their fleet was not prominent in the action, attributing in part to inexperience,{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} and Prud'homme accepts that the French allowed themselves to get separated from the English fleet.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=270}}\n\nWhat is clear is that the sheer size of the allied fleet and the length of its battle line together with inadequacies in the fighting instructions and signaling that were remedied after the battle made the task of controlling it difficult.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=268}} Spragge action in breaking formation for the second time to duel with Tromp, and losing his life as a result, as well as D'Estr\u00e9es ignoring or misunderstanding Rupert's signals allowed an inferior but better managed fleet to succeed.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=53}}{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=84}} Having incurred enormous damage, both fleets retreated.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}}\n\nThis tactical draw was a complete strategic victory for the Dutch,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} even though four ships of the Spice Fleet had fallen into Allied hands.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=274}} For De Ruyter, the successful campaign, by repelling attacks by much superior fleets to save his homeland, had been the highlight of his career, as the English readily acknowledged: [[James II of England|the Duke of York]] concluded that among admirals, \"he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world\".{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had to abandon their plans for an invasion from the sea,{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=272}} and the large costs of repair troubled Parliament.\n\n===Growing anti-war sentiment in England===\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]] was one of the English politicians to become pro-Dutch and anti-Stuart]]\nOverall the war had been far from profitable to the English. In previous conflicts many in England had gained riches by joining privateering enterprises; in this war Dutch raiders captured more English ships (over 550 merchantmen; 2,800 vessels of all Allies{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=282}}) than vice versa. The province of Zealand alone operated 120 privateers.{{sfn|Doedens|Mulder|2016|p=167}} Being well aware that the war was waged by English and French nobles who disdained the Dutch as, in the words of Louis, a nation of \"cheesemongers\", at least three privateers sailed under the name of the ''Getergde Kaasboer'' (provoked cheesemonger).{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=85}} The English had failed to blockade the Dutch coast and were themselves largely blocked from the vital Baltic trade in wood and tar. The fact that the Dutch under [[Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest]] had retaken New York City\u2014formerly [[New Amsterdam]]\u2014in 1673 mattered little financially, nor did the temporary loss of [[Saint Helena]], but it hurt the English reputation. In the East, on 1 September 1673, a Dutch East India Company fleet of thirteen vessels commanded by [[Cornelis van Quaelberg]]en defeated an [[East India Company]] squadron of ten ships under [[William Basse]] off [[Masulipatam]], capturing two and sinking one British vessel. The material damage compounded a moral unease about the justifiability of the war; [[John Evelyn]] already after Solebay wrote: \"the loss of my Lord Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, as well the folly of hazarding so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation in the world but because the Hollander exceeded us in industry, and all things else but envy.\"{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=86}} In November 1673, parliament voted to deny Charles a war budget for 1674. Conversely, the Dutch had been able to restore international credit. For 1673, their war budget could be increased to a hundred million guilders, three times the normal annual tax revenues of the Republic.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=83}} This allowed them to operate large fleets, rebuild their army and find and subsidise allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the developments in the land war had also become very unfavourable to Charles. The ultimate goal of the French, and their deeper rationale for this war, was to conquer the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Olaf van Nimwegen, 2006, ''\"Deser landen crijchsvolck\". Het Staatse leger en de militaire revoluties 1588-1688'' Amsterdam, p 360</ref> Such a conquest would be very detrimental to the English strategic position: should the province of Holland capitulate to them also, the French would control the entire continental coast opposite England, as they would later achieve in the 19th-century [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=34}} For this reason Charles had in the Treaty of Dover explicitly reserved his rights to come to the aid of the Spanish Netherlands should his interests demand so; Louis had to delay the execution of his plans in this region until the Dutch affair was finished. Now that a deadlock had been reached, Louis' patience was severely tried. Emperor Leopold had promised in 1668 that after the death of the sickly [[Charles II of Spain]], the area would be ceded to France, but against expectations he survived until 1700.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=32}} Eventually the temptation to take possession of the Southern Netherlands while they were so vulnerable became too great. Louis gradually turned his attention to this area, first by the [[Siege of Maastricht (1673)|capture of Maastricht]] in July 1673, in which elements of Monmouth's brigade played an honourable r\u00f4le. Though this could be justified as improving the supply situation of the northern French army, its potential as a starting point for a Flemish campaign was not lost on the Spanish who had provided troops to help defend the city.\n\nOn 30 August, the Republic, the Empire, and Spain agreed the Alliance of The Hague.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=372}} In October, they were joined by [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine]] (who wanted his duchy back from Louis) forming the [[Quadruple Alliance (1673)|Quadruple Alliance]].{{sfn|Panhuysen|2009|p=383}}{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=95}} William made sure peace negotiations held with France and England in Cologne failed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=123}} In November, [[Bonn]] was taken by the alliance forces commanded by William; this forced the French army to abandon almost all occupied Dutch territory,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=126}} with the exception of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and Maastricht.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=97}} A final French victory over the Dutch at this point appeared most implausible; the war was changed into one about the dominion of Flanders and on this issue, the natural interests of England were opposed to those of France. The changed international situation was an important consideration for Parliament's decision to withhold funding, but internal events were even more decisive.\n\nThe Treaty of Dover was not only aimed at the Dutch Republic but also at the domination of Protestantism in England; Charles had promised Louis to try to end it. In accordance, on 25 March 1672, he had issued the [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence]], as a first step to complete [[religious tolerance]]. Parliament was shocked by this,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=123}} but at first was unaware of the connection with the French alliance; in February 1673 it voted to start funding the alliance, to an amount of \u00a31,260,000,{{sfn|Boxer|1969|p=87}} in exchange for a suspension of the Indulgence (and an issuing of the [[Test Act]] in March), not as yet seeing any contradiction in such policies.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=130}} This would soon change, however. Arlington's former secretary, [[Peter du Moulin|Pierre du Moulin]], had after fleeing to the Republic begun to work for William;{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} in the summer of 1673 he exploited the fears of the English population by starting a propaganda campaign,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} using one of the Dutch main assets: the world's largest per capita printing capacity.\n\nSoon, England was flooded with tens of thousands of pamphlets accusing Charles of wanting to make the country Catholic again in conspiracy with the French king.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} The campaign was a complete success, convincing the English people that such a plan really existed.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=127}} It was greatly aided by the decision in June 1673 by Charles's brother [[James II of England|James, the Duke of York]], to lay down his position as Lord High Admiral, which was generally (and correctly) interpreted as a sign that James had in secret become a Catholic and was therefore unable to abjure the [[transubstantiation]] doctrine, as the Test Act demanded of all officials.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} In September James married the Catholic [[Mary of Modena]], a beautiful young girl especially selected for him by King Louis. As Charles had no legitimate offspring, this marriage presented the strong prospect of a Catholic dynasty ruling England in the future.{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=131}}\n\nReacting to the change in the public mood, Buckingham, who had learned of it during his trip to the Republic the previous year, began to leak the Dover Treaty to many fellow politicians, and Arlington soon followed. Thus in a short time Charles' own cabinet, the [[Cabal Ministry]], went over to the \"Dutch\" peace party; [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], much shocked by the revelation, began to consider driving out the troublesome [[House of Stuart]] entirely. He induced his secretary, [[John Locke]], to develop further the legal concepts which would later be the basis of the [[Two Treatises of Government]], which justified the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.\n\n== Second Peace of Westminster ==\nIn this situation Charles felt that continuing the alliance was a grave threat to his personal position and that Parliament would no longer fund a war.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He informed the French ambassador [[Colbert de Croissy]] that to his regret, he had to terminate the English war effort.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} He told the Dutch via the Spanish consul in London, the Marquess del Fresno,{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=126}} that, his main war aim to install his noble nephew as stadtholder having been attained, he no longer objected to concluding a lasting peace between the two Protestant brother nations, if only some minor \"indemnities\" could be paid. At first the States of Holland were disinclined to grant Charles's demands: as England had accomplished nothing in the war, it was, in their opinion, not entitled to any reward. But William convinced them that there was some chance of bringing Charles into the war ''against'' France eventually. Furthermore, Spain had not yet declared war on France and was willing to do so only if England made peace, because it feared English attacks on its American colonies.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=291}}\n\nAfter a short exchange of proposals by means of trumpeters, the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] was publicly proclaimed in London on 17 February Old Style.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} It was approved by the States of Holland and West Frisia on 4 March,{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}} (New Style), and ratified by the States General on 5 March.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=294}}\n\nThe treaty stipulated that New York\u2014formerly [[New Netherland]]\u2014would henceforth be an English possession and that [[Suriname]], captured by the Dutch in 1667, would remain their colony, confirming the status quo of 1667.{{sfn|Prud'homme van Reine|2015|p=275}} An \"indemnity\" of two million guilders was to be paid by the Dutch.{{sfn|Shomette|Haslach|2002|p=292}} Eventually, William would force Charles to [[Set-off (law)|set off]] these indemnities against the debts he owed to the [[House of Orange]], so the English king actually received very little. Despite the peace, Monmouth's brigade would not be withdrawn from the French army and it would be allowed to recruit in Britain until the end of the Franco-Dutch War.{{sfn|Zwitzer|1990|p=33}} In April that year, William attempted to convince his uncle to enter the war against Louis but failed. Until the end of the War of Holland in 1678, Charles tried to negotiate between the two parties,{{sfn|Troost|2001|p=132}} at times pretending to consider a conflict with France, when such pretence was beneficial to him.{{sfn|Troost|2005|p=142}} In 1677, he forced his niece [[Mary II of England|Mary]] to marry William;{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=114}} this would later prove to be a fundamental cause of the fall of his brother in 1688.{{sfn|Panhuysen|2016|pp=116}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/emily-dickinson-9274190|title=Emily Dickinson biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography.com |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile Dickinson was a prolific poet, only 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emily Dickinson Museum indicates only one letter and ten poems were published before her death|url=https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|website=Emilydickinson,useum.org|accessdate=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807012709/http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|archive-date=August 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique to her era. They contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use [[Half rhyme|slant rhyme]] as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.<ref name=\"Mc2\">McNeil (1986), 2.</ref> Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\n\nAlthough Dickinson's acquaintances were likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\u2014that the breadth of her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] and [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], though both heavily edited the content. A 1998 ''[[New York Times]]'' article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name \"Susan\" was often deliberately removed. At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to sister-in-law [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson]], though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/magazine/beethoven-s-hair-tells-all.html|title=Beethoven's Hair Tells All!|website=The New York Times|date=November 29, 1998}}</ref> A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H.

On an extended visit to Monson when she was two, Emily's Aunt Lavinia described Emily as \"perfectly well & contented\u2014She is a very good child & but little trouble.\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 324.</ref> Emily's aunt also noted the girl's affinity for music and her particular talent for the piano, which she called \"the ''moosic''\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 85.</ref>\n\nDickinson attended primary school in a two-story building on Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Sew337\" /> Her education was \"ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl\".<ref>Farr (2005), 1.</ref> Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to \"keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned\".<ref>Sewall (1974), 335.</ref> While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests that her mother was regularly cold and aloof.

He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none.\"<ref>Wolff (1986), 45.</ref>\n\nOn September 7, 1840, Dickinson and her sister Lavinia started together at Amherst Academy, a former boys' school that had opened to female students just two years earlier.<ref name=\"Sew337\">Sewall (1974), 337.</ref> At about the same time, her father purchased a house on North Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Hab129\">Habegger (2001), 129.</ref> Emily's brother Austin later described this large new home as the \"mansion\" over which he and Emily presided as \"lord and lady\" while their parents were absent.<ref>Sewall (1974) 322.</ref> The house overlooked Amherst's burial ground, described by one local minister as treeless and \"forbidding\".<ref name=\"Hab129\" />\n\n=== Teenage years ===\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=30%|quote=\n<poem>\nThey shut me up in Prose&nbsp;\u2013\nAs when a little Girl\nThey put me in the Closet&nbsp;\u2013\nBecause they liked me \"still\"&nbsp;\u2013\n\nStill!

When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from [[typhus]] and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized.<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that \"it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 172.</ref> She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in [[Boston]] to recover.<ref name=\"wolff77\">Wolff (1986), 77.</ref> With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies.<ref>Ford (1966), 55.</ref> During this period, she met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Huntington Gilbert]] (who later married Emily's brother Austin).\n\nIn 1845, a [[Second Great Awakening|religious revival]] took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers.<ref name=\"ford47to48\">Ford (1966), 47\u201348.</ref> Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: \"I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my Savior.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\">Habegger (2001), 168.</ref> She went on to say it was her \"greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\" /> The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years.<ref>Ford (1966), 37.</ref> After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: \"Some keep the Sabbath going to Church&nbsp;\u2013 / I keep it, staying at Home\".<ref>Johnson (1960), 153.</ref>\n\nDuring the last year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending [[Mary Lyon]]'s [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] (which later became [[Mount Holyoke College]]) in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) from Amherst.<ref>Ford (1966), 46.</ref> She stayed at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there.<ref>Sewall (1974), 368.</ref> The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick.<ref>Sewall (1974), 358.</ref> Whatever the reasons for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to \"bring [her] home at all events\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 211.</ref> Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities.<ref name=\"Pic19\">Pickard (1967), 19.</ref> She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.<ref>Habegger (2001), 213.</ref>\n\n=== Early influences and writing ===\nWhen she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester&nbsp;\u2013 in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 216.</ref> Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.<ref>Sewall (1974), 401.</ref>\n\nNewton likely introduced her to the writings of [[William Wordsworth]], and his gift to her of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\".<ref name=\"Hab221\">Habegger (2001), 221.</ref> Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of [[tuberculosis]], he wrote to her, saying he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.<ref name=\"Hab221\" /> Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862\u2014\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality&nbsp;\u2013 but venturing too near, himself&nbsp;\u2013 he never returned\"\u2014refers to Newton.<ref>Habegger (2001), 218.</ref>\n\nDickinson was familiar not only with the [[Bible]] but also with contemporary popular literature.<ref>Knapp (1989), 59.</ref> She was probably influenced by [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s ''Letters from New York'', another gift from Newton<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> (after reading it, she gushed \"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\"<ref name=\"Ford18\">Ford (1966), 18.</ref>). Her brother smuggled a copy of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[Kavanagh (novel)|Kavanagh]]'' into the house for her (because her father might disapprove)<ref>Sewall (1974), 683.</ref> and a friend lent her [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in late 1849.<ref name=\"Hab226\">Habegger (2001), 226.</ref> ''Jane Eyre''{{'}}s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], she named him \"Carlo\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog.<ref name=\"Hab226\" /> [[William Shakespeare]] was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \"Why clasp any hand but this?\" and to another, \"Why is any other book needed?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 700\u2013701.</ref>\n\n=== Adulthood and seclusion ===\nIn early 1850, Dickinson wrote that \"Amherst is alive with fun this winter&nbsp;... Oh, a very great town this is!\"<ref name=\"Pic19\" /> Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of \"brain congestion\" at age 25.<ref>Sewall (1974), 340.</ref> Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:<blockquote>some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping&nbsp;\u2013 sleeping the churchyard sleep&nbsp;\u2013 the hour of evening is sad&nbsp;\u2013 it was once my study hour&nbsp;\u2013 my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school ''alone'', make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.<ref>Sewall (1974), 341.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Homestead, Amherst, Massachusetts (from left).JPG|thumb|left|The Evergreens, built by Edward Dickinson, was the home of Austin and Susan's family.]]\nDuring the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Gilbert]]. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of \"most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser\" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed.<ref>Martin (2002), 53.</ref> In an 1882 letter to Susan, Emily said, \"With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living.\"\n\nThe importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife.<ref>Pickard (1967), 21.</ref> However, the notion of a \"cruel\" Susan\u2014as promoted by her romantic rival\u2014has been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close.<ref>Longenbach, James. (June 16, 2010.) \"[http://www.thenation.com/article/ardor-and-abyss?page=full Ardor and the Abyss]\". ''The Nation''. Retrieved June 29, 2010.</ref> Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'' Lena Koski wrote, \"Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings.\"<ref>Koski (1996), 26-31.</ref> She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, \"Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me&nbsp;... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you\u2014that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast&nbsp;... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language.\" The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film ''[[Wild Nights with Emily]]'' and explored in the TV series ''[[Dickinson (TV series)|Dickinson]]''.\n\nSue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it [[Emily Dickinson Museum#The Evergreens|the Evergreens]], a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead.<ref>Habegger (2001), 338.</ref>\n\nUntil 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home.<ref>Sewall (1974), 444.</ref> First, they spent three weeks in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where her father was representing [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district|Massachusetts]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Then they went to [[Philadelphia]] for two weeks to visit family. In Philadelphia, she met Charles Wadsworth, a famous minister of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church, with whom she forged a strong friendship which lasted until his death in 1882.<ref>Sewall (1974), 447.</ref> Despite seeing him only twice after 1855 (he moved to [[San Francisco]] in 1862), she variously referred to him as \"my Philadelphia\", \"my Clergyman\", \"my dearest earthly friend\" and \"my Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 330.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickinson and Turner 1859 (cleaned).jpg|thumb|In September 2012, the Amherst College Archives and Special Collections unveiled this daguerreotype, proposing it to be Dickinson (left) and her friend [[Kate Scott Turner]] (ca.&nbsp;1859); it has not been authenticated.<ref>[https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/holdings/edickinson/new_daguerreotype 'The World Is Not Acquainted With Us': A New Dickinson Daguerreotype?]\" Amherst College Archives and Special Collections Website.

I Know not what to hope of her\".<ref name=\"Hab342\">Habegger (2001). 342.</ref> As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia said that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her.<ref name=\"Hab342\" /> Emily took this role as her own, and \"finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it\".<ref name=\"Hab342\" />\n\nWithdrawing more and more from the outside world, Emily began in the summer of 1858 what would be her lasting legacy. Reviewing poems she had written previously, she began making clean copies of her work, assembling carefully pieced-together manuscript books.<ref name=\"Hab353\">Habegger (2001), 353.</ref> The forty [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] she created from 1858 through 1865 eventually held nearly eight hundred poems.<ref name=\"Hab353\" /> No one was aware of the existence of these books until after her death.\n\nIn the late 1850s, the Dickinsons befriended [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles]], the owner and editor-in-chief of the ''[[Springfield Republican]]'', and his wife, Mary.<ref>Sewall (1974), 463.</ref> They visited the Dickinsons regularly for years to come. During this time Emily sent him over three dozen letters and nearly fifty poems.<ref>Sewall (1974), 473.</ref> Their friendship brought out some of her most intense writing and Bowles published a few of her poems in his journal.<ref>Habegger (2001), 376; McNeil (1986), 33.</ref> It was from 1858 to 1861 that Dickinson is believed to have written a trio of letters that have been called \"The Master Letters\".

She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not \"care for Thought\", her father bought her books, but begged her \"not to read them&nbsp;\u2013 because he fears they joggle the Mind\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 456.</ref>\n\nDickinson valued his advice, going from calling him \"Mr. Higginson\" to \"Dear friend\" as well as signing her letters, \"Your Gnome\" and \"Your Scholar\".<ref>Sewall (1974), 554\u2013555.</ref> His interest in her work certainly provided great moral support; many years later, Dickinson told Higginson that he had saved her life in 1862.<ref>Wolff (1986), 254.</ref> They corresponded until her death, but her difficulty in expressing her literary needs and a reluctance to enter into a cooperative exchange left Higginson nonplussed; he did not press her to publish in subsequent correspondence.<ref>Wolff (1986), 188.</ref> Dickinson's own ambivalence on the matter militated against the likelihood of publication.<ref>Wolff (1986), 188, 258.</ref> Literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]], in his review of Civil War literature, surmised that \"with encouragement, she would certainly have published\".<ref>Wilson (1986), 491.</ref>\n\n=== The woman in white ===\nIn direct opposition to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866.<ref>Habegger (2001), 498; Murray (1996), 286\u2013287; Murray (1999), 724-725.</ref> Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson may have been too overcome to keep up her previous level of writing.<ref>Habegger (2001), 501; Murray (1996) 286\u2013287; Murray (2010) 81-83.</ref> Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret \u00d3 Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that the Dickinsons brought in a permanent household servant, [[Margaret Maher]], to replace their former maid-of-all-work.<ref>Habegger (2001), 502; Murray (1996) 287; Murray (1999) 724-725.</ref> Emily once again was responsible for the kitchen, including cooking and cleaning up, as well as the baking at which she excelled.<ref>86.

She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face.<ref>Habegger (2001), 517.</ref> She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878\u20131882.<ref name=\"Hab516\">Habegger (2001), 516.</ref> Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person.<ref>Habegger (2001), 540.</ref> Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders.<ref>Habegger (2001), 548.</ref> Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 541.</ref> Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that \"Aunt Emily stood for ''indulgence.''\"<ref name=\"Hab547\">Habegger (2001), 547.</ref> MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called \"A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson\", thought of her as always offering support{{clarify|date=March 2019}} to the neighborhood children.<ref name=\"Hab547\" />\n\nWhen Higginson urged her to come to Boston in 1868 so they could formally meet for the first time, she declined, writing: \"Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 521.</ref> It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as \"a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair&nbsp;... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqu\u00e9 & a blue net worsted shawl.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 523.</ref> He also felt that he never was \"with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 524.</ref>\n\n=== Posies and poesies ===\nScholar Judith Farr notes that Dickinson, during her lifetime, \"was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, than as a poet\".<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> Dickinson studied botany from the age of nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> During her lifetime, she assembled a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound [[herbarium]]. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] system.<ref>Habegger (2001), 154.</ref> The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/science/emily-dickinson-lost-gardens.html|title=The Lost Gardens of Emily Dickinson|date=May 17, 2016|website=The New York Times}}</ref> Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered \"carpets of [[Lily of the Valley|lily-of-the-valley]] and [[Pansy|pansies]], platoons of [[Sweet pea|sweetpeas]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinths]], enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia.

Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but \"they valued the posy more than the poetry\".<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nOn June 16, 1874, while in Boston, Edward Dickinson suffered a stroke and died. When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28.<ref>Habegger (2001), 562.</ref> She wrote to Higginson that her father's \"Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 566.</ref> A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral [[paralysis]] and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that \"Home is so far from Home\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 569.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=25%|quote=\n<poem>\nThough the great Waters sleep,\nThat they are still the Deep,\nWe cannot doubt&nbsp;\u2013\nNo vacillating God\nIgnited this Abode\nTo put it out&nbsp;\u2013\n</poem>|source=Emily Dickinson, c. 1884<ref>Johnson (1960), 661.</ref>}}\n[[Otis Phillips Lord]], an elderly judge on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] from [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], in 1872 or 1873 became an acquaintance of Dickinson's.

In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's ''Complete Concordance to Shakespeare'' (1877).<ref>Sewall (1974), 651.</ref> Dickinson wrote that \"While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 652.</ref> She referred to him as \"My lovely Salem\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 592; Sewall (1974), 653.</ref> and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that \"Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 591.</ref>\n\nAfter being critically ill for several years, Judge Lord died in March 1884. Dickinson referred to him as \"our latest Lost\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 597.</ref> Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson's \"Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\", Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.\n\n=== Decline and death ===\nAlthough she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 604.</ref> Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.\n\n[[File:EmilyDickinsonGrave-color.jpg|thumb|left|Emily Dickinson's tombstone in the family plot]]\nThe 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as \"a lady whom the people call the ''Myth''\".<ref>Walsh (1971), 26.</ref> Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief.<ref>Habegger (2001), 612.</ref> Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote \"We were never intimate&nbsp;... while she was our Mother&nbsp;\u2013 but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 607.</ref> The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert\u2014Emily's favorite\u2014died of [[typhoid fever]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 615.</ref>\n\nAs death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote,  \"The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 623.</ref> That summer she had seen \"a great darkness coming\" and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston.<ref>Habegger (2001), 625.</ref> She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: \"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily\".<ref>Wolff (1986), 534.</ref> On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that \"the day was awful&nbsp;... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six.\"<ref name=\"Hab627\">Habegger (2001), 627.</ref> Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as [[Bright's disease]] and its duration as two and a half years.<ref>Habegger (2001), 622.</ref>\n\nLavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Emily's body upon her death. Susan also wrote Emily's obituary for the ''Springfield Republican'', ending it with four lines from one of Emily's poems: \"Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose.\" Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Sue should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly.<ref>Nell Smith (1998), 265.</ref> Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with [[Heliotropium arborescens|vanilla-scented heliotrope]], a [[lady's slipper]] [[Orchidaceae|orchid]], and a \"knot of blue field [[Viola (plant)|violets]]\" placed about it.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\">Wolff (1986), 535.</ref> The funeral service, held in the Homestead's library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", a poem by [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] that had been a favorite of Dickinson's.<ref name=\"Hab627\" /> At Dickinson's request, her \"coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups\" for burial in the family plot at [[Amherst West Cemetery|West Cemetery]] on Triangle Street.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\">Farr (2005), 3\u20136.</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\nDespite Dickinson's prolific writing, fewer than a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's ''Complete Poems'' in 1955,<ref>Ford (1966), 122</ref> Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n[[File:Emilyrepublican.jpg|thumb|right|\"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013,\" titled \"The Sleeping,\" as it was published in the ''Springfield Republican'' in 1862.]]\nA few of Dickinson's poems appeared in [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles']] ''Springfield Republican'' between 1858 and 1868.

It was the last poem published during Dickinson's lifetime.\n\n=== Posthumous ===\nAfter Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest.<ref name=\"Farr3\">Farr (1996), 3.</ref> Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published.<ref>Pickard (1967), xv.</ref> She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.<ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\" /> A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.<ref>Wolff (1986), 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Poems.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Poems'', published in 1890]]\nThe first volume of Dickinson's ''Poems,'' edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890.<ref name=\"Wol537\">Wolff (1986), 537.</ref> Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity.<ref>McNeil (1986), 34; Blake (1964), 42.</ref> The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years.<ref name=\"Wol537\" /> ''Poems: Second Series'' followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: \"The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published\".<ref>Buckingham (1989), 194.</ref>\n\nNearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson's poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;243</ref> Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.<ref>Mitchell (2009), p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n\nThe first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a complete new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson's [[variorum]] brought all of Dickinson's known poems together for the first time.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;122</ref> Johnson's goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts.<ref name=\"Martin\">Martin (2002), 17.</ref> They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely [[wikt:elliptical|elliptical]] in their language.<ref>McNeil (1986), 35.</ref> Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson's letters, also presented in three volumes.\n\nIn 1981, ''The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson'' was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.\n\nDickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in ''My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson'' (2001) that \"The consequences of the poet's failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 628.</ref>\n\n== Poetry ==\n{{Main|List of Emily Dickinson poems}}\n\nDickinson's poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.\n* '''Pre-1861'''. These are often conventional and [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimental]] in nature.<ref>Ford (1966), 68.</ref> Thomas H. Johnson, who later published ''The Poems of Emily Dickinson'', was able to date only five of Dickinson's poems before 1858.<ref name=\"Pic20\">Pickard (1967), 20.</ref> Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, one of which is about missing her brother Austin. The fifth poem, which begins \"I have a Bird in spring\", conveys her grief over the feared loss of friendship and was sent to her friend Sue Gilbert.<ref name=\"Pic20\" />\n* '''1861\u20131865'''. This was her most creative period\u2014these poems represent her most vigorous and creative work. Johnson estimated that she composed 86 poems in 1861, 366 in 1862, 141 in 1863, and 174 in 1864. He also believed that during this period, she fully developed her themes of life and mortality.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\">Johnson (1960), viii.</ref>\n* '''Post-1866'''. It is estimated that two-thirds of the entire body of her poetry was written before this year.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\" />\n\n=== Structure and syntax ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson \"Wild nights\" manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|Dickinson's handwritten manuscript of her poem \"Wild Nights&nbsp;\u2013 Wild Nights!\"]]\nThe extensive use of [[dash]]es and unconventional [[capitalization]] in Dickinson's manuscripts, and the [[idiosyncratic]] vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is \"far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed\".<ref name=\"Mc2\" /><ref name=\"Hecht153\">Hecht (1996), 153\u2013155.</ref> Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the [[ballad stanza]], a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of [[half rhyme|slant rhyme]].<ref name=\"For63\">Ford (1966), 63.</ref> In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four, while only using tetrameter for line three.\n\nSince many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the [[common meter]], employing alternating lines of [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 186.</ref> Familiar examples of such songs are \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" and \"[[Amazing Grace]]'\".\n\nDickinson scholar and poet [[Anthony Hecht]] finds resonances in Dickinson's poetry not only with hymns and song-forms but also with [[psalms]] and [[riddle]]s, citing the following example: \"Who is the East?&nbsp;/ The Yellow Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Purple if he can&nbsp;/ That carries in the Sun.&nbsp;/ Who is the West?&nbsp;/ The Purple Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Yellow if He can&nbsp;/ That lets Him out again.\"<ref name=\"Hecht153\" />\n\nLate 20th-century scholars are \"deeply interested\" by Dickinson's highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks).<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime&nbsp;\u2013 \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\", published as \"The Snake\" in the ''Republican''&nbsp;\u2013 Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:20em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not<br />\nHis notice sudden is&nbsp;\u2013\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<ref name=\"For32\">Ford (1966), 32.</ref><br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not,<br />\nHis notice sudden is.\n|\n|}\n\nAs Farr points out, \"snakes instantly notice you\"; Dickinson's version captures the \"breathless immediacy\" of the encounter; and ''The Republican''{{'}}s punctuation renders \"her lines more commonplace\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson's structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are \"aesthetically based\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page.<ref>Crumbley (1997), 14.</ref> Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n=== Major themes ===\nDickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]].<ref>Bloom (1998), 18.</ref> However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's \"relentlessly measuring mind&nbsp;... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental\".<ref>Farr (1996), 13.</ref> Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, [[irony]] and [[satire]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 171.</ref>\n\n'''Flowers and gardens''': Farr notes that Dickinson's \"poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers\" and that allusions to gardens often refer to an \"imaginative realm&nbsp;... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\">Farr (2005), 1\u20137.</ref> She associates some flowers, like [[gentian]]s and [[anemone]]s, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and [[nosegay]]s.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Farr notes that one of Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to \"conflate her poetry itself with the posies\": \"My nosegays are for Captives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Dim&nbsp;\u2013 long expectant eyes&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Fingers denied the plucking,&nbsp;/ Patient till Paradise&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To such, if they sh'd whisper&nbsp;/ Of morning and the moor&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ They bear no other errand,&nbsp;/ And I, no other prayer\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" />\n\n'''The Master poems''': Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to \"Signor\", \"Sir\" and \"Master\", who is characterized as Dickinson's \"lover for all eternity\".<ref name=\"Farr7\">Farr (1996), 7\u20138.</ref> These confessional poems are often \"searing in their self-inquiry\" and \"harrowing to the reader\" and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson's day.<ref name=\"Farr7\" /> The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals but this view is frequently rejected by scholars. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, \"human, with specific characteristics, but godlike\" and speculates that Master may be a \"kind of Christian muse\".<ref name=\"Farr7\" />\n\n'''Morbidity''': Dickinson's poems reflect her \"early and lifelong fascination\" with illness, dying and death.<ref name=\"Pollak62\">Pollak (1996), 62\u201365.</ref> Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: \"crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> She reserved her sharpest insights into the \"death blow aimed by God\" and the \"funeral in the brain\", often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar Vivian Pollak considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson's \"thirsting-starving persona\", an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail.<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> Dickinson's most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at \"the interface of murder and suicide\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" />\n\n'''Gospel poems''': Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him.<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\">Oberhaus (1996), 105\u2013119</ref> She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with \"wit and American colloquial language\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the \"salient feature uniting Christian poets&nbsp;... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ\" and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the \"poetic tradition of Christian devotion\" alongside [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]].<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: \"The Savior must have been&nbsp;/ A docile Gentleman&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To come so far so cold a Day&nbsp;/ For little Fellowmen&nbsp;/ The Road to Bethlehem&nbsp;/ Since He and I were Boys&nbsp;/ Was leveled, but for that twould be&nbsp;/ A rugged billion Miles&nbsp;\u2013\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" />\n\n'''The Undiscovered Continent''': Academic Suzanne Juhasz considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\">Juhasz (1996), 130\u2013140.</ref> Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the \"undiscovered continent\" and the \"landscape of the spirit\" and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding\u2014castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms\u2014to create a dwelling place of \"oneself\" where one resides with one's other selves.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" /> An example that brings together many of these ideas is: \"Me from Myself&nbsp;\u2013 to banish&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Had I Art&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Impregnable my Fortress&nbsp;/ Unto All Heart&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ But since myself\u2014assault Me&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ How have I peace&nbsp;/ Except by subjugating&nbsp;/ Consciousness.&nbsp;/ And since We're mutual Monarch&nbsp;/ How this be&nbsp;/ Except by Abdication&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Me&nbsp;\u2013 of Me?\".<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" />\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson\u00b4s (1830-1886) manuscript of \"A route of evanescence\" (1880).jpg|thumb|left|Dickinson wrote and sent this poem (\"A Route of Evanescence\") to Thomas Higginson in 1880.]]\nThe surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson's poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from [[William Dean Howells]], an editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality \"is that of extraordinary grasp and insight\",<ref>Blake (1964), 12.</ref> albeit \"without the proper control and chastening\" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred.<ref>Wolff (1986), 175.</ref> His judgment that her opus was \"incomplete and unsatisfactory\" would be echoed in the essays of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Maurice Thompson]], who was literary editor of ''The Independent'' for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had \"a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality\".<ref>Blake (1964), 28.</ref> Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. [[Andrew Lang]], a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that \"if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much\".<ref>Blake (1964), 37.</ref> [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in January 1892: \"It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and [[grotesque]] fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of [[William Blake|Blake]], and strongly influenced by the mannerism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]&nbsp;... But the incoherence and formlessness of her&nbsp;\u2014 versicles are fatal&nbsp;... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar\".<ref>Blake (1964), 55.</ref>\n\nCritical attention to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s.<ref>Blake (1964), vi.</ref> By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially [[modernism|modern]]. Rather than seeing Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic.<ref>Wells (1929), 243\u2013259.</ref> In a 1915 essay, [[Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant]] called the poet's inspiration \"daring\" and named her \"one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore\".<ref>Blake (1964), 89.</ref> With the growing popularity of [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poetry]] in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a [[cult following]] began to form.<ref>Blake (1964), 202.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, a number of the New Critics&nbsp;\u2013 among them [[R. P. Blackmur]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Yvor Winters]]&nbsp;\u2013 appraised the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenb\u00fcchle pointed out, their \"affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship\".<ref>Grabher (1998), 358\u2013359.</ref> Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: \"...&nbsp;she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of [[antimacassar]]s&nbsp;... She came&nbsp;... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 223.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of [[feminism]] created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 1.</ref> Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book ''This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson'', \"Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman.\" Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 9.</ref> [[Adrienne Rich]] theorized in ''Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson'' (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: \"[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed&nbsp;... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time&nbsp;... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics.\"<ref>Juhasz (1983), 10.</ref>\n\nSome scholars question the poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry.<ref>Martin (2002), 58</ref> Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and [[Martha Nell Smith]] have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.<ref>Comment (2001), 167.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as ''Emily Dickinson Face to Face'' and ''Letters of Emily Dickinson'', which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.<ref>Grabher (1998), p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nEmily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture.<ref>Martin (2002), 1.</ref> Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet.<ref>Martin (2002), 2.</ref> As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that \"If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 24.</ref> Critic [[Harold Bloom]] has placed her alongside [[Walt Whitman]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Robert Frost]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Hart Crane]] as a major American poet,<ref name=\"Bloo9\">Bloom (1999), 9</ref> and [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|in 1994]] listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.<ref>Bloom (1994), 226</ref>\n\nDickinson is taught in [[American literature]] and [[Poetry of the United States|poetry]] classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as text for art songs by composers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Nick Peros]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[Michael Tilson Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_author_texts.html?AuthorId=697 |title=Vocal music set to texts by Emily Dickinson |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |accessdate=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in [[Bozeman, Montana]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml |title=Mission Statement|publisher=Emily Dickinson School website, Bozeman, Montana |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002033911/http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml|archivedate=October 2, 2007}}</ref>[[Redmond, Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |title=The Real Emily Dickinson |publisher=Emily Dickinson Elementary School website, Redmond, Washington |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094624/http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}</ref> and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/03/M075/default.htm|title=Find a School|website=Schools.nyc.gov|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> A few literary journals\u2014including ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'', the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society\u2014have been founded to examine her work.<ref name=\"journal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/ |title=The Emily Dickinson Journal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press website, Baltimore |accessdate=December 18, 2007}}</ref> An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson was issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] on August 28, 1971 as the second stamp in the \"American Poet\" series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |title=Emily Dickinson commemorative stamps and ephemera |publisher=Harvard University Library |accessdate=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712192306/http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |archive-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dickinson was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1973.<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/emily-dickinson/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Emily Dickinson]</ref> A one-woman play titled ''[[The Belle of Amherst]]'' appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.<ref>\"[http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 Belle of Amherst] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011951/http://emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 |date=November 24, 2010 }}\".

After studying at the [[Amherst College#Amherst Academy|Amherst Academy]] for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] before returning to her family's house in Amherst.\n\nEvidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/emily-dickinson-9274190|title=Emily Dickinson biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography.com |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile Dickinson was a prolific poet, only 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emily Dickinson Museum indicates only one letter and ten poems were published before her death|url=https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|website=Emilydickinson,useum.org|accessdate=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807012709/http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|archive-date=August 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique to her era. They contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use [[Half rhyme|slant rhyme]] as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.<ref name=\"Mc2\">McNeil (1986), 2.</ref> Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\n\nAlthough Dickinson's acquaintances were likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\u2014that the breadth of her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] and [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], though both heavily edited the content. A 1998 ''[[New York Times]]'' article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name \"Susan\" was often deliberately removed. At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to sister-in-law [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson]], though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/magazine/beethoven-s-hair-tells-all.html|title=Beethoven's Hair Tells All!|website=The New York Times|date=November 29, 1998}}</ref> A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H.

On an extended visit to Monson when she was two, Emily's Aunt Lavinia described Emily as \"perfectly well & contented\u2014She is a very good child & but little trouble.\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 324.</ref> Emily's aunt also noted the girl's affinity for music and her particular talent for the piano, which she called \"the ''moosic''\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 85.</ref>\n\nDickinson attended primary school in a two-story building on Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Sew337\" /> Her education was \"ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl\".<ref>Farr (2005), 1.</ref> Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to \"keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned\".<ref>Sewall (1974), 335.</ref> While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests that her mother was regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she \"always ran Home to Awe [Austin] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none.\"<ref>Wolff (1986), 45.</ref>\n\nOn September 7, 1840, Dickinson and her sister Lavinia started together at Amherst Academy, a former boys' school that had opened to female students just two years earlier.<ref name=\"Sew337\">Sewall (1974), 337.</ref> At about the same time, her father purchased a house on North Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Hab129\">Habegger (2001), 129.</ref> Emily's brother Austin later described this large new home as the \"mansion\" over which he and Emily presided as \"lord and lady\" while their parents were absent.<ref>Sewall (1974) 322.</ref> The house overlooked Amherst's burial ground, described by one local minister as treeless and \"forbidding\".<ref name=\"Hab129\" />\n\n=== Teenage years ===\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=30%|quote=\n<poem>\nThey shut me up in Prose&nbsp;\u2013\nAs when a little Girl\nThey put me in the Closet&nbsp;\u2013\nBecause they liked me \"still\"&nbsp;\u2013\n\nStill!

When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from [[typhus]] and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized.<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that \"it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 172.</ref> She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in [[Boston]] to recover.<ref name=\"wolff77\">Wolff (1986), 77.</ref> With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies.<ref>Ford (1966), 55.</ref> During this period, she met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Huntington Gilbert]] (who later married Emily's brother Austin).\n\nIn 1845, a [[Second Great Awakening|religious revival]] took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers.<ref name=\"ford47to48\">Ford (1966), 47\u201348.</ref> Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: \"I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my Savior.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\">Habegger (2001), 168.</ref> She went on to say it was her \"greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\" /> The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years.<ref>Ford (1966), 37.</ref> After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: \"Some keep the Sabbath going to Church&nbsp;\u2013 / I keep it, staying at Home\".<ref>Johnson (1960), 153.</ref>\n\nDuring the last year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending [[Mary Lyon]]'s [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] (which later became [[Mount Holyoke College]]) in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) from Amherst.<ref>Ford (1966), 46.</ref> She stayed at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there.<ref>Sewall (1974), 368.</ref> The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick.<ref>Sewall (1974), 358.</ref> Whatever the reasons for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to \"bring [her] home at all events\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 211.</ref> Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities.<ref name=\"Pic19\">Pickard (1967), 19.</ref> She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.<ref>Habegger (2001), 213.</ref>\n\n=== Early influences and writing ===\nWhen she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester&nbsp;\u2013 in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 216.</ref> Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.<ref>Sewall (1974), 401.</ref>\n\nNewton likely introduced her to the writings of [[William Wordsworth]], and his gift to her of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\".<ref name=\"Hab221\">Habegger (2001), 221.</ref> Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of [[tuberculosis]], he wrote to her, saying he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.<ref name=\"Hab221\" /> Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862\u2014\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality&nbsp;\u2013 but venturing too near, himself&nbsp;\u2013 he never returned\"\u2014refers to Newton.<ref>Habegger (2001), 218.</ref>\n\nDickinson was familiar not only with the [[Bible]] but also with contemporary popular literature.<ref>Knapp (1989), 59.</ref> She was probably influenced by [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s ''Letters from New York'', another gift from Newton<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> (after reading it, she gushed \"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\"<ref name=\"Ford18\">Ford (1966), 18.</ref>). Her brother smuggled a copy of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[Kavanagh (novel)|Kavanagh]]'' into the house for her (because her father might disapprove)<ref>Sewall (1974), 683.</ref> and a friend lent her [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in late 1849.<ref name=\"Hab226\">Habegger (2001), 226.</ref> ''Jane Eyre''{{'}}s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], she named him \"Carlo\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog.<ref name=\"Hab226\" /> [[William Shakespeare]] was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \"Why clasp any hand but this?\" and to another, \"Why is any other book needed?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 700\u2013701.</ref>\n\n=== Adulthood and seclusion ===\nIn early 1850, Dickinson wrote that \"Amherst is alive with fun this winter&nbsp;... Oh, a very great town this is!\"<ref name=\"Pic19\" /> Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of \"brain congestion\" at age 25.<ref>Sewall (1974), 340.</ref> Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:<blockquote>some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping&nbsp;\u2013 sleeping the churchyard sleep&nbsp;\u2013 the hour of evening is sad&nbsp;\u2013 it was once my study hour&nbsp;\u2013 my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school ''alone'', make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.<ref>Sewall (1974), 341.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Homestead, Amherst, Massachusetts (from left).JPG|thumb|left|The Evergreens, built by Edward Dickinson, was the home of Austin and Susan's family.]]\nDuring the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Gilbert]]. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of \"most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser\" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed.<ref>Martin (2002), 53.</ref> In an 1882 letter to Susan, Emily said, \"With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living.\"\n\nThe importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife.<ref>Pickard (1967), 21.</ref> However, the notion of a \"cruel\" Susan\u2014as promoted by her romantic rival\u2014has been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close.<ref>Longenbach, James. (June 16, 2010.) \"[http://www.thenation.com/article/ardor-and-abyss?page=full Ardor and the Abyss]\". ''The Nation''. Retrieved June 29, 2010.</ref> Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'' Lena Koski wrote, \"Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings.\"<ref>Koski (1996), 26-31.</ref> She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, \"Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me&nbsp;... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you\u2014that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast&nbsp;... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language.\" The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film ''[[Wild Nights with Emily]]'' and explored in the TV series ''[[Dickinson (TV series)|Dickinson]]''.\n\nSue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it [[Emily Dickinson Museum#The Evergreens|the Evergreens]], a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead.<ref>Habegger (2001), 338.</ref>\n\nUntil 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home.<ref>Sewall (1974), 444.</ref> First, they spent three weeks in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where her father was representing [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district|Massachusetts]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret \u00d3 Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that the Dickinsons brought in a permanent household servant, [[Margaret Maher]], to replace their former maid-of-all-work.<ref>Habegger (2001), 502; Murray (1996) 287; Murray (1999) 724-725.</ref> Emily once again was responsible for the kitchen, including cooking and cleaning up, as well as the baking at which she excelled.<ref>86.

She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face.<ref>Habegger (2001), 517.</ref> She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878\u20131882.<ref name=\"Hab516\">Habegger (2001), 516.</ref> Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person.<ref>Habegger (2001), 540.</ref> Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders.<ref>Habegger (2001), 548.</ref> Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 541.</ref> Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that \"Aunt Emily stood for ''indulgence.''\"<ref name=\"Hab547\">Habegger (2001), 547.</ref> MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called \"A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson\", thought of her as always offering support{{clarify|date=March 2019}} to the neighborhood children.<ref name=\"Hab547\" />\n\nWhen Higginson urged her to come to Boston in 1868 so they could formally meet for the first time, she declined, writing: \"Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 521.</ref> It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as \"a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair&nbsp;... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqu\u00e9 & a blue net worsted shawl.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 523.</ref> He also felt that he never was \"with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 524.</ref>\n\n=== Posies and poesies ===\nScholar Judith Farr notes that Dickinson, during her lifetime, \"was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, than as a poet\".<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> Dickinson studied botany from the age of nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> During her lifetime, she assembled a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound [[herbarium]]. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] system.<ref>Habegger (2001), 154.</ref> The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/science/emily-dickinson-lost-gardens.html|title=The Lost Gardens of Emily Dickinson|date=May 17, 2016|website=The New York Times}}</ref> Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered \"carpets of [[Lily of the Valley|lily-of-the-valley]] and [[Pansy|pansies]], platoons of [[Sweet pea|sweetpeas]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinths]], enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were ribbons of [[peony]] hedges and drifts of [[Narcissus (genus)|daffodils]] in season, [[Calendula|marigolds]] to distraction\u2014a butterfly utopia\".<ref name=\"Parker\">Parker, G9.</ref> In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she \"could inhabit the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Isles]] merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets\". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but \"they valued the posy more than the poetry\".<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nOn June 16, 1874, while in Boston, Edward Dickinson suffered a stroke and died. When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28.<ref>Habegger (2001), 562.</ref> She wrote to Higginson that her father's \"Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 566.</ref> A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral [[paralysis]] and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that \"Home is so far from Home\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 569.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=25%|quote=\n<poem>\nThough the great Waters sleep,\nThat they are still the Deep,\nWe cannot doubt&nbsp;\u2013\nNo vacillating God\nIgnited this Abode\nTo put it out&nbsp;\u2013\n</poem>|source=Emily Dickinson, c. 1884<ref>Johnson (1960), 661.</ref>}}\n[[Otis Phillips Lord]], an elderly judge on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] from [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], in 1872 or 1873 became an acquaintance of Dickinson's.

In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's ''Complete Concordance to Shakespeare'' (1877).<ref>Sewall (1974), 651.</ref> Dickinson wrote that \"While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 652.</ref> She referred to him as \"My lovely Salem\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 592; Sewall (1974), 653.</ref> and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that \"Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 591.</ref>\n\nAfter being critically ill for several years, Judge Lord died in March 1884. Dickinson referred to him as \"our latest Lost\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 597.</ref> Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson's \"Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\", Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.\n\n=== Decline and death ===\nAlthough she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 604.</ref> Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.\n\n[[File:EmilyDickinsonGrave-color.jpg|thumb|left|Emily Dickinson's tombstone in the family plot]]\nThe 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as \"a lady whom the people call the ''Myth''\".<ref>Walsh (1971), 26.</ref> Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief.<ref>Habegger (2001), 612.</ref> Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote \"We were never intimate&nbsp;... while she was our Mother&nbsp;\u2013 but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 607.</ref> The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert\u2014Emily's favorite\u2014died of [[typhoid fever]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 615.</ref>\n\nAs death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote,  \"The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 623.</ref> That summer she had seen \"a great darkness coming\" and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston.<ref>Habegger (2001), 625.</ref> She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: \"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily\".<ref>Wolff (1986), 534.</ref> On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that \"the day was awful&nbsp;... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six.\"<ref name=\"Hab627\">Habegger (2001), 627.</ref> Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as [[Bright's disease]] and its duration as two and a half years.<ref>Habegger (2001), 622.</ref>\n\nLavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Emily's body upon her death. Susan also wrote Emily's obituary for the ''Springfield Republican'', ending it with four lines from one of Emily's poems: \"Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose.\" Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Sue should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly.<ref>Nell Smith (1998), 265.</ref> Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with [[Heliotropium arborescens|vanilla-scented heliotrope]], a [[lady's slipper]] [[Orchidaceae|orchid]], and a \"knot of blue field [[Viola (plant)|violets]]\" placed about it.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\">Wolff (1986), 535.</ref> The funeral service, held in the Homestead's library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", a poem by [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] that had been a favorite of Dickinson's.<ref name=\"Hab627\" /> At Dickinson's request, her \"coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups\" for burial in the family plot at [[Amherst West Cemetery|West Cemetery]] on Triangle Street.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\">Farr (2005), 3\u20136.</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\nDespite Dickinson's prolific writing, fewer than a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's ''Complete Poems'' in 1955,<ref>Ford (1966), 122</ref> Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n[[File:Emilyrepublican.jpg|thumb|right|\"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013,\" titled \"The Sleeping,\" as it was published in the ''Springfield Republican'' in 1862.]]\nA few of Dickinson's poems appeared in [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles']] ''Springfield Republican'' between 1858 and 1868.

It was the last poem published during Dickinson's lifetime.\n\n=== Posthumous ===\nAfter Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest.<ref name=\"Farr3\">Farr (1996), 3.</ref> Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published.<ref>Pickard (1967), xv.</ref> She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.<ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\" /> A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.<ref>Wolff (1986), 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Poems.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Poems'', published in 1890]]\nThe first volume of Dickinson's ''Poems,'' edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890.<ref name=\"Wol537\">Wolff (1986), 537.</ref> Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity.<ref>McNeil (1986), 34; Blake (1964), 42.</ref> The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years.<ref name=\"Wol537\" /> ''Poems: Second Series'' followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: \"The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published\".<ref>Buckingham (1989), 194.</ref>\n\nNearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson's poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;243</ref> Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.<ref>Mitchell (2009), p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n\nThe first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a complete new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson's [[variorum]] brought all of Dickinson's known poems together for the first time.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;122</ref> Johnson's goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts.<ref name=\"Martin\">Martin (2002), 17.</ref> They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely [[wikt:elliptical|elliptical]] in their language.<ref>McNeil (1986), 35.</ref> Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson's letters, also presented in three volumes.\n\nIn 1981, ''The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson'' was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.\n\nDickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in ''My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson'' (2001) that \"The consequences of the poet's failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 628.</ref>\n\n== Poetry ==\n{{Main|List of Emily Dickinson poems}}\n\nDickinson's poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.\n* '''Pre-1861'''. These are often conventional and [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimental]] in nature.<ref>Ford (1966), 68.</ref> Thomas H. Johnson, who later published ''The Poems of Emily Dickinson'', was able to date only five of Dickinson's poems before 1858.<ref name=\"Pic20\">Pickard (1967), 20.</ref> Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, one of which is about missing her brother Austin. The fifth poem, which begins \"I have a Bird in spring\", conveys her grief over the feared loss of friendship and was sent to her friend Sue Gilbert.<ref name=\"Pic20\" />\n* '''1861\u20131865'''. This was her most creative period\u2014these poems represent her most vigorous and creative work. Johnson estimated that she composed 86 poems in 1861, 366 in 1862, 141 in 1863, and 174 in 1864. He also believed that during this period, she fully developed her themes of life and mortality.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\">Johnson (1960), viii.</ref>\n* '''Post-1866'''. It is estimated that two-thirds of the entire body of her poetry was written before this year.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\" />\n\n=== Structure and syntax ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson \"Wild nights\" manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|Dickinson's handwritten manuscript of her poem \"Wild Nights&nbsp;\u2013 Wild Nights!\"]]\nThe extensive use of [[dash]]es and unconventional [[capitalization]] in Dickinson's manuscripts, and the [[idiosyncratic]] vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is \"far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed\".<ref name=\"Mc2\" /><ref name=\"Hecht153\">Hecht (1996), 153\u2013155.</ref> Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the [[ballad stanza]], a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of [[half rhyme|slant rhyme]].<ref name=\"For63\">Ford (1966), 63.</ref> In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four, while only using tetrameter for line three.\n\nSince many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the [[common meter]], employing alternating lines of [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 186.</ref> Familiar examples of such songs are \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" and \"[[Amazing Grace]]'\".\n\nDickinson scholar and poet [[Anthony Hecht]] finds resonances in Dickinson's poetry not only with hymns and song-forms but also with [[psalms]] and [[riddle]]s, citing the following example: \"Who is the East?&nbsp;/ The Yellow Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Purple if he can&nbsp;/ That carries in the Sun.&nbsp;/ Who is the West?&nbsp;/ The Purple Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Yellow if He can&nbsp;/ That lets Him out again.\"<ref name=\"Hecht153\" />\n\nLate 20th-century scholars are \"deeply interested\" by Dickinson's highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks).<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime&nbsp;\u2013 \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\", published as \"The Snake\" in the ''Republican''&nbsp;\u2013 Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:20em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not<br />\nHis notice sudden is&nbsp;\u2013\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<ref name=\"For32\">Ford (1966), 32.</ref><br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not,<br />\nHis notice sudden is.\n|\n|}\n\nAs Farr points out, \"snakes instantly notice you\"; Dickinson's version captures the \"breathless immediacy\" of the encounter; and ''The Republican''{{'}}s punctuation renders \"her lines more commonplace\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson's structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are \"aesthetically based\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page.<ref>Crumbley (1997), 14.</ref> Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n=== Major themes ===\nDickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]].<ref>Bloom (1998), 18.</ref> However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's \"relentlessly measuring mind&nbsp;... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental\".<ref>Farr (1996), 13.</ref> Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, [[irony]] and [[satire]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 171.</ref>\n\n'''Flowers and gardens''': Farr notes that Dickinson's \"poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers\" and that allusions to gardens often refer to an \"imaginative realm&nbsp;... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\">Farr (2005), 1\u20137.</ref> She associates some flowers, like [[gentian]]s and [[anemone]]s, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and [[nosegay]]s.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Farr notes that one of Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to \"conflate her poetry itself with the posies\": \"My nosegays are for Captives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Dim&nbsp;\u2013 long expectant eyes&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Fingers denied the plucking,&nbsp;/ Patient till Paradise&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To such, if they sh'd whisper&nbsp;/ Of morning and the moor&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ They bear no other errand,&nbsp;/ And I, no other prayer\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" />\n\n'''The Master poems''': Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to \"Signor\", \"Sir\" and \"Master\", who is characterized as Dickinson's \"lover for all eternity\".<ref name=\"Farr7\">Farr (1996), 7\u20138.</ref> These confessional poems are often \"searing in their self-inquiry\" and \"harrowing to the reader\" and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson's day.<ref name=\"Farr7\" /> The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals but this view is frequently rejected by scholars. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, \"human, with specific characteristics, but godlike\" and speculates that Master may be a \"kind of Christian muse\".<ref name=\"Farr7\" />\n\n'''Morbidity''': Dickinson's poems reflect her \"early and lifelong fascination\" with illness, dying and death.<ref name=\"Pollak62\">Pollak (1996), 62\u201365.</ref> Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: \"crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> She reserved her sharpest insights into the \"death blow aimed by God\" and the \"funeral in the brain\", often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar Vivian Pollak considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson's \"thirsting-starving persona\", an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail.<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> Dickinson's most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at \"the interface of murder and suicide\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" />\n\n'''Gospel poems''': Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him.<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\">Oberhaus (1996), 105\u2013119</ref> She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with \"wit and American colloquial language\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the \"salient feature uniting Christian poets&nbsp;... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ\" and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the \"poetic tradition of Christian devotion\" alongside [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]].<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: \"The Savior must have been&nbsp;/ A docile Gentleman&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To come so far so cold a Day&nbsp;/ For little Fellowmen&nbsp;/ The Road to Bethlehem&nbsp;/ Since He and I were Boys&nbsp;/ Was leveled, but for that twould be&nbsp;/ A rugged billion Miles&nbsp;\u2013\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" />\n\n'''The Undiscovered Continent''': Academic Suzanne Juhasz considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\">Juhasz (1996), 130\u2013140.</ref> Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the \"undiscovered continent\" and the \"landscape of the spirit\" and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding\u2014castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms\u2014to create a dwelling place of \"oneself\" where one resides with one's other selves.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" /> An example that brings together many of these ideas is: \"Me from Myself&nbsp;\u2013 to banish&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Had I Art&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Impregnable my Fortress&nbsp;/ Unto All Heart&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ But since myself\u2014assault Me&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ How have I peace&nbsp;/ Except by subjugating&nbsp;/ Consciousness.&nbsp;/ And since We're mutual Monarch&nbsp;/ How this be&nbsp;/ Except by Abdication&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Me&nbsp;\u2013 of Me?\".<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" />\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson\u00b4s (1830-1886) manuscript of \"A route of evanescence\" (1880).jpg|thumb|left|Dickinson wrote and sent this poem (\"A Route of Evanescence\") to Thomas Higginson in 1880.]]\nThe surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson's poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from [[William Dean Howells]], an editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality \"is that of extraordinary grasp and insight\",<ref>Blake (1964), 12.</ref> albeit \"without the proper control and chastening\" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred.<ref>Wolff (1986), 175.</ref> His judgment that her opus was \"incomplete and unsatisfactory\" would be echoed in the essays of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Maurice Thompson]], who was literary editor of ''The Independent'' for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had \"a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality\".<ref>Blake (1964), 28.</ref> Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. [[Andrew Lang]], a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that \"if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much\".<ref>Blake (1964), 37.</ref> [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in January 1892: \"It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and [[grotesque]] fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of [[William Blake|Blake]], and strongly influenced by the mannerism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]&nbsp;... But the incoherence and formlessness of her&nbsp;\u2014 versicles are fatal&nbsp;... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar\".<ref>Blake (1964), 55.</ref>\n\nCritical attention to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s.<ref>Blake (1964), vi.</ref> By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially [[modernism|modern]]. Rather than seeing Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic.<ref>Wells (1929), 243\u2013259.</ref> In a 1915 essay, [[Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant]] called the poet's inspiration \"daring\" and named her \"one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore\".<ref>Blake (1964), 89.</ref> With the growing popularity of [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poetry]] in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a [[cult following]] began to form.<ref>Blake (1964), 202.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, a number of the New Critics&nbsp;\u2013 among them [[R. P. Blackmur]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Yvor Winters]]&nbsp;\u2013 appraised the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenb\u00fcchle pointed out, their \"affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship\".<ref>Grabher (1998), 358\u2013359.</ref> Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: \"...&nbsp;she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of [[antimacassar]]s&nbsp;... She came&nbsp;... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 223.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of [[feminism]] created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 1.</ref> Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book ''This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson'', \"Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman.\" Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 9.</ref> [[Adrienne Rich]] theorized in ''Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson'' (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: \"[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed&nbsp;... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time&nbsp;... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics.\"<ref>Juhasz (1983), 10.</ref>\n\nSome scholars question the poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry.<ref>Martin (2002), 58</ref> Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and [[Martha Nell Smith]] have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.<ref>Comment (2001), 167.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as ''Emily Dickinson Face to Face'' and ''Letters of Emily Dickinson'', which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.<ref>Grabher (1998), p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nEmily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture.<ref>Martin (2002), 1.</ref> Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet.<ref>Martin (2002), 2.</ref> As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that \"If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 24.</ref> Critic [[Harold Bloom]] has placed her alongside [[Walt Whitman]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Robert Frost]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Hart Crane]] as a major American poet,<ref name=\"Bloo9\">Bloom (1999), 9</ref> and [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|in 1994]] listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.<ref>Bloom (1994), 226</ref>\n\nDickinson is taught in [[American literature]] and [[Poetry of the United States|poetry]] classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as text for art songs by composers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Nick Peros]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[Michael Tilson Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_author_texts.html?AuthorId=697 |title=Vocal music set to texts by Emily Dickinson |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |accessdate=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in [[Bozeman, Montana]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml |title=Mission Statement|publisher=Emily Dickinson School website, Bozeman, Montana |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002033911/http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml|archivedate=October 2, 2007}}</ref>[[Redmond, Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |title=The Real Emily Dickinson |publisher=Emily Dickinson Elementary School website, Redmond, Washington |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094624/http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}</ref> and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/03/M075/default.htm|title=Find a School|website=Schools.nyc.gov|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> A few literary journals\u2014including ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'', the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society\u2014have been founded to examine her work.<ref name=\"journal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/ |title=The Emily Dickinson Journal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press website, Baltimore |accessdate=December 18, 2007}}</ref> An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson was issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] on August 28, 1971 as the second stamp in the \"American Poet\" series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |title=Emily Dickinson commemorative stamps and ephemera |publisher=Harvard University Library |accessdate=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712192306/http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |archive-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dickinson was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1973.<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/emily-dickinson/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Emily Dickinson]</ref> A one-woman play titled ''[[The Belle of Amherst]]'' appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.<ref>\"[http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 Belle of Amherst] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011951/http://emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 |date=November 24, 2010 }}\".

The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics has led to negative [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[deformities]], blindness, and even death through the ages. Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin. Tremella fuciformis is also known in Chinese medicine for nourishing the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reshetnikov SV, Wasser SP, Duckman I, Tsukor K |title=Medicinal value of the genus ''Tremella'' Pers.

''The History of Make-up''. First ed. Great Britain: The Macmillan Company, 1970. 41\u201342. Print.</ref>\n\nCosmetic use was frowned upon at many points in Western history. For example, in the 19th century, [[Queen Victoria]] publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors.<ref>{{cite book | title = Lipstick: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Cosmetic | first = J | last = Pallingston | isbn = 978-0-312-19914-2 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1998}}</ref>\n\nMany women in the 19th century liked to be thought of as fragile ladies. They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

The market was developed in the US during the 1910s by [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on.

Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks. Makeup can empower women in many ways. \n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics.

Beauty advisers can be certified by an Anti-Aging Beauty Institute.\n\nA [[Cosmetology|cosmetician]] is a professional who provides facial and body treatments for clients. The term [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]] is sometimes used interchangeably with this term, but the former most commonly refers to a certified professional. A freelance [[makeup artist]] provides clients with beauty advice and cosmetics assistance. They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry. The most successful beauty influencers such as Jeffree Star, James Charles, and Jaclyn Hill, go on to create their own makeup brands or collaborate with other major brands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Airbrush makeup]]\n* [[Baking (make-up)|Baking]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Cosmeceutical]]\n* [[Cosmetic packaging]]\n* [[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)]]\n* [[Female cosmetic coalitions]]\n* [[Henna]]\n* [[List of cosmetic ingredients]]\n* [[Male cosmetics]]\n* [[Maker culture]]\n* [[Moulage]]\n* [[Natural skin care]]\n* [[Permanent makeup]]\n* [[Skin care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Winter|first=Ruth|title=A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Complete Information About the Harmful and Desirable Ingredients in Cosmetics (Paperback)|origyear=2005|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=US|isbn=978-1-4000-5233-2|year=2005}}\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Cosmetics | b=no | n=no | q=Cosmetics | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n{{Cosmetics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmetics| ]]\n[[Category:Skin care]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Substances applied to the body to change its appearance or fragrance}}\n{{About|substances also known as \"make-up\" in English||Cosmetic (disambiguation){{!}}Cosmetic}}\n{{Redirect|Make-up}}\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Toilette|Toilet}}\n{{Tone|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Cosmetics.JPG|thumb|Assorted cosmetics and tools]]\n[[File:Makeup .jpg|thumb|Woman wearing several forms of cosmetics, including [[lipstick]], [[eye liner]], [[eye shadow]], [[Hair coloring|hair dye]], [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]], and [[mascara]].]]\n[[File:Self make up by an artist.jpg|thumb|An actor preparing for a stage performance.

The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics has led to negative [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[deformities]], blindness, and even death through the ages. Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin.

They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on.

They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

This regulation applies to single-person companies making or importing just one product as well as to large multinationals. Manufacturers and importers of cosmetic products must comply with the applicable regulations in order to sell their products in the EU. In this industry, it is common fall back on a suitably qualified person, such as an independent third party inspection and testing company, to verify the cosmetics\u2019 compliance with the requirements of applicable cosmetic regulations and other relevant legislation, including [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]], [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substances]], etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/product-safety/cosmetic-products-safety-regulations-2008-as-amended|title=Product safety for manufacturers|work=bis.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, the circulation of cosmetic products and their safety has been a subject of legislation since 1976. One of the newest improvement of the regulation concerning cosmetic industry is a result of the ban [[animal testing]]. Testing cosmetic products on animals has been illegal in the European Union since September 2004, and testing the separate ingredients of such products on animals is also prohibited by law, since March 2009 for some endpoints and full since 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/sectors/cosmetics/animal-testing/index_en.htm|title=Regulatory context|date=|accessdate= 2010-08-04|publisher=ec.europa.eu}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic regulations in Europe are often updated to follow the trends of innovations and new technologies while ensuring [[safety standards|product safety]]. For instance, all annexes of the Regulation 1223/2009 were aimed to address potential risks to human [[health]].\nUnder the EU cosmetic regulation, manufacturers, retailers, and importers of cosmetics in Europe will be designated as \"Responsible Person\".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0059:0209:en:PDF \"EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009\"], European Parliament & Council, 30 November 2009, Retrieved 7 April 2015</ref> This new status implies that the responsible person has the legal [[Legal liability|liability]] to ensure that the cosmetics and [[brand]]s they manufacture or sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms. The responsible person is also responsible of the documents contained in the Product Information File (PIF), a list of product information including data such as Cosmetic Product Safety Report, product description, [[GMP statement]], or product function.\n\n=== United States ===\nIn 1938, the U.S. passed the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] authorizing the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to oversee safety via legislation in the cosmetic industry and its aspects in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/default.htm|title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)|work=fda.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/ucm132818.htm|title = The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|date = |accessdate = 22 April 2015|website = }}</ref> The FDA joined with 13 other federal agencies in forming the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) in 1997, which is an attempt to ban animal testing and find other methods to test cosmetic products.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal Testing & Cosmetics|url=https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/scienceresearch/producttesting/ucm072268.htm|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Brazil ===\n\nANVISA (Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Vigil\u00e2ncia Sanit\u00e1ria, ''Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency'') is the regulatory body responsible for cosmetic legislation and [[:wikt:directive|directives]] in the country. The rules apply to manufacturers, importers, and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire [[Mercosur]].\n\nThe current legislation restricts the use of certain substances such as pyrogallol, [[formaldehyde]], or paraformaldehyde and bans the use of others such as lead [[acetate]] in cosmetic products. All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics. They explain new products and \"gifts with purchase\" arrangements (free items given out upon purchase of cosmetics items costing over some set amount).\n\nA beauty adviser provides product advice based on the client's skin care and makeup requirements. Beauty advisers can be certified by an Anti-Aging Beauty Institute.\n\nA [[Cosmetology|cosmetician]] is a professional who provides facial and body treatments for clients. The term [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]] is sometimes used interchangeably with this term, but the former most commonly refers to a certified professional. A freelance [[makeup artist]] provides clients with beauty advice and cosmetics assistance. They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry. The most successful beauty influencers such as Jeffree Star, James Charles, and Jaclyn Hill, go on to create their own makeup brands or collaborate with other major brands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Airbrush makeup]]\n* [[Baking (make-up)|Baking]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Cosmeceutical]]\n* [[Cosmetic packaging]]\n* [[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)]]\n* [[Female cosmetic coalitions]]\n* [[Henna]]\n* [[List of cosmetic ingredients]]\n* [[Male cosmetics]]\n* [[Maker culture]]\n* [[Moulage]]\n* [[Natural skin care]]\n* [[Permanent makeup]]\n* [[Skin care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Winter|first=Ruth|title=A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Complete Information About the Harmful and Desirable Ingredients in Cosmetics (Paperback)|origyear=2005|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=US|isbn=978-1-4000-5233-2|year=2005}}\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Cosmetics | b=no | n=no | q=Cosmetics | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n{{Cosmetics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmetics| ]]\n[[Category:Skin care]]\n", "name_user": "Madhabilata singha roy", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(added a line)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"}
