The criteria for selection involved finding somewhere remote with a good water supply, but within reach of good transport links and a university with a [[nuclear physics]] laboratory. This more or less limited the choice to the areas around [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]]. It had been decided that an RAF airfield would be chosen, the aircraft hangars being ideal to house the large atomic piles that would need to be built. Although Cambridge University had the better [[nuclear physics]] facility (the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]), the RAF did not want to abandon any of its eastern airfields because of its potential involvement in the [[Cold War]], therefore Harwell was chosen when the RAF made the airfield available. [[RAF Harwell]] was sixteen miles south of [[Oxford]] near [[Didcot]] and [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]] (at this time in Berkshire), and on 1 January 1946 the Atomic Energy Research Establishment was formed, coming under the [[Ministry of Supply]]. The scientists mostly took over both accommodations and work buildings from the departing [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].\n\nThe early laboratory had several specialist divisions: Chemistry (initially headed by [[Egon Bretscher]], later by Robert Spence), General Physics (H.W.B. Skinner), Nuclear Physics (initially headed by [[Otto Frisch]], later E. Bretscher), Reactor Physics (John Dunworth), Theoretical Physics ([[Klaus Fuchs]], later [[Brian Flowers]] and [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]]), Isotopes (Henry Seligmann), Engineering (Harold Tongue, later Robert Jackson), Chemical Engineering (A.S. White), and Metallurgy (Bruce Chalmers, later [[Monty Finniston]], FRS). Finniston was later to become chairman of the British Steel Corporation. Directors after Cockcroft included [[Basil Schonland]], Sir [[Arthur Vick]] and [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]].\n\n[[File:Aere harwell main gate.jpg|thumb|AERE main gate]]\nThe decision to site AERE at Harwell had huge implications for a rural area which had depended mainly on agriculture for employment before World War II. The site (which quickly became known colloquially amongst the local population as 'The Atomic') became one of the main employers in the post-war period. It also led to an influx of labour from outside the area, putting pressure on already scarce housing stocks. In response to the problem, hostels and temporary housing were established around the site. The hostels were named Icknield Way House ('B' mess, the RAF sergeants' mess), Portway House ('C' Mess, the RAF airmans' mess) and Ridgeway House ('A' Mess, the officers' mess) provided either single or double room accommodation for staff and were adopted from existing RAF structures on the site. The class distinction was maintained by the UKAEA. A-Mess housed visiting scientists, B-Mess scientific support staff and some post-graduate scientists, and C-Mess industrial support staff. The temporary housing stock consisted of several hundred '[[Prefabricated building|Prefabs]]', single storey structures manufactured in parts for quick erection, which were designed originally to help alleviate chronic housing shortages in the immediate post-war period in Britain. Two estates of 'Prefabs' were built to the north and south of the site perimeter, along with a road system and parade of shops. In later years, conventional housing was provided on estates built in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Grove, Oxfordshire|Grove]] (near [[Wantage]]) and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] for employees. A modern hostel (Rush Common House) was built in Abingdon. The houses were later sold (mainly to their occupants) in the 1980s and the hostels were demolished or adapted for other uses. The 'Prefab' estates lasted until the early 1990s when the residents were transferred to local authority housing. The RAF prewar NCO married quarter housing at Harwell together other UKAEA housing in Abingdon, Grove, Wantage and Newbury totaling 129 houses were sold in their entirety to the Welbeck Estate Group in 1995 and following extensive refurbishment were sold to local buyers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWorkers were bussed to the site from as far away as Reading in utilitarian grey buses marked 'AERE'.\n\n==Early reactors==\n{{main|DIDO (nuclear reactor)|GLEEP|PLUTO reactor}}\nSuch was the interest in nuclear power and the priority devoted to it in those days that the first reactor, [[GLEEP]], was operating by 15 August 1947. GLEEP (Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile) was a low-power (3 [[kilowatt]]) graphite-moderated air-cooled reactor. The first reactor in Western Europe, it operated until 1990.\n\nA successor to GLEEP, called [[BEPO]] (British Experimental Pile 0) was constructed based on the experience with GLEEP, and commenced operation in 1948. At 6MW, BEPO was much more powerful than GLEEP.<ref>[https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR-Innovative-way-to-plug-tubes-at-BEPO-1011145.html \"Innovative way to plug tubes at BEPO\"] ''WNN'', 10 Nov 2014</ref> The engineers at Harwell eventually decided that this small reactor should be put to some use, so the air that flowed over it was directed through an underground trench, where there were some pipes filled with water that connected to a secondary group of water-filled pipes that were used by the nearby establishments to heat offices.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=94qQag_j-FkC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=bepo+hot+air+british+affairs&source=bl&ots=C7RLtl_jYI&sig=ACfU3U2GF1MtR_oucp7rR6QobC91KkvOjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAz5Pcm9jnAhWFqHEKHXScAQoQ6AEwAHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=bepo%20hot%20air%20british%20affairs&f=false \"Graphite Pile in Britain\"] ''British Afairs'', Vol. III, NO. 1, March 1959 pp. 44</ref> This was the first use of nuclear district heating in the UK. BEPO was shut down in 1968.\n\n[[LIDO reactor|LIDO]] was an [[enriched uranium]] thermal swimming pool reactor which operated from 1956 to 1972 and was mainly used for shielding and nuclear physics experiments. It was fully dismantled and returned to a green field site in 1995. In the same building as LIDO, DAPHNE (Dido And Pluto Handmaiden for Nuclear Experiments) was constructed to test equipment used in experiments on the two larger reactors.\n\nA pair of larger 26 [[megawatt|MW]] reactors, [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] and [[PLUTO reactor|PLUTO]], which used enriched [[uranium]] with a [[heavy water]] [[neutron moderator|moderator]] came online in 1956 and 1957 respectively. These reactors were used primarily for testing the behaviour of different materials under intense [[neutron]] irradiation to help decide what materials to build reactor components out of. A sample could be irradiated for a few months to simulate the radiation dose that it would receive over the lifetime of a power reactor. Both reactors were also used for neutron scattering crystallography. They took over commercial [[isotope]] production from BEPO after that was shut down.  DIDO and PLUTO themselves were shut down in 1990 and the fuel, moderator and some ancillary buildings removed.  The GLEEP reactor and the hangar it was situated in were decommissioned 2005. The current plans are to decommission the BEPO, DIDO and PLUTO reactors by 2020.\n\n==Zeta==\nOne of the most significant experiments to occur at AERE was the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] [[fusion power]] experiment. An early attempt to build a large-scale nuclear fusion reactor, the project was started in 1954, and the first successes were achieved in 1957. In 1968 the project was shut down, as it was believed that no further progress could be made with the kind of design that ZETA represented (see [[Timeline of nuclear fusion]]).\n\n==Organisational history==\nIn 1954 AERE was incorporated into the newly formed [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA). Harwell and other laboratories were to assume responsibility for atomic energy research and development. It was part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI).\n\nDuring the 1970s the slowdown of the British nuclear energy program resulted in a greatly reduced demand for the kind of work being done by the UKAEA. Pressures on government spending also reduced the funding available. Reluctant to merely disband a quality scientific research organisation, UKAEA was required to divert its research effort to the solving of scientific problems for industry by providing paid consultancy or services. For example, an Operations Research Group was set up at Harwell, and developed shipping fleet scheduling software that was used to provide a service to British and overseas shipping companies<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BAIlXPgcsHwC&lpg=PA268&ots=1aT_-RwA1c&dq=%22Route%20program%20sends%20profits%20sailing%20ahead%22&pg=PA268#v=onepage&f=false \"Route program sends profits sailing ahead\"], New Scientist 3 Feb 1972 p268</ref> and oil reservoir simulation software to help in the development of the UK's North Sea oil interests.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aNRaAAAAYAAJ&dq=harwell+oil+reservoir+simulator&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Atomic+Energy+Authority+Research \"Winning More Oil: Increasing Importance for Enhanced Oil Recovery\"] auth. Ray Dafter, pub. Financial Times Business Information Limited, 1981, p. 34</ref> UKAEA was ordered to operate on a [[Trading Fund]] basis, i.e. to account for itself financially as though it was a private corporation, while remaining fully government owned. After several years of transition, UKAEA was divided in the early 1990s. UKAEA retained ownership of all land and infrastructure and of all nuclear facilities, and of businesses directly related to nuclear power. The remainder was privatised as [[AEA Technology]] and floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Harwell Laboratory contained elements of both organisations, though the land and infrastructure was owned by UKAEA.\n\n[[File:Aere harwell national chemical landmark.jpg|thumb|right|Harwell Laboratory blue plaque]]\nThe name Atomic Energy Research Establishment was dropped at the same time, and the site became known as the ''Harwell International Business Centre''. The site incorporates the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] which is home to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (including the [[ISIS neutron source]] and [[Diamond Light Source]]). In 2006, the name [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] was introduced and management of the campus was passed to a Public / Private 50:50 Joint Venture partnership to take forward the management and redevelopment of the campus which has been re-branded as Harwell Oxford. In February 2009, part of the campus, the remaining nuclear licensed site, passed to the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] and is being decommissioned by Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL, from 2015 part of [[Magnox Ltd]]), on their behalf.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]]\n* [[Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment]]\n* [[Harwell CADET]], an early transistorised computer\n* [[Harwell Synchrocyclotron]], an early accelerator based in AERE Hangar 7\n* [[Joint European Torus|JET]] fusion reactor\n* [[List of nuclear reactors]]\n* [[WITCH (computer)]], an early [[Dekatron]]-based computer constructed at Harwell and donated to computer science in the late 1950s\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://harwellcampus.com/ Harwell Science and Innovation Campus website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20000915093227/http://research-sites.com/ Information about the RSRL site, present day]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040513171750/http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=1578&FT=yes Speech by Sir John Cockcroft]\n* [http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/appendices/nuclear-development-in-the-united-kingdom.aspx Nuclear Development in the UK]\n* [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|Nuclear Power in the UK]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031216103922/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/fusion/famous.asp Fusion experiments from the British Science Museum]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1946 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:History of Berkshire]]\n[[Category:History of Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Nuclear energy in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Nuclear research institutes in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Nuclear weapons infrastructure of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Research institutes in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Scientific organizations established in 1946]]\n[[Category:Vale of White Horse]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the Bangladeshi instutue|Atomic Energy Research Establishment (Bangladesh)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n{{Infobox laboratory\n| name             =  Atomic Energy Research Establishment\n| native_name      =\n| image            =\n| caption          =\n| latin_name       =\n| motto            =\n| established      =  {{start date|1946|01|01|df=y}}\n| type             =  <!--Research type (basic, applied, classified, unclassified, \u2026)-->\n| budget           =\n| debt             =\n| research_field   =\n| president        =\n| vice-president   =\n| dean             =\n| director         =  <!--or: | directors = -->\n| head_label       =\n| head             =\n| faculty          =\n| staff            =\n| students         =\n| alumni           =\n| address          =\n| city             = [[Didcot]]\n| state            = Oxfordshire\n| province         =\n| country          = United Kingdom\n| coor             = {{coord|51.581|-1.305|region:GB-OXF_type:landmark|display=title}}\n| zipcode          =\n| campus           =\n| free_label       =\n| free             =\n| affiliations     =\n| operating_agency =\n| nobel_laureates  =  <!--Number and/or names of Nobel laureates associated with the laboratory/institute-->\n| website          =  <!--{{URL|example.edu}}-->\n| logo             =\n| footnotes        =\n}}\n\nThe '''Atomic Energy Research Establishment''', known as '''AERE''' or colloquially '''Harwell Laboratory''', near [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], was the main [[Headquarters|centre]] for [[nuclear power|atomic energy]] [[research and development]] in the [[United Kingdom]] from the 1940s to the 1990s.\n\n==Founding==\nIn 1945 [[John Cockcroft]] was asked to set up a research laboratory to further the use of [[nuclear fission]] for both [[military]] purposes and generating energy.

It had been decided that an RAF airfield would be chosen, the aircraft hangars being ideal to house the large atomic piles that would need to be built. Although Cambridge University had the better [[nuclear physics]] facility (the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]), the RAF did not want to abandon any of its eastern airfields because of its potential involvement in the [[Cold War]], therefore Harwell was chosen when the RAF made the airfield available. [[RAF Harwell]] was sixteen miles south of [[Oxford]] near [[Didcot]] and [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]] (at this time in Berkshire), and on 1 January 1946 the Atomic Energy Research Establishment was formed, coming under the [[Ministry of Supply]]. The scientists mostly took over both accommodations and work buildings from the departing [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].\n\nThe early laboratory had several specialist divisions: Chemistry (initially headed by [[Egon Bretscher]], later by Robert Spence), General Physics (H.W.B. Skinner), Nuclear Physics (initially headed by [[Otto Frisch]], later E. Bretscher), Reactor Physics (John Dunworth), Theoretical Physics ([[Klaus Fuchs]], later [[Brian Flowers]] and [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]]), Isotopes (Henry Seligmann), Engineering (Harold Tongue, later Robert Jackson), Chemical Engineering (A.S. White), and Metallurgy (Bruce Chalmers, later [[Monty Finniston]], FRS). Finniston was later to become chairman of the British Steel Corporation. Directors after Cockcroft included [[Basil Schonland]], Sir [[Arthur Vick]] and [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]].\n\n[[File:Aere harwell main gate.jpg|thumb|AERE main gate]]\nThe decision to site AERE at Harwell had huge implications for a rural area which had depended mainly on agriculture for employment before World War II. The site (which quickly became known colloquially amongst the local population as 'The Atomic') became one of the main employers in the post-war period. It also led to an influx of labour from outside the area, putting pressure on already scarce housing stocks. In response to the problem, hostels and temporary housing were established around the site. The hostels were named Icknield Way House ('B' mess, the RAF sergeants' mess), Portway House ('C' Mess, the RAF airmans' mess) and Ridgeway House ('A' Mess, the officers' mess) provided either single or double room accommodation for staff and were adopted from existing RAF structures on the site. The class distinction was maintained by the UKAEA. A-Mess housed visiting scientists, B-Mess scientific support staff and some post-graduate scientists, and C-Mess industrial support staff. The temporary housing stock consisted of several hundred '[[Prefabricated building|Prefabs]]', single storey structures manufactured in parts for quick erection, which were designed originally to help alleviate chronic housing shortages in the immediate post-war period in Britain. Two estates of 'Prefabs' were built to the north and south of the site perimeter, along with a road system and parade of shops. In later years, conventional housing was provided on estates built in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Grove, Oxfordshire|Grove]] (near [[Wantage]]) and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] for employees. A modern hostel (Rush Common House) was built in Abingdon. The houses were later sold (mainly to their occupants) in the 1980s and the hostels were demolished or adapted for other uses. The 'Prefab' estates lasted until the early 1990s when the residents were transferred to local authority housing. The RAF prewar NCO married quarter housing at Harwell together other UKAEA housing in Abingdon, Grove, Wantage and Newbury totaling 129 houses were sold in their entirety to the Welbeck Estate Group in 1995 and following extensive refurbishment were sold to local buyers.\n\nWorkers were bussed to the site from as far away as Reading in utilitarian grey buses marked 'AERE'.\n\n==Early reactors==\n{{main|DIDO (nuclear reactor)|GLEEP|PLUTO reactor}}\nSuch was the interest in nuclear power and the priority devoted to it in those days that the first reactor, [[GLEEP]], was operating by 15 August 1947. GLEEP (Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile) was a low-power (3 [[kilowatt]]) graphite-moderated air-cooled reactor. The first reactor in Western Europe, it operated until 1990.\n\nA successor to GLEEP, called [[BEPO]] (British Experimental Pile 0) was constructed based on the experience with GLEEP, and commenced operation in 1948. At 6MW, BEPO was much more powerful than GLEEP.<ref>[https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/WR-Innovative-way-to-plug-tubes-at-BEPO-1011145.html \"Innovative way to plug tubes at BEPO\"] ''WNN'', 10 Nov 2014</ref> The engineers at Harwell eventually decided that this small reactor should be put to some use, so the air that flowed over it was directed through an underground trench, where there were some pipes filled with water that connected to a secondary group of water-filled pipes that were used by the nearby establishments to heat offices.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=94qQag_j-FkC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=bepo+hot+air+british+affairs&source=bl&ots=C7RLtl_jYI&sig=ACfU3U2GF1MtR_oucp7rR6QobC91KkvOjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAz5Pcm9jnAhWFqHEKHXScAQoQ6AEwAHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=bepo%20hot%20air%20british%20affairs&f=false \"Graphite Pile in Britain\"] ''British Afairs'', Vol. III, NO. 1, March 1959 pp. 44</ref> This was the first use of nuclear district heating in the UK. BEPO was shut down in 1968.\n\n[[LIDO reactor|LIDO]] was an [[enriched uranium]] thermal swimming pool reactor which operated from 1956 to 1972 and was mainly used for shielding and nuclear physics experiments. It was fully dismantled and returned to a green field site in 1995. In the same building as LIDO, DAPHNE (Dido And Pluto Handmaiden for Nuclear Experiments) was constructed to test equipment used in experiments on the two larger reactors.\n\nA pair of larger 26 [[megawatt|MW]] reactors, [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] and [[PLUTO reactor|PLUTO]], which used enriched [[uranium]] with a [[heavy water]] [[neutron moderator|moderator]] came online in 1956 and 1957 respectively. These reactors were used primarily for testing the behaviour of different materials under intense [[neutron]] irradiation to help decide what materials to build reactor components out of. A sample could be irradiated for a few months to simulate the radiation dose that it would receive over the lifetime of a power reactor. Both reactors were also used for neutron scattering crystallography. They took over commercial [[isotope]] production from BEPO after that was shut down.  DIDO and PLUTO themselves were shut down in 1990 and the fuel, moderator and some ancillary buildings removed.  The GLEEP reactor and the hangar it was situated in were decommissioned 2005. The current plans are to decommission the BEPO, DIDO and PLUTO reactors by 2020.\n\n==Zeta==\nOne of the most significant experiments to occur at AERE was the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] [[fusion power]] experiment. An early attempt to build a large-scale nuclear fusion reactor, the project was started in 1954, and the first successes were achieved in 1957. In 1968 the project was shut down, as it was believed that no further progress could be made with the kind of design that ZETA represented (see [[Timeline of nuclear fusion]]).\n\n==Organisational history==\nIn 1954 AERE was incorporated into the newly formed [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA). Harwell and other laboratories were to assume responsibility for atomic energy research and development. It was part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI).\n\nDuring the 1970s the slowdown of the British nuclear energy program resulted in a greatly reduced demand for the kind of work being done by the UKAEA. Pressures on government spending also reduced the funding available. Reluctant to merely disband a quality scientific research organisation, UKAEA was required to divert its research effort to the solving of scientific problems for industry by providing paid consultancy or services. For example, an Operations Research Group was set up at Harwell, and developed shipping fleet scheduling software that was used to provide a service to British and overseas shipping companies<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BAIlXPgcsHwC&lpg=PA268&ots=1aT_-RwA1c&dq=%22Route%20program%20sends%20profits%20sailing%20ahead%22&pg=PA268#v=onepage&f=false \"Route program sends profits sailing ahead\"], New Scientist 3 Feb 1972 p268</ref> and oil reservoir simulation software to help in the development of the UK's North Sea oil interests.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aNRaAAAAYAAJ&dq=harwell+oil+reservoir+simulator&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Atomic+Energy+Authority+Research \"Winning More Oil: Increasing Importance for Enhanced Oil Recovery\"] auth. Ray Dafter, pub. Financial Times Business Information Limited, 1981, p. 34</ref> UKAEA was ordered to operate on a [[Trading Fund]] basis, i.e. to account for itself financially as though it was a private corporation, while remaining fully government owned. After several years of transition, UKAEA was divided in the early 1990s. UKAEA retained ownership of all land and infrastructure and of all nuclear facilities, and of businesses directly related to nuclear power. The remainder was privatised as [[AEA Technology]] and floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Harwell Laboratory contained elements of both organisations, though the land and infrastructure was owned by UKAEA.\n\n[[File:Aere harwell national chemical landmark.jpg|thumb|right|Harwell Laboratory blue plaque]]\nThe name Atomic Energy Research Establishment was dropped at the same time, and the site became known as the ''Harwell International Business Centre''. The site incorporates the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] which is home to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (including the [[ISIS neutron source]] and [[Diamond Light Source]]). In 2006, the name [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] was introduced and management of the campus was passed to a Public / Private 50:50 Joint Venture partnership to take forward the management and redevelopment of the campus which has been re-branded as Harwell Oxford. In February 2009, part of the campus, the remaining nuclear licensed site, passed to the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] and is being decommissioned by Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL, from 2015 part of [[Magnox Ltd]]), on their behalf.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]]\n* [[Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment]]\n* [[Harwell CADET]], an early transistorised computer\n* [[Harwell Synchrocyclotron]], an early accelerator based in AERE Hangar 7\n* [[Joint European Torus|JET]] fusion reactor\n* [[List of nuclear reactors]]\n* [[WITCH (computer)]], an early [[Dekatron]]-based computer constructed at Harwell and donated to computer science in the late 1950s\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://harwellcampus.com/ Harwell Science and Innovation Campus website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20000915093227/http://research-sites.com/ Information about the RSRL site, present day]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040513171750/http://www.empireclubfoundation.com/details.asp?SpeechID=1578&FT=yes Speech by Sir John Cockcroft]\n* [http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/appendices/nuclear-development-in-the-united-kingdom.aspx Nuclear Development in the UK]\n* [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|Nuclear Power in the UK]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031216103922/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/fusion/famous.asp Fusion experiments from the British Science Museum]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1946 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:History of Berkshire]]\n[[Category:History of Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Nuclear energy in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Nuclear research institutes in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Nuclear weapons infrastructure of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Research institutes in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Scientific organizations established in 1946]]\n[[Category:Vale of White Horse]]\n", "name_user": "E bruton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added citation needed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Research_Establishment"}

A lawyer by training, he balanced his musical career with work as a radio announcer, writer, humourist, reporter, producer, emcee, interviewer and football commentator. He was such a fan of the [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo]] football club of Rio de Janeiro that he turned down an invitation to move to the United States at the peak of his fame in the 1940s because he didn't want to be so far from the team.\n\nAlthough Barroso's father, Joao Evangelista, was a well-known poet, guitar player, singer and lawyer, he became an orphan at the age of seven when his parents died and was raised by his grandmother and aunt. At his aunt's insistence, Barroso began studying the piano at the age of ten, practicing a mandatory three hours a day. Within two years, he was playing so well that he was hired to accompany silent films at the local cinema. Although he inherited money at the age of seventeen when his uncle died, Barroso spent it quickly and was forced to turn to music for an income. In addition to playing piano in cinemas, cabarets and with orchestras, he became involved with musical theatre, when composed two works: \"Vou \u00e0 Penha\", recorded by the singer M\u00e1rio Reis, and \"Vamos deixar de intimidades\", both recorded in 1929. In 1930, Barroso won his first award promoted by Casa Edison Records, in the \"Carnival Songs\" category.<ref>{{https://musicabrasilis.com/composers/ary-barroso}}</ref> Joining forces with lyricist Lu\u00eds Peixoto, Barroso composed more than 60 tunes, as well as writing scripts.\n\nShortly after finishing law school, in 1929, Barroso married the daughter of the boarding house in which he lived. In an attempt to raise money, he entered and won a Carnaval song contest in 1930. Three years later, Barroso hosted the first of many radio shows.\n\n== Death ==\nIn 1961, Barroso was diagnosed with [[liver cirrhosis]], he died on February 9, 1964.<ref>{{cite

He was such a fan of the [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo]] football club of Rio de Janeiro that he turned down an invitation to move to the United States at the peak of his fame in the 1940s because he didn't want to be so far from the team.\n\nAlthough Barroso's father, Joao Evangelista, was a well-known poet, guitar player, singer and lawyer, he became an orphan at the age of seven when his parents died and was raised by his grandmother and aunt. At his aunt's insistence, Barroso began studying the piano at the age of ten, practicing a mandatory three hours a day. Within two years, he was playing so well that he was hired to accompany silent films at the local cinema. Although he inherited money at the age of seventeen when his uncle died, Barroso spent it quickly and was forced to turn to music for an income. In addition to playing piano in cinemas, cabarets and with orchestras, he became involved with musical theatre. Joining forces with lyricist Lu\u00eds Peixoto, Barroso composed more than 60 tunes, as well as writing scripts.\n\nShortly after finishing law school, in 1929, Barroso married the daughter of the boarding house in which he lived. In an attempt to raise money, he entered and won a Carnaval song contest in 1930. Three years later, Barroso hosted the first of many radio shows.\n\n== Death ==\nIn 1961, Barroso was diagnosed with [[liver cirrhosis]], he died on February 9, 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/ary-barroso.jhtm|title=Compositor Brasileiro: Ary Barroso|publisher= UOL Educa\u00e7\u00e3o|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n[[File:AryBarroso.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ary Barroso on [[Avenida Atl\u00e2ntica]] in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]]]]\n* ''[[Hello, Hello Brazil!|Al\u00f4, Al\u00f4, Brasil]]'' (1935)\n* ''[[Music in My Heart]]'' (1940)\n* ''Laranja da China'' (1940)\n* ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' (1942) (uncredited)\n* ''Gals, Incorporated'' (1943) (uncredited)\n* ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]'' (1943) (uncredited) \n* ''Popular Science'' (1943) (Documentary)\n* ''[[Jam Session (1944 film)|Jam Session]]'' (1944)\n* ''[[Something for the Boys]]'' (1944)\n* ''[[Brazil (1944 film)|Brazil]]'' (1944)\n* ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944)\n* ''[[Pan-Americana]]'' (1945)\n* ''[[Tell It to a Star]]'' (1945)\n* ''[[Easy to Wed]]'' (1946)\n* ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947) (uncredited)\n* ''[[Road to Rio]]'' (1947)\n* ''Esta \u00e9 Fina'' (1948)\n* ''[[Sitting Pretty (1948 film)|Sitting Pretty]]'' (1948) (uncredited)\n* ''Revancha'' (1948)\n* ''Viajera'' (1952)\n* ''Cantando nace el amor'' (1954)\n* ''La culpa de los hombres'' (1955)\n* ''[[The Eddy Duchin Story]]'' (1956) (uncredited)\n* ''Matem\u00e1tica Zero, Amor Dez'' (1958)\n* ''[[Holiday for Lovers]]'' (1959) (uncredited)\n* ''Garota de Ipanema'' (1967)\n* ''Os Inconfidentes'' (1972)\n* ''[[Silent Movie]]'' (1976) (uncredited)\n* ''[[Bye Bye Brasil]]'' (1980)\n* ''O Homem do Pau-Brasil'' (1982)\n* ''Brazil: O Filme'' (1985)\n* ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Lucky Break (1994 film)|Lucky Break]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[Carmen Miranda: Bananas is My Business]]'' (1995) (Documentary) \n* ''[[Next Stop Wonderland]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Three to Tango]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Woman on Top]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Madame Sat\u00e3]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Carandiru (film)|Carandiru]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Millions (2004 film)|Millions]]'' (2004)\n* ''Ma vie en cin\u00e9mascope'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004)\n* ''La gran final'' (2006)\n* ''My Kid Could Paint That'' (2004) (Documentary)\n* ''Chega de Saudade'' (2007)\n* ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' (2008)\n* ''Iron Maiden: Flight 666'' (2009) (Documentary)\n* ''[[Arbitrage (film)|Arbitrage]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Mr. Peabody & Sherman]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Spy (2015 film)|Spy]]'' (2015)\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Ary Barroso}}\n* [http://daniellathompson.com/ary/ Ary Barroso \u2013 Giant of Brazilian Song]\n* [http://daniellathompson.com/Texts/Ary_Barroso/Ary.htm Ary Barroso Discography]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071213012052/http://www.brazil-brasil.com/blajul97.htm ExtraordinAry], article by Arthur de Faria\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080615125015/http://cliquemusic.uol.com.br/en/Artists/Artists.asp?Status=ARTISTA&Nu_Artista=47 Ary Barroso] from AllBrazilianMusic\n* {{IMDb name|0057795|Ary Barroso}}\n* [http://albumitaucultural.org.br/wp-content/gallery/almir-chediak-historia-songbooks-e-musica/thumbs/thumbs_galeria10.jpg Walt Disney and Ary Barroso working at the Walt Disney studios, 1940]\n\n{{Order of Cultural Merit}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barroso, Ary}}\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cirrhosis]]\n[[Category:Brazilian composers]]\n[[Category:People from Ub\u00e1]]\n[[Category:Brazilian Presbyterians]]\n[[Category:20th-century composers]]\n", "name_user": "Nivia Zumpano", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBiography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ary_Barroso"}

Introduced on 5 July 1990, Clyde featured in prominent storylines including an inter-racial relationship with [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) and being framed for the murder of publican [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/EastEnders+at+15%3a+tragic+moments%3b+1991-1993.-a061515690|title=EastEnders at 15: tragic moments; 1991-1993.|publisher=Sunday Mail |accessdate=2009-09-16 | date=16 April 2000}}</ref> The character was written out in 1993 and was given a happy ending, leaving on 22 July 1993.\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===Backstory===\nClyde was the first-born son to [[Etta Tavernier|Etta]] and [[Celestine Tavernier]] ([[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]] and [[Leroy Golding]]). After his birth in Trinidad in 1968, his family moved to the UK. Growing up in [[London]], Clyde was subject to racism and police harassment, which made him angry and somewhat bitter. In adulthood, Clyde struggled to find direction. He lazed around, did odd jobs, and took up boxing. Clyde met a woman named Abigail Chadwick and they had a child together, a son named Kofi. Clyde and Abigail split up and Kofi was taken to Bristol by his mother to live with his grandparents. When Abigail was killed in a car crash, it was agreed that Kofi would remain living with his maternal grandparents.\n\n===1990\u20131993===\nClyde moves to Albert Square in July 1990 with his family. Clyde gets a job working in [[The Queen Victoria]] public house. Clyde becomes prime suspect for a series of thefts that were occurring in the pub. Clyde's boss, [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), suspects Clyde is behind the incidents as he is the only black barman. However, Clyde is later cleared of any wrongdoing. Clyde desperately misses his son, [[Kofi Tavernier]] (Marcel Smith), and when he discovers that Kofi's grandparents are planning to take his child to live permanently in Jamaica, he tails them to the airport to stop them. Despite initial uncertainty Clyde is given custody of his son and Kofi moves in with Clyde. Clyde starts a relationship with [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]); their inter-racial relationship causes a stir in the community. Clyde resumes boxing, spurred on by [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), who hope to exploit him in the ring by pitting him against a superior fighter and betting against him. However their plan backfires when an overfaced Clyde manages to win the fight, despite the odds being severely stacked against him. Clyde is later trained to box by Eddie, but animosity between him and Eddie resurfaces when Eddie attempts to get Clyde to throw a fight in a betting scam. Clyde refuses, but his altercations with Eddie come back to haunt him when he becomes the prime suspect in Eddie's murder soon after.\n\nClyde discovers Eddie's bloody body in the square and unwittingly picks up the knife that has been used to kill him. Panicking, Clyde leaves the scene and disposes of the murder weapon, but is seen by the real murderer, [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), who proceeds to frame Clyde for the deed. With a clear motive and a key witness, Clyde finds it difficult to convince anyone of his innocence. Clyde feels that he was the victim of a racist conspiracy and sensing his imminent arrest he decides to go 'on the run' with Kofi. Michelle sticks by him and she and her daughter [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Samantha Leigh Martin]]) leave Walford with Clyde, with the hope of starting a new life together in France. Their bid for freedom is not to be as Clyde is apprehended in [[Portsmouth]] before he can leave the country; he is subsequently imprisoned. He only secures release three months later when a witness, [[Joe Wallace (EastEnders)|Joe Wallace]] (Jason Rush) comes forward and identifies Nick as Eddie's real killer. Upon Clyde's release, his relationship with Michelle abruptly ends when he catches her in bed with another man, [[Jack Woodman (EastEnders)|Jack Woodman]] ([[James Gilbey]]). The Taverniers are visited by [[Gidea Thompson]] (Si\u00e2n Martin), a friend of Jules' family back in Trinidad. Clyde and Gidea grow close and embark on a relationship, forcing Jules to admit Gidea is his granddaughter from an adulterous affair he had in his 20s, meaning the pair are cousins. Gidea wants to break things off with Clyde, but he persuades her they can still have a relationship. Jules disapproves, but Clyde ignores his protests, and in July 1993 he decides to leave Walford to start a new life with Gidea in Trinidad.\n\n==Creation and development==\nIn the latter part of 1989, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]] became the new executive producer of ''EastEnders'', taking over from [[Mike Gibbon]]. Ferguson had previously been a producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' \u2013 a hard-hitting, gritty and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging ''EastEnders'' in providing a realistic vision of modern life in [[London]]. Due to his success on ''The Bill'', [[Peter Cregeen]], the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become the executive producer of ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] said that it was a challenging period, but \"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAs a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among the new characters were the Jamaican Tavernier family, who collectively arrived on-screen in July 1990, composed of grandfather [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules]] ([[Tommy Eytle]]), his son and daughter-in-law [[Celestine and Etta Tavernier|Celestine]] ([[Leroy Golding]]) and [[Celestine and Etta Tavernier|Etta]] ([[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]]), their eldest son Clyde ([[Steven Woodcock]]), and their twins [[Lloyd Tavernier|Lloyd]] ([[Garey Bridges]]) and [[Hattie Tavernier|Hattie]] ([[Michelle Gayle]]). Later Clyde's son [[Kofi Tavernier]] was introduced. Colin Brake described the Taverniers as the major new additions that year, and it heralded the first time that an entire family had joined the serial all at once. Their introduction was also described as a well-intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the soap.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nIt took a long time to cast the complete Tavernier family. Once ''EastEnders'' became a success, the producers had no difficulties in finding \"good actors\" who wanted to join the cast; however, what became hard was finding families\u2014combinations of performers who \"look and sound as though they could be related.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to producers [[Corinne Hollingworth]] and Pat Sandys, the Taveriner family were especially difficult as four generations of the family were being featured. Hollingworth has commented \"The most difficult job we've had was finding six black actors who fitted the bill for the Tavernier family. Here we needed two teenagers who looked around fifteen but were actually older, had left school and had mature attitudes to work.

Introduced on 5 July 1990, Clyde featured in prominent storylines including an inter-racial relationship with [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) and being framed for the murder of publican [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/EastEnders+at+15%3a+tragic+moments%3b+1991-1993.-a061515690|title=EastEnders at 15: tragic moments; 1991-1993.|publisher=Sunday Mail |accessdate=2009-09-16 | date=16 April 2000}}</ref> The character was written out in 1993 and was given a happy ending, leaving on 22 July 1993.\n\n== Storylines ==\n\n===Backstory===\nClyde was the first-born son to [[Etta Tavernier|Etta]] and [[Celestine Tavernier]] ([[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]] and [[Leroy Golding]]). After his birth in Trinidad in 1968, his family moved to the UK. Growing up in [[London]], Clyde was subject to racism and police harassment, which made him angry and somewhat bitter. In adulthood, Clyde struggled to find direction. He lazed around, did odd jobs, and took up boxing. Clyde met a woman named Abigail Chadwick and they had a child together, a son named Kofi. Clyde and Abigail split up and Kofi was taken to Bristol by his mother to live with his grandparents. When Abigail was killed in a car crash, it was agreed that Kofi would remain living with his maternal grandparents.\n\n===1990\u20131993===\nClyde moves to Albert Square in July 1990 with his family. Clyde gets a job working in [[The Queen Victoria]] public house. Clyde becomes prime suspect for a series of thefts that were occurring in the pub. Clyde's boss, [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), suspects Clyde is behind the incidents as he is the only black barman. However, Clyde is later cleared of any wrongdoing. Clyde desperately misses his son, [[Kofi Tavernier]] (Marcel Smith), and when he discovers that Kofi's grandparents are planning to take his child to live permanently in Jamaica, he tails them to the airport to stop them. Despite initial uncertainty Clyde is given custody of his son and Kofi moves in with Clyde. Clyde starts a relationship with [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]); their inter-racial relationship causes a stir in the community. Clyde resumes boxing, spurred on by [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), who hope to exploit him in the ring by pitting him against a superior fighter and betting against him. However their plan backfires when an overfaced Clyde manages to win the fight, despite the odds being severely stacked against him. Clyde is later trained to box by Eddie, but animosity between him and Eddie resurfaces when Eddie attempts to get Clyde to throw a fight in a betting scam. Clyde refuses, but his altercations with Eddie come back to haunt him when he becomes the prime suspect in Eddie's murder soon after.\n\nClyde discovers Eddie's bloody body in the square and unwittingly picks up the knife that has been used to kill him. Panicking, Clyde leaves the scene and disposes of the murder weapon, but is seen by the real murderer, [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), who proceeds to frame Clyde for the deed. With a clear motive and a key witness, Clyde finds it difficult to convince anyone of his innocence. Clyde feels that he was the victim of a racist conspiracy and sensing his imminent arrest he decides to go 'on the run' with Kofi. Michelle sticks by him and she and her daughter [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Samantha Leigh Martin]]) leave Walford with Clyde, with the hope of starting a new life together in France. Their bid for freedom is not to be as Clyde is apprehended in [[Portsmouth]] before he can leave the country; he is subsequently imprisoned. He only secures release three months later when a witness, [[Joe Wallace (EastEnders)|Joe Wallace]] (Jason Rush) comes forward and identifies Nick as Eddie's real killer. Upon Clyde's release, his relationship with Michelle abruptly ends when he catches her in bed with another man, [[Jack Woodman (EastEnders)|Jack Woodman]] ([[James Gilbey]]). The Taverniers are visited by [[Gidea Thompson]] (Si\u00e2n Martin), a friend of Jules' family back in Trinidad. Clyde and Gidea grow close and embark on a relationship, forcing Jules to admit Gidea is his granddaughter from an adulterous affair he had in his 20s, meaning the pair are cousins. Gidea wants to break things off with Clyde, but he persuades her they can still have a relationship. Jules disapproves, but Clyde ignores his protests, and in July 1993 he decides to leave Walford to start a new life with Gidea in Trinidad.\n\n==Creation and development==\nIn the latter part of 1989, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]] became the new executive producer of ''EastEnders'', taking over from [[Mike Gibbon]]. Ferguson had previously been a producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' \u2013 a hard-hitting, gritty and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging ''EastEnders'' in providing a realistic vision of modern life in [[London]]. Due to his success on ''The Bill'', [[Peter Cregeen]], the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become the executive producer of ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] said that it was a challenging period, but \"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAs a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among the new characters were the Jamaican Tavernier family, who collectively arrived on-screen in July 1990, composed of grandfather [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules]] ([[Tommy Eytle]]), his son and daughter-in-law [[Celestine and Etta Tavernier|Celestine]] ([[Leroy Golding]]) and [[Celestine and Etta Tavernier|Etta]] ([[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]]), their eldest son Clyde ([[Steven Woodcock]]), and their twins [[Lloyd Tavernier|Lloyd]] ([[Garey Bridges]]) and [[Hattie Tavernier|Hattie]] ([[Michelle Gayle]]). Later Clyde's son [[Kofi Tavernier]] was introduced. Colin Brake described the Taverniers as the major new additions that year, and it heralded the first time that an entire family had joined the serial all at once. Their introduction was also described as a well-intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the soap.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nIt took a long time to cast the complete Tavernier family. Once ''EastEnders'' became a success, the producers had no difficulties in finding \"good actors\" who wanted to join the cast; however, what became hard was finding families\u2014combinations of performers who \"look and sound as though they could be related.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to producers [[Corinne Hollingworth]] and Pat Sandys, the Taveriner family were especially difficult as four generations of the family were being featured. Hollingworth has commented \"The most difficult job we've had was finding six black actors who fitted the bill for the Tavernier family. Here we needed two teenagers who looked around fifteen but were actually older, had left school and had mature attitudes to work. They had to love music, hanging around in tracksuits and most important, they had to look as if they could be twins. And for Clyde, we needed someone who looked as though he'd been a boxer but also seemed thoughtful.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nAuthor Hilary Kingsley described Clyde as someone who \"has never accepted that black people have to tolerate prejudice without protest.\" She added that \"Clyde has good reason to feel bitter, thanks to years of being harassed by the police.

At its settlement in 7th century by the Angles of Mercia it was ''Weogorna''. After centuries of warfare against the Vikings and Danelaw it had become a centre for the Anglo-Saxon army or ''here'' known as ''Weogorna ceastre'' (Worcester Camp). Between the 10th and 12th centuries, when scholasticism flourished, it became ''Wirccester''. The county later developed from the ''Wigornia'' shire of the Anglo-Norman period, with foundations of market fairs by the Henrician and Edwardian parliaments (1216\u20131377). It was still known as County Wigorn in 1750,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} with its Shire Courts divided into hundreds.\n\nThe [[Weorgoran]] were probably a sub-tribe of the larger kingdom of the [[Hwicce]], which occupied present-day Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and western Wiltshire. They would have entered the area some time after the 577 [[Battle of Dyrham]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=Anglo-Saxon England |last=Stenton |first=Frank |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1943 |isbn=0-19-280139-2 |location=Oxford |pages=44, 422}}</ref>In 680, Worcester was chosen as their fort over the larger [[Gloucester]], and the royal court at [[Winchcombe]] as the [[episcopal see]] of a new [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|bishopric]], suggesting there was already an established and powerful [[Celtic Christianity|Christian]] community when the site [[Saxon invasions of England|fell into English hands]]. The oldest known church was [[Saint Helen of Caernarfon|St Helen]]'s, which was certainly of British origin. The later Saxon cathedral was dedicated to [[St Peter]].<ref name=\"subromancow\" />\n\nWorcester appears often in pre-Viking historic records. Frequent references to the church and monastic communities give evidence of extensive land ownership by the Church. The earls of [[Mercia]] in [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]'s reign fortified it \"for protection of all the people\", at the request of Bishop Werfrith. Its defences were to be maintained at the expense of the townspeople. A document detailing this and privileges granted to the Church notes the existence of Worcester market and borough court, differentiates between church and market quarters in the city, and specifies the role of the King in relation to the roads.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\">{{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1924}}</ref>\n\nWorcester's fortifications are likely to have followed the line of the wall, extant until the 1600s, except possibly in the south-east area near the early castle.

[[Oswald of Worcester]], appointed Bishop in 961, was an important reformer alongside the Archbishop of York. The last Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Worcester, St [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Wulfstan]] or Wulstan, was a reformer, who remained in office until he died in 1095.\n\nWorcester became a focus of tax resistance against the Danish [[Harthacnut (1020\u20131042)|Harthacanute]]. Two [[huscarl]]s were killed in May 1041 while seeking to collect taxes for the expanded navy, and been driven into the Priory. A military force composed of the country's powerful earls and their thegns was sent to deal with the non-payment. It included Siward, Earl of Northumbria, Earl Godwine of Wessex and Leofric Earl of Mercia, who was himself ruler of the Hwicce and from a family of traditional ealdormen of that tribal hidage.<ref name=\":0\" /> The townspeople tried to defend themselves by occupying the Severn island of Bevere, two miles up river. After Harthacnut's men had sacked the city and set it alight, agreement was reached and the populace returned to rebuild its city.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester possessed a mint in the late Anglo-Saxon period, with seven moneyers in the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]]. This implies a middling role in trade for the city.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n===Medieval===\n====Early medieval====\nWorcester was counted for tax purposes within the neighbouring rural hundreds at the start of the Norman period, but was administratively independent.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Its growth and position as a market town for goods and produce rested on its river crossing and bridge and its position on the road network. The nearest bridges over the Severn were at [[Gloucester]] and [[Bridgnorth]] in the 14th century. The main road from London to mid-Wales ran through Worcester, then north-west to Kidderminster, Bridgnorth and Shrewsbury, and via Bromsgrove to Coventry and on to Derby. Southward it connected with Tewkesbury and Gloucester.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThere had been a bridge in Worcester since at least the 11th century. It was replaced in the early 14th century by one situated below the current Newport Street. It had six arches on piers with [[starling (architecture)|starlings]], the middle pier having a gatehouse.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe upkeep of the city walls was paid for by the residents. Its somewhat irregular course included bastions and a watercourse. The entrances to the city were through defensive gates built at various times, including St Martin's in the east, Sidbury to the south, Friar Gate, Edgar Tower, and Water Gate. There were six gates by the 16th century.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n[[File:Worcester Cathedral Cloister, Worcestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The medieval cloisters]]\nWorcester was also a centre of religious life. The several monasteries up to the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] included [[Worcester Greyfriars|Greyfriars]], [[Worcester Blackfriars|Blackfriars]], the Penitent Sisters, and the Benedictine Priory, now Worcester Cathedral.<ref>{{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1971b |pp=167\u2013173}}</ref> Monastic houses provided hospital and educational services, including [[Royal Grammar School Worcester|Worcester School]]. St Wulstan's Hospital was founded about 1085, but dissolved with the monasteries in 1540. St Oswald's Hospital may have been founded by [[Oswald of Worcester|St Oswald]]. Much land and property in Worcester were held by the church.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nDomesday Book (1086) also records many town houses belonging to rural landowners, presumably used as residences while selling produce from their lands.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> In the 1100s, Worcester suffered a number of city fires. The first, on 19 June 1113, destroyed town, castle and cathedral. A second ensued in November 1131.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe 12th-century town (then better defended) was attacked in 1139, 1150 and 1151 during the civil war between [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and [[Empress Matilda]], daughter of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. The 1139 attack again resulted in a fire that destroyed part of the city, with citizens being held for ransom. Another fire in 1189 destroyed much of the city for the fourth time that century.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester received its first [[royal charter]] in 1189. This set the annual payment made to the Crown at \u00a324 a year and stipulated that the city would deal directly with the Crown Exchequer, not through the county [[sheriff]], who would no longer have jurisdiction over the city. However, Worcester's charter was not renewed under [[John, King of England|King John]], who could levy increased arbitrary taxation or [[tallage]], demanding \u00a3100 in 1214.\n\nIn 1227 under [[King Henry III of England|King Henry III]], Worcester regained its charter and was granted more freedoms. The annual tax was raised to \u00a330. The county sheriff was again removed from his role of representing the city to the Crown, except in limited circumstances. A guild of merchants was created, with a trading monopoly for those admitted. [[Villein]]s who resided in the city for a year and day became members of the guild and were to be deemed free. The charter was renewed in 1264.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Worcester's institutions grew more slowly than those of most county towns and had detectably archaic sides to them, probably due to the power of the local aristocracy.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n====Jewish persecution and expulsions====\nWorcester had a small [[Jewish community of Worcester#The Jews in Worcester in the Middle Ages|Jewish population]] by the late 12th century. It was one of a number of places allowed to keep records of debts, in an official locked chest known as an ''archa''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1727-archa |title=ARCHA |website=Jewishencyclopedia.com |accessdate=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802180705/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1727-archa |archive-date=2 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Jewish life probably centred around what is now Copenhagen Street.\n\nThe Diocese was hostile to the Jewish community. [[Peter of Blois]] was commissioned by a Bishop of Worcester, probably [[John of Coutances]], to write an anti-Judaic treatise, ''Against the Perfidy of Jews'', around 1190.<ref>{{harvnb |de Blois |1194}}, {{harvnb |Lazare |1903}}</ref>\n\n[[William de Blois (bishop of Worcester)|William de Blois]] as Bishop of Worcester imposed strict rules on Jews within the diocese in 1219.<ref>{{harvnb |Vincent |1994 |p=217}}</ref> As elsewhere in England, Jews were compelled to wear square white badges, supposedly representing ''tabulae''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-badge |title=Jewish Badge |website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106150945/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-badge |archive-date=6 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In most places, this requirement was waived as long as fines were paid. While enforcing the church edicts on wearing badges, Blois tried to impose additional restrictions on [[usury]]. He wrote to [[Pope Gregory IX]] in 1229 to request better powers of enforcement and further, harsher measures, which were granted.<ref>{{harvnb |Vincent |1994 |p=209}}</ref>\n\nA national assembly of Jewish notables was summoned to Worcester by the Crown in 1240 to assess their wealth for taxation. There [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] \"squeezed the largest tallage of the thirteenth century from his Jewish subjects.\"<ref>{{harvnb |Mundill |2002 |pp=58\u201360}}</ref>\n\nIn 1263 Worcester's Jewish residents were attacked by a baronial force under [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby|Robert Earl Ferrers]] and [[Henry de Montfort]]. Most were killed.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Ferrers used this chance to remove titles to his debts by seizing the ''archae''.<ref>{{harvnb |Mundill |2002 |p=42}}</ref> The Worcester massacre was part of a wider campaign by allies of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] at the start of the [[Second Barons' War]]. A massacre of London Jewry also occurred. In 1275, Jews still in Worcester were expelled to [[Hereford]],<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> under anti-Jewish terms for towns under the jurisdiction of the Queen Mother.<ref>{{harvnb |Mundill |2002 |p=23}}</ref>\n\n====Late medieval====\nWorcester's Ordinances of the sixth year of Edward IV, renewed in 1496\u20131497 in 82 clauses, give a detailed picture of city life and organisation in the late [[medieval]] period, as enforced by its bailiffs. Chamberlains received and accounted for rents and other income, and the use of common lands in Worcester was laid down. Trade regulations covered bread and ale. Others dealt with sanitation, fire regulations and upkeep of the city wall, quays and pavements. Public order and crimes, including affray, are covered. Citizens were given the privilege of being imprisoned underneath the [[Worcester Guildhall|Guildhall]] rather than in the town jail, except for the most serious offences.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe cloth industry was also regulated by the Ordinances. Apart from setting weights and measures, they sought to protect artisans engaged in the trade. Payment in kind was banned, with fines of 20 shillings for those paying otherwise than in gold and silver. Employees had to be living in the city and its suburbs.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester elected members of Parliament at the Guildhall, by the loudest shout rather than raising of hands. Members of Parliament had to own freehold property worth 40 shillings a year and be \"of good name and fame, not outlawed, not acombred in accyons as nygh as men may knowe, for worshipp of the seid cite\".<ref>Ordinances quoted {{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1924}}</ref> Their wages were levied by the Constable.\n\nThe city council was organised by a system of co-option, with 24 members of the high chamber and 48 of the lower. Committees appointed two bailiffs and made financial decisions; the two chambers agreed the city's rules or ordinances.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nBy late medieval times the population had reached 1,025 families, excluding the cathedral quarter, so that it probably stood under 10,000.<ref>See Green, in History of Worcester Volume ii.</ref> Worcester's suburbs extended beyond the limits of its walls<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nManufacture of cloth and allied trades began locally. Leland stated in the mid 1500s, for instance, that \"the welthe of the towne of Worcestar standithe most by draping, and noe towne of England, at this present tyme, maketh so many cloathes yearly as this towne doth.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1924}}</ref> The glove-making trade also had its roots in this period.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n===Craft guilds===\nMedieval and early modern Worcester developed a system of craft [[guild|gild]]s to regulate who could work in a trade, lay down trade practices and training, and provide social support for members. The city's late medieval ordinances banned tilers from forming a guild and encouraged tilers to settle in Worcester to trade freely. Roofs of thatch and wooden chimneys were banned in order to reduce risks of fire.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:Worcester, 1610 map.jpg|thumb|Worcester, 1610 map]] The Dissolution saw the Priory's status change, as it lost its Benedictine monks. There were around 36 monks and a Prior at the dissolution in 1540. Some 16 were given pensions immediately or soon after, the rest being employed in the new Deanery. It was necessary to set up \"public\" schools to replace monastic education in Worcester, as elsewhere. This led to the establishment of [[King's School, Worcester|King's School]]. Worcester School continued to teach. St Oswald's Hospital survived the dissolution, later providing [[almshouses]];<ref>{{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1971a |pp=175\u2013179}}</ref> the charity and its housing survives to the present day.\n\nThe city gained the right to elect a [[Mayor]], and was designated a [[county corporate]] in 1621, giving it autonomy from local government. From this point, Worcester was governed by a mayor, recorder and six aldermen. Councillors were selected by co-option.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester contained green spaces such as orchards and fields between its main streets, within the city wall, as appears on Speed's map of 1610. The walls were still more or less complete at the time, but suburbs had been established beyond them.\n\n====Civil war====\n{{more information|Worcestershire in the English Civil War|Battle of Worcester}}\n[[File:Battle of Worcester.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Worcester]]\nWorcester equivocated, but eventually sided with Parliament before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642. It was swiftly occupied by the Royalists, who billeted troops in the city and used the Cathedral to store munitions. [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]] briefly retook the city for Parliament after the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], the first engagement of the war. Parliamentary troops then ransacked the Cathedral. Stained glass was smashed and the organ destroyed, along with library books and monuments.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\nEssex was soon forced to withdraw after the [[Battle of Edgehill]], and the city spent the rest of the war under Royalist occupation, as did most of the county. Worcester was a garrison town and had to bear the expense of sustaining and billeting a large number of Royalist troops. During the Royalist occupation, the suburbs were destroyed to make defence easier. Responsibility for maintenance of defences was transferred to the military command. High taxation was imposed, and many male residents [[Impressment|impressed]] into the army.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004}}</ref>\n\nAs Royalist power collapsed in May 1646, Worcester was placed under siege. Worcester had some 5,000 civilians and a Royalist garrison of about 1,500 men facing a [[New Model Army]] force of 2,500\u20135,000. The city surrendered on 23 July, bringing the first civil war to a close in Worcestershire.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=125\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nIn 1651 a Scottish army, 16,000 strong, marched south along the west coast in support of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s attempt to regain the Crown. As the army approached, Worcester Council voted to surrender, fearing further violence and destruction. The Parliamentary garrison withdrew to [[Evesham]] in the face of the overwhelming numbers against them. The Scots were billeted in and around the city, again at great expense and causing further anxiety among residents. The Scots were joined by very limited local forces, including a company of 60 men under [[Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury|Francis Talbot]].<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=142\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Worcester]] took place on 3 September 1651 in fields to the west and south of the city, near the village of [[Powick]]. Charles II was easily defeated by Cromwell's forces of 30,000 men. Charles II returned to his headquarters in what is now known as King Charles House in the Cornmarket, before fleeing in disguise with Talbot's help to [[Boscobel House]] in [[Shropshire]], from where he eventually escaped to France. Worcester was then heavily looted by the Parliamentarian army. The city council estimated \u00a380,000 of damage was done and the subsequent debts were still not recovered in the 1670s.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=142\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1646 to 1660, the Bishopric was abolished and the Cathedral fell into disrepair.\n\n====After the Restoration====\nAfter the Restoration in 1660, Worcester cleverly used its location as the site of the final battles of the First Civil War (1646) and Third Civil War (1651) to mount an appeal for compensation from [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Though unbased on historical fact, it invented the epithet ''Fidelis Civitas'' (The Faithful City), since included in the city's [[coat of arms]].<ref name=\"Civic Heralrdy\" /><ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |1998}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Guildhall, High Street, Worcester.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Worcester Guildhall]]\nThe Guildhall rebuilt in 1721 to replace an earlier one on the site is a [[Grade I listed]] [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne-style]] building described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] as a town hall \"as splendid as any of C18 England\".<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-488872-guildhall-worcestershire Guildhall \u2013 Worcester \u2013 Worcestershire \u2013 England] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430232747/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-488872-guildhall-worcestershire |date=30 April 2015}}.

As the city population expanded, the green areas between the main streets filled with housing and back streets, so that the extent of the city and suburbs remained much the same as in the early 1600s. Large stretches of the city walls had been removed by 1796.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Meanwhile the [[Royal Worcester|Royal Worcester Porcelain Company]] factory was founded by [[John Wall (physician)|Dr John Wall]] in 1751. Production continued until 2009. A handful of decorators are still employed at the factory, and the museum on the site remains open. Since 2015 there has been re-development there devoted to housing.\n\n===Industrial revolution and Victorian era===\n[[File:Worcester in 1806.

Local government reform took place in 1835, which for the first time created election procedures for councillors, but also restricted the ability of the city to buy and sell property, requiring Treasury permission.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nUp until 1835, the legal distinction between a select group of citizens with specific privileges and other residents of the town had survived.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) was founded in the Board Room of the old Worcester Royal Infirmary building in Castle Street in 1832.<ref name=\"BMA\" /> While part of the Royal Infirmary has now been demolished to make way for the [[University of Worcester]]'s new city campus, the original Georgian building has been preserved.<ref name=\"BBC 2008\" /> One of the old wards opened as a medical museum, the Infirmary, in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worcester.ac.uk/your-home/the-infirmary.html |title=The Infirmary \u2013 University of Worcester |website=Worcester.ac.uk |accessdate=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303012856/http://www.worcester.ac.uk/your-home/the-infirmary.html |archive-date=3 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Museum\" />\n\nRailways opened in Worcester in 1850, with [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Shrub Hill]], jointly owned by the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]] and [[Midland Railway]], initially running to Birmingham only. [[Worcester Foregate Street railway station|Foregate Street]] was opened in 1860 by the Hereford and Worcester Railway, quickly incorporated into the [[West Midland Railway]]. The WMR lines became part of the [[Great Western Railway]] after 1 August 1863. The railways also gave Worcester thousands of jobs with the just under half of all [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] passenger coaches built in Worcester and the three signalling factories including the largest [[railway signalling]] company in the World: [[McKenzie & Holland]].\n\nIn 1882 Worcester hosted the Worcestershire Exhibition, inspired by the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] in London. There were sections for exhibits of fine arts (over 600 paintings), historical manuscripts and industrial items. The profit was \u00a31,867.9s.6d. The number of visitors is recorded as 222,807. Some of the profit from the exhibition was used to build the Victoria Institute in Foregate Street, Worcester. This was opened on 1 October 1896 and originally housed the city art gallery and museum; now located on Foregate Street.{{Citation needed|reason=details, dates and stats should be referenced/referenceable|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Twentieth century to present===\nRail reorganisation in 1922 saw the Midland Railway's routes from Shrub Hill absorbed into the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the city was chosen to be the seat of an evacuated government in case of mass [[Operation Sealion|German invasion]].

It had no rail or road loading facilities but distribution could be carried out by barge through the [[Diglis Basin|Diglis basin]] and the depot could receive fuel either by barge or the GPSS pipeline network.

The late Victorian period saw the growth of ironfounders like [[Heenan & Froude]], Hardy & Padmore and McKenzie & Holland.\n\n===Glove industry===\n[[File:Gloves, Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum, England - DSCF0752.JPG|thumb|150px|Gloves, [[Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum]]]]\nOne of the flourishing industries was glove making, which peaked between 1790 and 1820, when about 30,000 were employed by 150 firms. At this time nearly half the glove manufacturers of Britain were located in Worcestershire.\n\nIn the 19th century, the industry declined as import taxes on foreign competitors, mainly French, were greatly reduced. By the mid-20th century, only a few Worcester glove companies survived since gloves became less fashionable and free trade enabled cheaper imports from the [[Far East]]. Nevertheless, at least three glove manufacturers survived until the late 20th century: [[Dents|Dent Allcroft]], Fownes and Milore. Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s coronation gloves were designed by Emil Rich and manufactured in the Worcester Milore factory.<ref name=\"GloveMaking\" /><ref name=\"WorcesterNews21062010\" />\n\n===Manufacturing===\n[[File:leaperrins.png|thumb|150px|[[Lea & Perrins]] advertisement (1900)]]\nThe inter-war years saw rapid growth in engineering and machine-tool manufacturing firms such as James Archdale and H. W. Ward, castings for the motor industry from Worcester Windshields and Casements, valve design and manufacture from [[Sentinel Valve Works|Alley & MacLellan, Sentinel Valve Works]], mining machinery from Mining Engineering Company (MECO) \u2013 later part of [[Joy Mining Machinery]], and open-top cans from Williamsons, although G. H. Williamson and Sons had become part of the Metal Box Co in 1930. Later the company became Carnaud Metal Box PLC.\n\nWorcester Porcelain operated in Worcester until 2009, when the factory closed down due to the recession. However, the site still houses the [[Museum of Royal Worcester]], which is open daily to visitors.<ref name=\"Porcelain Museum\" />\n\nOne of Worcester's most famous products, [[Lea & Perrins]] [[Worcestershire sauce]], is made and bottled at the Midland Road factory in Worcester, which has been its home since 16 October 1897. Messrs Lea and Perrins originally came together in a chemist's shop on the site of the Debenhams's store in Crowngate Shopping Centre.\n\nWorcester has what is claimed to be the [[List of the oldest newspapers|oldest newspaper in the world]] still in publication: ''[[Berrow's Worcester Journal]]''. It traces its descent from a news-sheet started in 1690.\n\nThe surprising foundry heritage of the city is represented by Morganite Crucible at Norton which produces graphitic shaped products and cements for use in the modern industry.<ref name=\"Morganite\" /> The city is home to the European manufacturing plant of [[Yamazaki Mazak Corporation]], a global [[Japan]]ese [[machine tool builder]] established here in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mazak.com/mazak-history/ |title=Mazak History |publisher=Yamazaki Mazak Corporation |accessdate=29 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092910/https://www.mazak.com/mazak-history/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWorcester Heating systems was started in the city in 1962 by [[Cecil Duckworth]].

The High Street was partly modernised in 2005 amid controversy and further modernised in 2015, with current redevelopment of Cathedral Plaza and Lychgate Shopping Centre. Much of the protest came at the felling old trees, the duration of the works (caused by weather and an archaeological find) and the removal of flagstones outside the city's 18th-century Guildhall.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/11639198.At_least___500_000_to_be_pumped_into_sprucing_up_Worcester_city_centre |title=At least \u00a3500000 to be pumped into sprucing up Worcester City Centre |date=December 2014 |newspaper=[[Worcester News]] |accessdate=4 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803052226/http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/11639198.At_least___500_000_to_be_pumped_into_sprucing_up_Worcester_city_centre/|archive-date=3 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe other main thoroughfares are the Shambles and Broad Street, while the Cross (and its immediate surrounding area) is the city's financial centre for the majority of Worcester's main bank branches.\n\nThere are three main covered shopping centres in the city centre: [[CrownGate Shopping Centre]], Cathedral Plaza and Reindeer Court. There is also an unenclosed shopping area immediately east of the city centre called St Martin's Quarter. There are three retail parks, the Elgar and Blackpole retail parks located in the [[inner suburb]] of Blackpole, and the Shrub Hill Retail Park in neighbouring St. Martin's Quarter.

Its crypt dates from the 10th century. It includes the only circular chapter house in the country. The cathedral houses the tomb of [[John of England|King John]].\n\nNear the cathedral is the spire of St Andrew's Church, known as [[Glover's Needle]].

At its settlement in 7th century by the Angles of Mercia it was ''Weogorna''. After centuries of warfare against the Vikings and Danelaw it had become a centre for the Anglo-Saxon army or ''here'' known as ''Weogorna ceastre'' (Worcester Camp). Between the 10th and 12th centuries, when scholasticism flourished, it became ''Wirccester''. The county later developed from the ''Wigornia'' shire of the Anglo-Norman period, with foundations of market fairs by the Henrician and Edwardian parliaments (1216\u20131377). It was still known as County Wigorn in 1750,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} with its Shire Courts divided into hundreds.\n\nThe [[Weorgoran]] were probably a sub-tribe of the larger kingdom of the [[Hwicce]], which occupied present-day Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and western Wiltshire. They would have entered the area some time after the 577 [[Battle of Dyrham]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=Anglo-Saxon England |last=Stenton |first=Frank |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1943 |isbn=0-19-280139-2 |location=Oxford |pages=44, 422}}</ref>In 680, Worcester was chosen as their fort over the larger [[Gloucester]], and the royal court at [[Winchcombe]] as the [[episcopal see]] of a new [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|bishopric]], suggesting there was already an established and powerful [[Celtic Christianity|Christian]] community when the site [[Saxon invasions of England|fell into English hands]]. The oldest known church was [[Saint Helen of Caernarfon|St Helen]]'s, which was certainly of British origin. The later Saxon cathedral was dedicated to [[St Peter]].<ref name=\"subromancow\" />\n\nWorcester appears often in pre-Viking historic records. Frequent references to the church and monastic communities give evidence of extensive land ownership by the Church. The earls of [[Mercia]] in [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]'s reign fortified it \"for protection of all the people\", at the request of Bishop Werfrith. Its defences were to be maintained at the expense of the townspeople. A document detailing this and privileges granted to the Church notes the existence of Worcester market and borough court, differentiates between church and market quarters in the city, and specifies the role of the King in relation to the roads.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\">{{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1924}}</ref>\n\nWorcester's fortifications are likely to have followed the line of the wall, extant until the 1600s, except possibly in the south-east area near the early castle. It is referred to at the time as a wall and so may have been of stone.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n[[File:Oswald and Eadnoth.jpg|thumb|Oswald and Eadnoth]]\nWorcester became a centre of monastic learning and church power. [[Oswald of Worcester]], appointed Bishop in 961, was an important reformer alongside the Archbishop of York. The last Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Worcester, St [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Wulfstan]] or Wulstan, was a reformer, who remained in office until he died in 1095.\n\nWorcester became a focus of tax resistance against the Danish [[Harthacnut (1020\u20131042)|Harthacanute]]. Two [[huscarl]]s were killed in May 1041 while seeking to collect taxes for the expanded navy, and been driven into the Priory. A military force composed of the country's powerful earls and their thegns was sent to deal with the non-payment. It included Siward, Earl of Northumbria, Earl Godwine of Wessex and Leofric Earl of Mercia, who was himself ruler of the Hwicce and from a family of traditional ealdormen of that tribal hidage.<ref name=\":0\" /> The townspeople tried to defend themselves by occupying the Severn island of Bevere, two miles up river. After Harthacnut's men had sacked the city and set it alight, agreement was reached and the populace returned to rebuild its city.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester possessed a mint in the late Anglo-Saxon period, with seven moneyers in the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]]. This implies a middling role in trade for the city.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n===Medieval===\n====Early medieval====\nWorcester was counted for tax purposes within the neighbouring rural hundreds at the start of the Norman period, but was administratively independent.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Its growth and position as a market town for goods and produce rested on its river crossing and bridge and its position on the road network. The nearest bridges over the Severn were at [[Gloucester]] and [[Bridgnorth]] in the 14th century. The main road from London to mid-Wales ran through Worcester, then north-west to Kidderminster, Bridgnorth and Shrewsbury, and via Bromsgrove to Coventry and on to Derby. Southward it connected with Tewkesbury and Gloucester.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThere had been a bridge in Worcester since at least the 11th century. It was replaced in the early 14th century by one situated below the current Newport Street. It had six arches on piers with [[starling (architecture)|starlings]], the middle pier having a gatehouse.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe upkeep of the city walls was paid for by the residents. Its somewhat irregular course included bastions and a watercourse. The entrances to the city were through defensive gates built at various times, including St Martin's in the east, Sidbury to the south, Friar Gate, Edgar Tower, and Water Gate. There were six gates by the 16th century.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n[[File:Worcester Cathedral Cloister, Worcestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The medieval cloisters]]\nWorcester was also a centre of religious life. The several monasteries up to the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] included [[Worcester Greyfriars|Greyfriars]], [[Worcester Blackfriars|Blackfriars]], the Penitent Sisters, and the Benedictine Priory, now Worcester Cathedral.<ref>{{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1971b |pp=167\u2013173}}</ref> Monastic houses provided hospital and educational services, including [[Royal Grammar School Worcester|Worcester School]]. St Wulstan's Hospital was founded about 1085, but dissolved with the monasteries in 1540. St Oswald's Hospital may have been founded by [[Oswald of Worcester|St Oswald]]. Much land and property in Worcester were held by the church.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nDomesday Book (1086) also records many town houses belonging to rural landowners, presumably used as residences while selling produce from their lands.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> In the 1100s, Worcester suffered a number of city fires. The first, on 19 June 1113, destroyed town, castle and cathedral. A second ensued in November 1131.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe 12th-century town (then better defended) was attacked in 1139, 1150 and 1151 during the civil war between [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and [[Empress Matilda]], daughter of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]. The 1139 attack again resulted in a fire that destroyed part of the city, with citizens being held for ransom. Another fire in 1189 destroyed much of the city for the fourth time that century.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester received its first [[royal charter]] in 1189. This set the annual payment made to the Crown at \u00a324 a year and stipulated that the city would deal directly with the Crown Exchequer, not through the county [[sheriff]], who would no longer have jurisdiction over the city. However, Worcester's charter was not renewed under [[John, King of England|King John]], who could levy increased arbitrary taxation or [[tallage]], demanding \u00a3100 in 1214.\n\nIn 1227 under [[King Henry III of England|King Henry III]], Worcester regained its charter and was granted more freedoms. The annual tax was raised to \u00a330. The county sheriff was again removed from his role of representing the city to the Crown, except in limited circumstances. A guild of merchants was created, with a trading monopoly for those admitted. [[Villein]]s who resided in the city for a year and day became members of the guild and were to be deemed free. The charter was renewed in 1264.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Worcester's institutions grew more slowly than those of most county towns and had detectably archaic sides to them, probably due to the power of the local aristocracy.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n====Jewish persecution and expulsions====\nWorcester had a small [[Jewish community of Worcester#The Jews in Worcester in the Middle Ages|Jewish population]] by the late 12th century. It was one of a number of places allowed to keep records of debts, in an official locked chest known as an ''archa''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1727-archa |title=ARCHA |website=Jewishencyclopedia.com |accessdate=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802180705/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1727-archa |archive-date=2 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Jewish life probably centred around what is now Copenhagen Street.\n\nThe Diocese was hostile to the Jewish community. [[Peter of Blois]] was commissioned by a Bishop of Worcester, probably [[John of Coutances]], to write an anti-Judaic treatise, ''Against the Perfidy of Jews'', around 1190.<ref>{{harvnb |de Blois |1194}}, {{harvnb |Lazare |1903}}</ref>\n\n[[William de Blois (bishop of Worcester)|William de Blois]] as Bishop of Worcester imposed strict rules on Jews within the diocese in 1219.<ref>{{harvnb |Vincent |1994 |p=217}}</ref> As elsewhere in England, Jews were compelled to wear square white badges, supposedly representing ''tabulae''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-badge |title=Jewish Badge |website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106150945/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-badge |archive-date=6 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In most places, this requirement was waived as long as fines were paid. While enforcing the church edicts on wearing badges, Blois tried to impose additional restrictions on [[usury]]. He wrote to [[Pope Gregory IX]] in 1229 to request better powers of enforcement and further, harsher measures, which were granted.<ref>{{harvnb |Vincent |1994 |p=209}}</ref>\n\nA national assembly of Jewish notables was summoned to Worcester by the Crown in 1240 to assess their wealth for taxation. There [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] \"squeezed the largest tallage of the thirteenth century from his Jewish subjects.\"<ref>{{harvnb |Mundill |2002 |pp=58\u201360}}</ref>\n\nIn 1263 Worcester's Jewish residents were attacked by a baronial force under [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby|Robert Earl Ferrers]] and [[Henry de Montfort]]. Most were killed.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Ferrers used this chance to remove titles to his debts by seizing the ''archae''.<ref>{{harvnb |Mundill |2002 |p=42}}</ref> The Worcester massacre was part of a wider campaign by allies of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] at the start of the [[Second Barons' War]]. A massacre of London Jewry also occurred. In 1275, Jews still in Worcester were expelled to [[Hereford]],<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> under anti-Jewish terms for towns under the jurisdiction of the Queen Mother.<ref>{{harvnb |Mundill |2002 |p=23}}</ref>\n\n====Late medieval====\nWorcester's Ordinances of the sixth year of Edward IV, renewed in 1496\u20131497 in 82 clauses, give a detailed picture of city life and organisation in the late [[medieval]] period, as enforced by its bailiffs. Chamberlains received and accounted for rents and other income, and the use of common lands in Worcester was laid down. Trade regulations covered bread and ale. Others dealt with sanitation, fire regulations and upkeep of the city wall, quays and pavements. Public order and crimes, including affray, are covered. Citizens were given the privilege of being imprisoned underneath the [[Worcester Guildhall|Guildhall]] rather than in the town jail, except for the most serious offences.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe cloth industry was also regulated by the Ordinances. Apart from setting weights and measures, they sought to protect artisans engaged in the trade. Payment in kind was banned, with fines of 20 shillings for those paying otherwise than in gold and silver. Employees had to be living in the city and its suburbs.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester elected members of Parliament at the Guildhall, by the loudest shout rather than raising of hands. Members of Parliament had to own freehold property worth 40 shillings a year and be \"of good name and fame, not outlawed, not acombred in accyons as nygh as men may knowe, for worshipp of the seid cite\".<ref>Ordinances quoted {{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1924}}</ref> Their wages were levied by the Constable.\n\nThe city council was organised by a system of co-option, with 24 members of the high chamber and 48 of the lower. Committees appointed two bailiffs and made financial decisions; the two chambers agreed the city's rules or ordinances.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nBy late medieval times the population had reached 1,025 families, excluding the cathedral quarter, so that it probably stood under 10,000.<ref>See Green, in History of Worcester Volume ii.</ref> Worcester's suburbs extended beyond the limits of its walls<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nManufacture of cloth and allied trades began locally. Leland stated in the mid 1500s, for instance, that \"the welthe of the towne of Worcestar standithe most by draping, and noe towne of England, at this present tyme, maketh so many cloathes yearly as this towne doth.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1924}}</ref> The glove-making trade also had its roots in this period.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n===Craft guilds===\nMedieval and early modern Worcester developed a system of craft [[guild|gild]]s to regulate who could work in a trade, lay down trade practices and training, and provide social support for members. The city's late medieval ordinances banned tilers from forming a guild and encouraged tilers to settle in Worcester to trade freely. Roofs of thatch and wooden chimneys were banned in order to reduce risks of fire.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:Worcester, 1610 map.jpg|thumb|Worcester, 1610 map]] The Dissolution saw the Priory's status change, as it lost its Benedictine monks. There were around 36 monks and a Prior at the dissolution in 1540. Some 16 were given pensions immediately or soon after, the rest being employed in the new Deanery. It was necessary to set up \"public\" schools to replace monastic education in Worcester, as elsewhere. This led to the establishment of [[King's School, Worcester|King's School]]. Worcester School continued to teach. St Oswald's Hospital survived the dissolution, later providing [[almshouses]];<ref>{{harvnb |Willis-Bund |Page |1971a |pp=175\u2013179}}</ref> the charity and its housing survives to the present day.\n\nThe city gained the right to elect a [[Mayor]], and was designated a [[county corporate]] in 1621, giving it autonomy from local government. From this point, Worcester was governed by a mayor, recorder and six aldermen. Councillors were selected by co-option.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nWorcester contained green spaces such as orchards and fields between its main streets, within the city wall, as appears on Speed's map of 1610. The walls were still more or less complete at the time, but suburbs had been established beyond them.\n\n====Civil war====\n{{more information|Worcestershire in the English Civil War|Battle of Worcester}}\n[[File:Battle of Worcester.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Worcester]]\nWorcester equivocated, but eventually sided with Parliament before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642. It was swiftly occupied by the Royalists, who billeted troops in the city and used the Cathedral to store munitions. [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]] briefly retook the city for Parliament after the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], the first engagement of the war. Parliamentary troops then ransacked the Cathedral. Stained glass was smashed and the organ destroyed, along with library books and monuments.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\nEssex was soon forced to withdraw after the [[Battle of Edgehill]], and the city spent the rest of the war under Royalist occupation, as did most of the county. Worcester was a garrison town and had to bear the expense of sustaining and billeting a large number of Royalist troops. During the Royalist occupation, the suburbs were destroyed to make defence easier. Responsibility for maintenance of defences was transferred to the military command. High taxation was imposed, and many male residents [[Impressment|impressed]] into the army.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004}}</ref>\n\nAs Royalist power collapsed in May 1646, Worcester was placed under siege. Worcester had some 5,000 civilians and a Royalist garrison of about 1,500 men facing a [[New Model Army]] force of 2,500\u20135,000. The city surrendered on 23 July, bringing the first civil war to a close in Worcestershire.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=125\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nIn 1651 a Scottish army, 16,000 strong, marched south along the west coast in support of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s attempt to regain the Crown. As the army approached, Worcester Council voted to surrender, fearing further violence and destruction. The Parliamentary garrison withdrew to [[Evesham]] in the face of the overwhelming numbers against them. The Scots were billeted in and around the city, again at great expense and causing further anxiety among residents. The Scots were joined by very limited local forces, including a company of 60 men under [[Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury|Francis Talbot]].<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=142\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Worcester]] took place on 3 September 1651 in fields to the west and south of the city, near the village of [[Powick]]. Charles II was easily defeated by Cromwell's forces of 30,000 men. Charles II returned to his headquarters in what is now known as King Charles House in the Cornmarket, before fleeing in disguise with Talbot's help to [[Boscobel House]] in [[Shropshire]], from where he eventually escaped to France. Worcester was then heavily looted by the Parliamentarian army. The city council estimated \u00a380,000 of damage was done and the subsequent debts were still not recovered in the 1670s.<ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |2004 |pp=142\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1646 to 1660, the Bishopric was abolished and the Cathedral fell into disrepair.\n\n====After the Restoration====\nAfter the Restoration in 1660, Worcester cleverly used its location as the site of the final battles of the First Civil War (1646) and Third Civil War (1651) to mount an appeal for compensation from [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Though unbased on historical fact, it invented the epithet ''Fidelis Civitas'' (The Faithful City), since included in the city's [[coat of arms]].<ref name=\"Civic Heralrdy\" /><ref>{{harvnb |Atkin |1998}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Guildhall, High Street, Worcester.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Worcester Guildhall]]\nThe Guildhall rebuilt in 1721 to replace an earlier one on the site is a [[Grade I listed]] [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne-style]] building described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] as a town hall \"as splendid as any of C18 England\".<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-488872-guildhall-worcestershire Guildhall \u2013 Worcester \u2013 Worcestershire \u2013 England] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430232747/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-488872-guildhall-worcestershire |date=30 April 2015}}.

As the city population expanded, the green areas between the main streets filled with housing and back streets, so that the extent of the city and suburbs remained much the same as in the early 1600s. Large stretches of the city walls had been removed by 1796.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Meanwhile the [[Royal Worcester|Royal Worcester Porcelain Company]] factory was founded by [[John Wall (physician)|Dr John Wall]] in 1751. Production continued until 2009. A handful of decorators are still employed at the factory, and the museum on the site remains open. Since 2015 there has been re-development there devoted to housing.\n\n===Industrial revolution and Victorian era===\n[[File:Worcester in 1806. Engraving by J.Roper from a drawing by G.Cole.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Map of Worcester in 1806]]\nWorcester in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was a major centre for glove making, employing nearly half the glovers in England at its peak (over 30,000 people).<ref name=\"WorcesterGloveMaking\" /> In 1815 the [[Worcester and Birmingham Canal]] opened, allowing Worcester goods to be transported more easily.\n\nRiots took place in 1831, in response to the defeat of the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]], reflecting discontent with the city administration and the wider lack of democratic representation.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" /> Riots occurred elsewhere, including [[Bristol riots|Bristol]]. Local government reform took place in 1835, which for the first time created election procedures for councillors, but also restricted the ability of the city to buy and sell property, requiring Treasury permission.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nUp until 1835, the legal distinction between a select group of citizens with specific privileges and other residents of the town had survived.<ref name=\"bhoworcester\" />\n\nThe [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) was founded in the Board Room of the old Worcester Royal Infirmary building in Castle Street in 1832.<ref name=\"BMA\" /> While part of the Royal Infirmary has now been demolished to make way for the [[University of Worcester]]'s new city campus, the original Georgian building has been preserved.<ref name=\"BBC 2008\" /> One of the old wards opened as a medical museum, the Infirmary, in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worcester.ac.uk/your-home/the-infirmary.html |title=The Infirmary \u2013 University of Worcester |website=Worcester.ac.uk |accessdate=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303012856/http://www.worcester.ac.uk/your-home/the-infirmary.html |archive-date=3 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Museum\" />\n\nRailways opened in Worcester in 1850, with [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Shrub Hill]], jointly owned by the [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]] and [[Midland Railway]], initially running to Birmingham only. [[Worcester Foregate Street railway station|Foregate Street]] was opened in 1860 by the Hereford and Worcester Railway, quickly incorporated into the [[West Midland Railway]]. The WMR lines became part of the [[Great Western Railway]] after 1 August 1863. The railways also gave Worcester thousands of jobs with the just under half of all [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] passenger coaches built in Worcester and the three signalling factories including the largest [[railway signalling]] company in the World: [[McKenzie & Holland]].\n\nIn 1882 Worcester hosted the Worcestershire Exhibition, inspired by the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] in London. There were sections for exhibits of fine arts (over 600 paintings), historical manuscripts and industrial items. The profit was \u00a31,867.9s.6d. The number of visitors is recorded as 222,807. Some of the profit from the exhibition was used to build the Victoria Institute in Foregate Street, Worcester. This was opened on 1 October 1896 and originally housed the city art gallery and museum; now located on Foregate Street.{{Citation needed|reason=details, dates and stats should be referenced/referenceable|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Twentieth century to present===\nRail reorganisation in 1922 saw the Midland Railway's routes from Shrub Hill absorbed into the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the city was chosen to be the seat of an evacuated government in case of mass [[Operation Sealion|German invasion]]. The [[War Cabinet]], along with [[Winston Churchill]] and some 16,000 state workers, would have moved to [[Hindlip Hall]] (now part of the complex forming the Headquarters of [[West Mercia Police]]), {{convert|3|mi|km}} north of Worcester and [[Houses of Parliament|Parliament]] would have temporarily seated in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].

There were six 4,000 ton semi-buried tanks for the storage of white oils. It had no rail or road loading facilities but distribution could be carried out by barge through the [[Diglis Basin|Diglis basin]] and the depot could receive fuel either by barge or the GPSS pipeline network. It was at one time used as a civil reserve storing gas oil and then stored aviation kerosene for USAFE.

The late Victorian period saw the growth of ironfounders like [[Heenan & Froude]], Hardy & Padmore and McKenzie & Holland.\n\n===Glove industry===\n[[File:Gloves, Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum, England - DSCF0752.JPG|thumb|150px|Gloves, [[Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum]]]]\nOne of the flourishing industries was glove making, which peaked between 1790 and 1820, when about 30,000 were employed by 150 firms. At this time nearly half the glove manufacturers of Britain were located in Worcestershire.\n\nIn the 19th century, the industry declined as import taxes on foreign competitors, mainly French, were greatly reduced. By the mid-20th century, only a few Worcester glove companies survived since gloves became less fashionable and free trade enabled cheaper imports from the [[Far East]]. Nevertheless, at least three glove manufacturers survived until the late 20th century: [[Dents|Dent Allcroft]], Fownes and Milore. Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s coronation gloves were designed by Emil Rich and manufactured in the Worcester Milore factory.<ref name=\"GloveMaking\" /><ref name=\"WorcesterNews21062010\" />\n\n===Manufacturing===\n[[File:leaperrins.png|thumb|150px|[[Lea & Perrins]] advertisement (1900)]]\nThe inter-war years saw rapid growth in engineering and machine-tool manufacturing firms such as James Archdale and H. W. Ward, castings for the motor industry from Worcester Windshields and Casements, valve design and manufacture from [[Sentinel Valve Works|Alley & MacLellan, Sentinel Valve Works]], mining machinery from Mining Engineering Company (MECO) \u2013 later part of [[Joy Mining Machinery]], and open-top cans from Williamsons, although G. H. Williamson and Sons had become part of the Metal Box Co in 1930. Later the company became Carnaud Metal Box PLC.\n\nWorcester Porcelain operated in Worcester until 2009, when the factory closed down due to the recession. However, the site still houses the [[Museum of Royal Worcester]], which is open daily to visitors.<ref name=\"Porcelain Museum\" />\n\nOne of Worcester's most famous products, [[Lea & Perrins]] [[Worcestershire sauce]], is made and bottled at the Midland Road factory in Worcester, which has been its home since 16 October 1897. Messrs Lea and Perrins originally came together in a chemist's shop on the site of the Debenhams's store in Crowngate Shopping Centre.\n\nWorcester has what is claimed to be the [[List of the oldest newspapers|oldest newspaper in the world]] still in publication: ''[[Berrow's Worcester Journal]]''. It traces its descent from a news-sheet started in 1690.\n\nThe surprising foundry heritage of the city is represented by Morganite Crucible at Norton which produces graphitic shaped products and cements for use in the modern industry.<ref name=\"Morganite\" /> The city is home to the European manufacturing plant of [[Yamazaki Mazak Corporation]], a global [[Japan]]ese [[machine tool builder]] established here in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mazak.com/mazak-history/ |title=Mazak History |publisher=Yamazaki Mazak Corporation |accessdate=29 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092910/https://www.mazak.com/mazak-history/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWorcester Heating systems was started in the city in 1962 by [[Cecil Duckworth]].

The High Street was partly modernised in 2005 amid controversy and further modernised in 2015, with current redevelopment of Cathedral Plaza and Lychgate Shopping Centre. Much of the protest came at the felling old trees, the duration of the works (caused by weather and an archaeological find) and the removal of flagstones outside the city's 18th-century Guildhall.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/11639198.At_least___500_000_to_be_pumped_into_sprucing_up_Worcester_city_centre |title=At least \u00a3500000 to be pumped into sprucing up Worcester City Centre |date=December 2014 |newspaper=[[Worcester News]] |accessdate=4 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803052226/http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/11639198.At_least___500_000_to_be_pumped_into_sprucing_up_Worcester_city_centre/|archive-date=3 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe other main thoroughfares are the Shambles and Broad Street, while the Cross (and its immediate surrounding area) is the city's financial centre for the majority of Worcester's main bank branches.\n\nThere are three main covered shopping centres in the city centre: [[CrownGate Shopping Centre]], Cathedral Plaza and Reindeer Court. There is also an unenclosed shopping area immediately east of the city centre called St Martin's Quarter. There are three retail parks, the Elgar and Blackpole retail parks located in the [[inner suburb]] of Blackpole, and the Shrub Hill Retail Park in neighbouring St. Martin's Quarter.

Its crypt dates from the 10th century. It includes the only circular chapter house in the country. The cathedral houses the tomb of [[John of England|King John]].\n\nNear the cathedral is the spire of St Andrew's Church, known as [[Glover's Needle]].
