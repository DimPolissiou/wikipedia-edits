He spends his time wandering around town with his best friend Montgomery \"Mont\" Allen, whom he also lives with, along with Mont's grandfather. Jimmie waits for the bus with Mont every day, during which they see various states of change in the city and protesters trying to stop it. The two then skateboard to a Victorian house in the city's [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore District]] that Jimmie grew up in and says was built by his grandfather in 1946. The home is currently occupied by an older couple, and Jimmie often laments to Mont about how the couple doesn't take care of the house while doing his best to remodel it himself. One day, Jimmie and Mont visit the house only to find the woman crying on her husband's shoulder and movers taking the couple's things.\n\nJimmie and Mont go to a local realtor, who informs them that the woman's mother had died and now she and her sister are fighting over the house. They use this opportunity to visit the now vacant house and be free to finally re-explore the house in its entirety. Deciding to take up residence, the pair visit Jimmie's aunt Wanda, who gives them the interior decorations that they had when living there. Jimmie and Mont ride back to the home with the help of Wanda's husband, Ricky, and unpack the items, displaying them throughout the house.\n\nOne night, Mont invites Kofi, a childhood friend of Jimmie's and his, to the house, and the three enjoy a night of relaxation. However, the next day, Kofi says hurtful things to Jimmie about his father to appear dominant after being called \"feminine\" by his friends. Jimmie and Mont later find out from Kofi's friends that he has been killed by a man he had a scuffle with. At the same time, the pair find that their possessions have been thrown out of the house and left on the sidewalk, in addition to a sign posted by the realtor they went to earlier. Feeling betrayed, Jimmie fights back by putting all of it right back in. Mont, however, goes to the realtor, who reveals that the house wasn't built by Jimmie's grandfather, and has the deed to prove that it was actually built in the 1850s.\n\nMont writes a play about the aftermath of Kofi's death and encourages Jimmie to advertise it to passersby, holding it in the \"witch hat\" of the house. On the day of the performance, Jimmie's estranged father, who he had previously gotten into an argument with, shows. During the performance, Mont shows various social media posts about Kofi's death, all of which he proclaims show that these people never really knew Kofi. He asks various people in the crowd to recount their opinions on Kofi, including Jimmie, who says that even though the last thing that Kofi ever said to him was mean, his experience with him in a group home was friendly, saying that \"people aren't one thing\". Mont then confronts Jimmie with the truth that Jimmie's grandfather did not build the house. This angers Jimmie, who storms out, followed by the rest of the play's audience.\n\nJimmie reunites with Mont at the dock before going home, telling him that he knew all along that his grandfather didn't build the house. He watches TV with Mont and Grandpa Allen before going to bed. Mont wakes up and finds Jimmie gone, with a note that thanks Mont for being his best friend. Mont is left alone, and while he continues the various daily activities that the two would share, when done alone they no longer carry the same sense of joy. He watches from the dock, where Jimmie is far away, rowing in the water outside the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jimmie Fails]] as Jimmie Fails\n* [[Jonathan Majors]] as Montgomery \"Mont\" Allen\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Grandpa Allen\n* [[Tichina Arnold]] as Wanda Fails\n* [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] as James Sr.\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Bobby\n* [[Finn Wittrock]] as Clayton Newsom\n* Isiain Lalime as Gunna (of Chorus)\n* Jamal Trulove as Kofi (of Chorus)\n* Jordan Gomes as Jordan (of Chorus)\n* Maximilienne Ewalt as Mary\n* [[Jello Biafra]] as Tour Guide\n* [[San Quinn]] as Grown Ass Man\n* [[Daewon Song]] as Uncle Ricky\n* Andy Roy as Andy\n* Willie Hen as The Preacher\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Becca\n* Tonya Glanz as Nina\n* Sergio Gonzalez as Banker\n* Wynner Gonzalez as Andrew Joseph\n}}\n\n==Production==\nTalbot and Fails grew up together in [[San Francisco]] and first discussed the possibility of making the movie as teenagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hoodline.com/2015/04/meet-the-misfits-behind-the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco|title=Meet The Misfits Behind 'The Last Black Man In San Francisco'|website=Hoodline|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> However, they found it difficult to make the film in the City due to the lack of a film scene within the region<ref>{{Citation|title=Jimmie Fails & Joe Talbot Speaks on 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco' {{!}} Sway's Universe|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXi79H0esGY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> and neither of them had any proper film training nor knew anybody within the industry.<ref name=\"apnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/24f15b705fb84e8da325868c96045311|title=The newcomers behind 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco'|date=2019-06-13|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Talbot got some initial advice on how to start from a cold email to [[Barry Jenkins]], who shot ''[[Medicine for Melancholy]]'' (2008) in San Francisco, before he left to shoot [[Moonlight (2016 film)|''Moonlight'']] (2016).<ref name=\"apnews.com\"/>\n\nIn May 2015, the two shot a preview trailer to raise funds for the making of the film and launched a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign that ultimately surpassed their goal of $50,000 by more than $25,000.<ref name=\"sfchronicle1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Childhood-friends-create-The-Last-Black-Man-in-6298033.php|title=Childhood friends create \"The Last Black Man in San Francisco\" -

He spends his time wandering around town with his best friend Montgomery \"Mont\" Allen, whom he also lives with, along with Mont's grandfather. Jimmie waits for the bus with Mont every day, during which they see various states of change in the city and protesters trying to stop it. The two then skateboard to a Victorian house in the city's [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore District]] that Jimmie grew up in and says was built by his grandfather in 1946. The home is currently occupied by an older couple, and Jimmie often laments to Mont about how the couple doesn't take care of the house while doing his best to remodel it himself. One day, Jimmie and Mont visit the house only to find the woman crying on her husband's shoulder and movers taking the couple's things.\n\nJimmie and Mont go to a local realtor, who informs them that the woman's mother had died and now she and her sister are fighting over the house. They use this opportunity to visit the now vacant house and be free to finally re-explore the house in its entirety. Deciding to take up residence, the pair visit Jimmie's aunt Wanda, who gives them the interior decorations that they had when living there. Jimmie and Mont ride back to the home with the help of Wanda's husband, Ricky, and unpack the items, displaying them throughout the house.\n\nOne night, Mont invites Kofi, a childhood friend of Jimmie's and his, to the house, and the three enjoy a night of relaxation. However, the next day, Kofi says hurtful things to Jimmie about his father to appear dominant after being called \"feminine\" by his friends. Jimmie and Mont later find out from Kofi's friends that he has been killed by a man he had a scuffle with. At the same time, the pair find that their possessions have been thrown out of the house and left on the sidewalk, in addition to a sign posted by the realtor they went to earlier. Feeling betrayed, Jimmie fights back by putting all of it right back in. Mont, however, goes to the realtor, who reveals that the house wasn't built by Jimmie's grandfather, and has the deed to prove that it was actually built in the 1850s.\n\nMont writes a play about the aftermath of Kofi's death and encourages Jimmie to advertise it to passersby, holding it in the \"witch hat\" of the house. On the day of the performance, Jimmie's estranged father, who he had previously gotten into an argument with, shows. During the performance, Mont shows various social media posts about Kofi's death, all of which he proclaims show that these people never really knew Kofi. He asks various people in the crowd to recount their opinions on Kofi, including Jimmie, who says that even though the last thing that Kofi ever said to him was mean, his experience with him in a group home was friendly, saying that \"people aren't one thing\". Mont then confronts Jimmie with the truth that Jimmie's grandfather did not build the house. This angers Jimmie, who storms out, followed by the rest of the play's audience.\n\nJimmie reunites with Mont at the dock before going home, telling him that he knew all along that his grandfather didn't build the house. He watches TV with Mont and Grandpa Allen before going to bed. Mont wakes up and finds Jimmie gone, with a note that thanks Mont for being his best friend. Mont is left alone, and while he continues the various daily activities that the two would share, when done alone they no longer carry the same sense of joy. He watches from the dock, where Jimmie is far away, rowing in the water outside the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jimmie Fails]] as Jimmie Fails\n* [[Jonathan Majors]] as Montgomery \"Mont\" Allen\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Grandpa Allen\n* [[Tichina Arnold]] as Wanda Fails\n* [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]] as James Sr.\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Bobby\n* [[Finn Wittrock]] as Clayton Newsom\n* Isiain Lalime as Gunna (of Chorus)\n* Jamal Trulove as Kofi (of Chorus)\n* Jordan Gomes as Jordan (of Chorus)\n* Maximilienne Ewalt as Mary\n* [[Jello Biafra]] as Tour Guide\n* [[San Quinn]] as Grown Ass Man\n* [[Daewon Song]] as Uncle Ricky\n* Andy Roy as Andy\n* Willie Hen as The Preacher\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Becca\n* Tonya Glanz as Nina\n* Sergio Gonzalez as Banker\n* Wynner Gonzalez as Andrew Joseph\n}}\n\n==Production==\nTalbot and Fails grew up together in [[San Francisco]] and first discussed the possibility of making the movie as teenagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hoodline.com/2015/04/meet-the-misfits-behind-the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco|title=Meet The Misfits Behind 'The Last Black Man In San Francisco'|website=Hoodline|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> However, they found it difficult to make the film in the City due to the lack of a film scene within the region<ref>{{Citation|title=Jimmie Fails & Joe Talbot Speaks on 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco' {{!}} Sway's Universe|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXi79H0esGY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> and neither of them had any proper film training nor knew anybody within the industry.<ref name=\"apnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/24f15b705fb84e8da325868c96045311|title=The newcomers behind 'The Last Black Man in San Francisco'|date=2019-06-13|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Talbot got some initial advice on how to start from a cold email to [[Barry Jenkins]], who shot ''[[Medicine for Melancholy]]'' (2008) in San Francisco, before he left to shoot [[Moonlight (2016 film)|''Moonlight'']] (2016).<ref name=\"apnews.com\"/>\n\nIn May 2015, the two shot a preview trailer to raise funds for the making of the film and launched a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign that ultimately surpassed their goal of $50,000 by more than $25,000.<ref name=\"sfchronicle1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Childhood-friends-create-The-Last-Black-Man-in-6298033.php|title=Childhood friends create \"The Last Black Man in San Francisco\" -

He lives with Juliet Higgins, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent assigned by Masters to protect the estate, and native Hawaiian Kumu Tuileta, who is the estate's cultural curator. (Juliet Higgins replaces the male character [[Jonathan Higgins]] from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2.

He lives with Juliet Higgins, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent assigned by Masters to protect the estate, and native Hawaiian Kumu Tuileta, who is the estate's cultural curator. (Juliet Higgins replaces the male character Jonathan Higgins from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2. Magnum is also frequently assisted by two former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], Rick Wright and TC Calvin. Rick is now a bar owner, while TC is a pilot whose main business is running helicopter tours of the islands. Magnum tends to butt heads with HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, but the two also help each other when needed.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as [[Thomas Magnum]], a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] who is a security consultant for the successful novelist Robin Masters, living in the guest house on his estate, while also working as a [[private investigator]]\n* [[Perdita Weeks]] as [[Jonathan Higgins#2018 reboot|Juliet Higgins]], a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent who is [[majordomo]] to Robin Masters; she and Magnum bicker but become allies\n* [[Zachary Knighton]] as Orville \"Rick\" Wright, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] veteran and former [[door gunner]], who runs his own [[tiki bar]] and is also a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]]\n* Stephen Hill as Theodore \"TC\" Calvin, a Marine veteran and [[helicopter]] pilot who runs helicopter tours of Hawaii and is a member of Magnum's team\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Teuila \"Kumu\" Tuileta, the cultural [[curator]] of Robin Masters' estate\n* [[Tim Kang]] as HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, who dislikes Magnum but usually comes to the team's aid when needed\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James Remar]] as Captain Buck Greene, Magnum's former C.O.\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Sebastian Nuzo, Magnum's friend who was killed in the pilot but recurs in flashbacks\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Francis \"Icepick\" Hofstetler, Rick's underworld-connected father figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |title=Corbin Bernsen Cast on ''Magnum P.I.'' as [Spoiler]'s Degenerate Father Figure |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=TVLine |date=November 20, 2018 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123200751/https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |archive-date=November 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bernsen guest starred in [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0 ]] in another part.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Luther H.

Relentlessly he sought an end to borough-mongers, [[Sinecure|sinecurists]] and \"tax-eaters\" (meaning a wide class of overpaid or corrupt bureaucrats). Early in life he was a loyal devotee of King and Country, but he later pushed for [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]], which helped bring about the [[Reform Act 1832]] and his election that year as one of two [[member of Parliament|MPs]] for the newly enfranchised borough of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. He also strongly advocated of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. His [[polemic]]s cover subjects from political reform to religion. His best known book is ''[[Rural Rides]]'' (1830, still in print).\n\n==Life==\n{{anchor|Early life}}\n===Early life (1763\u20131791)===\n[[File:Farnham Cobbett's birthplace.JPG|250px|thumb|left|William Cobbett's birthplace.]]\nWilliam Cobbett was born in Farnham, Surrey, on 9 March 1763, the third son of George Cobbett, a farmer and publican, and Anne Vincent.<ref name=\"ODNB\">[[Ian Dyck]], '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5734 Cobbett,  William  (1763\u20131835)]', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 23 July 2011.</ref> He was taught to read and write by his father and he started working from an early age.

He wrote ''The Soldier's Friend'' (1792), protesting against the low pay and harsh treatment of enlisted men in the British army.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Sensing that he was about to be indicted in retribution, he fled to France in March 1792 to avoid imprisonment.

C. Hansard]] in 1812.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> This unofficial record of parliamentary proceedings later became known officially as [[Hansard]].\n\nCobbett intended to campaign for Parliament in [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]] in 1806, but was persuaded by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald]] to let him campaign in his stead. Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \"buying\" votes.

He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in [[Newgate Prison]]. While in prison he wrote the pamphlet ''Paper Against Gold'',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cobbett |first=William |title=Paper Against Gold |url=https://archive.org/details/cobbettspaperaga00cobbrich |work=Cobbett's Paper Against Gold |publisher=California Digital Library |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> warning of the dangers of [[Banknote|paper money]], and also many essays and letters. On his release, a dinner was held in his honour in London, attended by 600 people and directed by [[Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet|Sir Francis Burdett]], who like Cobbett was a strong advocate of parliamentary reform.\n\n{{anchor|Two-Penny Trash}}\n\n===\"Two-Penny Trash\" (1812\u20131817)===\nBy 1815 the tax on newspapers had reached four [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] a copy. As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising [[William Wilberforce]] for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, for his personal wealth and opposition to bull and [[bear-baiting]], and particularly for his approval of \"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\".<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/251 251\u2013252]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816 Cobbett began publishing the ''Political Register'' as a pamphlet. It now sold for only two pence and soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings\u2014misgovernment; and to its proper corrective\u2014parliamentary reform.<ref>Samuel Bamford, ''Bamford's Passages in the Life of a Radical, and Early Days: Vol. II'' (London: T.

With the government intending to [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|suspend ''habeas corpus'']], and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett again fled to the United States.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at [[Liverpool]] for New York on the ship ''Importer'', with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John.\n\n===Refuge in the United States (1817\u20131819)===\n[[File:Cobbett - Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England, 1930 - 5214769.tif|thumb|''Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England'', 1930.]]\nCobbett lived for two years on a farm on [[Long Island]], where he wrote ''Grammar of the English Language'' and with help from [[William Benbow]], a friend in London, continued to issue the ''Political Register''. He also wrote ''The American Gardener'' (1821), one of the earliest horticultural books published in the United States.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nCobbett closely observed alcohol-drinking habits in the United States. He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Ronald G. Walters, ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett's arrival came soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. He joined with other [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years.\n\n[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The introduction of horse-powered threshing machines to farms was one of the principal causes of the [[Swing Riots]].]]\n\nIn 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]], but finished last in the poll. That year he also founded a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust ''(Robinia pseudoacacia)'', and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden, which turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety, he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of rural Englishmen. He began riding about the country observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing it, Cobbett also produced ''The Woodlands'' (1825), a book on [[silviculture]].<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nAlthough not a Catholic,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hanink |first=James G |date=November 2005 |title=William Cobbett.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of Parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.

He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born.

He believed that reforming [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]], including abolishing \"[[rotten borough]]s\", would ease the poverty of farm labourers. Relentlessly he sought an end to borough-mongers, [[Sinecure|sinecurists]] and \"tax-eaters\" (meaning a wide class of overpaid or corrupt bureaucrats). Early in life he was a loyal devotee of King and Country, but he later pushed for [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]], which helped bring about the [[Reform Act 1832]] and his election that year as one of two [[member of Parliament|MPs]] for the newly enfranchised borough of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. He also strongly advocated of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. His [[polemic]]s cover subjects from political reform to religion.

He wrote ''The Soldier's Friend'' (1792), protesting against the low pay and harsh treatment of enlisted men in the British army.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Sensing that he was about to be indicted in retribution, he fled to France in March 1792 to avoid imprisonment.

Cobbett initially prospered by teaching English to Frenchmen and translating texts from French into English. He later claimed that he had become a political writer by accident: during an English lesson one of his French students read aloud from a New York newspaper the addresses of welcome that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had sent to [[Joseph Priestley]] upon his arrival in America, along with Priestley's replies.

C. Hansard]] in 1812.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> This unofficial record of parliamentary proceedings later became known officially as [[Hansard]].\n\nCobbett intended to campaign for Parliament in [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]] in 1806, but was persuaded by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald]] to let him campaign in his stead. Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \"buying\" votes. This situation also encouraged his opposition to [[rotten borough]]s and belief in parliamentary reform.<ref>[[David Cordingly]], ''Cochrane the Dauntless: The Life and Adventures of Thomas Cochrane'', Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-7475-8545-9}}), pp. 105\u2013113.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Prison}}\n\n===Prison (1810\u20131812)===\n[[File:The Hampshire hog in the pound LOC ds.10846.jpg|thumb|The Hampshire hog in the pound]]\nCobbett was found guilty of treasonous [[libel]] on 15 June 1810, after objecting in ''The Register'' to the [[flogging]] at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] of local [[militia]]men by [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanoverians]]. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in [[Newgate Prison]]. While in prison he wrote the pamphlet ''Paper Against Gold'',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cobbett |first=William |title=Paper Against Gold |url=https://archive.org/details/cobbettspaperaga00cobbrich |work=Cobbett's Paper Against Gold |publisher=California Digital Library |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> warning of the dangers of [[Banknote|paper money]], and also many essays and letters. On his release, a dinner was held in his honour in London, attended by 600 people and directed by [[Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet|Sir Francis Burdett]], who like Cobbett was a strong advocate of parliamentary reform.\n\n{{anchor|Two-Penny Trash}}\n\n===\"Two-Penny Trash\" (1812\u20131817)===\nBy 1815 the tax on newspapers had reached four [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] a copy. As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising [[William Wilberforce]] for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, for his personal wealth and opposition to bull and [[bear-baiting]], and particularly for his approval of \"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\".<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/251 251\u2013252]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816 Cobbett began publishing the ''Political Register'' as a pamphlet. It now sold for only two pence and soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings\u2014misgovernment; and to its proper corrective\u2014parliamentary reform.<ref>Samuel Bamford, ''Bamford's Passages in the Life of a Radical, and Early Days: Vol. II'' (London: T.

With the government intending to [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|suspend ''habeas corpus'']], and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett again fled to the United States.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at [[Liverpool]] for New York on the ship ''Importer'', with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John.\n\n===Refuge in the United States (1817\u20131819)===\n[[File:Cobbett - Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England, 1930 - 5214769.tif|thumb|''Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England'', 1930.]]\nCobbett lived for two years on a farm on [[Long Island]], where he wrote ''Grammar of the English Language'' and with help from [[William Benbow]], a friend in London, continued to issue the ''Political Register''. He also wrote ''The American Gardener'' (1821), one of the earliest horticultural books published in the United States.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nCobbett closely observed alcohol-drinking habits in the United States. He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Ronald G. Walters, ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett's arrival came soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. He joined with other [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years.\n\n[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The introduction of horse-powered threshing machines to farms was one of the principal causes of the [[Swing Riots]].]]\n\nIn 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]], but finished last in the poll. That year he also founded a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust ''(Robinia pseudoacacia)'', and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden, which turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety, he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of rural Englishmen. He began riding about the country observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing it, Cobbett also produced ''The Woodlands'' (1825), a book on [[silviculture]].<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4\u20136\"/>\n\nAlthough not a Catholic,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hanink |first=James G |date=November 2005 |title=William Cobbett.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of Parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{Cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.  Sketch by [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]].]]\nIn 1829, Cobbett published ''Advice To Young Men'', in which he criticised ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by the Reverend [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]. That year he also published ''The English Gardener'', which he later updated and expanded. This book has been compared favourably with other contemporary garden tomes, such as [[John Claudius Loudon]]'s ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Gardening''.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\">Clifford-Smith, S., \"William Cobbett: cottager's friend\", ''Australian Garden History'', 19 (5), 2008, pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\nCobbett continued to publish controversy in the ''Political Register'' and was charged in July 1831 with [[seditious libel]] for a pamphlet entitled ''Rural War'', endorsing the Captain [[Swing Riots]], in which rioters were smashing farm machinery and burning haystacks. Cobbett successfully conducted his own defence.<ref>State Trials (New Series) II, 789.</ref>\n\nCobbett still sought to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the [[1832 Reform Act]], Cobbett won the seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]]. During later life, however, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], a fellow [[Member of Parliament|MP]], remarked that Cobbett's faculties were impaired by age; indeed that his [[paranoia]] had reached insanity.\n\nFrom 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of [[Normandy, Surrey]], a few miles from his birthplace at [[Farnham]]. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nDuring his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful:\n*1806 [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]]\n*1820 [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]]\n*1826 [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]]\n*1832 [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]]\n\nIn 1832 he was successfully elected as member for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Cobbett Grave 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of William Cobbett in the churchyard of St Andrew's church in Farnham.]]\nCobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti-government and democratic ideals. He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \"swagger about and be saucy to England.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \"bears the name of my country.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> [[Ian Dyck]] claimed that Cobbett endorsed \"the eighteenth-century [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] platform\".<ref>[[Ian Dyck]], 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, ''Rural Rides'' (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii.</ref> [[Edward Tangye Lean]] described him as \"an archaic English Tory\".<ref>[[Edward Tangye Lean]], ''The Napoleonists.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.
