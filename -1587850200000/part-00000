The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the [[Dutch Golden Age]], when [[:Category:Art of the Dutch Golden Age|Dutch art]] (especially [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch painting]]), although in many ways antithetical to the [[Baroque|Baroque style]] that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as [[Jan Vermeer]] of Delft, Rembrandt was also an avid [[art collector]] and [[art dealer|dealer]].\n\nRembrandt never went abroad, but he was considerably influenced by the work of the [[Italian masters]] and [[Netherlandish art]]ists who had studied in Italy, like [[Pieter Lastman]], the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]], and [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high,<ref>Gombrich, p. 427.</ref> and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters.<ref name=Clark_203>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203}}</ref>\n\nRembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. [[Self-portraits by Rembrandt|His self-portraits]] form a unique and intimate biography, in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity.<ref name=\"Gombrich, p. 420\"/> Rembrandt's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into a true [[art form]], along with [[Jacques Callot]]. His reputation as the greatest [[etcher]] in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime and never questioned since. Few of [[List of paintings by Rembrandt|his paintings]] left the [[Dutch Republic]] while he lived, but his [[old master prints|prints]] were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.\n\nIn his works he exhibited knowledge of classical [[iconography]], which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Jewish Amsterdam|Jewish population]].<ref name=Clark_203_204>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called \"one of the great prophets of civilization\".<ref name=Clark_205>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=205}}</ref> The French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] said, \"Compare me with Rembrandt!

Until then, he had signed with a combination of initials or monograms. In late 1632, he began signing solely with his first name, \"Rembrant\". He added the \"d\" in the following year and stuck to this spelling for the rest of his life. Although we can only speculate, this change must have had a meaning for Rembrandt, which is generally interpreted as his wanting to be known by his first name like the great figures of the Italian Renaissance: Leonardo, Raphael etc., who did not sign with their first names, if at all.

She admitted this and was banned from receiving communion.

The sale list survives and gives us a good insight into Rembrandt's collections, which, apart from [[Old Master]] paintings and drawings, included busts of the Roman Emperors, suits of Japanese armor among many objects from Asia, and collections of natural history and minerals.  But the prices realized in the sales in 1657 and 1658 were disappointing.<ref>Slive, p. 84</ref> Rembrandt was forced to sell his house and his printing-press and move to more modest accommodation on the [[Rozengracht]] in 1660.<ref>Schwartz, p. 12.

A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer's attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light\u2014an overwhelming clarity\u2014and a brooding duskiness.<ref>Taylor, Michael (2007).[http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html Rembrandt's Nose: Of Flesh & Spirit in the Master's Portraits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505200753/http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html |date=5 May 2016 }} p. 21, D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, Inc., New York {{ISBN|978-1-933045-44-3}}'</ref>\n\nIn a number of biblical works, including ''The Raising of the Cross'', ''Joseph Telling His Dreams'' and ''[[The Stoning of Saint Stephen]]'', Rembrandt painted himself as a character in the crowd. Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt \"a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life\".<ref>Durham, p. 60.</ref>\n\nAmong the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt's work are his use of [[chiaroscuro]], the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from [[Caravaggio]], or, more likely, from the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]], but adapted for very personal means.<ref>Bull, et al., pp. 11\u201313.</ref> Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age. His immediate family\u2014his wife Saskia, his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje\u2014often figured prominently in his paintings, many of which had [[mythology|mythical]], biblical or historical themes.\n\nDrawings by Rembrandt and his pupils have been extensively studied by many artists and scholars<ref>Such as [[Otto Benesch]], [[David Hockney]], [[Nigel Konstam]], [[Jakob Rosenberg (art historian)|Jakob Rosenberg]], [[Gary Schwartz (art historian)|Gary Schwartz]].</ref> through the centuries. His original draughtsmanship has been described as an individualistic art style that was very similar to East Asian old masters, most notably Chinese masters:<ref>Mendelowitz, Daniel Marcus: ''Drawing''. (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, Inc., 1967), p. 305. As Mendelowitz (1967) noted: \"Probably no one has combined to as great a degree as Rembrandt a disciplined exposition of what his eye saw and a love of line as a beautiful thing in itself. His \"Winter Landscape\" displays the virtuosity of performance of an Oriental master, yet unlike the Oriental calligraphy, it is not based on an established convention of brush performance. It is as personal as handwriting.\"</ref> a \"combination of formal clarity and [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] vitality in the movement of pen or brush that is closer to [[Chinese painting]] in technique and feeling than to anything in European art before the twentieth century\".<ref>Sullivan, Michael: ''The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art''. (University of California Press, 1989), p. 91</ref>\n\n===Periods, themes and styles===\nThroughout his career Rembrandt took as his primary subjects the themes of portraiture, landscape and narrative painting. For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - The Abduction of Europa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Abduction of Europa (Rembrandt)|''The Abduction of Europa'']], 1632. Oil on panel. The work has been described as  \"...a shining example of the 'golden age' of [[Baroque]] painting\".<ref>Clough, p. 23</ref>]]\n\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt's skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIt was during Rembrandt's Leiden period (1625\u20131631) that Lastman's influence was most prominent. It is also likely that at this time Lievens had a strong impact on his work as well.<ref name=Wetering-284>van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small, but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and [[allegory|allegorical]] themes were favored, as were [[tronie]]s.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1629 he completed ''[[Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver]]'' and ''[[Artist in his studio|The Artist in His Studio]]'', works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application, and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt, Portret van Haesje v.Cleyburg 1634.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical portrait from 1634, when Rembrandt was enjoying great commercial success]]\n\nDuring his early years in Amsterdam (1632\u20131636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (''[[The Blinding of Samson]]'', 1636, ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', c.&nbsp;1635 ''[[Dana\u00eb (Rembrandt)|Dana\u00eb]]'', 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of [[Rubens]].<ref>van de Wetering, p. 287.</ref> With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh's workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small ([[Jacob de Gheyn III (painting)|''Jacob de Gheyn&nbsp;III'']]) and large (''Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife'', 1633, ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', 1632).<ref>van de Wetering, p. 286.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1630s Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of [[landscape painting|landscapes]]. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (''Cottages before a Stormy Sky'', c.&nbsp;1641; ''The Three Trees'', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted ''[[The Night Watch]]'', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt - Zelfportret - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Self Portrait'', 1658, [[Frick Collection]], a masterpiece of the final style, \"the calmest and grandest of all his portraits\"<ref>Clark 1978, p. 28</ref>]]\n\nIn the decade following the ''Night Watch'', Rembrandt's paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (''Susanna and the Elders'', 1637\u201347).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163\u201365.</ref>\nAt the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\n\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt's style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of 'finish' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt's brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155\u201365.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting's surface. The end result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157\u201358, 190.</ref>\n\nIn later years biblical themes were still depicted often, but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (''James the Apostle'', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (''[[The Jewish Bride]]'', c.&nbsp;1666)\u2014in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt's (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering. Those keen and steady eyes that we know so well from Rembrandt's self-portraits must have been able to look straight into the human heart.\" Gombrich, p. 423.</ref><ref>\"It (''The Jewish Bride'') is a picture of grown-up love, a marvelous amalgam of richness, tenderness, and trust... the heads which, in their truth, have a spiritual glow that painters influenced by the classical tradition could never achieve.\" Clark, p. 206.</ref>\n\n===Etchings===\n[[File:Rembrandt - The windmill - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Windmill'', 1641, [[etching]]]]\n\nRembrandt produced [[etching]]s for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and practically abandoned etching. Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8\u201312</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he also learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing, but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5\u20136</ref> He worked on the so-called ''[[Hundred Guilder Print]]'' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9\u201310</ref>\n\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|left|''The Three Trees'', 1643, etching]]\n\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"plate tone,\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the twenty-seven self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. There are forty-six landscapes, mostly small, which largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings.<ref>See Schwartz, 1994, where the works are divided by subject, following [[Adam Bartsch|Bartsch]].</ref> He owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of prints by other artists, and many borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Hercules Seghers]], and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].\n\n===''The Night Watch''===\n{{main|The Night Watch}}\n[[File:La ronda de noche, por Rembrandt van Rijn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Night Watch]]'' or ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'', 1642. Oil on canvas; on display at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]\n\nRembrandt painted the large painting ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' between 1640 and 1642. This picture was called ''De Nachtwacht'' by the Dutch and ''The Night Watch'' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] because by the 18th century the picture was so dimmed and defaced that it was almost indistinguishable, and it looked quite like a night scene. After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day\u2014a party of [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight.\n\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the ''[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]'', the musketeer branch of the civic militia. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission (what kind of mission, an ordinary patrol or some special event, is a matter of debate).\n\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Amsterdam town hall]] in 1715; the Rijksmuseum has a smaller copy of what is thought to be the full original composition; the four figures in the front are at the centre of the canvas. The painting is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]].\n\n===Indian Miniatures===\n[[File:Rembrandt 208.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Rembrandt drawing of an Indian Mughal painting]]\nRembrandt was interested in [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniatures]], especially around the 1650s. He drew versions of some 23 Mughal paintings, and may have owned an album of them. These miniatures include paintings of [[Shah Jahan]], [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Dara Shikoh]].  They may also have influenced the costumes and other aspects of his works.<ref>Schrader, Stephanie; et al.

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future|url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\n\nOne example of activity is ''[[The Polish Rider]]'', in New York's [[Frick Collection]]. Rembrandt's authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century, but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn's remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost's authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick, with [[Simon Schama]] (in his 1999 book ''Rembrandt's Eyes'') and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both arguing for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt's authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the 'Lisowczyk' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., ''Artibus et Historiae'', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197\u2013205.

For example, the exact subject being portrayed in ''[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]'' (recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum) has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). ''Rembrandt's Eyes''. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp 582\u2013591.</ref>\n\nAnother painting, ''Pilate Washing His Hands'', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master's command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |publisher=Outpost Art |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing. In 2005 four oil paintings previously attributed to Rembrandt's students were reclassified as the work of Rembrandt himself: ''Study of an Old Man in Profile'' and ''Study of an Old Man with a Beard'' from a US private collection, ''[[Study of a Weeping Woman]]'', owned by the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], and ''Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet'', painted in 1640.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4276034.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Lost Rembrandt works discovered |publisher=BBC News  |date=23 September 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2009}}</ref> The ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' is a further example: in 2014, Professor [[Ernst van de Wetering]] offered his view to ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the demotion of the 1652 painting ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' \"was a vast mistake...it is a most important painting.

Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt's own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.<ref>\"...Rembrandt was not always the perfectly consistent, logical Dutchman he was originally anticipated to be.\" Ackley, p. 13.</ref> As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<ref>van de Wetering, p. x.</ref> It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.\n\n==Painting materials==\n[[File:Rembrandt - Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume - WGA19164.jpg|thumb|''Saskia as Flora'', 1635]]\n\nTechnical investigation of Rembrandt's paintings in the possession of the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden\u2019(Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Maltechnik/Restauro, issue 4 (1977): 223\u2013233</ref> and in the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel\u2019 (Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel), Maltechnik/Restauro, volume 82 (1976): 25\u201333</ref> has been conducted by Hermann K\u00fchn in 1977.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\", but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\". In 1633 he added&nbsp;a&nbsp;\"d\", and maintained this form consistently from then on, proving that this minor change had a meaning for him (whatever it might have been). This change is purely visual; it does not change the way his name is pronounced. Curiously enough, despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name, most of the documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original \"Rembrant\" spelling. (Note: the rough chronology of signature forms above applies to the paintings, and to a lesser degree to the etchings; from 1632, presumably, there is only one etching signed \"RHL-v.

The great shadow of the old master required a decided attitude. A late Romantic painter and critic, like [[Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin|Fromentin]] was, if he happened not to like some of Rembrandt's pictures, he felt obliged to justify his feeling. The greatness of the dramatic old master was for artists of about 1875 not a matter for doubt. 'Either I am wrong', Fromentin wrote from Holland 'or everybody else is wrong'. When Fromentin realized his inability to like some of the works by Rembrandt he formulated the following comments: 'I even do not dare to write down such a blasphemy; I would get ridiculed if this is disclosed'. Only about twenty-five years earlier another French Romantic master [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], when expressing his admiration for Rembrandt, has written in his ''Journal'' a very different statement: '... perhaps one day we will discover that Rembrandt is a much greater painter than [[Raphael]]. It is a blasphemy which would make hair raise on the heads of all the academic painters'. In 1851 the blasphemy was to put Rembrandt above Raphael. In 1875 the blasphemy was not to admire everything Rembrandt had ever produced.

[[Picasso]], [[Michelangelo]], possibly, might be verging on genius, but I don't think a painter like Rembrandt is a genius. It's about freedom and guts. It's about looking. It can be learned. That's the great thing about art. Anybody can do it if you just believe. With practice, you can make great paintings.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/14/damien-hirst-interview |author=Hattenstone, Simon |title=Damien Hirst: 'Anyone

His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the [[Dutch Golden Age]], when [[:Category:Art of the Dutch Golden Age|Dutch art]] (especially [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch painting]]), although in many ways antithetical to the [[Baroque|Baroque style]] that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as [[Jan Vermeer]] of Delft, Rembrandt was also an avid [[art collector]] and [[art dealer|dealer]].\n\nRembrandt never went abroad, but he was considerably influenced by the work of the [[Italian masters]] and [[Netherlandish art]]ists who had studied in Italy, like [[Pieter Lastman]], the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]], and [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high,<ref>Gombrich, p. 427.</ref> and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters.<ref name=Clark_203>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203}}</ref>\n\nRembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. [[Self-portraits by Rembrandt|His self-portraits]] form a unique and intimate biography, in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity.<ref name=\"Gombrich, p. 420\"/> Rembrandt's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into a true [[art form]], along with [[Jacques Callot]]. His reputation as the greatest [[etcher]] in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime and never questioned since. Few of [[List of paintings by Rembrandt|his paintings]] left the [[Dutch Republic]] while he lived, but his [[old master prints|prints]] were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.\n\nIn his works he exhibited knowledge of classical [[iconography]], which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Jewish Amsterdam|Jewish population]].<ref name=Clark_203_204>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called \"one of the great prophets of civilization\".<ref name=Clark_205>{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=205}}</ref> The French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] said, \"Compare me with Rembrandt!

Until then, he had signed with a combination of initials or monograms. In late 1632, he began signing solely with his first name, \"Rembrant\". He added the \"d\" in the following year and stuck to this spelling for the rest of his life.

In 1639 they moved to a prominent newly built house (now the [[Rembrandt House Museum]]) in the upscale 'Breestraat' (eng.: 'Broadway'), today known as [[Jodenbreestraat]] (Jodenbreestraat 4,1011 NK Amsterdam-now) in what was becoming the Jewish quarter; then a young upcoming neighborhood.

In 1640, they had a second daughter, also named Cornelia, who died after living barely over a month. Only their fourth child, [[Titus van Rijn|Titus]], who was born in 1641, survived into adulthood. Saskia died in 1642 soon after Titus's birth, probably from [[tuberculosis]]. Rembrandt's drawings of her on her sick and death bed are among his most moving works.<ref name=Slive-71>Slive, p. 71</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt van Rijn - Rembrandts zoon Titus in monniksdracht (Rijksmuseum Amsterdam).jpg|thumb|Rembrandt's son [[Titus as a Monk|Titus, as a monk]], 1660]]\n\nDuring Saskia's illness, [[Geertje Dircx]] was hired as Titus' caretaker and nurse and also became Rembrandt's lover.

In 1654 they had a daughter, Cornelia, bringing Hendrickje a summons from the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed Church]] to answer the charge \"that she had committed the acts of a whore with Rembrandt the painter\". She admitted this and was banned from receiving communion. Rembrandt was not summoned to appear for the Church council because he was not a member of the Reformed Church.<ref>Slive, p. 82</ref> The two were considered legally wed under common law, but Rembrandt had not married Hendrickje.

The sale list survives and gives us a good insight into Rembrandt's collections, which, apart from [[Old Master]] paintings and drawings, included busts of the Roman Emperors, suits of Japanese armor among many objects from Asia, and collections of natural history and minerals.  But the prices realized in the sales in 1657 and 1658 were disappointing.<ref>Slive, p. 84</ref> Rembrandt was forced to sell his house and his printing-press and move to more modest accommodation on the [[Rozengracht]] in 1660.<ref>Schwartz, p. 12. The house sale was in 1658, but was agreed with two years for Rembrandt to vacate.</ref> The authorities and his creditors were generally accommodating to him, except for the Amsterdam [[painters' guild]], which introduced a new rule that no one in Rembrandt's circumstances could trade as a painter.

Modern scholarship has reduced the autograph count to over forty paintings, as well as a few drawings and thirty-one etchings, which include many of the most remarkable images of the group.<ref>White and Buvelot 1999, p. 10.</ref> Some show him posing in quasi-historical fancy dress, or pulling faces at himself. His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man, through the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s, to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age. Together they give a remarkably clear picture of the man, his appearance and his psychological make-up, as revealed by his richly weathered face.<ref>While the popular interpretation is that these paintings represent a personal and introspective journey, it is possible that they were painted to satisfy a market for self-portraits by prominent artists. Van de Wetering, p. 290.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt van Rijn - A Polish nobleman.jpg|thumb|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]'', 1637]]\n\nIn his portraits and self-portraits, he angles the sitter's face in such a way that the ridge of the nose nearly always forms the line of demarcation between brightly illuminated and shadowy areas. A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer's attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light\u2014an overwhelming clarity\u2014and a brooding duskiness.<ref>Taylor, Michael (2007).[http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html Rembrandt's Nose: Of Flesh & Spirit in the Master's Portraits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505200753/http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html |date=5 May 2016 }} p. 21, D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, Inc., New York {{ISBN|978-1-933045-44-3}}'</ref>\n\nIn a number of biblical works, including ''The Raising of the Cross'', ''Joseph Telling His Dreams'' and ''[[The Stoning of Saint Stephen]]'', Rembrandt painted himself as a character in the crowd. Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt \"a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life\".<ref>Durham, p. 60.</ref>\n\nAmong the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt's work are his use of [[chiaroscuro]], the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from [[Caravaggio]], or, more likely, from the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]], but adapted for very personal means.<ref>Bull, et al., pp. 11\u201313.</ref> Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age. His immediate family\u2014his wife Saskia, his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje\u2014often figured prominently in his paintings, many of which had [[mythology|mythical]], biblical or historical themes.\n\nDrawings by Rembrandt and his pupils have been extensively studied by many artists and scholars<ref>Such as [[Otto Benesch]], [[David Hockney]], [[Nigel Konstam]], [[Jakob Rosenberg (art historian)|Jakob Rosenberg]], [[Gary Schwartz (art historian)|Gary Schwartz]].</ref> through the centuries. His original draughtsmanship has been described as an individualistic art style that was very similar to East Asian old masters, most notably Chinese masters:<ref>Mendelowitz, Daniel Marcus: ''Drawing''. (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, Inc., 1967), p. 305. As Mendelowitz (1967) noted: \"Probably no one has combined to as great a degree as Rembrandt a disciplined exposition of what his eye saw and a love of line as a beautiful thing in itself. His \"Winter Landscape\" displays the virtuosity of performance of an Oriental master, yet unlike the Oriental calligraphy, it is not based on an established convention of brush performance. It is as personal as handwriting.\"</ref> a \"combination of formal clarity and [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] vitality in the movement of pen or brush that is closer to [[Chinese painting]] in technique and feeling than to anything in European art before the twentieth century\".<ref>Sullivan, Michael: ''The Meeting of Eastern and Western Art''. (University of California Press, 1989), p. 91</ref>\n\n===Periods, themes and styles===\nThroughout his career Rembrandt took as his primary subjects the themes of portraiture, landscape and narrative painting. For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - The Abduction of Europa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Abduction of Europa (Rembrandt)|''The Abduction of Europa'']], 1632. Oil on panel. The work has been described as  \"...a shining example of the 'golden age' of [[Baroque]] painting\".<ref>Clough, p. 23</ref>]]\n\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt's skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\n\nIt was during Rembrandt's Leiden period (1625\u20131631) that Lastman's influence was most prominent. It is also likely that at this time Lievens had a strong impact on his work as well.<ref name=Wetering-284>van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small, but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and [[allegory|allegorical]] themes were favored, as were [[tronie]]s.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1629 he completed ''[[Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver]]'' and ''[[Artist in his studio|The Artist in His Studio]]'', works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application, and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt, Portret van Haesje v.Cleyburg 1634.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical portrait from 1634, when Rembrandt was enjoying great commercial success]]\n\nDuring his early years in Amsterdam (1632\u20131636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (''[[The Blinding of Samson]]'', 1636, ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', c.&nbsp;1635 ''[[Dana\u00eb (Rembrandt)|Dana\u00eb]]'', 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of [[Rubens]].<ref>van de Wetering, p. 287.</ref> With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh's workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small ([[Jacob de Gheyn III (painting)|''Jacob de Gheyn&nbsp;III'']]) and large (''Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife'', 1633, ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', 1632).<ref>van de Wetering, p. 286.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1630s Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of [[landscape painting|landscapes]]. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (''Cottages before a Stormy Sky'', c.&nbsp;1641; ''The Three Trees'', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted ''[[The Night Watch]]'', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rembrandt - Zelfportret - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Self Portrait'', 1658, [[Frick Collection]], a masterpiece of the final style, \"the calmest and grandest of all his portraits\"<ref>Clark 1978, p. 28</ref>]]\n\nIn the decade following the ''Night Watch'', Rembrandt's paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (''Susanna and the Elders'', 1637\u201347).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163\u201365.</ref>\nAt the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\n\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt's style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of 'finish' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt's brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155\u201365.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting's surface. The end result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157\u201358, 190.</ref>\n\nIn later years biblical themes were still depicted often, but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (''James the Apostle'', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (''[[The Jewish Bride]]'', c.&nbsp;1666)\u2014in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt's (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering. Those keen and steady eyes that we know so well from Rembrandt's self-portraits must have been able to look straight into the human heart.\" Gombrich, p. 423.</ref><ref>\"It (''The Jewish Bride'') is a picture of grown-up love, a marvelous amalgam of richness, tenderness, and trust... the heads which, in their truth, have a spiritual glow that painters influenced by the classical tradition could never achieve.\" Clark, p. 206.</ref>\n\n===Etchings===\n[[File:Rembrandt - The windmill - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Windmill'', 1641, [[etching]]]]\n\nRembrandt produced [[etching]]s for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and practically abandoned etching. Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8\u201312</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he also learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing, but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5\u20136</ref> He worked on the so-called ''[[Hundred Guilder Print]]'' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9\u201310</ref>\n\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|left|''The Three Trees'', 1643, etching]]\n\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"plate tone,\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6\u20137</ref>\n\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the twenty-seven self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. There are forty-six landscapes, mostly small, which largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings.<ref>See Schwartz, 1994, where the works are divided by subject, following [[Adam Bartsch|Bartsch]].</ref> He owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of prints by other artists, and many borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Hercules Seghers]], and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].\n\n===''The Night Watch''===\n{{main|The Night Watch}}\n[[File:La ronda de noche, por Rembrandt van Rijn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Night Watch]]'' or ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'', 1642. Oil on canvas; on display at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]\n\nRembrandt painted the large painting ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' between 1640 and 1642. This picture was called ''De Nachtwacht'' by the Dutch and ''The Night Watch'' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] because by the 18th century the picture was so dimmed and defaced that it was almost indistinguishable, and it looked quite like a night scene. After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day\u2014a party of [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight.\n\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the ''[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]'', the musketeer branch of the civic militia. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission (what kind of mission, an ordinary patrol or some special event, is a matter of debate).\n\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Amsterdam town hall]] in 1715; the Rijksmuseum has a smaller copy of what is thought to be the full original composition; the four figures in the front are at the centre of the canvas. The painting is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]].\n\n===Indian Miniatures===\n[[File:Rembrandt 208.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Rembrandt drawing of an Indian Mughal painting]]\nRembrandt was interested in [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniatures]], especially around the 1650s. He drew versions of some 23 Mughal paintings, and may have owned an album of them. These miniatures include paintings of [[Shah Jahan]], [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Dara Shikoh]].  They may also have influenced the costumes and other aspects of his works.<ref>Schrader, Stephanie; et al.

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future|url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\n\nOne example of activity is ''[[The Polish Rider]]'', in New York's [[Frick Collection]]. Rembrandt's authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century, but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn's remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost's authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick, with [[Simon Schama]] (in his 1999 book ''Rembrandt's Eyes'') and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both arguing for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt's authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the 'Lisowczyk' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., ''Artibus et Historiae'', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197\u2013205.

There is a book on the subject:''Responses to Rembrandt; Who painted the Polish Rider?'' by Anthony Bailey (New York, 1993)</ref>\n\n[[File:Mann mit dem Goldhelm.jpg|thumb|''[[The Man with the Golden Helmet]]'', [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin]], once one of the most famous \"Rembrandt\" portraits, is no longer attributed to the master.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/arts/art-view-in-search-of-the-real-thing.html |title=Art View; In Search of the Real Thing|author=John Russell|date= December 1, 1985|work=New York Times }}</ref>]]\n\nA similar issue was raised by Simon Schama in his book ''Rembrandt's Eyes'' concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt's works. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in ''[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]'' (recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum) has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). ''Rembrandt's Eyes''. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp 582\u2013591.</ref>\n\nAnother painting, ''Pilate Washing His Hands'', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master's command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |publisher=Outpost Art |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing. In 2005 four oil paintings previously attributed to Rembrandt's students were reclassified as the work of Rembrandt himself: ''Study of an Old Man in Profile'' and ''Study of an Old Man with a Beard'' from a US private collection, ''[[Study of a Weeping Woman]]'', owned by the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], and ''Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet'', painted in 1640.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4276034.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Lost Rembrandt works discovered |publisher=BBC News  |date=23 September 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2009}}</ref> The ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' is a further example: in 2014, Professor [[Ernst van de Wetering]] offered his view to ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the demotion of the 1652 painting ''Old Man Sitting in a Chair'' \"was a vast mistake...it is a most important painting.

Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt's own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.<ref>\"...Rembrandt was not always the perfectly consistent, logical Dutchman he was originally anticipated to be.\" Ackley, p. 13.</ref> As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<ref>van de Wetering, p. x.</ref> It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.\n\n==Painting materials==\n[[File:Rembrandt - Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume - WGA19164.jpg|thumb|''Saskia as Flora'', 1635]]\n\nTechnical investigation of Rembrandt's paintings in the possession of the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden\u2019(Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Maltechnik/Restauro, issue 4 (1977): 223\u2013233</ref> and in the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]<ref>K\u00fchn, Hermann. \u2018Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgr\u00fcnden Rembrandts, durchgef\u00fchrt an den Gem\u00e4lden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel\u2019 (Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel), Maltechnik/Restauro, volume 82 (1976): 25\u201333</ref> has been conducted by Hermann K\u00fchn in 1977.

Mitchell Lane Publishers, 2009.  {{ISBN|978-1-61228-760-7}}. p. 13.</ref>\n\nRoughly speaking, his earliest signatures (c. 1625) consisted of an initial&nbsp;\"R\", or the monogram \"RH\" (for Rembrant Harmenszoon), and starting in 1629, \"RHL\" (the \"L\" stood, presumably, for Leiden). In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\", but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\". In 1633 he added&nbsp;a&nbsp;\"d\", and maintained this form consistently from then on, proving that this minor change had a meaning for him (whatever it might have been). This change is purely visual; it does not change the way his name is pronounced. Curiously enough, despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name, most of the documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original \"Rembrant\" spelling. (Note: the rough chronology of signature forms above applies to the paintings, and to a lesser degree to the etchings; from 1632, presumably, there is only one etching signed \"RHL-v. Rijn,\" the large-format \"Raising of Lazarus,\"&nbsp;B&nbsp;73).<ref>[http://www.rembrandt-signature-file.com/remp_texte/remp050.pdf Chronology of his signatures (pdf)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171107/http://www.rembrandt-signature-file.com/remp_texte/remp050.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} with examples.

His printmaking studio has been set up with a printing press, where replica prints are printed.  The museum has a few Rembrandt paintings, many loaned, but an important collection of his prints, a good selection of which are on rotating display. All major [[print room]]s have large collections of Rembrandt prints, although as some exist in only a single impression, no collection is complete. The degree to which these collections are displayed to the public, or can easily be viewed by them in the print room, varies greatly.\n\n==Influence and recognition==\n[[File:Nachtwacht-in-3D.jpg|thumb|188px|Rembrandt statue and the sculptures of ''[[The Night Watch]]'' in 3D at the [[Rembrandtplein]] in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Leiden Rembrandt Statue.jpg|thumb|188px|Rembrandt statue in Leiden]]\nRembrandt is one of the most famous<ref>Golahny, Amy (2001), '[https://www.academia.edu/11872097/Use_and_Misuse_of_Rembrandt_Dutch_Crossing_2001 The Use and Misuse of Rembrandt: An Overview of Popular Reception],'.

The great shadow of the old master required a decided attitude. A late Romantic painter and critic, like [[Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin|Fromentin]] was, if he happened not to like some of Rembrandt's pictures, he felt obliged to justify his feeling. The greatness of the dramatic old master was for artists of about 1875 not a matter for doubt. 'Either I am wrong', Fromentin wrote from Holland 'or everybody else is wrong'. When Fromentin realized his inability to like some of the works by Rembrandt he formulated the following comments: 'I even do not dare to write down such a blasphemy; I would get ridiculed if this is disclosed'. Only about twenty-five years earlier another French Romantic master [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], when expressing his admiration for Rembrandt, has written in his ''Journal'' a very different statement: '... perhaps one day we will discover that Rembrandt is a much greater painter than [[Raphael]]. It is a blasphemy which would make hair raise on the heads of all the academic painters'. In 1851 the blasphemy was to put Rembrandt above Raphael. In 1875 the blasphemy was not to admire everything Rembrandt had ever produced.
