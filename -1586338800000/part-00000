Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].

Kudasai\" on March 26, 1997. Her role as [[Nanoha Takamachi]] in the [[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha (series)|''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha'']] series contributed to a rise in her popularity, as several of her singles (\"Little Wish: Lyrical Step\", \"[[Spiritual Garden]]\", \"[[Hoshizora no Spica]]\", \"Beautiful Amulet\") were used as the ending themes for the franchise's anime adaptations. Besides ''Nanoha'', she voices the title characters [[Kait\u014d Tenshi Twin Angel#Haruka Minazuki|Haruka Minazuki / Red Angel]] in ''[[Kait\u014d Tenshi Twin Angel]]'', [[No-Rin#Ringo Kinoshita|Ringo Kinoshita]] in ''[[No-Rin]]'',  [[B Gata H Kei#Yamada|Yamada]] in ''[[B Gata H Kei]]'' and Kaoru Tsunashi in ''[[I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying]]''.

Affectionately called Yukarin by her fans, several of her releases have been used as opening and ending themes for [[anime]] series, while some have reached the [[Oricon]] top 100 singles and album charts. In 2001, Tamura formed a unit called Yamato Nadeshiko with another well known voice actress, [[Yui Horie]]. Two singles were released, ''M\u014d Hitori no Watashi'' and ''Merry Merrily'' - the latter of which was an insert song in the [[Love Hina|''Love Hina'' Christmas Special]].\n\nOn January 1, 2007, Tamura's talent management agency changed from [[Arts Vision]] to [[I'm Enterprise]], a subsidiary of Arts Vision and on April 1, 2007, Tamura's record company officially changed from Konami to King Records, however, there was no material effect to Tamura because the actual record production of Konami is carried out by King Records. She has also featured as a narrator of Japanese [[anime]] [[satellite television]] network [[Animax]].\n\nIn February 2016, Tamura's agency announced that a concert which had been announced during a [[Niconico]] livestream in 2015 would be cancelled. Her management also announced that her fanclub would change ownership and her radio programs would end. Her staff's Twitter account would be closed and her website would undergo maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voice Actress Yukari Tamura Cancels Concert & Radio Shows, Puts Site on Hiatus|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-10/voice-actress-yukari-tamura-cancels-concert-and-radio-shows-puts-site-on-hiatus/.98522|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=February 10, 2016|date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> On February 13, 2016, her management announced that her contract with [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] would end on March 20, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voice Actress Yukari Tamura's Contract With King Records Ends|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-12/voice-actress-yukari-tamura-contract-with-king-records-ends/.98647|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref> She changed her agency once more from I'm Enterprise to Amuleto.<ref name = \"Amuleto\"/>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Anime===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of voice performances in anime\n!

During the reign of Rajaraja Narendra, it was said that they immigrated to southern regions from Repalle. It is because of the above inferences, the Gollas consider themselves to belong to the Yadava clan or Golla kings. The very term Golla kings asserts their kinship with [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]], besides asserting them to be of a higher stratum of the society. Nanjundayya and Ananthakrishna Iyer refer to the last inference in the third volume of their book \u201cThe Mysore Tribes & Castes\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.22885|title=The Mysore Tribes And Castes Vol. 3|last=Iyer|first=L.

The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself.

It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

Kumara Kampana was tasked with protecting the temple Endowments and recruiting many leaders to take on the responsibilities of Pandya Nadu.\n\nHis wife [[Gangadevi]], who was present during the invasion of Madurai, records the siege and conquest of Madurai in her Sanskrit treatise [[Madura Vijayam|Madhura Vijayam]].<ref name=\"Jackson2005\">{{cite book|author=William Joseph Jackson|title=Vijayanagara Voices: Exploring South Indian History and Hindu Literature|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3950-3|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=PxvDNBc4qwUC&pg=PA61 61]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tamilvu.org/slet/lA100/lA100pd1.jsp?bookid=224&pno=392 |title = Tvu}}</ref>\n\n==Sri Krishnadevaraya's Clan==\n\n[[File:vijayanagara.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sri Krishnadevaraya]]\n\n* The Below informations are Published by [[Archeological Survey of India]] in the book \"Annual Report of the Mysore Archeological Department\".\n\n===Nanjagud Taluk Inscription Translation===\nBe it well.

Victory to the Adorable (Padmanabha) who resembles the sky free\nfrom clouds.While the illustrious Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja seated on the stable throne, \u2018the prosperous king of kings, lord of kings, champion over those who wear moustaches in the great earth, kathdri-sahwa (dagger and kite), ruler over the southern sea,\nNarasimha-mahadhiraja\u2019s son ; a sun to the firmament that is the [[Yadava]] race of\nwhich he is a lineal descendant ; crest-jewel to righteousness, (delighter) of all the\nassemblage of bards, brother to the wives of others, support for purity, heroism and prowess; possessed of lotus-like feet on which bow the jewelled crowns of all the kings, kathari-trinitra (a Siva in the use of dagger) : was ruling the earth :\u2014 Under the orders of vira Krishnaraya, while he was pleased to go on a victorious\nexpedition to the south : \u2014the illustrious mahapradhana (chief minister) Saluva\nTimmarasa of Yajus-sakha, Khandava-gotra, and Apastambha-sutra made a gift to the best of the gods, Kirtinarayanadevaru of [[Talakadu|Talakad]] which is Rajarajapura, south Benares and Gajaranya-kshetra, of the village Kavahalli in Thayuru-sthala, with the right to enjoy the eight rights and powers in the village including all the rice-fields, dry lands, gardens, vegetable gardens (tudike), money income, treasure, deposits underground, water springs, rocks, imperishables, future accruals, existing rights and possibilities. The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers. He who seizes land gifted by himsolf or by others is borm as a worm in ordure for 60,000 years. Whoever destroys this gift will incur the sin of killing tawny cows on the banks of the [[Ganges]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.501532|title=Annual Report Of The Mysore Archaeological Department, For The Year 1930|first=M.H.|last=Krishna|date=1934|language=english}}</ref>\n\n'''Note'''\n\nThis is a record registering the grant of a village called Kavahalli or Kalihalli (same as the present village Kahalli) for services in the Kirtinarayana temple at Talakad on the Kaveri river in T.-Narsipur Taluk, Mysore District. It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

He was influenced by his military family members and nursed the idea of serving in the Army since his childhood. After his basic education in his native place, he got selected to join the Army and was happy to achieve his childhood dream.\n\n== Military career ==\nOn 26 August 1955, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh joined [[Bombay Sappers]] as a recruit and got appointed as a sapper after his initial training. After two years, on 19 July 1957, he got posted in the depot battalion (T). After serving the company for four and half years, he was posted to training battalion in Oct 1962. On 5 January 1971, he was then appointed as an instructor at \u201c[[College of Military Engineering, Pune|College of Military Engineering]]\u201d, [[Pune]] after serving with 22 and 23 Field Companies for few years.\n\n== Mine Explosin ==\nOn the 23rd September 1973, a demonstration was arranged by the College of Military Engineering for the visiting staff and student officers of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington.\u00a0 One part of the demonstration was the actual firing of the Charge Line Mine Clearing, an explosive device for the clearing of enemy mine fields, which was recently introduced in the Army. Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was tasked to fire this explosive charge under simulated battle conditions and was assisted by a party of seven sappers in this task.\n\nWhile Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was in the process of setting up and preparing the Charge Line Mine Clearing for firing, the tail initiator of the charge got prematurely actuated. He at once realized that the entire explosive was likely to blow up within 10 seconds. Realizing the danger to the lives of the men under his command, he immediately ordered them to run to a safe distance and he himself, in utter disregard of his personal safety set upon the hazardous task of uncoupling the actuated initiator to ensure the safety of the men and equipment.\n\nBut unfortunately, in spite of his best efforts and determination, he was not able to prevent the explosion within the few seconds, at his disposal. There was an explosion and Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was blown to pieces.  Thus, in order to save the lives of the men under his command, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh made the supreme self sacrifice.  \n\n== Ashoka Chakra Awardee ==\nNb Sub Gurnam Singh was given the nation's highest gallantry award during peace time \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his commendable courage and unflinching devotion to duty.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n\n\n<br />\n[[Category:1935 births]]\n[[Category:1973 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian military personnel]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{Notability|date=March 2020}}\n}}{{Infobox military person\n| honorific_prefix = [[Naib Subedar]]\n| name          = Gurnam Singh\n| honorific_suffix = [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]]\n| image         = Naib Subedar Gurnam Singh.jpg\n| image_size    = 250 px\n| caption       = \n| birth_date    = {{birth date |1935|08|18}}\n| death_date    = {{death date and age |1973|09|23|1935|08|18}}\n| birth_place   = [[Bhullar]], [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab]], [[British India]]\n| death_place   = \n| allegiance    = {{flag|India}}\n| branch        = {{Army|India}}\n| serviceyears  = 1955-1974\n| rank          = [[File:Naib Subedar - Naib Risaldar of the Indian Army.svg|24px]] [[Naib Subedar]]\n| servicenumber = JC47692K\n| unit          = [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|108 Engr Regt]]\n| awards        = [[File:Ashoka Chakra ribbon.svg|25px]] [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]]\n}}\n\n[[Naib subedar|Naib Subedar]] '''Gurnam Singh''', [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]] (18 Aug 1935 - 23 Sep 1973) was a [[Junior commissioned officer|Junior Commissioned officer]] (JCO) in [[Indian Army]].

On 5 January 1971, he was then appointed as an instructor at \u201c[[College of Military Engineering, Pune|College of Military Engineering]]\u201d, [[Pune]] after serving with 22 and 23 Field Companies for few years.\n\n== Mine Explosin ==\nOn the 23rd September 1973, a demonstration was arranged by the College of Military Engineering for the visiting staff and student officers of the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington.\u00a0 One part of the demonstration was the actual firing of the Charge Line Mine Clearing, an explosive device for the clearing of enemy mine fields, which was recently introduced in the Army. Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was tasked to fire this explosive charge under simulated battle conditions and was assisted by a party of seven sappers in this task.\n\nWhile Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was in the process of setting up and preparing the Charge Line Mine Clearing for firing, the tail initiator of the charge got prematurely actuated. He at once realized that the entire explosive was likely to blow up within 10 seconds. Realizing the danger to the lives of the men under his command, he immediately ordered them to run to a safe distance and he himself, in utter disregard of his personal safety set upon the hazardous task of uncoupling the actuated initiator to ensure the safety of the men and equipment.\n\nBut unfortunately, in spite of his best efforts and determination, he was not able to prevent the explosion within the few seconds, at his disposal. There was an explosion and Nb Sub Gurnam Singh was blown to pieces.  Thus, in order to save the lives of the men under his command, Nb Sub Gurnam Singh made the supreme self sacrifice.  \n\n== Ashoka Chakra Awardee ==\nNb Sub Gurnam Singh was given the nation's highest gallantry award during peace time \u201cAshok Chakra\u201d for his commendable courage and unflinching devotion to duty.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n\n\n<br />\n", "name_user": "Koushik Pain", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurnam_Singh_(soldier)"}

The single peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Outside the United Kingdom, \"I'm Too Sexy\" topped the charts in six countries, including Australia, Ireland, and the United States.\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe idea for the song came about when the Fairbrass brothers were running a gym in London where, according to Richard, there was \"lots of narcissism and posing\". One day, he took his shirt off and started singing \"I'm too sexy for my shirt\" in front of a mirror as a joke. The band originally recorded it as an [[indie rock]] song.\n\nIt was rejected by multiple record companies before they played it to [[Song plugger|radio plugger]] Guy Holmes. He was initially unimpressed after playing it on his car stereo, but his passengers latched onto the song's \"I'm a model, you know what I mean\" hook and Holmes asked the band if they could rework it as a dance track.\n\nDJ [[TommyD]], an acquaintance of Richard Fairbrass, programmed electronics around the original vocal, whilst guitarist Rob Manzoli added a riff borrowed from the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song \"[[Third Stone from the Sun]]\".<ref>{{cite news|first= Dave |last= Simpson |title= How we made Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 4 April 2017 |accessdate= 4 April 2017 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/04/how-we-made-right-said-fred-im-too-sexy-interview}}</ref>\n\nIn the clubs, everyone imitated their \"catwalk\" dance as seen on the video clip by January 1992.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Spotlight: Right Said Fred |magazine= [[Music & Media]] |volume= 9 |issue= 3 |page= 21 |date= 18 January 1992 |accessdate= 20 February 2020 |url= https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1992/MM-1992-01-18.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe single equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] without ever topping the chart, staying at number two for six weeks in a row while held back by [[Bryan Adams]]' \"[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]\" (this equaled the previous record set by [[Pierre Kartner|Father Abraham]]'s hit of 1978 \"[[The Smurf Song]]\").\n\nIn May 1992, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Selling 'A' Side.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Ivors 1992 > Best Selling 'A' Side |website= Theivors.com |accessdate= 9 September 2018 |url= http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013937/http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archivedate= 4 January 2018 |url-status= dead}}</ref> \"I'm Too Sexy\" was the act's first of several hits, particularly in the United Kingdom.

The single peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Outside the United Kingdom, \"I'm Too Sexy\" topped the charts in six countries, including Australia, Ireland, and the United States.\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe idea for the song came about when the Fairbrass brothers were running a gym in London where, according to Richard, there was \"lots of narcissism and posing\". One day, he took his shirt off and started singing \"I'm too sexy for my shirt\" in front of a mirror as a joke. The band originally recorded it as an [[indie rock]] song.\n\nIt was rejected by multiple record companies before they played it to [[Song plugger|radio plugger]] Guy Holmes. He was initially unimpressed after playing it on his car stereo, but his passengers latched onto the song's \"I'm a model, you know what I mean\" hook and Holmes asked the band if they could rework it as a dance track.\n\nDJ [[TommyD]], an acquaintance of Richard Fairbrass, programmed electronics around the original vocal, whilst guitarist Rob Manzoli added a riff borrowed from the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song \"[[Third Stone from the Sun]]\".<ref>{{cite news|first= Dave |last= Simpson |title= How we made Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 4 April 2017 |accessdate= 4 April 2017 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/04/how-we-made-right-said-fred-im-too-sexy-interview}}</ref>\n\nIn the clubs, everyone imitated their \"catwalk\" dance as seen on the video clip by January 1992.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Spotlight: Right Said Fred |magazine= [[Music & Media]] |volume= 9 |issue= 3 |page= 21 |date= 18 January 1992 |accessdate= 20 February 2020 |url= https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1992/MM-1992-01-18.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe single equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] without ever topping the chart, staying at number two for six weeks in a row while held back by [[Bryan Adams]]' \"[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]\" (this equaled the previous record set by [[Pierre Kartner|Father Abraham]]'s hit of 1978 \"[[The Smurf Song]]\").\n\nIn May 1992, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Selling 'A' Side.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Ivors 1992 > Best Selling 'A' Side |website= Theivors.com |accessdate= 9 September 2018 |url= http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013937/http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1992/ |archivedate= 4 January 2018 |url-status= dead}}</ref> \"I'm Too Sexy\" was the act's first of several hits, particularly in the United Kingdom.
