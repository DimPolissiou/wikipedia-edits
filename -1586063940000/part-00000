The dominant languages in [[Algeria|Algerian]] literature are [[French language|French]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Berber language|Berber]].\n\nA few of the more notable Algerian writers are: [[Kateb Yacine]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Assia Djebar]] and [[Mohammed Dib]]. \n\n==History==\nThe historic roots of Algerian literature trace back to the [[Numidia]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote [[The Golden Ass]], the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among others, also wrote in this period. The Middle Ages also saw many Arabic writers revolutionize the Arab world literature with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]] and [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria. During the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Algerian literature remained in Arabic, mainly in the style of short stories and poetry.<ref> Aoudjit, A. (2017). Algerian literature : A reader's guide and anthology (Francophone cultures and literatures ; v. 66). New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 29</ref> In the 19th century, with the beginning of French colonialism, most Algerian literature transition into French, and few Arabic works were written until post-independence in 1962.<ref> Aoudjit, A. (2017). Algerian literature : A reader's guide and anthology (Francophone cultures and literatures ; v. 66). New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 30</ref> \n\n==Literature in French==\nFrench literature in Algeria can be critically grouped into three main periods: first, assimilation from the beginning of the colonial period to 1945; second, decolonization from 1945 to 1962; and third, social critique from 1962 to present.<ref> Aoudjit, A. (2017). Algerian literature : A reader's guide and anthology (Francophone cultures and literatures ; v. 66). New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 30</ref> \n\n===Up to 1945===\nBecause of the colonial regime, this 1st literature appears at first to be in support of the [[French Algeria|French colonial regime]]<ref> Aoudjit, A. (2017). Algerian literature : A reader's guide and anthology (Francophone cultures and literatures ; v. 66). New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 32</ref>, but they still explored themes about the difficulty of assimilation into French culture and the rifts between generations that these colonial changes caused. Some scholars continue to consider these works problematic in their acquiescence to French colonialism while other critics find a veiled critique of colonialism throughout these works in the form of allusions and double-entendre.<ref> Aoudjit, A. (2017). Algerian literature : A reader's guide and anthology (Francophone cultures and literatures ; v. 66). New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 34</ref> \n\nMany scholars consider M\u2019Hamed Ben Rahal\u2019s ''La vengeance du cheikh'' (The Cheikh\u2019s Vengeance) in 1891 to be the first work of fiction in French by an Algerian author. Others notable works in the same period include Mustapha Allaoua\u2019s ''Le Faux talisman'' (The False Talisman) and Omar Samar\u2019s Ali, ''O mon fr\u00e8re'' (Ali, O My Brother) in 1893.<ref> Aoudjit, A.

(2017). Algerian literature : A reader's guide and anthology (Francophone cultures and literatures ; v. 66). New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 35</ref> Most Algerian authors of this period were staunch supporters of the FLN and of an independent Algeria, so much so that many literary figures at the time were active participants in the independence struggle. Countless such writers, including [[Kateb Yacine]], [[Mohamed Boudia]], [[Anna Gr\u00e9ki]], and [[Leila Djabali]], were arrested and imprisoned by the colonial regime during the 1950s.<ref> Aoudjit, A.

New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 35</ref> In contrast with their pre-1945 counterparts, these writers were more vocally critical of France in their work and used a realistic style to highlight the injustices of colonialism.<ref> Aoudjit, A.

Leila Sebbar's book explores the subject of identity and cultural hybridity with the use of intertextual and artistic references.  In her book, Sherazade is able to mourn her lost homeland through the photographs of the French photographer Marc Garanger. As Karina Eileraas develops, his photographs \"equip Sherazade with a supplemental shortcut to the past, the allow her to temporarily mourn her (lack of) Algeria\".\n\n[[Algerianism]] was a literary genre with political overtones, born among French Algerian writers who hoped for a common Algerian future culture, uniting French settlers and native Algerians.

The first group is strongly influenced by terrorism that occurred in the 1990s. The second group focuses on an individualistic conception of human adventure.

The dominant languages in [[Algeria|Algerian]] literature are [[French language|French]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Berber language|Berber]].\n\nA few of the more notable Algerian writers are: [[Kateb Yacine]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Assia Djebar]] and [[Mohammed Dib]]. \n\n==History==\nThe historic roots of Algerian literature trace back to the [[Numidia]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote [[The Golden Ass]], the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among others, also wrote in this period. The Middle Ages also saw many Arabic writers revolutionize the Arab world literature with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]] and [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria. During the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Algerian literature remained in Arabic, mainly in the style of short stories and poetry<ref> Aoudjit, A. (2017).

New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 30</ref>. \n\n==Literature in French==\nFrench literature in Algeria can be critically grouped into three main periods: first, assimilation from the beginning of the colonial period to 1945; second, decolonization from 1945 to 1962; and third, social critique from 1962 to present<ref> Aoudjit, A.

(2017). Algerian literature : A reader's guide and anthology (Francophone cultures and literatures ; v. 66). New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing. p. 32</ref>, but they still explored themes about the difficulty of assimilation into French culture and the rifts between generations that these colonial changes caused. Some scholars continue to consider these works problematic in their acquiescence to French colonialism while other critics find a veiled critique of colonialism throughout these works in the form of allusions and double-entendre<ref> Aoudjit, A.

Others notable works in the same period include Mustapha Allaoua\u2019s ''Le Faux talisman'' (The False Talisman) and Omar Samar\u2019s Ali, ''O mon fr\u00e8re'' (Ali, O My Brother) in 1893<ref> Aoudjit, A.

Most Algerian authors of this period were staunch supporters of the FLN and of an independent Algeria, so much so that many literary figures at the time were active participants in the independence struggle. Countless such writers, including [[Kateb Yacine]], [[Mohamed Boudia]], [[Anna Gr\u00e9ki]], and [[Leila Djabali]], were arrested and imprisoned by the colonial regime during the 1950s<ref> Aoudjit, A.

Leila Sebbar's book explores the subject of identity and cultural hybridity with the use of intertextual and artistic references.  In her book, Sherazade is able to mourn her lost homeland through the photographs of the French photographer Marc Garanger. As Karina Eileraas develops, his photographs \"equip Sherazade with a supplemental shortcut to the past, the allow her to temporarily mourn her (lack of) Algeria\".\n\n[[Algerianism]] was a literary genre with political overtones, born among French Algerian writers who hoped for a common Algerian future culture, uniting French settlers and native Algerians.

He is venerated as a [[saint]] and [[martyr]] by both the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. He engaged in conflict with [[Henry II of England|Henry II, King of England]], over the rights and privileges of the Church and was murdered by followers of the king in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Soon after his death, he was [[Canonization|canonised]] by [[Pope Alexander III]].\n\n==Sources==\nThe main sources for the life of Becket are a number of biographies written by contemporaries. A few of these documents are by unknown writers, although traditional historiography has given them names. The known biographers are [[John of Salisbury]], [[Edward Grim]], [[Benedict of Peterborough]], [[William of Canterbury]], [[William fitzStephen]], [[Guernes de Pont-Sainte-Maxence|Guernes of Pont-Sainte-Maxence]], [[Robert of Cricklade]], [[Alan of Tewkesbury]], [[Benet of St Albans]], and [[Herbert of Bosham]]. The other biographers, who remain anonymous, are generally given the pseudonyms of Anonymous I, Anonymous II (or Anonymous of Lambeth), and Anonymous III (or Lansdowne Anonymous). Besides these accounts, there are also two other accounts that are likely contemporary that appear in the ''Quadrilogus II'' and the ''[[Th\u00f3mas saga Erkibyskups|Th\u00f3mas saga erkibyskups]]''. Besides these biographies, there is also the mention of the events of Becket's life in the chroniclers of the time. These include [[Robert of Torigni]]'s work, [[Roger of Howden]]'s ''Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi'' and ''Chronica'', [[Ralph Diceto]]'s works, [[William of Newburgh]]'s ''Historia Rerum'', and [[Gervase of Canterbury]]'s works.<ref name=Barlow3>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 3\u20139</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBecket was born about 1119,<ref>Butler and Walsh ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' p. 430</ref> or in 1120 according to later tradition.<ref name=ODNB/> He was born in [[Cheapside]], London, on 21 December, which was the feast day of St Thomas the Apostle. He was the son of Gilbert and Matilda Beket.{{sic}}<!-- Source spelling omits the \"c\"-->{{refn|There is a legend that claims Thomas's mother was a [[Saracen]] princess who met and fell in love with his English father while he was on Crusade or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] in the [[Holy Land]], followed him home, was baptised and married him.

Gilbert was perhaps related to [[Theobald of Bec]], whose family also was from Thierville. Gilbert began his life as a merchant, perhaps in textiles, but by the 1120s he was living in London and was a property owner, living on the rental income from his properties. He also served as the sheriff of the city at some point.<ref name=ODNB>Barlow \"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27201 Becket, Thomas (1120?\u20131170)]\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> They were buried in [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Becket Memorial Plaque on Cheapside.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking Becket's birthplace along Cheapside]]\n\nOne of Becket's father's wealthy friends, Richer de [[L'Aigle]], often invited Thomas to his estates in [[Sussex]] where Becket was exposed to hunting and hawking. According to Grim, Becket learned much from Richer, who was later a signatory of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] against Thomas.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nBeginning when he was 10, Becket was sent as a student to [[Merton Priory]] in England and later attended a grammar school in London, perhaps the one at St Paul's Cathedral. He did not study any subjects beyond the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] at these schools. Later, he spent about a year in Paris around age 20. He did not, however, study canon or civil law at this time and his [[Latin]] skill always remained somewhat rudimentary. Some time after Becket began his schooling, Gilbert Beket suffered financial reverses, and the younger Becket was forced to earn a living as a clerk. Gilbert first secured a place for his son in the business of a relative\u2014Osbert Huitdeniers\u2014and then later Becket acquired a position in the household of Theobald of Bec, by now the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nTheobald entrusted him with several important missions to Rome and also sent him to [[Bologna]] and [[Auxerre]] to study [[canon law]]. Theobald in 1154 named Becket [[List of Archdeacons of Canterbury|Archdeacon of Canterbury]], and other ecclesiastical offices included a number of [[benefice]]s, [[Prebendary|prebends]] at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and St Paul's Cathedral, and the office of [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] of [[Beverley]]. His efficiency in those posts led to Theobald recommending him to King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] for the vacant post of [[Lord Chancellor]],<ref name=ODNB/> to which Becket was appointed in January 1155.<ref name=Handbook84>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p.  84</ref>\n\nAs Chancellor, Becket enforced the king's traditional sources of revenue that were exacted from all landowners, including churches and bishoprics.<ref name=ODNB/> King Henry sent his son [[Henry the Young King|Henry]] to live in Becket's household, it being the custom then for noble children to be fostered out to other noble houses.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Primacy==\nBecket was nominated as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, several months after the death of Theobald. His election was confirmed on 23 May 1162 by a royal council of bishops and noblemen.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry may have hoped that Becket would continue to put the royal government first, rather than the church. However, the famous transformation of Becket into an [[ascetic]] occurred at this time.<ref name=Huscroft192>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 192\u2013195</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Becket enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury from a [[Nottingham Alabaster]] in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:StThomasEnthroned.jpg\nImage:StThomasReturn.jpg\nImage:StThomasSens.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nBecket was ordained a priest on 2 June 1162 at Canterbury, and on 3 June 1162 was [[Consecration#Ordination_of_bishops|consecrated]] as archbishop by [[Henry of Blois]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and the other [[suffragan bishop]]s of Canterbury.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nA rift grew between Henry and Becket as the new archbishop resigned his [[chancellor|chancellorship]] and sought to recover and extend the rights of the [[archbishopric]]. This led to a series of conflicts with the King, including that over the jurisdiction of secular courts over English clergymen, which accelerated antipathy between Becket and the king. Attempts by Henry to influence the other bishops against Becket began in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] in October 1163, where the King sought approval of the traditional rights of the royal government in regard to the church.<ref name=ODNB/> This led to the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], where Becket was officially asked to agree to the King's rights or face political repercussions.\n\n==Constitutions of Clarendon==\n{{Main article|Becket controversy}}\n{{details|Constitutions of Clarendon}}\n\n[[File:Jindrich2 Beckett.jpg|170px|14th-century depiction of Becket with King Henry II|thumb|left|alt=Manuscript illustration.

Behind the mitred figure are a number of standing men wearing armour and carrying weapons.]]King Henry II presided over the assemblies of most of the higher English clergy at [[Clarendon Palace]] on 30 January 1164. In sixteen constitutions, he sought less clerical independence and a weaker connection with Rome. He employed all his skills to induce their consent and was apparently successful with all but Becket. Finally, even Becket expressed his willingness to agree to the substance of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], but he still refused to formally sign the documents. Henry summoned Becket to appear before a great council at [[Northampton Castle]] on 8 October 1164, to answer allegations of contempt of royal authority and [[malfeasance]] in the Chancellor's office. Convicted on the charges, Becket stormed out of the trial and fled to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nHenry pursued the fugitive archbishop with a series of [[Edict|edicts]], targeting Becket as well as all of Becket's friends and supporters, but King [[Louis VII of France]] offered Becket protection. He spent nearly two years in the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] of [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]], until Henry's threats against the order obliged him to return to [[Sens]]. Becket fought back by threatening [[excommunication]] and [[interdict]] against the king and bishops and the kingdom, but [[Pope Alexander III]], though sympathising with him in theory, favoured a more diplomatic approach. [[Papal legates]] were sent in 1167 with authority to act as arbitrators.<ref name=ODNB/>\n[[File:Arbroath Abbey Seal 01.jpg|thumb|A [[Seal (device)|Seal]] of the [[Abbot of Arbroath|Abbot]] of [[Arbroath]], showing the murder of Becket.

According to accounts left by the monk Gervase of Canterbury and eyewitness Edward Grim, they placed their weapons under a tree outside the cathedral and hid their [[mail (armour)|mail armour]] under cloaks before entering to challenge Becket. The knights informed Becket he was to go to [[Winchester]] to give an account of his actions, but Becket refused.

The knights found Becket in a spot near a door to the monastic cloister, the stairs into the crypt, and the stairs leading up into the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] of the cathedral, where the monks were chanting vespers.<ref name=ODNB/>  Upon seeing them, Becket said, \"I am no traitor and I am ready to die.\" One knight grabbed him and tried to pull him outside, but Becket grabbed onto a pillar and bowed his head to make peace with God.{{cn|date=March 2019}} \n\n[[File:Place_of_murder_in_Canterbury_cathedral.jpg|thumb|Sculpture and altar marking the spot of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, Canterbury Cathedral.

This is part of his account:\n\n{{quote|...the impious knight... suddenly set upon him and [shaved] off the summit of his crown which the sacred chrism consecrated to God...

De Morville also held property in [[Cumbria]] and this may also have provided a convenient bolt-hole, as the men prepared for a longer stay in the separate kingdom of Scotland. They were not arrested and neither did Henry confiscate their lands, but he did not help them when they sought his advice in August 1171. Pope Alexander excommunicated all four. Seeking forgiveness, the assassins travelled to Rome and were ordered by the Pope to serve as knights in the Holy Lands for a period of fourteen years.<ref name=\"Barlow pp. 257\">Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 257\u2013258</ref>\n\nThis sentence also inspired the [[Knights of Saint Thomas]], incorporated in 1191 at [[Acre, Israel#Second Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1191-1291)|Acre]], and which was to be modelled on the [[Teutonic Knights]]. This was the only military order native to England (with chapters in not only Acre, but London, Kilkenny, and Nicosia), just as the [[Gilbertine Order]] was the only monastic order native to England. Nevertheless, [[Henry VIII]] dissolved both of these English institutions at the time of the Reformation, rather than merging them with foreign orders or nationalising them as elements of the Protestant Church of England.\n\nThe monks were afraid that Becket's body might be stolen. To prevent this, Becket's remains were placed beneath the floor of the eastern [[crypt]] of the cathedral.<ref name=\"Barlow pp. 257\"/> A stone cover was placed over the burial place with two holes where [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] could insert their heads and kiss the tomb;<ref name=ODNB/> this arrangement is illustrated in the \"Miracle Windows\" of the Trinity Chapel.

The [[Bridge House Estates]] seal used only the image of Becket, while the reverse featured a depiction of his martyrdom.\n\nLocal legends regarding Becket arose after his canonisation. Though they tend toward typical [[hagiography|hagiographical stories]], they also display Becket's well-known gruffness. \"Becket's Well\", in [[Otford]], [[Kent]], is said to have been created after Becket had become displeased with the taste of the local water. Two springs of clear water are said to have bubbled up after he struck the ground with his [[crozier]]. The absence of nightingales in Otford is also ascribed to Becket, who is said to have been so disturbed in his devotions by the song of a nightingale that he commanded that none should sing in the town ever again. In the town of [[Strood]], also in Kent, Becket is said to have caused the inhabitants of the town and their descendants to be born with tails. The men of Strood had sided with the king in his struggles against the archbishop, and to demonstrate their support, had cut off the tail of Becket's horse as he passed through the town.\n\nThe saint's fame quickly spread throughout the [[Normans|Norman]] world. The first holy image of Becket is thought to be a mosaic icon still visible in [[Monreale]] Cathedral, in [[Sicily]], created shortly after his death. Becket's cousins obtained refuge at the Sicilian court during his exile, and King [[William II of Sicily|William II]] of Sicily wed a daughter of Henry II.

A few of these documents are by unknown writers, although traditional historiography has given them names. The known biographers are [[John of Salisbury]], [[Edward Grim]], [[Benedict of Peterborough]], [[William of Canterbury]], [[William fitzStephen]], [[Guernes de Pont-Sainte-Maxence|Guernes of Pont-Sainte-Maxence]], [[Robert of Cricklade]], [[Alan of Tewkesbury]], [[Benet of St Albans]], and [[Herbert of Bosham]]. The other biographers, who remain anonymous, are generally given the pseudonyms of Anonymous I, Anonymous II (or Anonymous of Lambeth), and Anonymous III (or Lansdowne Anonymous). Besides these accounts, there are also two other accounts that are likely contemporary that appear in the ''Quadrilogus II'' and the ''[[Th\u00f3mas saga Erkibyskups|Th\u00f3mas saga erkibyskups]]''. Besides these biographies, there is also the mention of the events of Becket's life in the chroniclers of the time. These include [[Robert of Torigni]]'s work, [[Roger of Howden]]'s ''Gesta Regis Henrici Secundi'' and ''Chronica'', [[Ralph Diceto]]'s works, [[William of Newburgh]]'s ''Historia Rerum'', and [[Gervase of Canterbury]]'s works.<ref name=Barlow3>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp. 3\u20139</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBecket was born about 1119,<ref>Butler and Walsh ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' p. 430</ref> or in 1120 according to later tradition.<ref name=ODNB/> He was born in [[Cheapside]], London, on 21 December, which was the feast day of St Thomas the Apostle.

Gilbert was perhaps related to [[Theobald of Bec]], whose family also was from Thierville. Gilbert began his life as a merchant, perhaps in textiles, but by the 1120s he was living in London and was a property owner, living on the rental income from his properties. He also served as the sheriff of the city at some point.<ref name=ODNB>Barlow \"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27201 Becket, Thomas (1120?\u20131170)]\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> They were buried in [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Becket Memorial Plaque on Cheapside.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking Becket's birthplace along Cheapside]]\n\nOne of Becket's father's wealthy friends, Richer de [[L'Aigle]], often invited Thomas to his estates in [[Sussex]] where Becket was exposed to hunting and hawking. According to Grim, Becket learned much from Richer, who was later a signatory of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] against Thomas.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nBeginning when he was 10, Becket was sent as a student to [[Merton Priory]] in England and later attended a grammar school in London, perhaps the one at St Paul's Cathedral. He did not study any subjects beyond the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] at these schools. Later, he spent about a year in Paris around age 20. He did not, however, study canon or civil law at this time and his [[Latin]] skill always remained somewhat rudimentary. Some time after Becket began his schooling, Gilbert Beket suffered financial reverses, and the younger Becket was forced to earn a living as a clerk. Gilbert first secured a place for his son in the business of a relative\u2014Osbert Huitdeniers\u2014and then later Becket acquired a position in the household of Theobald of Bec, by now the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nTheobald entrusted him with several important missions to Rome and also sent him to [[Bologna]] and [[Auxerre]] to study [[canon law]]. Theobald in 1154 named Becket [[List of Archdeacons of Canterbury|Archdeacon of Canterbury]], and other ecclesiastical offices included a number of [[benefice]]s, [[Prebendary|prebends]] at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and St Paul's Cathedral, and the office of [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] of [[Beverley]]. His efficiency in those posts led to Theobald recommending him to King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] for the vacant post of [[Lord Chancellor]],<ref name=ODNB/> to which Becket was appointed in January 1155.<ref name=Handbook84>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p.  84</ref>\n\nAs Chancellor, Becket enforced the king's traditional sources of revenue that were exacted from all landowners, including churches and bishoprics.<ref name=ODNB/> King Henry sent his son [[Henry the Young King|Henry]] to live in Becket's household, it being the custom then for noble children to be fostered out to other noble houses.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Primacy==\nBecket was nominated as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, several months after the death of Theobald. His election was confirmed on 23 May 1162 by a royal council of bishops and noblemen.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry may have hoped that Becket would continue to put the royal government first, rather than the church. However, the famous transformation of Becket into an [[ascetic]] occurred at this time.<ref name=Huscroft192>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 192\u2013195</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Becket enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury from a [[Nottingham Alabaster]] in the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]]\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:StThomasEnthroned.jpg\nImage:StThomasReturn.jpg\nImage:StThomasSens.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nBecket was ordained a priest on 2 June 1162 at Canterbury, and on 3 June 1162 was [[Consecration#Ordination_of_bishops|consecrated]] as archbishop by [[Henry of Blois]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and the other [[suffragan bishop]]s of Canterbury.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nA rift grew between Henry and Becket as the new archbishop resigned his [[chancellor|chancellorship]] and sought to recover and extend the rights of the [[archbishopric]]. This led to a series of conflicts with the King, including that over the jurisdiction of secular courts over English clergymen, which accelerated antipathy between Becket and the king. Attempts by Henry to influence the other bishops against Becket began in [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] in October 1163, where the King sought approval of the traditional rights of the royal government in regard to the church.<ref name=ODNB/> This led to the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], where Becket was officially asked to agree to the King's rights or face political repercussions.\n\n==Constitutions of Clarendon==\n{{Main article|Becket controversy}}\n{{details|Constitutions of Clarendon}}\n\n[[File:Jindrich2 Beckett.jpg|170px|14th-century depiction of Becket with King Henry II|thumb|left|alt=Manuscript illustration.

Behind the mitred figure are a number of standing men wearing armour and carrying weapons.]]King Henry II presided over the assemblies of most of the higher English clergy at [[Clarendon Palace]] on 30 January 1164. In sixteen constitutions, he sought less clerical independence and a weaker connection with Rome. He employed all his skills to induce their consent and was apparently successful with all but Becket. Finally, even Becket expressed his willingness to agree to the substance of the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], but he still refused to formally sign the documents. Henry summoned Becket to appear before a great council at [[Northampton Castle]] on 8 October 1164, to answer allegations of contempt of royal authority and [[malfeasance]] in the Chancellor's office. Convicted on the charges, Becket stormed out of the trial and fled to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nHenry pursued the fugitive archbishop with a series of [[Edict|edicts]], targeting Becket as well as all of Becket's friends and supporters, but King [[Louis VII of France]] offered Becket protection. He spent nearly two years in the [[Cistercian]] [[abbey]] of [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]], until Henry's threats against the order obliged him to return to [[Sens]]. Becket fought back by threatening [[excommunication]] and [[interdict]] against the king and bishops and the kingdom, but [[Pope Alexander III]], though sympathising with him in theory, favoured a more diplomatic approach. [[Papal legates]] were sent in 1167 with authority to act as arbitrators.<ref name=ODNB/>\n[[File:Arbroath Abbey Seal 01.jpg|thumb|A [[Seal (device)|Seal]] of the [[Abbot of Arbroath|Abbot]] of [[Arbroath]], showing the murder of Becket.

De Morville also held property in [[Cumbria]] and this may also have provided a convenient bolt-hole, as the men prepared for a longer stay in the separate kingdom of Scotland. They were not arrested and neither did Henry confiscate their lands, but he did not help them when they sought his advice in August 1171. Pope Alexander excommunicated all four.

Nevertheless, [[Henry VIII]] dissolved both of these English institutions at the time of the Reformation, rather than merging them with foreign orders or nationalising them as elements of the Protestant Church of England.\n\nThe monks were afraid that Becket's body might be stolen.

The [[Bridge House Estates]] seal used only the image of Becket, while the reverse featured a depiction of his martyrdom.\n\nLocal legends regarding Becket arose after his canonisation. Though they tend toward typical [[hagiography|hagiographical stories]], they also display Becket's well-known gruffness. \"Becket's Well\", in [[Otford]], [[Kent]], is said to have been created after Becket had become displeased with the taste of the local water. Two springs of clear water are said to have bubbled up after he struck the ground with his [[crozier]]. The absence of nightingales in Otford is also ascribed to Becket, who is said to have been so disturbed in his devotions by the song of a nightingale that he commanded that none should sing in the town ever again. In the town of [[Strood]], also in Kent, Becket is said to have caused the inhabitants of the town and their descendants to be born with tails. The men of Strood had sided with the king in his struggles against the archbishop, and to demonstrate their support, had cut off the tail of Becket's horse as he passed through the town.\n\nThe saint's fame quickly spread throughout the [[Normans|Norman]] world. The first holy image of Becket is thought to be a mosaic icon still visible in [[Monreale]] Cathedral, in [[Sicily]], created shortly after his death. Becket's cousins obtained refuge at the Sicilian court during his exile, and King [[William II of Sicily|William II]] of Sicily wed a daughter of Henry II. [[Marsala Cathedral]] in western Sicily is dedicated to St Thomas Becket. Over forty-five medieval [[chasse (casket)|chasse]] [[reliquaries]] decorated in [[champlev\u00e9 enamel]] showing similar scenes from Becket's life survive, including the [[Becket Casket]], originally constructed to hold relics of the saint at [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough Abbey]], and now housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:SouthNewington StPeterAdVincula StThomasBeckettMartyrdom.JPG|thumb|Wall painting of Thomas Becket's martyrdom painted in the 1330s in the parish church of [[St Peter ad Vincula, South Newington#Wall paintings|St Peter ad Vincula, South Newington]], Oxfordshire]]\n\n* In 1170 the king of Castille [[Alfonso VIII]] married [[Eleanor of England|Eleanor Plantagenet]], the second daughter of Henry II.

Starting in 1935, he also appeared in more than fifty British films, including an iconic adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019 novella  ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', released in 1951 as [[Scrooge (1951 film)|''Scrooge'']] in Great Britain and as ''A Christmas Carol'' in the United States. \n\nAfter a series of false starts, including a spell as a jobbing labourer and another as a clerk in a local government office, Sim's love of and talent for poetry reading won him several prizes and led to his appointment as a lecturer in elocution at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1925. He also ran his own private elocution and drama school, from which, with the help of the playwright [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]], he made the transition to the professional stage in 1930.\n\nDespite his late start, Sim soon became well known on the London stage. A period of more than a year as a member of the [[Old Vic]] company brought him wide experience of playing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and other classics, to which he returned throughout his career. In the modern repertoire, he formed a close professional association with the author [[James Bridie]], which lasted from 1939 until the dramatist's death in 1951. Sim not only acted in Bridie's works, but directed them.\n\nIn the later 1940s and for most of the 1950s, Sim was a leading star of British cinema, appearing in more than 50 films. They included ''[[Green for Danger (film)|Green for Danger]]'' (1946), ''[[Hue and Cry (film)|Hue and Cry]]'' (1947), ''[[The Happiest Days of Your Life]]'' (1950), ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'' (1951), ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'' (1954) and ''[[An Inspector Calls (1954 film)|An Inspector Calls]]'' (1954). Later, he made fewer films and generally concentrated on stage work, including successful productions at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre|Chichester Festival]] and regular appearances in new and old works in the West End.\n\n==Early life==\n\nSim was born in [[Edinburgh]], the youngest child and second son of Isabella (n\u00e9e McIntyre) and Alexander Sim. His mother moved to Edinburgh as a teenager from [[Eigg]], one of the [[Small Isles]] in the [[Inner Hebrides|Hebrides]], and was a native [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker.<ref>Simpson, p. 15</ref> His father was a [[Justice of the Peace]] and a successful tailor with a business on [[A700 road|Lothian Road]]. Sim was educated at Bruntsfield Primary school, [[James Gillespie's High School]] and [[George Heriot's School]].<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/spellbinding-times-at-heriot-s-1-1215177 |title=Spellbinding times at Heriot's |date=13 August 2009 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]}}</ref> He worked \u2013 probably part-time{{#tag:ref|In her memoirs, Sim's widow, [[Naomi Sim|Naomi]], wrote that he worked after leaving school at fourteen; in his 2011 biography of Sim, Mark Simpson questions this, observing that Sim took his Intermediate School Certificate at the age of sixteen|group= n}} \u2013 in his father's shop and then for the men's outfitters [[Gieves & Hawkes|Gieve's]], displaying no talent for the retail trade.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 1918 he was admitted to the University of Edinburgh to study analytical chemistry, but was called up for army training.<ref name=dnb>Gilbert, Michael.

In his spare time, he joined poetry reading classes, winning the gold medal for verse speaking at the Edinburgh Music Festival. This led to his engagement to teach [[elocution]] at a further education college in [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]], Edinburgh. He held this post from 1922 to 1924. After taking an advanced training course in his subject, in 1925 he successfully applied to the University of Edinburgh for the post of Fulton Lecturer in Elocution, which he held for five years.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nWhile maintaining his university position, Sim also taught private pupils and later founded and ran his own drama school for children in Edinburgh. This developed his skills as a director and occasional actor. One of his pupils, [[Naomi Sim|Naomi Merlith Plaskitt]], aged 12 when they met, became his wife six years later. The dramatist [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]] saw one of Sim's productions for the school and encouraged him to become a professional actor.<ref name=times>\"Obituary: Mr Alastair Sim \u2013 Idiosyncratic comedian of stage and screen\", ''The Times'', 21 August 1976, p. 14</ref> Through Drinkwater's influence, Sim was cast in his first professional production, ''[[Othello]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]], London, in 1930; he understudied the three principal male roles (played by [[Paul Robeson]], Maurice Browne and [[Ralph Richardson]]) and played the small role of the messenger.<ref name=dnb/><ref>[http://www.alastairsim.net/biography/annual_overview.htm \"Biography \u2013 Annual Overview\"], Alastair Sim, retrieved 11 July 2014</ref>\n\n==Early stage and screen career==\n\nSim followed ''Othello'' with productions ranging from a musical [[revue]] to a medieval costume drama by [[Clifford Bax]], in whose ''The Venetian'' he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in October 1931.<ref name=gaye>Gaye, pp. 1184\u20131185</ref><ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=11436 ''The Venetian''], Internet Broadway database, accessed 15 July 2014</ref> In 1932\u201333 he was engaged for sixteen months as a member of the [[Old Vic]] company, headed by [[Peggy Ashcroft]].

The new plays in which Sim appeared were [[Michael Gilbert]]'s ''Windfall'' (1963), [[William Trevor]]'s ''The Elephant's Foot'' (1965) and [[Ronald Millar]]'s ''Number Ten'' (1967); he directed all three productions. The first was dismissed by ''The Times'' as a tepid comedy about a progressive young headmaster thwarted by a reactionary member of his staff; the second, billed as a pre-London tour, started and finished in the provinces; the last was castigated by [[Philip Hope-Wallace]] in ''The Guardian'' as \"maladroit playmaking\" with a tedious plot about political machinations.<ref name=crits60s/> Sim's performances provided some consolation: in the first, ''The Times'' said, his \"treacherously sweet smiles, triple takes and unheralded spasms of apoplectic fury almost make the evening worth while\".<ref name=crits60s>Lyric Theatre. \"Mr Sim again the Indulgent Pedagogue\",  ''The Times'', 3 July 1963, p. 13 (''Windfall''); \"Briefing\", ''The Observer'', 4 April 1965, p. 22 (''The Elephant's Foot''); and Hope-Wallace, Philip. \"Number 10 at the Strand Theatre\", ''The Guardian'', 16 November 1967, p. 6 (''Number Ten'')</ref>\n\nMuch more successful among Sim's 1960s appearances were two productions at the [[Chichester Festival]]: [[George Colman the Elder|Colman]] and [[David Garrick|Garrick]]'s 1766 comedy ''[[The Clandestine Marriage]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Magistrate (play)|The Magistrate]]''.

Starting in 1935, he also appeared in more than fifty British films, including an iconic adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019 novella  ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', released in 1951 as [[Scrooge (1951 film)|''Scrooge'']] in Great Britain and as ''A Christmas Carol'' in the United States. \n\nAfter a series of false starts, including a spell as a jobbing labourer and another as a clerk in a local government office, Sim's love of and talent for poetry reading won him several prizes and led to his appointment as a lecturer in elocution at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1925. He also ran his own private elocution and drama school, from which, with the help of the playwright [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]], he made the transition to the professional stage in 1930.\n\nDespite his late start, Sim soon became well known on the London stage. A period of more than a year as a member of the [[Old Vic]] company brought him wide experience of playing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and other classics, to which he returned throughout his career. In the modern repertoire, he formed a close professional association with the author [[James Bridie]], which lasted from 1939 until the dramatist's death in 1951. Sim not only acted in Bridie's works, but directed them.\n\nIn the later 1940s and for most of the 1950s, Sim was a leading star of British cinema, appearing in more than 50 films. They included ''[[Green for Danger (film)|Green for Danger]]'' (1946), ''[[Hue and Cry (film)|Hue and Cry]]'' (1947), ''[[The Happiest Days of Your Life]]'' (1950), ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'' (1951), ''[[The Belles of St Trinian's]]'' (1954) and ''[[An Inspector Calls (1954 film)|An Inspector Calls]]'' (1954). Later, he made fewer films and generally concentrated on stage work, including successful productions at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre|Chichester Festival]] and regular appearances in new and old works in the West End.\n\n==Early life==\n\nSim was born in [[Edinburgh]], the youngest child and second son of Isabella (n\u00e9e McIntyre) and Alexander Sim.

The new plays in which Sim appeared were [[Michael Gilbert]]'s ''Windfall'' (1963), [[William Trevor]]'s ''The Elephant's Foot'' (1965) and [[Ronald Millar]]'s ''Number Ten'' (1967); he directed all three productions. The first was dismissed by ''The Times'' as a tepid comedy about a progressive young headmaster thwarted by a reactionary member of his staff; the second, billed as a pre-London tour, started and finished in the provinces; the last was castigated by [[Philip Hope-Wallace]] in ''The Guardian'' as \"maladroit playmaking\" with a tedious plot about political machinations.<ref name=crits60s/> Sim's performances provided some consolation: in the first, ''The Times'' said, his \"treacherously sweet smiles, triple takes and unheralded spasms of apoplectic fury almost make the evening worth while\".<ref name=crits60s>Lyric Theatre. \"Mr Sim again the Indulgent Pedagogue\",  ''The Times'', 3 July 1963, p. 13 (''Windfall''); \"Briefing\", ''The Observer'', 4 April 1965, p. 22 (''The Elephant's Foot''); and Hope-Wallace, Philip. \"Number 10 at the Strand Theatre\", ''The Guardian'', 16 November 1967, p. 6 (''Number Ten'')</ref>\n\nMuch more successful among Sim's 1960s appearances were two productions at the [[Chichester Festival]]: [[George Colman the Elder|Colman]] and [[David Garrick|Garrick]]'s 1766 comedy ''[[The Clandestine Marriage]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Magistrate (play)|The Magistrate]]''.

McGee left school at 16 with one [[O Grade]].<ref name=\"harris\"/> McGee and Gillespie were heavily into punk rock, and they joined a local punk band, The Drains, in 1978. The band's guitarist was [[Andrew Innes]].<ref name=\"uncut\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/uncut-nov99.html|title=True Adventures of Primal Scream|accessdate=27 December 2007|author=[[Michael Bonner]]|date=November 1999|magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123182728/http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/uncut-nov99.html|archivedate=23 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter the breakup of The Drains, McGee and Innes moved to London and formed the band [[The Laughing Apple]] with Mark Jardim, a drummer from Croydon.<ref name=\"harris\"/> They recorded three singles in 1981 and 1982, two of which were released on Autonomy, and the third was put out on their own Essential record label.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1983, quitting his job at [[British Rail]], he co-founded [[Creation Records]] (named after cult 1960s band [[The Creation (band)|The Creation]]) with Dick Green and [[Slaughter Joe|Joe Foster]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nMcGee said that his intention with Creation \"was to merge psychedelia with punk rock\".<ref name=\"harris\"/> He also formed the band [[Biff Bang Pow!]] (named after The Creation's song), which would continue until 1991, and began running a club night called \"The Living Room\" at The Adams Arms in Central London.

When [[The Jesus And Mary Chain]] moved to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers]] in 1985, Creation was able to use McGee's profits as their manager to release singles by acts including [[Primal Scream]], [[Felt (band)|Felt]], and [[The Weather Prophets]]. While these records were not commercially successful, McGee's enthusiasm and ability to promote Creation releases in the weekly music media ensured a healthy following. Following an unsuccessful attempt to run an offshoot label for Warner Brothers, McGee regrouped Creation and immersed himself in the burgeoning [[dance music|dance]] and [[acid house]] scene, the legacy of which saw him release era-defining albums from Creation mainstays [[Primal Scream]] and new arrivals like [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and [[Teenage Fanclub]].<ref name=\"harris\"/>\n\nDuring this time Creation had run up considerable debts, which forced McGee to sell half of the label to [[Sony Music]] in 1992. McGee calls the Sony years as the beginning of the end of the ''real'' Creation Records, which was driven by Joe Foster, Tim Abbot, Dick Green and McGee himself, and not by Sony accountants and marketing managers.<ref name=\"harris\"/> At the point it seemed Creation would collapse into receivership, the recently signed Manchester band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] began selling albums in huge quantities, as one of the leading lights of the [[Britpop]] movement of the mid-1990s. The success of Oasis was unprecedented for an act on an independent label, and their second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' became the biggest selling British album of the decade.<ref name=\"MW19991218\">{{cite magazine|title=Top 20 Singles and Albums of the Nineties|periodical=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Miller Freeman|page=28|date=18 December 1999}}</ref>\n\nThis brought McGee substantial exposure, and his position was noted by the revitalized [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who considered him a figurehead of youth culture and courted his influence to spearhead a media campaign prior to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 General Election]]. McGee was largely responsible for changing government legislation in relation to musicians being able to go on the ''New Deal'' which gave musicians three years to develop and be funded by the government instead of having to take other jobs to survive.<ref name=\"harris\"/> In 1998, [[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]] made a documentary about McGee and Creation for [[BBC One]].\n\nMcGee was awarded by the ''NME'' 'Godlike Genius' award in February 1996 <ref>{{cite magazine|last=Anderson|first=Sarah|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/22-glorious-years-of-nme-s-godlike-genius-award-1417150|title=22 glorious years of NME's Godlike Genius Award|magazine=[[NME]]|date=19 January 2016|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> and Creation Records was awarded \"independent label of the year\" every year between 1995 and 1998 by ''Music Week''. McGee returned to making music in 1997, collaborating with [[Ed Ball (musician)|Ed Ball]] under the name The Chemical Pilot, releasing the album ''Journey to the Centre of the Mind'' in 1998.<ref name=\"Strong\"/>\n\nWhile Oasis went on to sell nearly 54 million records by 2008, Creation continued issuing albums by other artists, none of which came near the success of the Manchester band. Rumours began to circulate of McGee's dissatisfaction with the direction Creation had gone. In late 1999 it was announced that Creation Records would cease operations. The final album released by the label was [[Primal Scream]]'s 2000 release ''[[XTRMNTR]]'', which went gold in the UK. The final single was the third released from the album itself.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nTwo books were written in the wake of Creation Records: One, by David Cavanagh, which McGee calls \"the accountant's tale\" and one by Paulo Hewitt. McGee closed Creation Records for good, selling the rest of the shares to Sony in 2000 for an overall price that was staggered through the 1990s of around $30,000,000 (USD).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Following Creation's closure, McGee became a property developer, buying houses, flats, a farm in [[Wales]] and even an office block in [[Primrose Hill]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Post Creation: Poptones Records and Death Disco===\nThe dissolution of Creation Records led to McGee forming [[Poptones]] in 2000.

Although Poptones was written off by Paul Lester of ''[[UNCUT (magazine)|Uncut]]'' after eight days of opening {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=June 2009}}, McGee found platinum success within the second year with [[The Hives]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} During this period McGee also ran the international club night, Death Disco. McGee occasionally DJ's around the globe under the moniker of \"Death Disco\". Death Disco had branches in [[Glasgow]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Budapest]] and [[Los Angeles]].

Following an unsuccessful attempt to run an offshoot label for Warner Brothers, McGee regrouped Creation and immersed himself in the burgeoning [[dance music|dance]] and [[acid house]] scene, the legacy of which saw him release era-defining albums from Creation mainstays [[Primal Scream]] and new arrivals like [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and [[Teenage Fanclub]].<ref name=\"harris\"/>\n\nDuring this time Creation had run up considerable debts, which forced McGee to sell half of the label to [[Sony Music]] in 1992. McGee calls the Sony years as the beginning of the end of the ''real'' Creation Records, which was driven by Joe Foster, Tim Abbot, Dick Green and McGee himself, and not by Sony accountants and marketing managers.<ref name=\"harris\"/> At the point it seemed Creation would collapse into receivership, the recently signed Manchester band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] began selling albums in huge quantities, as one of the leading lights of the [[Britpop]] movement of the mid-1990s. The success of Oasis was unprecedented for an act on an independent label, and their second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' became the biggest selling British album of the decade.<ref name=\"MW19991218\">{{cite magazine|title=Top 20 Singles and Albums of the Nineties|periodical=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Miller Freeman|page=28|date=18 December 1999}}</ref>\n\nThis brought McGee substantial exposure, and his position was noted by the revitalized [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who considered him a figurehead of youth culture and courted his influence to spearhead a media campaign prior to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 General Election]]. McGee was largely responsible for changing government legislation in relation to musicians being able to go on the ''New Deal'' which gave musicians three years to develop and be funded by the government instead of having to take other jobs to survive.<ref name=\"harris\"/> In 1998, [[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]] made a documentary about McGee and Creation for [[BBC One]].\n\nMcGee was awarded by the ''NME'' 'Godlike Genius' award in February 1996 <ref>{{cite magazine|last=Anderson|first=Sarah|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/22-glorious-years-of-nme-s-godlike-genius-award-1417150|title=22 glorious years of NME's Godlike Genius Award|magazine=[[NME]]|date=19 January 2016|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> and Creation Records was awarded \"independent label of the year\" every year between 1995 and 1998 by ''Music Week''. McGee returned to making music in 1997, collaborating with [[Ed Ball (musician)|Ed Ball]] under the name The Chemical Pilot, releasing the album ''Journey to the Centre of the Mind'' in 1998.<ref name=\"Strong\"/>\n\nWhile Oasis went on to sell nearly 54 million records by 2008, Creation continued issuing albums by other artists, none of which came near the success of the Manchester band. Rumours began to circulate of McGee's dissatisfaction with the direction Creation had gone. In late 1999 it was announced that Creation Records would cease operations. The final album released by the label was [[Primal Scream]]'s 2000 release ''[[XTRMNTR]]'', which went gold in the UK. The final single was the third released from the album itself.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nTwo books were written in the wake of Creation Records: One, by David Cavanagh, which McGee calls \"the accountant's tale\" and one by Paulo Hewitt. McGee closed Creation Records for good, selling the rest of the shares to Sony in 2000 for an overall price that was staggered through the 1990s of around $30,000,000 (USD).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Following Creation's closure, McGee became a property developer, buying houses, flats, a farm in [[Wales]] and even an office block in [[Primrose Hill]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Post Creation: Poptones Records and Death Disco===\nThe dissolution of Creation Records led to McGee forming [[Poptones]] in 2000. The label's name is a homage to the [[Public Image Limited]] song. Although Poptones was written off by Paul Lester of ''[[UNCUT (magazine)|Uncut]]'' after eight days of opening {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=June 2009}}, McGee found platinum success within the second year with [[The Hives]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} During this period McGee also ran the international club night, Death Disco. McGee occasionally DJ's around the globe under the moniker of \"Death Disco\". Death Disco had branches in [[Glasgow]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Budapest]] and [[Los Angeles]]. Death Disco had appearances from [[The Libertines]], [[The Killers]], [[BRMC]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Glasvegas]], [[Razorlight]], [[The Hives]], [[Kasabian]], [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], [[Neils Children]] and [[The Foxes (band)|The Foxes]] among others. McGee had no further involvement with Death Disco after 2009.\n\nIn May 2007, McGee told ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper that he was winding down Poptones for financial reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/alan-mcgee-why-im-giving-up-my-label-448270.html|title=Alan McGee: Why I'm giving up my label|work=The Independent|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"martin\"/>\n[[File:Mcgee moss fallon.jpg|thumb|right|Alan McGee, [[Kate Moss]], and [[BP Fallon]] DJing at Death Disco NY in 2004]]\n\n===Retirement from music management and other activities===\nOn 12 September 2008, McGee retired from band music management and being involved with record companies after 25 years.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Michaels|first=Sean|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/30/alan-mcgee-retirement-oasis|title=Alan McGee announces his retirement|date=2008-10-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The decision was due to him wanting to concentrate on raising his daughter.

In interviews with the Glasgow's ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' in September 2010 and the UK's ''[[The Independent]]'' in October 2010, McGee stated he had lost interest in music and was more interested in the esoteric and occult teachings of Aleister Crowley and [[Peter J.

Fought in northwestern [[Asia Minor]], near the site of [[Troy]], it was here that Alexander defeated the forces of the Persian [[satrap]]s of Asia Minor, including a large force of Greek mercenaries led by [[Memnon of Rhodes]].\n\nThe battle took place on the road from [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]] to [[Dascylium]] (near modern-day Ergili, [[Turkey]]), at the crossing of the [[Granicus]] River (modern-day ''[[Biga \u00c7ay\u0131]]'').\n\n==Background==\nAfter the death of Phillip of Macedon, many of his newly conquered territories desired to take advantage of the perceived weakness of the new young king. These nations included the [[Illyria]]ns, [[Thracia]]ns, and some southern Greek city-states. Alexander had to prove the strength of his rule before leaving for his Persian expedition, and crushed several nascent rebellions within Greece and the northern tribes. After extensive planning in Macedonia, Alexander started to prepare for his next major conquest: the invasion of Asia. Before leaving Macedon, Alexander appointed his father\u2019s experienced general Antipater as regent in his absence, leaving him with 9,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to maintain control over Macedonia's holdings in Europe.

Alexander's second-in-command, [[Parmenion]], suggested crossing the river upstream and attacking at dawn the next day, but Alexander attacked immediately. This tactic caught the Persians off guard.  The Macedonian line was arrayed with the heavy [[Macedonian phalanx|phalanx]]es in the middle, and cavalry on either side.  Alexander was with the [[Companion cavalry|Companions]] on the right flank.  The Persians expected the main assault to come from Alexander's position and moved units from their center to that flank.\n\n[[File:Spithridates attacking Alexander from behind at the Battle of Granicus.jpg|thumb|left|Achaemenid satrap of [[Lydia]] [[Spithridates]], attacking Alexander from behind at the [[Battle of Granicus]].

The Persians countercharged with a squadron of nobles on horse, and accounts show that in the melee, several high-ranking Persian nobles were killed by Alexander himself or his bodyguards, although Alexander was stunned by an axe-blow from a Persian nobleman named [[Rhoisakes]]. A second Persian nobleman named [[Spithridates]] attempted to attack Alexander from behind while he was still reeling; however, he was himself killed by [[Cleitus the Black]], who severed his outstretched arm. Alexander quickly recovered.\n\nEventually the Macedonian horse were able to gain the advantage over their Persian counterpart, owing to the superiority of their [[xyston|lance]] over the Persian [[javelin]] for [[melee]] fighting<ref>[[Arrian]] ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' I.15.46</ref>, as well as the close support of the light infantry interspersed among their squadrons.<ref>[[Arrian]] ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' I.16.48</ref> The Greek cavalry then turned left and started rolling up the Persian cavalry, which was engaged with the left side of the Macedonian line after a general advance.  A hole opened in the recently vacated place in the battle line, and the Macedonian infantry charged through to engage the poor-quality Persian infantry in the rear. The Macedonian phalanx then attacked the Greek mercenaries. With many of their leaders already dead, and their infantry routed, both flanks of the Persian cavalry retreated, seeing the collapse of the center.  The infantry routed too, many being cut down as they fled.\n\nTotal casualties for the Greeks were between 300 and 400.  The Persians had roughly 1,000 cavalry and 3,000 infantry killed, mostly in the rout.  The Greek mercenaries, under the command of [[Memnon of Rhodes]], who fought for the Persians, were abandoned after the cavalry retreat.  They attempted to broker a peace with Alexander but to no avail.  As a result, after the battle Alexander ordered the mercenaries to be enslaved. Out of the 18,000 Greek mercenaries, half were killed and 8,000 enslaved and sent back to Macedon.<ref name=\"Arrian 1.16.45 - 50\"/>\nAlso, Alexander sent 300 Persian [[armour]]s to the [[Parthenon|Parthenon of Athens]] as an [[oblation]] to [[Athena]], with this [[epigram]]: \"''Alexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks, except of [[Lacedaemonians]], from the barbarians who live in Asia''\".

The Persians, resting on high ground, made no move, intending to fall upon the foes as he crossed the river, for they supposed they could easily carry the day when the Macedonian phalanx was divided. But Alexander at dawn boldly brought his army across the river and deployed in good order before they could stop him. In return, they posted their mass of horsemen all along the front of the Macedonians since they had decided to press the battle with these. Memnon of Rhodes and satrap Arsamenes held the left wing each with his own cavalry; Arsites was stationed next with the horsemen from Paphlagonia; then came Spithrobates satrap of Ionia at the head of the Hyrcanian cavalry. The right wing was held by a thousand Medes and two thousand horsemen with Rheomithres as well as Bactrians of like number. Other national contingents occupied the centre, numerous and picked for their valour. In all, the cavalry amounted to more than ten thousand. The Persian foot soldiers were not fewer than one hundred thousand, but they were posted behind the line and did not advance since the cavalry was thought to be sufficient to crush the Macedonians.\"<ref>Diodorus, Book XVII, 19</ref> The record of Arrian and Diodorus on the battle of Granicus can't be reconciled so historians usually prefer Arrian, although some revisionists try to reconcile the two accounts.\n\n==Revisionist view==\n[[File:Cornelis Troost 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Alexander the Great in the battle against the Persians at the Granicus''. [[Cornelis Troost]], 1737.]]\nHistorian [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], in his 1974 book ''Alexander of Macedon'', proposed a way to reconcile the accounts of Diodorus and Arrian.  According to Green's interpretation, the riverbank was guarded by infantry, not cavalry, and Alexander's forces sustained heavy losses in the initial attempt to cross the river and were forced to retire.  Alexander then grudgingly accepted Parmenion's advice and crossed the river during the night in an uncontested location, and fought the battle at dawn the next day.  The Persian army hurried to the location of Alexander's crossing, with the cavalry reaching the scene of the battle first before the slower infantry, and then the battle continued largely as described by the Arrian and Plutarch accounts.  Green accounts for the differences between his account and the ancient sources by suggesting that Alexander later covered up his initial failed crossing. Green devotes an entire appendix in support of his interpretation, taking the view that for political reasons, Alexander could not admit even a temporary defeat. Thus, the initial defeat was covered up by his propagandists by a very heroic (and Homeric) charge into the now well-deployed enemy. In his preface to the 2012 reprint, Green states: \"on the evidence as it stands that theory remains untenable and the contradiction inexplicable.\"<ref>Green, \"Preface to the 2012 edition\", ''Alexander of Macedon'', Kindle edition. {{ISBN|0520275861}}.</ref>\n\n==Result==\nTowards the end of this battle, Alexander buried the Persian commanders and the Greek mercenaries who were killed fighting on the side of the enemy. Those he took as prisoners were bound in fetters and sent away to Macedonia to till the soil, because, although they were Greeks, they were fighting against Greece on behalf of the foreigners, in opposition to decrees which the Greeks had made in their federal council.<ref>[[Arrian]], ''Anabasis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D6 1.16.6], on Perseus (Greek original)</ref>\nTo Athens also he sent 300 suits of Persian armour to be hung up in the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] as a [[votive offering]] to [[Athena]] and ordered this inscription to be fixed over them so as to mark the absence of the Spartans in his united Greek army: \"Alexander, son of Philip and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the barbarians inhabiting Asia\".<ref>[[Arrian]], ''Anabasis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D7 1.16.7], on Perseus (Greek original)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient Macedonian army]]\n*[[Aretis]]\n*[[Battle of Issus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Battle of the Granicus}}\n*Delbr\u00fcck, Hans (1920).

With many of their leaders already dead, and their infantry routed, both flanks of the Persian cavalry retreated, seeing the collapse of the center.  The infantry routed too, many being cut down as they fled.\n\nTotal casualties for the Greeks were between 300 and 400.  The Persians had roughly 1,000 cavalry and 3,000 infantry killed, mostly in the rout.  The Greek mercenaries, under the command of [[Memnon of Rhodes]], who fought for the Persians, were abandoned after the cavalry retreat.  They attempted to broker a peace with Alexander but to no avail.  As a result, after the battle Alexander ordered the mercenaries to be enslaved. Out of the 18,000 Greek mercenaries, half were killed and 8,000 enslaved and sent back to Macedon.<ref name=\"Arrian 1.16.45 - 50\"/>\nAlso, Alexander sent 300 Persian [[armour]]s to the [[Parthenon|Parthenon of Athens]] as an [[oblation]] to [[Athena]], with this [[epigram]]: \"''Alexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks, except of [[Lacedaemonians]], from the barbarians who live in Asia''\".

The Persians, resting on high ground, made no move, intending to fall upon the foes as he crossed the river, for they supposed they could easily carry the day when the Macedonian phalanx was divided. But Alexander at dawn boldly brought his army across the river and deployed in good order before they could stop him. In return, they posted their mass of horsemen all along the front of the Macedonians since they had decided to press the battle with these. Memnon of Rhodes and satrap Arsamenes held the left wing each with his own cavalry; Arsites was stationed next with the horsemen from Paphlagonia; then came Spithrobates satrap of Ionia at the head of the Hyrcanian cavalry. The right wing was held by a thousand Medes and two thousand horsemen with Rheomithres as well as Bactrians of like number. Other national contingents occupied the centre, numerous and picked for their valour. In all, the cavalry amounted to more than ten thousand. The Persian foot soldiers were not fewer than one hundred thousand, but they were posted behind the line and did not advance since the cavalry was thought to be sufficient to crush the Macedonians.\"<ref>Diodorus, Book XVII, 19</ref> The record of Arrian and Diodorus on the battle of Granicus can't be reconciled so historians usually prefer Arrian, although some revisionists try to reconcile the two accounts.\n\n==Revisionist view==\n[[File:Cornelis Troost 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Alexander the Great in the battle against the Persians at the Granicus''. [[Cornelis Troost]], 1737.]]\nHistorian [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], in his 1974 book ''Alexander of Macedon'', proposed a way to reconcile the accounts of Diodorus and Arrian.  According to Green's interpretation, the riverbank was guarded by infantry, not cavalry, and Alexander's forces sustained heavy losses in the initial attempt to cross the river and were forced to retire.  Alexander then grudgingly accepted Parmenion's advice and crossed the river during the night in an uncontested location, and fought the battle at dawn the next day.  The Persian army hurried to the location of Alexander's crossing, with the cavalry reaching the scene of the battle first before the slower infantry, and then the battle continued largely as described by the Arrian and Plutarch accounts.  Green accounts for the differences between his account and the ancient sources by suggesting that Alexander later covered up his initial failed crossing. Green devotes an entire appendix in support of his interpretation, taking the view that for political reasons, Alexander could not admit even a temporary defeat. Thus, the initial defeat was covered up by his propagandists by a very heroic (and Homeric) charge into the now well-deployed enemy. In his preface to the 2012 reprint, Green states: \"on the evidence as it stands that theory remains untenable and the contradiction inexplicable.\"<ref>Green, \"Preface to the 2012 edition\", ''Alexander of Macedon'', Kindle edition. {{ISBN|0520275861}}.</ref>\n\n==Result==\nTowards the end of this battle, Alexander buried the Persian commanders and the Greek mercenaries who were killed fighting on the side of the enemy. Those he took as prisoners were bound in fetters and sent away to Macedonia to till the soil, because, although they were Greeks, they were fighting against Greece on behalf of the foreigners, in opposition to decrees which the Greeks had made in their federal council.<ref>[[Arrian]], ''Anabasis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D6 1.16.6], on Perseus (Greek original)</ref>\nTo Athens also he sent 300 suits of Persian armour to be hung up in the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] as a [[votive offering]] to [[Athena]] and ordered this inscription to be fixed over them so as to mark the absence of the Spartans in his united Greek army: \"Alexander, son of Philip and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the barbarians inhabiting Asia\".<ref>[[Arrian]], ''Anabasis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0530%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D16%3Asection%3D7 1.16.7], on Perseus (Greek original)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ancient Macedonian army]]\n*[[Aretis]]\n*[[Battle of Issus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Battle of the Granicus}}\n*Delbr\u00fcck, Hans (1920).

As a popular tourist destination leisure sports like Golf, but most particularly sports associated with its famous beaches, have always been popular. A number of surf clubs line Gold Coasts beaches, who host a variety of swimming and athletic events collected into surf carnivals along with competitions evolved from methods of surf life saving.\n\nMotor racing has a strong history on the coast with racing having been held in the region since 1954, but consistently since the late 1960s with only a small break in the late 1980s as well as hosting the region's largest event, the [[Gold Coast 600]].\n\nThe region has had a sporadic history with professional club sport. Several national competitions in Australia's different football codes and basketball have attempted to establish clubs in the city since the 1980s, often bankrolled by wealthy private owners including Christopher Skase and Clive Palmer, and most such clubs have folded within only a few years. In 2015, only the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in rugby league and the [[Gold Coast Suns]] in Australian rules football are competing in fully professional competitions. No Gold Coast based club has yet won a national premiership in its code.\n\nThe region was the host of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]], building and upgrading various venues all over the Coast. The games were centred on [[Carrara Stadium]].\n\n==Professional sports==\n[[File:Adelaide v Gold Coast - Carrara crowd.jpg|thumb|[[Carrara Stadium]], home of the AFL's Gold Coast Suns.]]\n[[File:Aussie rules game.jpg|thumb|[[Australian rules football]] being played at Carrara Stadium.]]\n[[File:Skilled Park (2008).jpg|thumb|[[Robina Stadium]], home of the NRL's Gold Coast Titans.]]\nThe Gold Coast is currently home to professional sports teams in [[Australian rules football]] and [[rugby league]].

The club was forced to play in Tweed Heads due to a clause in the [[Brisbane Broncos]] licence at the time which disallowed any other clubs from playing in south-east Queensland, but was also financially favourable for the club, as the club was allowed to produce revenue through gaming machines which was a legal practice in New South Wales but not in Queensland. In 1990, the team became known as the [[Gold Coast Seagulls]] but continued to play out of Tweed Heads, with the occasional game played at Carrara Stadium. In 1991 the ''[[Gambling in Australia|Gaming Machine Act]]'' passed in Queensland which caused considerable damage to the Seagulls' bottom line, and the club withdrew from the NSWRL in 1995 due to financial strains and the looming [[Super League war]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOh_H1pMSWE How the Gold Coast Titans evolved].

This annual event held in January each year attracts buyers and enthusiasts from around the world, with one year a staggering $100 million turnover in yearling sales.

The Ladies Masters was first held on the Gold Coast in 1990 at Palm Meadows and moved to its current home in 1992. The PGA Championship was first held on the Gold Coast in 1970 and returned in both 1971 and 1975. Following the 1975 Championships, the event did not return to the Gold Coast until 2013.\n\n===Surfing===\nThe [[Roxy Pro Gold Coast|Roxy Pro]] and [[Quiksilver Pro]] are held on the Gold Coast and kickstart the [[ASP World Tour|ASP World Surfing Tour]] calendar each year.

The Clippers played home games at Carrara Stadium during their first season but re-branded to the [[Daikyo Dolphins]] a year later and set up base at [[Palm Meadows]]. The Dolphins were able to win the Gold Coast's first national championship of any sport in the [[1991\u201392 Australian Baseball League season|1991-92 season]] where they defeated the [[Perth Heat]] 3-1 in the Championship series. Daikyo, the major sponsor of the Dolphins, ended their association with the club in 1993 and the team once again re-branded to become the [[Gold Coast Cougars]] and also returned to Carrara Stadium for the [[1993\u201394 Australian Baseball League season|1993-94 season]]. The Cougars managed to acquire a second championship in the final season of the Australian Baseball League where they defeated the [[Sydney Storm]] in the [[1998\u201399 Australian Baseball League season|1998\u201399]] Championship series.

As a popular tourist destination leisure sports like Golf, but most particularly sports associated with its famous beaches, have always been popular. A number of surf clubs line Gold Coasts beaches, who host a variety of swimming and athletic events collected into surf carnivals along with competitions evolved from methods of surf life saving.\n\nMotor racing has a strong history on the coast with racing having been held in the region since 1954, but consistently since the late 1960s with only a small break in the late 1980s as well as hosting the region's largest event, the [[Gold Coast 600]].\n\nThe region has had a sporadic history with professional club sport. Several national competitions in Australia's different football codes and basketball have attempted to establish clubs in the city since the 1980s, often bankrolled by wealthy private owners including Christopher Skase and Clive Palmer, and most such clubs have folded within only a few years.

No Gold Coast based club has yet won a national premiership in its code.\n\nThe region was the host of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]], building and upgrading various venues all over the Coast.

The club played at [[Seagulls Stadium]] in [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]], which is located just across the border in [[New South Wales]], but borders the Gold Coast and is considered by many to be a part of the greater Gold Coast area. The club was forced to play in Tweed Heads due to a clause in the [[Brisbane Broncos]] licence at the time which disallowed any other clubs from playing in south-east Queensland, but was also financially favourable for the club, as the club was allowed to produce revenue through gaming machines which was a legal practice in New South Wales but not in Queensland. In 1990, the team became known as the [[Gold Coast Seagulls]] but continued to play out of Tweed Heads, with the occasional game played at Carrara Stadium. In 1991 the ''[[Gambling in Australia|Gaming Machine Act]]'' passed in Queensland which caused considerable damage to the Seagulls' bottom line, and the club withdrew from the NSWRL in 1995 due to financial strains and the looming [[Super League war]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOh_H1pMSWE How the Gold Coast Titans evolved].
