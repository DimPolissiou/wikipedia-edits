[[Bishop]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nReverdy Cassius Ransom was born in [[Flushing, Ohio]], on January 4, 1861. His father, whose name is not recorded, was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and his mother, Harriet Johnson, was an African American who sacrificed herself in order to ensure Reverdy's education.\n\nRansom was introduced to the [[African Methodist Episcopal]] church (A.M.E.) in 1865, by his mother and stepfather, in [[Washington, Ohio]]. Although he was not used to the idea of attending church he was forced due to his stepfather's family influence, he was intrigued by the church's fight for civil rights and economic stability for the African-American community. He was also intrigued by the militant leaders who were head of the church, such as [[Daniel Payne]], [[Benjamin W. Arnett]], and [[Henry McNeal Turner]]. While Ransom had not fully committed to the church as a young boy, the A.M.E. Churches' discussion of racial issues helped strengthen his religious consciousness.\n\nIn his youth, Ransom married and had a child.  His mother raised this child, his first son, while Ransom's wife worked, because his mother was dedicated to Ransom's education and future.  Ransom began his higher education at [[Wilberforce University]]. Although he attended [[Oberlin College]] for some small portion of his higher education, he returned to Wilberforce University very soon with renewed appreciation for its many positive qualities.\n\nWhile studying and preparing for ordained ministry at Wilberforce, Ransom became distanced from his first wife due to a growing intellectual chasm.  They eventually divorced, and he remarried. The Emma Ransom House YWCA in Harlem, New York City, was named in honor of his second wife [[Emma S. Ransom]]. She helped many young black women to better their education and lives.\n\n===Career===\n\nBishop Reverdy C. Ransom served the A.M.E. Church as a minister in the late 1880s. During this time, he witnessed the harsh despair and poverty that African Americans suffered in the industrial centers in Altoona and Alleghany, Pennsylvania. After examining the role of church in the community, he decided that the best way to fight the poor living conditions of African Americans was to establish programs that taught self-improvement.<ref>Cornelius L.

Dubois: Biography of a Race.'' pg. 329.</ref>\nRansom spoke passionately  on \"The Spirit of John Brown.\"\n\n===Ideas===\n\nBishop Reverdy C. Ransom recognized the inequality in American society, blaming it on [[capitalism]] and [[individualism]] and seeing [[socialism]] and [[Christian faith]] as means to tackle this evil.  He believed that the world had enough resources to care for all humanity, but the distribution of them was wrongly handled.  For him, socialism offered a means to help the downtrodden, which was in keeping with the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]].\n\nRansom disagreed with the idea that the African race was inferior to the White, and explained the hardships suffered by his people in the United States as a burden, during which God strengthened them in order that they would be a better instrument afterward to help bring the African race to a rightful position in American society.  This can be seen as his answer to the theological question of the [[problem of evil]].\n\n{{quote|God brought naked barbarians from Africa, put them upon the anvil of American Christianity and Democracy; under the white heat of denial and persecution, He is fashioning them with sledgehammer blows into a new pattern from American civilization.|Reverdy C. Ransom|The Negro, The hope or the despair of Christianity}}\n\n===Death and legacy===\nRansom was an eloquent orator. He served as Pastor of Charles Street A. M. E. in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as many other churches in New York, Ohio, and Bethel Church in Chicago. He founded the Institutional Church and Social Settlement. Ransom provided social programs for youth, including early education, job training, counseling, childcare and lectures.       \n \nReverdy C. Ransom was the first African American to give an address at Faneuil Hall in Boston, Massachusetts. While he was still the Pastor of Charles Street A. M. E.

The villages were once situated along the historic Qutb Road, the main road connecting [[Shahjahanabad]], the walled city of Delhi (now known as [[Old Delhi]]) to [[Qutb Minar]] in south Delhi since the [[Mughal era]]. The displaced people were relocated in [[Karol Bagh]] to the west, a rocky area populated only by trees and wild bushes. However, three structures were spared demolition.  These were Hanuman temple, a Jain temple in Jaisinghpura and the [[Jantar Mantar, New Delhi|Jantar Mantar]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A tale of two cities |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/A-tale-of-two-cities/Article1-740282.aspx |work=Hindustan Times|date=1 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702164816/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/A-tale-of-two-cities/Article1-740282.aspx |archivedate=2 July 2015  }}</ref><ref name=ht2013/>\n\n===Construction===\n[[File: Connaught Place New Delhi.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Tor Russell]] was the architect of Connaught Place|alt=|left]]\n\nPlans to have a central business district were developed as the construction of the new capital of Imperial India began to take shape.

However Nicholls left India in 1917, and with [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]] and [[Herbert Baker|Baker]] busy working on larger buildings in the capital, design of the plaza eventually fell to [[Robert Tor Russell]], chief architect to the [[Central Public Works Department|Public Works Department]] (PWD), Government of India.<ref name=\"ht\"/>\n\nNamed after [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]], 1st [[Duke of Connaught]] (1850\u20131942), third son of [[Queen Victoria]] and uncle of [[King George VI]] of England, who visited India in 1921 and laid the foundation of the ''Council House'' (now [[Sansad Bhavan]], or Parliament House).\n\nConnaught Place's [[Georgian architecture]] is modelled after the [[Royal Crescent]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], designed by the architect [[John Wood the Younger]] and built between 1767 and 1774.

However, the circle was 'broken up' to give it a grander scale. Even the blocks were originally planned to be {{convert|172|m}} in height but later reduced to the present two-storied structure with an open colonnade.\n\nGovernment plans to have [[New Delhi Railway Station]] built inside Central Park were rejected by railway authorities as they found the idea impractical, and instead chose the nearby [[Paharganj]] area. Finally construction work began in 1929, with the construction of the [[Viceroy's house|Viceroy House]] (present [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]]), [[Secretariat Building, New Delhi|Secretariat Building]], [[Sansad Bhavan|Parliament House]], and All-India War Memorial, [[India Gate]] were completed by 1933, long after the inauguration of the city in 1931.<ref name=\"ht\"/><ref name=\"me\"/>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Central Park, Connaught Place (view from Parikarma restaurant).jpg|thumb|260px|View of the Central Park and Inner Circle of CP|alt=]]Early commercial establishments belonged to traders from the Kashmere Gate area: Kanter's, Galgotia and Snowhite.

Connaught Place became the entertainment hub of New Delhi. The Regal, the first theatre in the area, was opened in 1932 by [[Sir Sobha Singh]]. It was designed by architect [[Walter Sykes George]] and mainly hosted stage performances. In the coming years it hosted Western Classical music artists, Russian ballet and British theatre groups, and soon started morning and afternoon movie shows. The next theatre to be built was the Plaza in 1940, designed by Sir Robert Tor Russell, the architect of Connaught Place itself. It was owned by director and actor [[Sohrab Modi]] until the early 1950s. The Odeon was built in 1945 and had the city's second 70mm screen after the \"Shiela Cinema\" in [[Paharganj]]. The Rivoli, close to the Regal, was the smallest theatre in the area. Half a century later most of the theatres were still running, although most had changed ownership. The Plaza and Rivoli are now owned by a multiplex giant [[PVR Cinemas]], while the Odeon is a joint venture with [[Reliance Big Pictures]].<ref name=\"ht\"/><ref name=fourht>{{cite news|title=The famous four|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/Delhi100/The-famous-four/newdelhi/SP-Article10-745362.aspx|work=Hindustan Times|date=14 September 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023021832/http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/Delhi100/The-famous-four/newdelhi/SP-Article10-745362.aspx|archivedate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Palika Bazar, Connaught Place, Delhi.jpg|left|220px|thumb|Entrance of the underground shopping complex, [[Palika Bazaar]], in Connaught Place, built in the 1970s]]\n[[File:Connaught Place.JPG|thumb|Connaught Place on a busy weekend]]\nThe area is instantly recognisable on any map of Delhi as a big circle in the middle with radial roads spreading out in all directions.

As a part of its 'Return to Heritage Project', the [[New Delhi Municipal Council]] (NDMC) prepared a plan to revamp and redevelop this Delhi landmark. The plan included the provision of heritage sensitive signage, engineering improvements of roads, drainage sewerage, water supply and substations, development of a traffic management plan, provisions of street furniture including adequate parking, walkways etc. and enhancing the structural stability of all buildings including retrofitting for earthquake resistance. All these components have been identified based on studies conducted by various reputed agencies such as [[School of Planning and Architecture|SPA]], [[RITES]], CMCCC and NTPAC, etc.\n[[File:View of Connaught Place at Night.JPG|300px|left|thumb|Connaught Place commercial area at Night]]\nThe redevelopment work was slated to be completed in time for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] held at Delhi, but due to huge cost overruns and undue delays,<ref>{{cite news|title=CP restoration plan hit by undue delays: CAG|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/article2321306.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 August 2011}}</ref> this deadline was not met. The Performance Audit Report prepared by Controller and Auditor General, India, on the Commonwealth Games 2010 concluded that there were \"significant deficiencies in contract management, with consequent avoidable expenditure\". Moreover, the mis-management and delays caused great inconvenience to shoppers and shop-owners alike, and led to a decline in trade.<ref>{{cite news|title=NDMC's digging frenzy in CP stalls traffic hits trade|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-08/delhi/28146520_1_middle-circle-atul-bharghav-outer-circle|newspaper=The Times of India|date=8 January 2010}}</ref> Many store-owners complained of erratic power supplies and lost air-conditioning in their shops during the renovation work.\n\nWork on the renovation was resumed soon after the Commonwealth Games, and is currently scheduled to meet the new deadline of December 2012. Till 2016 only the first phase for renovating blocks A & B has taken place. By 2020 all the six blocks of Connaught Place would be renovated and brought to their original glory.\n\nThe art project [[United Buddy Bears]] was presented in Connaught Place during the summer of 2012.\n\nOn 5 January 2017, the Union Urban Development Ministry announced a plan to convert the middle and inner circles of Connaught Place, into an exclusive pedestrian zone, starting February 2017. As a result, people driving into the area will now have to park their vehicles at designated parking slots like [[Shivaji Stadium]], [[Palika Bazaar]] and then either walk to Connaught Place or use the shuttle bus service. However, [[Bicycles]] will be allowed in the pedestrian zones.\nThis move however does not have any planning as of 24 January 2017 and may be totally scrapped as the current infrastructure is insufficient to support the pedestrianisation of Connaught Place, Naresh Kumar Chairman of NDMC Reported Hindustan Times.\n\n==Films==\nOver the years, Connaught Place has been location many films including sequences in ''[[Dil Se..]]'' (1998), ''[[Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi]]'' (2003), ''[[Pyaar Ke Side Effects]]'' (2006), ''[[3 Idiots]]'' (2009), ''[[Aisha (film)|Aisha]]'' (2010), ''[[Delhi Belly (film)|Delhi Belly]]'' (2011), ''[[Rockstar (2011 film)|Rockstar]]'' (2011), ''[[Ahista Ahista (2006 film)|Ahista Ahista]]'' (2006), ''[[Agent Vinod (2012 film)|Agent Vinod]]'', ''[[Vicky Donor]]'' (2012),  ''[[Hate Story]]'' (2011), ''[[Special 26]]'' (2013), ''[[A Wednesday]]'' (2008), ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (2006), ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' (2014) and ''[[2 States (2014 film)|2 States]]'' (2014).\n\n==Visitor attractions==\n*[[Agrasen ki Baoli]], Connaught Place\n* [[The Imperial, New Delhi]]\n* [[National Philatelic Museum, New Delhi]]\n\n==Picture gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Skyscrapers connaught place New Delhi.JPG|Skyscrapers at Connaught Place\nFile:Delhicommercial.jpg|The Statesman Building\nFile:New Delhi India.jpg|Central Park\nFile:ConnaughtCircleShopsNight.jpg|Shops along the innermost Connaught Circle at night in early 2006\nFile:Georgian buildings in New Delhi.jpg|Typical Georgian buildings\nFile:Agrasen Ki Baoli in New Delhi.jpg|[[Agrasen ki Baoli]] is hidden among the high-rises of Connaught Place\nFile:Mosquedelhi (93).JPG|Small Mosque\nFile:Street connaught place.jpg|Inner circle\nFile:Street delhi connaught place.jpg|On one of the spokes\nFile:Street delhi connaught place2.jpg|Street scene\nFile:Central Park, Connaught Place (view from Parikarma restaurant).jpg|View from a restaurant\nFile:Connaught Place, New Delhi -

Finally construction work began in 1929, with the construction of the [[Viceroy's house|Viceroy House]] (present [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]]), [[Secretariat Building, New Delhi|Secretariat Building]], [[Sansad Bhavan|Parliament House]], and All-India War Memorial, [[India Gate]] were completed by 1933, long after the inauguration of the city in 1931.<ref name=\"ht\"/><ref name=\"me\"/>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Central Park, Connaught Place (view from Parikarma restaurant).jpg|thumb|260px|View of the Central Park and Inner Circle of CP|alt=]]Early commercial establishments belonged to traders from the Kashmere Gate area: Kanter's, Galgotia and Snowhite.

Connaught Place became the entertainment hub of New Delhi. The Regal, the first theatre in the area, was opened in 1932 by [[Sir Sobha Singh]]. It was designed by architect [[Walter Sykes George]] and mainly hosted stage performances. In the coming years it hosted Western Classical music artists, Russian ballet and British theatre groups, and soon started morning and afternoon movie shows. The next theatre to be built was the Plaza in 1940, designed by Sir Robert Tor Russell, the architect of Connaught Place itself. It was owned by director and actor [[Sohrab Modi]] until the early 1950s. The Odeon was built in 1945 and had the city's second 70mm screen after the \"Shiela Cinema\" in [[Paharganj]]. The Rivoli, close to the Regal, was the smallest theatre in the area. Half a century later most of the theatres were still running, although most had changed ownership.

As a part of its 'Return to Heritage Project', the [[New Delhi Municipal Council]] (NDMC) prepared a plan to revamp and redevelop this Delhi landmark. The plan included the provision of heritage sensitive signage, engineering improvements of roads, drainage sewerage, water supply and substations, development of a traffic management plan, provisions of street furniture including adequate parking, walkways etc. and enhancing the structural stability of all buildings including retrofitting for earthquake resistance. All these components have been identified based on studies conducted by various reputed agencies such as [[School of Planning and Architecture|SPA]], [[RITES]], CMCCC and NTPAC, etc.\n[[File:View of Connaught Place at Night.JPG|300px|left|thumb|Connaught Place commercial area at Night]]\nThe redevelopment work was slated to be completed in time for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] held at Delhi, but due to huge cost overruns and undue delays,<ref>{{cite news|title=CP restoration plan hit by undue delays: CAG|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/article2321306.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 August 2011}}</ref> this deadline was not met. The Performance Audit Report prepared by [http://www.cag.gov.in/ Controller and Auditor General, India], on the Commonwealth Games 2010 concluded that there were \"significant deficiencies in contract management, with consequent avoidable expenditure\".

As a result, people driving into the area will now have to park their vehicles at designated parking slots like [[Shivaji Stadium]], [[Palika Bazaar]] and then either walk to Connaught Place or use the shuttle bus service. However, [[Bicycles]] will be allowed in the pedestrian zones.\nThis move however does not have any planning as of 24 January 2017 and may be totally scrapped as the current infrastructure is insufficient to support the pedestrianisation of Connaught Place, Naresh Kumar Chairman of NDMC Reported Hindustan Times.\n\n==Films==\nOver the years, Connaught Place has been location many films including sequences in ''[[Dil Se..]]'' (1998), ''[[Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi]]'' (2003), ''[[Pyaar Ke Side Effects]]'' (2006), ''[[3 Idiots]]'' (2009), ''[[Aisha (film)|Aisha]]'' (2010), ''[[Delhi Belly (film)|Delhi Belly]]'' (2011), ''[[Rockstar (2011 film)|Rockstar]]'' (2011), ''[[Ahista Ahista (2006 film)|Ahista Ahista]]'' (2006), ''[[Agent Vinod (2012 film)|Agent Vinod]]'', ''[[Vicky Donor]]'' (2012),  ''[[Hate Story]]'' (2011), ''[[Special 26]]'' (2013), ''[[A Wednesday]]'' (2008), ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (2006), ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' (2014) and ''[[2 States (2014 film)|2 States]]'' (2014).\n\n==Visitor attractions==\n*[[Agrasen ki Baoli]], Connaught Place\n* [[The Imperial, New Delhi]]\n* [[National Philatelic Museum, New Delhi]]\n\n==Picture gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Skyscrapers connaught place New Delhi.JPG|Skyscrapers at Connaught Place\nFile:Delhicommercial.jpg|The Statesman Building\nFile:New Delhi India.jpg|Central Park\nFile:ConnaughtCircleShopsNight.jpg|Shops along the innermost Connaught Circle at night in early 2006\nFile:Georgian buildings in New Delhi.jpg|Typical Georgian buildings\nFile:Agrasen Ki Baoli in New Delhi.jpg|[[Agrasen ki Baoli|Agrasen Ki Baoli]] is hidden among the high-rises of Connaught Place\nFile:Mosquedelhi (93).JPG|Small Mosque\nFile:Street connaught place.jpg|Inner circle\nFile:Street delhi connaught place.jpg|On one of the spokes\nFile:Street delhi connaught place2.jpg|Street scene\nFile:Central Park, Connaught Place (view from Parikarma restaurant).jpg|View from a restaurant\nFile:Connaught Place, New Delhi - IMG 1958.JPG|Connaught Place commercial area\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\nOther commercial centres in Delhi metropolitan area:\n\n*[[Janakpuri]]\n*[[Nehru Place]]\n*[[Rajendra Place]]\n*[[Shivaji Place District Centre|Shivaji Place]]\n*[[South Extension]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Delhi}}\n{{Neighborhoods of Delhi}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1933]]\n[[Category:Central business districts in India]]\n[[Category:District subdivisions of Delhi]]\n[[Category:Georgian Revival architecture]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Delhi]]\n[[Category:New Delhi district]]\n[[Category:Shopping districts and streets in India]]\n[[Category:Road junctions in India]]\n[[Category:Town squares in India]]\n[[Category:Commercial and Business Centres in New Delhi]]\n[[Category:Commercial Area in New Delhi]]\n", "name_user": "Fylindfotberserk", "label": "safe", "comment": "Generalformattingbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connaught_Place,_New_Delhi"}

The best-selling [[video game]] to date is ''[[Minecraft]]'', a [[sandbox video game]] originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]] in 2011. The game has been ported to a wide range of platforms, selling over 180 million copies, including paid [[mobile game|mobile downloads]]. ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' is the only other game to have sold over 100 million copies. The best-selling game on a single platform is ''[[Wii Sports]]'', with nearly 83 million sales for the [[Wii]] console.\n\nOf the top 50 best-selling video games on this list, over half were developed or published by [[Nintendo]], including over half of the top ten. Four games were published by Nintendo and their affiliate, [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]]. Other publishers with multiple entries in the top 50 include [[Activision]], [[Rockstar Games]], [[Electronic Arts]], and [[Sega]]. Aside from Nintendo's internal development teams, [[Game Freak]] is the developer with the most games in the top 50, with five from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series. The oldest game in the top 50 is ''[[Frogger]]'', which was released in June 1981. Games reported on by player count instead of official sales figures, such as registered accounts, subscriptions, or [[free-to-play]] ownership, are to be included on the [[list of most-played video games by player count]] instead.\n\n==List==<!--As per a previous discussion, Tetris is a game series. Rather than counting the entire series as a single game, the series' highest selling entry (the GameBoy version) is included on this list.-->\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!#\n!

He was notable as the officer in charge when the Titanic collided with an iceberg. Mystery also surrounds his death.\n\nBorn from a family of sailors, William Murdoch was an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve; he was employed by the [[White Star Line]] in 1900 and quickly rose to the rank of [[Officer#Shipping industry|officer]]. In 1903, his leadership became recognized when he avoided a collision with the ''[[SS Arabic (1902)|Arabic]]''. In April 1912, Murdoch served as [[Chief mate|First Officer]] aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}}. He is notable as the officer in charge on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] the night the ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. He was one of 1,500 people who died in the disaster.<ref>{{citation | author=Walter Lord | title=A Night To Remember | publisher=Penguin Books | year=1955}}</ref>\n\nMurdoch became an iconic Scottish hero, a status that is maintained and reflected by the memorial in his hometown of [[Dalbeattie]]. However, debate revolves around the adequacy of instructions given to avoid the iceberg.\n\nIn the aftermath of the sinking, a number of eyewitness testimonies arose of a shooting/suicide by an officer during the launching of the last lifeboat. Though these facts are unconfirmed, it is possible that Murdoch was that officer.\n\nMurdoch has become a figure of controversy, with mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death and his actions during the collision with the iceberg.\n\n==Life and career==\nMurdoch was born in [[Dalbeattie]] in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] (now [[Dumfries and Galloway]]), [[Scotland]], the fourth son of Captain Samuel Murdoch, a master mariner, and Jane Muirhead, six of whose children survived infancy. They were a long and notable line of Scottish seafarers who sailed the world's oceans as early as the 19th century. His father and grandfather were both sea captains as were four of his grandfather's brothers.\n\nMurdoch was educated first at the old Primary School in High Street, and then at the [[Dalbeattie High School]] in Alpine Street until he gained his diploma in 1887. Finishing schooling, he followed in the family seafaring tradition and was apprenticed for five years to ''William Joyce & Coy'', [[Liverpool]], but after four years (and four voyages) he was so competent that he passed his [[second mate]]'s Certificate on his first attempt.\n\nHe served his apprenticeship aboard the ''Charles Cosworth'' of Liverpool, trading to the west coast of [[South America]]. From May 1895, he was First Mate on the ''St. Cuthbert'', which sank in a hurricane off [[Uruguay]] in 1897. Murdoch gained his Extra Master's Certificate at Liverpool in 1896, at age 23. From 1897 to 1899, he was First Officer aboard the ''J. Joyce & Co.'' steel four-masted 2,534-ton barque Lydgate, that traded from New York to Shanghai.\n[[File:William Murdoch in his 30s.jpg|thumb|right|Murdoch in his 30s]]\n[[File:William McMaster Murdoch in RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Murdoch, Chief Engineer Joseph Evans, Fourth Officer David Alexander and Captain Edward J. Smith, all as seen on the '' Olympic'']]\nFrom 1900 to 1912, Murdoch gradually progressed from Second Officer to First Officer, serving on a successive number of White Star Line vessels, [[SS Medic|''Medic'']] (1900, along with [[Charles Lightoller]], ''Titanic''{{'}}s second officer), [[SS Runic (1900)|''Runic'']] (1901\u20131903), [[SS Arabic (1902)|''Arabic'']] (1903), [[RMS Celtic (1901)|''Celtic'']] (1904), [[SS Germanic (1874)|''Germanic'']] (1904), [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|''Oceanic'']] (1905), [[RMS Cedric|''Cedric'']] (1906), [[RMS Adriatic (1906)|''Adriatic'']] (1907\u20131911) and [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']] (1911\u20131912).\n\nIn 1903, Murdoch met a 29-year-old [[New Zealand]] school teacher named Ada Florence Banks en route to [[England]] on either the ''Runic'' or the ''Medic''. They began to correspond regularly and on 2 September 1907 they were wed in [[Southampton]] at St Denys Church. The marriage register entry was witnessed by Captain William James Hannah and his wife and the addresses given by the bride and groom suggest they were lodging with the Hannahs. Captain Hannah came from a family of seafarers with their roots in Kircudbrightshire like Murdoch, and was Assistant Marine Superintendent for the White Star Line at Southampton. Hannah would see Murdoch for the last time when he witnessed the testing of lifeboats before Titanic departed from Southampton on 10 April 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.henry-aldridge.co.uk/catalogues/2013/ss200413/page8.html |website=henry-aldridge.co.uk |title=Titanic and Transport Memorabilia Sale on Saturday 20th April 2013. Lot 212 |quote=R.M.S. TITANIC: CAPTAIN MAURICE CLARKE ARCHIVE. Typed notes dated April 28th 1912 relating to the Board of Trade enquiry into Titanic. The notes detail Captain Clarke's inspection into the lifeboats. \"On the morning of sailing Wed 10th April, I gave instructions to the Chief Officer after The Board of Trade muster, to swing out No's 4 and 15 lifeboats which were situated on the starboard side of boat deck. The two boats were swung out simultaneously. The time occupied the covers and grips on being 3\u00bc and 3\u00bd minutes this being checked by Captains Steel and Hannah, the two marine Superintendents. All worked most satisfactorily, the crews were exercised by their officers and were fully satisfied as to the crew's efficiency.\" }}</ref>\n\nDuring 1903, Murdoch finally reached the stormy and glamorous ''North Atlantic'' run as Second Officer of the new liner ''[[SS Arabic (1902)|Arabic]]''. His cool head, quick thinking and professional judgement averted a disaster when a ship was spotted bearing down on the ''Arabic'' out of the darkness. He overrode a command from his superior, Officer Fox, to steer hard-a-port, rushing into the wheelhouse, brushing aside the quartermaster and holding the ship on course. The two ships passed within inches of one another. Any alteration in course would have actually caused a collision.\n\nThe final stage of Murdoch's career began in May 1911, when he joined the new {{RMS|Olympic}}, at {{convert|45000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Intended to outclass the ''[[Cunard Line|Cunard]]'' ships in luxury and size, it needed the most experienced large-liner crew that the ''White Star Line'' could find. Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]] assembled a crew that included [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Henry Wilde]] as Chief Officer, Murdoch as First Officer, and Chief Purser Herbert McElroy. On 14 June 1911 Olympic departed on her maiden voyage to New York, arriving there on the 21st.\n\nThe first indications of what was to come occurred on 20 September when the ''Olympic'' had her hull badly damaged in a collision with the Royal Navy cruiser ''HMS Hawke''. Since Murdoch was at his docking-station at the stern during this collision \u2013 a highly responsible position \u2013 he found himself giving evidence in the inquiry into an incident that turned into a financial disaster for the White Star Line, as the voyage to New York had to be abandoned and the ship taken to [[Belfast]] for repairs, which took a good six weeks. It was thus not until 11 December 1911 that Murdoch rejoined the ship. During the time that he served aboard as First Officer (until some time in March, 1912) there were two further \u2013 though lesser \u2013 incidents, striking a sunken wreck and having to have a broken propeller replaced, and nearly running aground while leaving [[Belfast]]. However, upon reaching [[Southampton]], he learned that he had been appointed as Chief Officer of the new ''Titanic'', the ''Olympic''{{'s}} sister ship and reputedly the largest and most luxurious one afloat. Lightoller later remarked that \"three very contented chaps\" headed north to Belfast, for he had been appointed First Officer, and their friend Davy Blair was to be the new second officer. Awaiting them would be an old '' Adriatic'' hand, [[Joseph Boxhall|Joseph Groves Boxhall]], as Fourth Officer, and others who would be familiar colleagues, including the now aging Edward J. Smith as Captain and on the verge of retirement.\n\n==''Titanic''==\n{{main|Sinking of the RMS Titanic}}\nMurdoch, with an \"ordinary master's certificate\" and a reputation as a \"canny and dependable man\", had climbed through the ranks of the White Star Line to become one of its foremost senior officers. Murdoch was originally selected as the Chief Officer for ''Titanic''{{'}}s maiden voyage. However, the captain, Edward J. Smith, brought [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Henry Wilde]] in as his Chief Officer (from a prior assignment), so Murdoch became the First Officer.

He was notable as the officer in charge when the Titanic collided with an iceberg. Mystery also surrounds his death.\n\nBorn from a family of sailors, William Murdoch was an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve; he was employed by the [[White Star Line]] in 1900 and quickly rose to the rank of [[Officer#Shipping industry|officer]]. In 1903, his leadership became recognized when he avoided a collision with the ''[[SS Arabic (1902)|Arabic]]''. In April 1912, Murdoch served as [[Chief mate|First Officer]] aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}}. He is notable as the officer in charge on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] the night the ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. He was one of 1,500 people who died in the disaster.<ref>{{citation | author=Walter Lord | title=A Night To Remember | publisher=Penguin Books | year=1955}}</ref>\n\nMurdoch became an iconic Scottish hero, a status that is maintained and reflected by the memorial in his hometown of [[Dalbeattie]]. However, debate revolves around the adequacy of instructions given to avoid the iceberg.\n\nIn the aftermath of the sinking, a number of eyewitness testimonies arose of a shooting/suicide by an officer during the launching of the last lifeboat. Though these facts are unconfirmed, it is possible that Murdoch was that officer.\n\nMurdoch has become a figure of controversy, with mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death and his actions during the collision with the iceberg.\n\n==Life and career==\nMurdoch was born in [[Dalbeattie]] in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] (now [[Dumfries and Galloway]]), [[Scotland]], the fourth son of Captain Samuel Murdoch, a master mariner, and Jane Muirhead, six of whose children survived infancy. They were a long and notable line of Scottish seafarers who sailed the world's oceans as early as the 19th century. His father and grandfather were both sea captains as were four of his grandfather's brothers.\n\nMurdoch was educated first at the old Primary School in High Street, and then at the [[Dalbeattie High School]] in Alpine Street until he gained his diploma in 1887. Finishing schooling, he followed in the family seafaring tradition and was apprenticed for five years to ''William Joyce & Coy'', [[Liverpool]], but after four years (and four voyages) he was so competent that he passed his [[second mate]]'s Certificate on his first attempt.\n\nHe served his apprenticeship aboard the ''Charles Cosworth'' of Liverpool, trading to the west coast of [[South America]]. From May 1895, he was First Mate on the ''St. Cuthbert'', which sank in a hurricane off [[Uruguay]] in 1897. Murdoch gained his Extra Master's Certificate at Liverpool in 1896, at age 23. From 1897 to 1899, he was First Officer aboard the ''J. Joyce & Co.'' steel four-masted 2,534-ton barque Lydgate, that traded from New York to Shanghai.\n[[File:William Murdoch in his 30s.jpg|thumb|right|Murdoch in his 30s]]\n[[File:William McMaster Murdoch in RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Murdoch, Chief Engineer Joseph Evans, Fourth Officer David Alexander and Captain Edward J. Smith, all as seen on the '' Olympic'']]\nFrom 1900 to 1912, Murdoch gradually progressed from Second Officer to First Officer, serving on a successive number of White Star Line vessels, [[SS Medic|''Medic'']] (1900, along with [[Charles Lightoller]], ''Titanic''{{'}}s second officer), [[SS Runic (1900)|''Runic'']] (1901\u20131903), [[SS Arabic (1902)|''Arabic'']] (1903), [[RMS Celtic (1901)|''Celtic'']] (1904), [[SS Germanic (1874)|''Germanic'']] (1904), [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|''Oceanic'']] (1905), [[RMS Cedric|''Cedric'']] (1906), [[RMS Adriatic (1906)|''Adriatic'']] (1907\u20131911) and [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']] (1911\u20131912).\n\nIn 1903, Murdoch met a 29-year-old [[New Zealand]] school teacher named Ada Florence Banks en route to [[England]] on either the ''Runic'' or the ''Medic''. They began to correspond regularly and on 2 September 1907 they were wed in [[Southampton]] at St Denys Church. The marriage register entry was witnessed by Captain William James Hannah and his wife and the addresses given by the bride and groom suggest they were lodging with the Hannahs. Captain Hannah came from a family of seafarers with their roots in Kircudbrightshire like Murdoch, and was Assistant Marine Superintendent for the White Star Line at Southampton. Hannah would see Murdoch for the last time when he witnessed the testing of lifeboats before Titanic departed from Southampton on 10 April 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.henry-aldridge.co.uk/catalogues/2013/ss200413/page8.html |website=henry-aldridge.co.uk |title=Titanic and Transport Memorabilia Sale on Saturday 20th April 2013.

All worked most satisfactorily, the crews were exercised by their officers and were fully satisfied as to the crew's efficiency.\" }}</ref>\n\nDuring 1903, Murdoch finally reached the stormy and glamorous ''North Atlantic'' run as Second Officer of the new liner ''[[SS Arabic (1902)|Arabic]]''. His cool head, quick thinking and professional judgement averted a disaster when a ship was spotted bearing down on the ''Arabic'' out of the darkness. He overrode a command from his superior, Officer Fox, to steer hard-a-port, rushing into the wheelhouse, brushing aside the quartermaster and holding the ship on course. The two ships passed within inches of one another. Any alteration in course would have actually caused a collision.\n\nThe final stage of Murdoch's career began in May 1911, when he joined the new {{RMS|Olympic}}, at {{convert|45000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Intended to outclass the ''[[Cunard Line|Cunard]]'' ships in luxury and size, it needed the most experienced large-liner crew that the ''White Star Line'' could find. Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]] assembled a crew that included [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Henry Wilde]] as Chief Officer, Murdoch as First Officer, and Chief Purser Herbert McElroy. On 14 June 1911 Olympic departed on her maiden voyage to New York, arriving there on the 21st.\n\nThe first indications of what was to come occurred on 20 September when the ''Olympic'' had her hull badly damaged in a collision with the Royal Navy cruiser ''HMS Hawke''. Since Murdoch was at his docking-station at the stern during this collision \u2013 a highly responsible position \u2013 he found himself giving evidence in the inquiry into an incident that turned into a financial disaster for the White Star Line, as the voyage to New York had to be abandoned and the ship taken to [[Belfast]] for repairs, which took a good six weeks. It was thus not until 11 December 1911 that Murdoch rejoined the ship. During the time that he served aboard as First Officer (until some time in March, 1912) there were two further \u2013 though lesser \u2013 incidents, striking a sunken wreck and having to have a broken propeller replaced, and nearly running aground while leaving [[Belfast]]. However, upon reaching [[Southampton]], he learned that he had been appointed as Chief Officer of the new ''Titanic'', the ''Olympic''{{'s}} sister ship and reputedly the largest and most luxurious one afloat. Lightoller later remarked that \"three very contented chaps\" headed north to Belfast, for he had been appointed First Officer, and their friend Davy Blair was to be the new second officer. Awaiting them would be an old '' Adriatic'' hand, [[Joseph Boxhall|Joseph Groves Boxhall]], as Fourth Officer, and others who would be familiar colleagues, including the now aging Edward J. Smith as Captain and on the verge of retirement.\n\n==''Titanic''==\n{{main|Sinking of the RMS Titanic}}\nMurdoch, with an \"ordinary master's certificate\" and a reputation as a \"canny and dependable man\", had climbed through the ranks of the White Star Line to become one of its foremost senior officers. Murdoch was originally selected as the Chief Officer for ''Titanic''{{'}}s maiden voyage. However, the captain, Edward J. Smith, brought [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Henry Wilde]] in as his Chief Officer (from a prior assignment), so Murdoch became the First Officer. [[Charles Lightoller]] was in turn reduced to Second Officer, and the original Second, [[David Blair (mariner)|David Blair]], would not sail with ''Titanic'' at all.\n\n[[Image:Titanic Bridge and Crow's Nest.png|thumb|right|150px|Murdoch was on the navigation bridge of the Titanic at the time of the collision with the iceberg.]]\nAt approximately 11:39 pm on 14 April 1912, First Officer Murdoch was in charge when a large iceberg directly in the ''Titanic'''s path was sighted.
