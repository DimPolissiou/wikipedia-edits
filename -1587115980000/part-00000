From that year until 1502, the number of men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the practice; among them: \"If you crave joys, tumble some boys.\"<ref>Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

For example, the French would call \"homosexuality\" the \"Italian vice\" in the 16th and 17th centuries, the \"English vice\" in the 18th century, the ''m\u0153urs orientales'' (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the \"German vice\" starting from 1870 and into the 20th century.<ref>Revenin, ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et prostitution masculines \u00e0 Paris : 1870-1918'', 102-103.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThe Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most famous examples is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] philosophic defense of the practice provided by [[Antonio Rocco]], in his infamous ''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola'' (''[[Alcibiades the Schoolboy]]'', in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke.\n\n==Modern Europe==\n[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|right|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann's popular pamphlets on the [[third sex]] and against [[\u00a7175]] - a copy from the library of the [[Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee]], confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''\"Destined [[Nazi book burnings|for destruction]] in accordance with the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|Reichspresident]]'s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28 February 1933]]!\"'' and hidden from the public (label \"Secr.\") as [[Nazi plunder]] at the [[Prussian State Library]].]]\n\n===Psychology and terminology shifts===\nThe developing field of psychology was the first way homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since the 1790s with Johann Valentin M\u00fcller's work.<ref>Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref> The studies of this era tended to be rigorous examination of \"criminals,\" looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify \"pederasts\" affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in his 1857 publishing.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152.</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Charles's expos\u00e9, ''Les Deux Prostitutions: \u00e9tudes du pathologie sociale'', (\"The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social Pathology\") developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous documentation of homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal, Karl Ulrichs. [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 publication, ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', was the most widely translated work of this kind.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>  He and Ulrichs believed that homosexuality was congenitally based, but Krafft-Ebing differed; in that, he asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nDegeneracy became a widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> It spoke to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th century. [[Benedict Augustin Morel]] is considered the father of degeneracy theory.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> His theories posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease, urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his contemporary society.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn important shift in the terminology of homosexuality was brought about by the development of psychology's inquisition into homosexuality.  \"Contrary sexual feeling,\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> as Westphal's phrased, and the word \"homosexual\" itself made their way into the Western lexicons. Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term \"sodomy\" and the elusive \"abomination.\"  As Michel Foucault phrases, \"the sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn addendum to the terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of \"gay and lesbian\" every time homosexuals were discussed in the media. Non-heterosexuals such as bisexual people and those who are transgender have also been classed alongside gay people and lesbians, resulting in the popular LGBT acronym (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender). However, the acronym is not set in stone; it has sometimes appeared as LGBTQ (to include [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning or queer people]]).\n\n===Homosexuality in eighteenth-century Great Britain===\n{{main|Timeline of LGBT history in Britain}}\n\nVarious authors wrote on the topic of homosexuality.

A ''Molly house'' is an archaic 18th century English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and [[cross-dressing]] men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving birth. [[Margaret Clap]] (?\u2014circa 1726), better known as ''Mother Clap'', ran such a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in [[Holborn]], London. She was also heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut down.

It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several other countries, thereby being the first international LGBT organization, although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sex Research), a private [[sexology]] [[research institute]].

Female homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. \"anti-social\".\n\n===Alan Turing===\nIn Britain, the view of homosexuality as the mark of a deviant mind was not limited to the psychiatric wards of hospitals but also the courts. An extremely famous case was that of [[Alan Turing]], a British mathematician and theoretician. During WWII, Turing worked at [[Bletchley Park]] and was one of the major architects of the [[Colossus computer]], designed to break the Enigma codes of the Nazi war machine. For the success of this, he received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18541715|title=I remember Alan Turing...|date=June 23, 2012|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In spite of all his brilliance and the services rendered to his country, Turing was also openly homosexual and in the early 1950s this fact came to the attention of the British government when he was arrested under section 11 of an [[Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885|1885 statute]] of \"gross indecency\".<ref>Leavitt, David (2007). The man who knew too much: Alan Turing and the invention of the computer. Phoenix. {{ISBN|978-0-7538-2200-5}}.</ref> At the time there was great fear that Turing's sexuality could be exploited by Soviet spies, and so he was sentenced to choosing between jail and injections of synthetic estrogen.  The choice of the latter lead him to massive depression and committing suicide at the age of 41, biting into a poisoned apple.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/alan-turings-apple|title=Alan Turing's Apple|first=Amy Davidson|last=Sorkin|date=August 10, 2011|via=www.newyorker.com}}</ref> It is estimated that an additional 50\u201375,000 men were persecuted under this law, with only partial repeal taking place in 1967 and the final measure of it in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/the-mistake-behind-the-posthumous-pardon-of-alan-turing/|title=The Mistake Behind The Posthumous Pardon Of Alan Turing|first=Tamara|last=Tabo}}</ref>\n\n==United States of America==\n{{main|LGBT history in the United States}}\n{{See also|History of bisexuals in the United States|History of gay men in the United States|History of lesbianism in the United States|History of transgender people in the United States}}\n\n===18th and 19th century===\nBefore the American Civil War and the massive population growth of the Post-Civil War America, the majority of the American population was rural. Homosexuality remained an unseen and taboo concept in society, and the word \"homosexuality\" was not coined until 1868 by German-Hungarian [[Karoly Maria Kertbeny]] (who advocated decriminalization).<ref>EEdsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref> During this era, homosexuality fell under the umbrella term \"sodomy\" that comprised all forms of nonproductive sexuality (masturbation and oral sex were sometimes excluded). Without urban sub-cultures or a name for self-definition, group identification and self-consciousness was unlikely.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref>\n\nMainstream [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]] of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26-7|KJV}} and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] were the justification for the severe penalties facing those accused of \"sodomy.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Most of the laws around homosexuality in the colonies were derived from the English laws of \"buggery,\" and the punishment in all American colonies was death. The penalty for attempted sodomy (both homosexuality and bestiality) was prison, whipping, banishment, or fines. Thomas Jefferson suggested castration as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the Virginia criminal code near the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nPennsylvania was the first state to repeal the death penalty for \"sodomy\" in 1786 and within a generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South Carolina that repealed after the Civil War).<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Along with the removal of the death penalty during this generation, legal language shifted away from that of damnation to more dispassionate terms like \"unmentionable\" or \"abominable\" acts.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Aside from sodomy and \"attempted sodomy\" court cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality was seen as peripheral in mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely given Victorian notions of female sexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nA survey of sodomy law enforcement during the nineteenth century suggests that a significant minority of cases did not specify the gender of the \"victim\" or accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\">Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP. Pg. 117\u2013128. 2008</ref> The first prosecution for consensual sex between people of the same gender was not until 1880.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In response to increasing visibility of alternative genders, gender bending, and homosexuality, a host of laws against vagrancy, public indecency, disorderly conduct, and indecent exposure was introduced across the United States. \"Sodomy\" laws also shifted in many states over the beginning of the twentieth century to address homosexuality specifically (many states during the twentieth century made heterosexual anal intercourse legal).<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In some states, these laws would last until they were repealed by the Supreme Court in 2003 with the Lawrence decision.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/>\n\n===Male ideal and the 19th century===\nHomosexual identity found its first social foothold in the 19th Century not in sexuality or homoerotica, but in idealized conception of the wholesome and loving male friendship during the 19th Century. Or as contemporary author [[Theodore Winthrop]] in Cecil Dreeme writes, \"a friendship I deemed more precious than the love of women.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> This ideal came from and was enforced by the male-centric institutions of boy's boarding schools, all-male colleges, the military, the frontier, etc. \u2013 fictional and non-fiction accounts of passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and social conceptions of masculinity.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nNew York, as America's largest city exponentially growing during the 19th Century (doubling from 1800\u201320 and again by 1840 to a population of 300,000), saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Continuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He was immediately drawn to young working-class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting their ages, physical characteristics, jobs, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014\"frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\" or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014\"I share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[We'wha]] (1849\u20131896) was a notable [[Zuni]] weaver, potter and ''[[lhamana]]''. Raised as a boy, they would later spend part of their life dressing and living in the roles usually filled by women in Zuni culture, later living and working in roles filled by men, changing depending on the situation. Anthropologist [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], a friend of We'wha's who wrote extensively about the Zuni, hosted We'wha and the Zuni delegation when We'wha was chosen as an official emissary to Washington D.C. in 1886. During this time [[Singular they|they]] met President [[Grover Cleveland]]. We'wha had at least one husband, was trained in the customs and rites for the ceremonies for both men and women, and was a respected member of their community. Friends who documented their life used both pronouns for We'wha.<ref name=Bost139>Suzanne Bost, ''Mulattas and Mestizas: Representing Mixed Identities in the Americas'', 1850-2000, (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2003), pg.139</ref><ref name=Stevenson37>Matilda Coxe Stevenson, ''The Zuni Indians: Their Mythology, Esoteric Fraternities, and Ceremonies'', (BiblioBazaar, 2010) p.&nbsp;37 Quote:\"the most intelligent person in the pueblo. Strong character made his word law among both men and women with whom he associated. Though his wrath was dreaded by men as well as women, he was loved by all children, to whom he was ever kind\"</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1908, the first American defense of homosexuality was published.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> ''The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life'', was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> This 600-page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and the homosexual subcultures of urban life.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> He dedicated the novel to Krafft-Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson's view and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing's, should not face prejudice. He also wrote one of the first homosexual novels\u2014''Imre: A Memorandum''.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Also in this era, the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote an account of his sexual history.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 90\u201391.</ref> He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to \"cure\" him.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/> Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely \"spiritual,\" but could not escape the \"animal.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/>\n\nBy this time, society was slowly becoming aware of the homosexual subculture. In an 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> With a population around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York's queer subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on its own terms. \"Middle class queer,\" \"fairies,\" were among the terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> But with this growing public presence, backlash occurred. The YMCA, who ironically promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman's praise of male brotherhood and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch. Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.\n\n===1920s===\n[[File:WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg|thumb|Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s.]]\n\nThe 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see [[Pre-Code]]) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title \"Masculine Women, Feminine Men.\"<ref>The song was written by [[Edgar Leslie]] (words) and [[James Vincent Monaco|James V. Monaco]] (music) and featured in [[Hugh J. Ward]]'s production of the musical ''[[Lady, Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''.</ref> It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:<ref>Artists who recorded this song include: 1.

Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as \"pansy clubs\". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, [[Jimmie Shields]].<ref>Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star.

'' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12\u201313, 80\u201383.</ref> In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'', and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]]. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality.\n\n===Late 1930s===\nBy 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. [[Victorian morality|Victorian values]] and morals, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this period, life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.

In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947, WWII [[conscientious objectors]] in the US assigned to psychiatric hospitals under [[Civilian Public Service]] exposed abuses throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in [[reform]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n===Stonewall riots===\n{{Main|Stonewall riots}}\n\nAlthough the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are generally considered the starting point of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the LGBT community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power. ''See: [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots]]''\n\nIn the autumn of 1959, the police force of New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars, which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year. This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing ''NY Mirror'' newspaper columnist [[Lee Mortimer]]. Existing gay bars were quickly closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], [[Craig Rodwell]] president and vice president respectively of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and Mattachine activist John Timmons staged the Sip-In at [[Julius (restaurant)|Julius' Bar]] on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens, transsexuals, and butch lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative march one year later, organized by the impetus of [[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980s===\n {{Disputed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe 1980s in LGBT history are marked with the emergence of [[HIV]]. During the early period of the outbreak of HIV, the [[HIV and men who have sex with men|epidemic of HIV was commonly linked to gay men.]]\n\nIn the 1980s a renewed conservative movement spawned a new anti-gay movement in the United States, particularly with the help of the Religious Right ([[Evangelicals]] in particular). While it is a common belief within some circles of the LGBT community that [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] were anti-gay, some others believe that this is an exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he came out against [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a ballot initiative that would have dismissed California teachers who \"advocated\" homosexuality, even off-campus. As President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of homosexuals. Robert G. Kaiser's news story in the March 18, 1984, Washington Post.\n\"The Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,\" Kaiser wrote. \"Their interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans' private White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington for Nancy Reagan's 60th birthday party\u2014a fact confirmed for the press by Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Murdock |first=Deroy |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/304207/gay-left-lies-about-reagan-again-deroy-murdock?pg=2: |title=The Gay Left Lies about Reagan \u2014 Again |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> However, by the later part of the decade the general public started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gays as the toll for AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as cultural icons such as [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Liberace]], who also died from the condition. Also, despite the more conservative period, life in general for gays and lesbians was considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era.\n \nTestifying to improved conditions, a 1991 [[Wall Street Journal]] survey found that homosexuals, in comparison with average Americans, were three times more likely to be college graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, with average salaries $30,000 higher than the norm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nayo9QVuJs8C&pg=PA139 \"The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom\"], Michael Bronski.

Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of entitlements, including [[social security]], taxation, inheritance and other benefits unavailable to couples not married, in the eyes of the law. Restricting legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children.\n\nThe first country to legalize same-sex marriages was the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. {{as of|2019|June}}, same-sex marriages are legal nationally in twenty-six countries: the Netherlands (2001), [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (without [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]\u2014May 22, 2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2014), [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]] (2015),  [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2018) and in [[Same-sex marriage in Austria|Austria]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]] (2019).

In 1990, a student group named The Other Ten Percentile (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8) was founded by a group of teachers and students in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], becoming the first LGBT organization in [[Jerusalem]]. Frequently, such groups have been banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recognition as other student groups. For example, in September 2006, [[Touro University California]] briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the [[Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance]]. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the [[American Medical Student Association]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] and the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] [[City council|City Council]], Touro University retracted its revocation of the school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nIn April 2016, the GSA Network changed their name from Gay-Straight Alliance Network to Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network in order to be more inclusive and reflective of youth who make up the organization.\n\n==Historical study of homosexuality==\n\n===19th century and early 20th century===\nWhen [[Heinrich H\u00f6ssli]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|K. H. Ulrichs]] began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam.<ref>''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia: Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of lesbian and gay histories and cultures'', George E. Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, {{ISBN|0-8153-3354-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3354-8}}, Taylor & Francis, 2000, page 388.</ref> Some other information was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and [[Havelock Ellis]]. In Germany, [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of the ''Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen'' and Magnus Hirschfeld's ''Die Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes'' (1914). The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] put a stop to most serious homosexual research.\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\nAs part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California, a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals as ''The Ladder'', ''Mattachine Review'', and ''One Quarterly''. In France ''Aracadie'' under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid to touch the subject. As a result, much of the work was done by autodidacts toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women of the past for example.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure from the group around the French periodical ''Annales''. Although several useful syntheses of the world [[history of homosexuality]] have appeared, much material, especially from [[Islam]], China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.<ref>Ed.

From that year until 1502, the number of men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the practice; among them: \"If you crave joys, tumble some boys.\"<ref>Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

For example, the French would call \"homosexuality\" the \"Italian vice\" in the 16th and 17th centuries, the \"English vice\" in the 18th century, the ''m\u0153urs orientales'' (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the \"German vice\" starting from 1870 and into the 20th century.<ref>Revenin, ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et prostitution masculines \u00e0 Paris : 1870-1918'', 102-103.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nThe Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most famous examples is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] philosophic defense of the practice provided by [[Antonio Rocco]], in his infamous ''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola'' (''[[Alcibiades the Schoolboy]]'', in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke.\n\n==Modern Europe==\n[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|right|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann's popular pamphlets on the [[third sex]] and against [[\u00a7175]] - a copy from the library of the [[Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee]], confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''\"Destined [[Nazi book burnings|for destruction]] in accordance with the [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|Reichspresident]]'s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28 February 1933]]!\"'' and hidden from the public (label \"Secr.\") as [[Nazi plunder]] at the [[Prussian State Library]].]]\n\n===Psychology and terminology shifts===\nThe developing field of psychology was the first way homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since the 1790s with Johann Valentin M\u00fcller's work.<ref>Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref> The studies of this era tended to be rigorous examination of \"criminals,\" looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify \"pederasts\" affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in his 1857 publishing.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152.</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Charles's expos\u00e9, ''Les Deux Prostitutions: \u00e9tudes du pathologie sociale'', (\"The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social Pathology\") developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous documentation of homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal, Karl Ulrichs. [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 publication, ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', was the most widely translated work of this kind.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>  He and Ulrichs believed that homosexuality was congenitally based, but Krafft-Ebing differed; in that, he asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nDegeneracy became a widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> It spoke to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th century. [[Benedict Augustin Morel]] is considered the father of degeneracy theory.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> His theories posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease, urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his contemporary society.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn important shift in the terminology of homosexuality was brought about by the development of psychology's inquisition into homosexuality.  \"Contrary sexual feeling,\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> as Westphal's phrased, and the word \"homosexual\" itself made their way into the Western lexicons. Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term \"sodomy\" and the elusive \"abomination.\"  As Michel Foucault phrases, \"the sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/>\n\nAn addendum to the terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of \"gay and lesbian\" every time homosexuals were discussed in the media. Non-heterosexuals such as bisexual people and those who are transgender have also been classed alongside gay people and lesbians, resulting in the popular LGBT acronym (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender). However, the acronym is not set in stone; it has sometimes appeared as LGBTQ (to include [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning or queer people]]).\n\n===Homosexuality in eighteenth-century Great Britain===\n{{main|Timeline of LGBT history in Britain}}\n\nVarious authors wrote on the topic of homosexuality.

A ''Molly house'' is an archaic 18th century English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and [[cross-dressing]] men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving birth. [[Margaret Clap]] (?\u2014circa 1726), better known as ''Mother Clap'', ran such a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in [[Holborn]], London. She was also heavily involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut down.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] decried cultural degeneration, [[prostitution]] and [[syphilis]] in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', blaming at least some of the phenomena on Jews.\n\n[[Berlin]] also had the most active [[LGBT movements|LGBT rights movements]] in the world at the time. Jewish doctor [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] had co-founded the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] (Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4res Komitee, WhK) in Berlin in 1897 to campaign against the notorious \"[[Paragraph 175]]\" of the Penal Code that made [[Men who have sex with men|sex between men]] illegal. It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several other countries, thereby being the first international LGBT organization, although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sex Research), a private [[sexology]] [[research institute]]. It had a [[research library]] and a large archive, and included a marriage and sex counseling office. In addition, the institute was a pioneer worldwide in the call for [[civil rights]] and social acceptance for homosexual and transgender people.\nAs a  leading city for homosexuals during the 1920, Berlin had  clubs and even newspapers for both lesbians and gay men. The lesbian magazine [[Die Freundin]] was started by [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] and the gay men's magazine ''[[Der Eigene]]'' had already started in 1896 as the world's first gay magazine.

Conditions for gay men in the camps were especially rough; they faced not only persecution from German soldiers, but also other prisoners, and many gay men were reported to die of beatings. Female homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. \"anti-social\".\n\n===Alan Turing===\nIn Britain, the view of homosexuality as the mark of a deviant mind was not limited to the psychiatric wards of hospitals but also the courts. An extremely famous case was that of [[Alan Turing]], a British mathematician and theoretician.

For the success of this, he received the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18541715|title=I remember Alan Turing...|date=June 23, 2012|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In spite of all his brilliance and the services rendered to his country, Turing was also openly homosexual and in the early 1950s this fact came to the attention of the British government when he was arrested under section 11 of an [[Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885|1885 statute]] of \"gross indecency\".<ref>Leavitt, David (2007).

Pg. 69\u201384. 2003.</ref>\n\nMainstream [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]] of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26-7|KJV}} and the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] were the justification for the severe penalties facing those accused of \"sodomy.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Most of the laws around homosexuality in the colonies were derived from the English laws of \"buggery,\" and the punishment in all American colonies was death. The penalty for attempted sodomy (both homosexuality and bestiality) was prison, whipping, banishment, or fines. Thomas Jefferson suggested castration as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the Virginia criminal code near the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nPennsylvania was the first state to repeal the death penalty for \"sodomy\" in 1786 and within a generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South Carolina that repealed after the Civil War).<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Along with the removal of the death penalty during this generation, legal language shifted away from that of damnation to more dispassionate terms like \"unmentionable\" or \"abominable\" acts.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Aside from sodomy and \"attempted sodomy\" court cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality was seen as peripheral in mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely given Victorian notions of female sexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nA survey of sodomy law enforcement during the nineteenth century suggests that a significant minority of cases did not specify the gender of the \"victim\" or accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\">Mucciaroni, Gary. Same Sex, Different Politics. Chicago UP. Pg. 117\u2013128. 2008</ref> The first prosecution for consensual sex between people of the same gender was not until 1880.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In response to increasing visibility of alternative genders, gender bending, and homosexuality, a host of laws against vagrancy, public indecency, disorderly conduct, and indecent exposure was introduced across the United States. \"Sodomy\" laws also shifted in many states over the beginning of the twentieth century to address homosexuality specifically (many states during the twentieth century made heterosexual anal intercourse legal).<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/> In some states, these laws would last until they were repealed by the Supreme Court in 2003 with the Lawrence decision.<ref name=\"Mucciaroni, Gary Pg. 117-128\"/>\n\n===Male ideal and the 19th century===\nHomosexual identity found its first social foothold in the 19th Century not in sexuality or homoerotica, but in idealized conception of the wholesome and loving male friendship during the 19th Century. Or as contemporary author [[Theodore Winthrop]] in Cecil Dreeme writes, \"a friendship I deemed more precious than the love of women.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> This ideal came from and was enforced by the male-centric institutions of boy's boarding schools, all-male colleges, the military, the frontier, etc. \u2013 fictional and non-fiction accounts of passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and social conceptions of masculinity.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nNew York, as America's largest city exponentially growing during the 19th Century (doubling from 1800\u201320 and again by 1840 to a population of 300,000), saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Continuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He was immediately drawn to young working-class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting their ages, physical characteristics, jobs, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014\"frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\" or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014\"I share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[We'wha]] (1849\u20131896) was a notable [[Zuni]] weaver, potter and ''[[lhamana]]''. Raised as a boy, they would later spend part of their life dressing and living in the roles usually filled by women in Zuni culture, later living and working in roles filled by men, changing depending on the situation. Anthropologist [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], a friend of We'wha's who wrote extensively about the Zuni, hosted We'wha and the Zuni delegation when We'wha was chosen as an official emissary to Washington D.C. in 1886. During this time [[Singular they|they]] met President [[Grover Cleveland]]. We'wha had at least one husband, was trained in the customs and rites for the ceremonies for both men and women, and was a respected member of their community. Friends who documented their life used both pronouns for We'wha.<ref name=Bost139>Suzanne Bost, ''Mulattas and Mestizas: Representing Mixed Identities in the Americas'', 1850-2000, (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 2003), pg.139</ref><ref name=Stevenson37>Matilda Coxe Stevenson, ''The Zuni Indians: Their Mythology, Esoteric Fraternities, and Ceremonies'', (BiblioBazaar, 2010) p.&nbsp;37 Quote:\"the most intelligent person in the pueblo. Strong character made his word law among both men and women with whom he associated. Though his wrath was dreaded by men as well as women, he was loved by all children, to whom he was ever kind\"</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn 1908, the first American defense of homosexuality was published.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> ''The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social Life'', was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> This 600-page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and the homosexual subcultures of urban life.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> He dedicated the novel to Krafft-Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson's view and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing's, should not face prejudice. He also wrote one of the first homosexual novels\u2014''Imre: A Memorandum''.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Also in this era, the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote an account of his sexual history.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall.Virginia UP. Pg. 90\u201391.</ref> He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to \"cure\" him.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/> Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely \"spiritual,\" but could not escape the \"animal.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 90-91\"/>\n\nBy this time, society was slowly becoming aware of the homosexual subculture. In an 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> With a population around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York's queer subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on its own terms. \"Middle class queer,\" \"fairies,\" were among the terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> But with this growing public presence, backlash occurred. The YMCA, who ironically promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman's praise of male brotherhood and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch. Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 127-152\"/> Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.\n\n===1920s===\n[[File:WeMustGrowAMustache.jpg|thumb|Sheet music poking fun at the masculine traits many women adopted during the 1920s.]]\n\nThe 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see [[Pre-Code]]) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title \"Masculine Women, Feminine Men.\"<ref>The song was written by [[Edgar Leslie]] (words) and [[James Vincent Monaco|James V. Monaco]] (music) and featured in [[Hugh J. Ward]]'s production of the musical ''[[Lady, Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''.</ref> It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:<ref>Artists who recorded this song include: 1.

Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as \"pansy clubs\". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor [[William Haines]], regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, [[Jimmie Shields]].<ref>Mann, William J., ''Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star.

'' New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12\u201313, 80\u201383.</ref> In 1927, [[Mae West]] wrote a play about homosexuality called ''[[The Drag (play)|The Drag]]'', and alluded to the work of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic [[human rights]] issue, and was also an early advocate of [[LGBT social movements|gay rights]]. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality.\n\n===Late 1930s===\nBy 1935, the United States had become conservative once again. [[Victorian morality|Victorian values]] and morals, which had been widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this period, life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.

The war effort greatly shifted American culture and by extension representations in entertainment of both the [[nuclear family]] and LGBT people. In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947, WWII [[conscientious objectors]] in the US assigned to psychiatric hospitals under [[Civilian Public Service]] exposed abuses throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in [[reform]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n===Stonewall riots===\n{{Main|Stonewall riots}}\n\nAlthough the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are generally considered the starting point of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the LGBT community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power. ''See: [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots]]''\n\nIn the autumn of 1959, the police force of New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars, which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year. This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing ''NY Mirror'' newspaper columnist [[Lee Mortimer]]. Existing gay bars were quickly closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], [[Craig Rodwell]] president and vice president respectively of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and Mattachine activist John Timmons staged the Sip-In at [[Julius (restaurant)|Julius' Bar]] on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens, transsexuals, and butch lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative march one year later, organized by the impetus of [[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the [[Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980s===\n {{Disputed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe 1980s in LGBT history are marked with the emergence of [[HIV]]. During the early period of the outbreak of HIV, the [[HIV and men who have sex with men|epidemic of HIV was commonly linked to gay men.]]\n\nIn the 1980s a renewed conservative movement spawned a new anti-gay movement in the United States, particularly with the help of the Religious Right ([[Evangelicals]] in particular). While it is a common belief within some circles of the LGBT community that [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]] were anti-gay, some others believe that this is an exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he came out against [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a ballot initiative that would have dismissed California teachers who \"advocated\" homosexuality, even off-campus. As President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of homosexuals. Robert G. Kaiser's news story in the March 18, 1984, Washington Post.\n\"The Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,\" Kaiser wrote. \"Their interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans' private White House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington for Nancy Reagan's 60th birthday party\u2014a fact confirmed for the press by Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Murdock |first=Deroy |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/304207/gay-left-lies-about-reagan-again-deroy-murdock?pg=2: |title=The Gay Left Lies about Reagan \u2014 Again |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> However, by the later part of the decade the general public started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gays as the toll for AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as cultural icons such as [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Liberace]], who also died from the condition. Also, despite the more conservative period, life in general for gays and lesbians was considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era.\n \nTestifying to improved conditions, a 1991 [[Wall Street Journal]] survey found that homosexuals, in comparison with average Americans, were three times more likely to be college graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, with average salaries $30,000 higher than the norm.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nayo9QVuJs8C&pg=PA139 \"The Pleasure Principle: Sex, Backlash, and the Struggle for Gay Freedom\"], Michael Bronski.

The Social Justice High School-Pride Campus is proposed for Chicago,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95565768 |title=Chicago Proposes Gay-Friendly High School |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> and a number of private schools have also identified as \"gay friendly\", such as the [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]] in New York City.\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, two American school districts celebrated [[LGBT History Month]]; the Broward County school district in Florida signed a resolution in September in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, and later that year the Los Angeles school district, America's second-largest, also signed on.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/08/two-school-districts-recognize-lgbt-month/?hpt=us_bn1 |title=Two school districts recognize LGBT Month \u2013 In America - CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Inamerica.blogs.cnn.com |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>\n\n==Same-sex marriage==\n{{Main|Same-sex marriage}}\n{{World homosexuality laws map|align=right|size=350px}}\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, there has been a growing movement in a number of countries to regard marriage as a right which should be extended to [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]. Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of entitlements, including [[social security]], taxation, inheritance and other benefits unavailable to couples not married, in the eyes of the law. Restricting legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children.\n\nThe first country to legalize same-sex marriages was the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. {{as of|2019|June}}, same-sex marriages are legal nationally in twenty-six countries: the Netherlands (2001), [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (without [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Northern Ireland]]\u2014May 22, 2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2014), [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]] (2015),  [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2018) and in [[Same-sex marriage in Austria|Austria]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]] (2019). In [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Mexico|Mexico]], same-sex marriage is recognized in all states, but performed only in [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]], where it became effective on March 4, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | author=Carlos \u00c1viles Allende | publisher=El Universal | title=Ratifica corte, bodas gay, v\u00e1lidas en todo el pa\u00eds | date=August 10, 2010 | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/700789.html | accessdate=September 23, 2010|language=es}}</ref><ref name=\"Gay marriage effective\">{{cite web | last=Archundia | first=M\u00f3nica | publisher=El Universal | title=La primera uni\u00f3n gay, para marzo | date=January 5, 2010 | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad/99607.html | accessdate=January 5, 2010|language=es}}</ref>\n\nSame-sex marriage was effectively legalized in the United States on June 26, 2015 following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Obergefell v.

Federal benefits were previously extended to lawfully married same-sex couples following the Supreme Court's June 2013 decision in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''.\n\n==Student groups==\n{{Main|Gay\u2013straight alliance}}\n\nSince the mid-1970s students at high schools and universities have organized LGBT groups, often called Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) at their respective schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amsa.org/news/release2.cfx?id=279|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213233143/http://www.amsa.org/news/release2.cfx?id=279|url-status=dead|publisher=American Medical Student Association |date=September 13, 2006 |title=Nation's Medical Students Applaud California Osteopathic Medical School's Affirmation of Gay-Straight Alliance |archivedate=February 13, 2009}}</ref> The groups form to provide support for LGBT students and to promote awareness of LGBT issues in the local community. In 1990, a student group named The Other Ten Percentile (Hebrew: \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8) was founded by a group of teachers and students in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], becoming the first LGBT organization in [[Jerusalem]]. Frequently, such groups have been banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recognition as other student groups. For example, in September 2006, [[Touro University California]] briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the [[Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance]]. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the [[American Medical Student Association]], the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]] and the [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] [[City council|City Council]], Touro University retracted its revocation of the school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nIn April 2016, the GSA Network changed their name from Gay-Straight Alliance Network to Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network in order to be more inclusive and reflective of youth who make up the organization.\n\n==Historical study of homosexuality==\n\n===19th century and early 20th century===\nWhen [[Heinrich H\u00f6ssli]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs|K. H. Ulrichs]] began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam.<ref>''Gay histories and cultures: an encyclopedia: Volume 2 of Encyclopedia of lesbian and gay histories and cultures'', George E. Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman, {{ISBN|0-8153-3354-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3354-8}}, Taylor & Francis, 2000, page 388.</ref> Some other information was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and [[Havelock Ellis]]. In Germany, [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of the ''Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen'' and Magnus Hirschfeld's ''Die Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes'' (1914). The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of [[Nazism]] put a stop to most serious homosexual research.\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\nAs part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California, a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals as ''The Ladder'', ''Mattachine Review'', and ''One Quarterly''. In France ''Aracadie'' under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid to touch the subject. As a result, much of the work was done by autodidacts toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women of the past for example.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure from the group around the French periodical ''Annales''. Although several useful syntheses of the world [[history of homosexuality]] have appeared, much material, especially from [[Islam]], China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.<ref>Ed.

{"title_page": "Song Car-Tunes", "text_new": "{{short description|Animated film series}}\n{{italic title}}\n''''' Ko-Ko Song Car-Tunes''''', '''''Song Car-Tunes''''', or (some sources erroneously say) '''''Sound Car-Tunes''''', is a series of [[short film|short]] three-minute [[animation]] films produced by [[Max Fleischer]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] between May 1924 and September 1927, pioneering the use of the \"[[Bouncing ball (music)|Follow the Bouncing Ball]]\" device used to lead audiences in theater sing-alongs. The ''Song Car-Tunes'' also pioneered the application of [[sound film]] to animation, four years before [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]]'s ''[[Dinner Time (film)|Dinner Time]]'' (released October 14, 1928) and [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (released November 18, 1928).\n\n==History==\n\nBetween 45 and 50 ''Song Car-tunes'' were produced and released between 1924 and 1927. The first, ''Come Take a Trip on My Airship'', was released March 9, 1924. Beginning in 1925, an estimated 16 ''Song Car-tunes'' were produced using the [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process developed by [[Lee DeForest]] beginning with ''Come Take a Trip on My Airship''. The remaining 31 titles were released silent, designed to be played with live music in theaters.\n\nThe Fleischer brothers partnered with DeForest, Edwin Miles Fadiman, and Dr. [[Hugo Riesenfeld]] to form Red Seal Pictures Corporation, which owned 36 theaters on the East Coast, extending as far west as [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In September 1926, the U.S. division of DeForest Phonofilm and Red Seal Pictures Corporation filed for bankruptcy, and the Fleischers ended their use of the Phonofilm system, releasing their last sound ''Song Car-Tune'', ''[[By the Light of the Silvery Moon (song)|By the Light of the Silvery Moon]]'' (1927), just as the [[sound film|sound era]] was about to begin. In early 1929, the Fleischers signed a [[Paramount Pictures]] contract. Former Fleischer partner, Alfred Weiss re-released some of the silent ''Song Car-Tunes'' between 1929 and 1932 with new soundtracks, new animation, and new main titles that exploited the reputation of the popular song films with the elimination of the names of Max and Dave Fleischer.\n\nWith the sound era established, the Fleischers revived the song film series as ''[[Screen Songs]]'' in February 1929 on the strength of being the holders of the original Patent on the concept.  Though [[Ko-Ko the Clown]] had been temporarily retired due to complications with the dissolution of the original [[Inkwell Studios]], the \"Bouncing Ball\" was retained. This new series ran a full seven minutes, with more animation than the early Song Car-Tunes, built around the theme of the featured song.\n\nThe first films in the new series used standards such as ''[[The Sidewalks of New York (cartoon)|The Sidewalks of New York]]'' (released 5 February 1929) and ''[[Old Black Joe]]''. The series continued with new productions of songs previously released in the earlier series, such as ''Daisy Bell'', ''Good Bye, My Lady Love'', ''Mother Pin a Rose On Me'', ''[[Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning]]'', and ''Come Take a Trip in My Airship'', released by [[Paramount Pictures]] for nine years.\n\nMany of the Screen Songs featured popular stars of stage, radio, and records such as [[Ethel Merman]], [[Rudy Vallee]], [[Lillian Roth]], [[The Mills Brothers]], and the [[Boswell Sisters]]. Starting in 1934, the Screen Songs series focused on the [[big bands]] of the \"Swing Era\", such as [[Abe Lyman]], [[Shep Fields]], [[Gus Arnheim]], [[Hal Kemp]], Jack Denny, [[Vincent Lopez]], [[Henry King (musician)|Henry King]], [[Jay Freeman]], Jerry Baline, Bert Block, Frank Dailey, and [[Jimmy Dorsey]].\n\nThe \"Screen Songs\" concept was revised in a special edition of the [[Technicolor]] ''[[Noveltoons]]'' series in 1945 with ''When G. I. Johnny Comes Home Again'', and the series officially returned in 1947 with ''The Circus Comes to Clown'' and continued until 1951. Paramount attempted to revive the series in 1963 after the television success of ''[[Sing Along With Mitch]]'' with the cartoon ''Hobo's Holiday''.\n\nThe concept of the \"Bouncing Ball\" has become such an established cultural icon, that it has been used in television commercials to sell all sorts of products from sleeping tablets to cat food.  Just before retiring in 1968, Dave Fleischer used a form of the \"Bouncing Ball\" for the ending of ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' where he shot cutout animation to \"bounce\" the head of [[Beatrice Lillie]] over the lyrics to the title song.<ref>Pointer, Ray (2016) \"The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer,\" McFarland & Co.

The ''Song Car-Tunes'' also pioneered the application of [[sound film]] to animation, four years before [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]]'s ''[[Dinner Time (film)|Dinner Time]]'' (released October 14, 1928) and [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (released November 18, 1928).\n\n==History==\n\nBetween 45 and 50 ''Song Car-tunes'' were produced and released between 1924 and 1927. The first, ''Come Take a Trip on My Airship'' was released March 9, 1924. Beginning in 1925, an estimated 16 ''Song Car-tunes'' were produced using the [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process developed by [[Lee DeForest]] beginning with ''Come Take a Trip on My Airship''. The remaining 31 titles were released silent, designed to be played with live music in theaters.\n\nThe Fleischer brothers partnered with DeForest, Edwin Miles Fadiman, and Dr. [[Hugo Riesenfeld]] to form Red Seal Pictures Corporation, which owned 36 theaters on the East Coast, extending as far west as [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In September 1926, the U.S. division of DeForest Phonofilm and Red Seal Pictures Corporation filed for bankruptcy, and the Fleischers ended their use of the Phonofilm system, releasing their last sound ''Song Car-Tune'', ''[[By the Light of the Silvery Moon (song)|By the Light of the Silvery Moon]]'' (1927), just as the [[sound film|sound era]] was about to begin. In early 1929, the Fleischers signed a [[Paramount Pictures]] contract. Former Fleischer partner, Alfred Weiss re-released some of the silent ''Song Car-Tunes'' between 1929 and 1932 with new soundtracks, new animation, and new main titles that exploited the reputation of the popular song films with the elimination of the names of Max and Dave Fleischer.\n\nWith the sound era established, the Fleischers revived the song film series as ''[[Screen Songs]]'' in February 1929 on the strength of being the holders of the original Patent on the concept.  Though [[Ko-Ko the Clown]] had been temporarily retired due to complications with the dissolution of the original [[Inkwell Studios]], the \"Bouncing Ball\" was retained. This new series ran a full seven minutes, with more animation than the early Song Car-Tunes, built around the theme of the featured song.\n\nThe first films in the new series used standards such as ''[[The Sidewalks of New York (cartoon)|The Sidewalks of New York]]'' (released 5 February 1929) and ''[[Old Black Joe]]''. The series continued with new productions of songs previously released in the earlier series, such as ''Daisy Bell'', ''Good Bye, My Lady Love'', ''Mother Pin a Rose On Me'', ''[[Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning]]'', and ''Come Take a Trip in My Airship'', released by [[Paramount Pictures]] for nine years.\n\nMany of the Screen Songs featured popular stars of stage, radio, and records such as [[Ethel Merman]], [[Rudy Vallee]], [[Lillian Roth]], [[The Mills Brothers]], and the [[Boswell Sisters]]. Starting in 1934, the Screen Songs series focused on the [[big bands]] of the \"Swing Era\", such as [[Abe Lyman]], [[Shep Fields]], [[Gus Arnheim]], [[Hal Kemp]], Jack Denny, [[Vincent Lopez]], [[Henry King (musician)|Henry King]], [[Jay Freeman]], Jerry Baline, Bert Block, Frank Dailey, and [[Jimmy Dorsey]].\n\nThe \"Screen Songs\" concept was revised in a special edition of the [[Technicolor]] ''[[Noveltoons]]'' series in 1945 with ''When G. I. Johnny Comes Home Again'', and the series officially returned in 1947 with ''The Circus Comes to Clown'' and continued until 1951.
