To the south and southeast the forest was separated from the coast by mangrove and swamp forests, while to the north it merged into the Guinean Forest-Savanna Mosaic ecoregion. Human pressure is not new. In the Okomu park there is an extensive layer of charcoal and pottery below the forest, indicating that it was cleared and then regenerated over the last 700 years. By the start of the 20th century the forest survived only in disconnected blocks, which were under intense pressure from human activity. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oladejo|first=S.O|date=2015-11-28|title=LAND USE/LAND COVER AND BIODIVERSITY STATUS OF OKOMU FOREST RESERVE|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284813842_LAND_USELAND_COVER_AND_BIODIVERSITY_STATUS_OF_OKOMU_FOREST_RESERVE}}</ref>.{{cn|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Khaya senegalensis MS 2037.JPG|thumb|300px|''[[Khaya senegalensis]]'', or African mahogany.

The book represents an imagined exhibit, curated by Ann Marie Pena, at the imagined gallery the Road at the Top of the World Museum. The museum is supposedly located in [[Dawson City]], Yukon, and the title was inspired by Alaska's [[Top of the World Highway|Yukon Highway 9]] or the \u201cTop of the World Highway\u201d.\n \nIn order to focus and work on the paintings which would eventually be featured in the book, Williamson moved to the Yukon for an extended period of time. <ref name=\":8\" /> The book's title \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d refers to the limitations and opportunities provided by working in the extreme solitude of the Yukon, \u201cI was picturing working away in the studio in the Yukon, seeing the world through the Internet, newspapers, books\u2014trying to see what the world looked like in that way\". <ref name=\":8\" /> This influence of popular culture can be seen in works such as \u201cI saw the whole universe (Scarlett Johansson in Versace)\u201d. The \u201cexhibition\u201d included 46 paintings, most of which are oil on wood and featured, \u201cstill lifes, heads, hands, torsos and prone figures\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" /> The book features five different \u201cgalleries\u201d which all feature an accompanying essay by Williamson's friends, collaborators, and authors such as Leanne Shapton and Chris Kraus.\n \nThe process of creating this exhibit / book took Margaux almost six years. Finally, when the book was released in 2014 Williamson did her first gallery in nearly seven years. The exhibit, entitled \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d was shown at Mulherin + Pollard in New York City's Lower East Side. \n\n== Exhibitions<ref name=\":13\" />==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The book represents an imagined exhibit, curated by Ann Marie Pena, at the imagined gallery the Road at the Top of the World Museum. The museum is supposedly located in [[Dawson City]], Yukon, and the title was inspired by Alaska\u2019s [[Top of the World Highway|Yukon Highway 9]] or the \u201cTop of the World Highway\u201d.\n \nIn order to focus and work on the paintings which would eventually be featured in the book, Williamson moved to the Yukon for an extended period of time. <ref name=\":8\" /> The book\u2019s title \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d refers to the limitations and opportunities provided by working in the extreme solitude of the Yukon, \u201cI was picturing working away in the studio in the Yukon, seeing the world through the Internet, newspapers, books\u2014trying to see what the world looked like in that way\". <ref name=\":8\" /> This influence of popular culture can be seen in works such as \u201cI saw the whole universe (Scarlett Johansson in Versace)\u201d. The \u201cexhibition\u201d included 46 paintings, most of which are oil on wood and featured, \u201cstill lifes, heads, hands, torsos and prone figures\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" /> The book features five different \u201cgalleries\u201d which all feature an accompanying essay by Williamson\u2019s friends, collaborators, and authors such as Leanne Shapton and Chris Kraus.\n \nThe process of creating this exhibit / book took Margaux almost six years. Finally, when the book was released in 2014 Williamson did her first gallery in nearly seven years. The exhibit, entitled \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d was shown at Mulherin + Pollard in New York City\u2019s Lower East Side. \n\n== Exhibitions<ref name=\":13\" />==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Williamson spent eight weeks in the Anne Lind Studio, where she studied and examined concepts including, \u201cavoidance, conflict, compromise and the notion of establishing a sense of place\".  <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://ago.ca/artist-in-residence/margaux-williamson|title=Artist-in-Residence - Margaux Williamson|website=Art Gallery of Ontario|language=en|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Williamson examined these four concepts through videos and painting. During her residency, one of the works Williamson created was \u201cHow to Act in Real Life\u201d a new and still on-going performance art series. <ref name=\":11\" /> This work was a collaboration with Sheila Heti, it was a public and performance piece where Williamson instructed Heti on how \u201cto act in the real world\u201d . <ref name=\":11\" /> Williamson and Heti would act out this performance in a circle like setting, which was open to the audience  to join and interact in. Another piece of work Williamson showcased was a series of \u201creal art of tv\u201d, called \u201cBack to the World\u201d. The screening of this piece took place between 3pm and midnight. Williamson once again engaged with her audience, this time by inviting them to bring their own sleeping bags and pillows to the showing. <ref name=\":11\" /> Other programs Williamson developed during her residency were Teenager Hamlet, I\u2019m a Very Sexy Baby and a  performance by Tomboyfriend.<ref name=\":11\" />\n== Awards ==\nIn April 2013, Partners in Art won the MOCCA Award ([[Museum of Contemporary Art]]), it was a $25,000 prize.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://partnersinart.ca/projects/mocca-award-commissioned-videos/|title=MOCA Award: Commissioned Videos|website=Partners in Art|language=en|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>  The award recognizes an individual's achievements in the visual art realm.
