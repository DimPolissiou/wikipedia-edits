In addition, grading  scales at university level institutions have changed frequently. Grading scales  can be 1 to 7, 1 to 5, or A through F, where A is on a 4.0 scale or on a 5.0  scale. The most common scale is now 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest grade obtained.   In addition, degrees are awarded in a Class, depending on the grades  received. Degrees may be awarded in the First Class, Second Class (Upper  Division), Second Class (Lower Division), Third Class and Pass  Class. Grading scales for secondary certificates are standard. Below is the grading system of Nigerian universities:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Percentage\n!Grade\n!Description\n|-\n|70 - 100%\n|A\n|First class\n|-\n|60 - 69%\n|B\n|Second class, Upper Division\n|-\n|50 - 59%\n|C\n|Second Class, Lower Division\n|-\n|45 - 49%\n|D\n|Third Class\n|-\n|40 - 44%\n|E\n|Pass\n|-\n|0 - 39%\n|F\n|Fail\n|}\n\n=== South Africa ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in South Africa}}\n\nMost universities follow a model based on the British system. Thus, at the University of Cape Town and the University of South Africa (UNISA), the percentages are calibrated as follows: a 1st class pass is given for 75% and above, a second (division one) for 70 - 74%, a second (division two) for 60% - 69%, and a third for 50 - 59%. Any lower than 40% is a fail. The University of the Witwatersrand considers an A to be 75% and above.\n\n===Tanzania===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Percentage !! Grade !!

Most schools use a 0\u201320 scale where the passing grade is 10 out of 20 (Minimum passing grade may be as low as 7). It depends on the programme the school is offering: if French/Lebanese Baccalaureate the 0-20 scale is used with some exceptions (Some schools offer the Lebanese baccalaureate but instead of the 0-20 scale a 100-point scale is used) IB schools unanimously use a 100-point scale if not an American grading scale (Refer to the American grading system).\n\nIn the typical school offering a Lebanese curriculum (to which the outcome is a Lebanese Baccalaureate) getting high grades is very hard because teachers do not use the full scale. For instance the highest score one can earn in essay writing in some schools is 14 out of 20 (with the class averaging 9 or 10). Each subject has a weight and thus contributes differently towards the overall score: the \"General Average\" (Taken from the French Moyenne G\u00e9n\u00e9rale). This weight is determined by the credit hours. For instance math (6hours/week) x 20 (the base grade) = 120 (weight)\nExample: Sample grades: (Maths 13.33/20, English 13.4/20, Biology 8.25/20)\n\nEnglish: 5 credits \u00d7 13.4 = 67 out of possible 100\n\nMath: 6 credits \u00d7 13.33 = 79.98 out of possible 120\n\nBiology: 2 credits \u00d7 8.25 = 16.5 out of possible 40\n\n'''Total points earned = 163.48 out of possible 260'''\n\n'''General Average / Moyenne G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  12.575'''\n(Considered a good average, a B+ if not A- US Equivalent since the standards are different: Grade 12 in Lebanese Baccalaureate or French Baccalaureate is equivalent to a US College Freshman, moreover all Lebanese programmes include 3 Languages and a total of 18 subjects yearly with summer homework)\nStudents Graduating Lebanese or French Bacc. enter universities as sophomores not freshmen and can complete their degrees in 3 years.\n\nU.S. Equivalence <br />\nScale / U.S. Grade Equiv.<br />\n14\u201320 / A+<br />\n13\u201313.9 / A<br />\n11\u201312.9 / B+<br />\n10\u201310.9 / B<br />\n9.5\u20139.9 / B\u2212<br />\n9.1\u20139.4 / C+<br />\n9 / C<br />\n8\u20138.9 / C\u2212<br />\n6.5\u20137.9 / D<br />\nBelow 6 / F\n\nIn some universities the American grading system is used.

The grading is managed by the Ministry of Education ([http://www.moe.gov.ae/english/pages/default.aspx MOE]). However, there are also many schools run by expatriates that are equally successful with their own grading system, or an accepted grading system of the country where the schools are affiliated to or share common standards with. At most universities and colleges, the United Arab Emirates' grading system is very similar to the United States' system.\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Vietnam}}\n\nThe grade scale in Vietnam is from 10 to 1 where 10 is the highest, as follows.\n\n*10 - Outstanding\n*9 - Very good\n*8 - Good\n*7 - Acceptable\n*5-6 - Satisfactory\n*2-4 - Insufficient\n*1 - Fail\n\nSchools and universities in Vietnam use a 10-point grading scale, with 10 being the highest and 0 being the lowest, as follows.\n*8-10 - Distinction\n*6.5-8 - Good\n*5-6.5 - Intermediate\n*3.5-5 - Insufficient\n*Lower than 3.5 - Fail\nThe grading may vary from school to school. It depends on the difficulty of each.\n\nThe distribution of grades differs from standards in Western countries and strongly depends on the university. In Vietnamese universities, a ten or nine is nearly impossible. Students hardly get more than 8.0 of the final results.\n\n== Central America ==\n\n=== Costa Rica ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Costa Rica}}\n\n=== Nicaragua ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Nicaragua}}\n\n=== Panama ===\n\nGrading system in Panama is different from universities than schools.\n\nUniversities use 0\u2013100 point grade scaling similar to the United States grading. 71 is required to pass or the same as a C. While schools use the 1\u20135 point system. meaning if a student has a 4.5 that is the equivalent of an A- or somewhere around the 95 point range.\n\nWhen it comes to the GPA Scale though, Panama uses 0\u20133 point scale to determine the student's GPA. So if a student has a 2.5 that is roughly the same as a U.S. student having a 3.0\u20133.5.\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== Albania ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date= May 2017}}\nIn [[Albania]], grades from 4 to 10 are used, with some schools allowing decimals (up to the hundredth digit) and some others only allowing whole numbers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Grade\n!Qualification\n|-\n|9.00\u201310.00\n| Excellent\n|-\n|8.00\u20138.99\n| Very good\n|-\n|7.00\u20137.99\n| Good\n|-\n|6.00\u20136.99\n| Satisfactory\n|-\n|5.00\u20135.99\n| Sufficient\n|-\n|1.00\u20134.99\n| Insufficient\n|}\n\nMost universities evaluate classes with two mid exams and a final. The [[final exam]] encompasses the whole course syllabus, whereas the mid exams usually review half. In some schools, if the average grade of the two mid exams is equal to or higher than 7.00, the student is able to pass the class without the need to take a final exam (since there are only two exams, some teachers also pass students who average 6.50; others weigh in the decision based on the student's performance in class). An average of less than 4.00 is failing; students who score such an average are not allowed to take the final exam.\n\nIn high schools, the year is divided into three trimesters and classes are usually yearlong. Students need an average of 6.00 or higher in the three trimestral exams to avoid having to take a final to pass the class. In the event of a student scoring less than 6.00 in the third trimester, he or she would have to take a final exam, regardless of average. This is considered controversial, since the last trimestral exam is not more important than the first two, but the rule stands to prevent students who have already reached the minimum average (e.g., two 10.00 in the first two give a student the lowest possible average of 6.33) from not making an effort during the last three months of the year.

On report cards, certain schools also give grades on a percentage scale (0 to 100) while others use a 0\u201310 scale. Those total scores are weighted averages of exams and tests.\nIn Belgian secondary schools, there are 6 years. In the first three years, students have to do exams every term. The scores are usually given in percentages. On the end of the school year, a total average score is given.\n\nUniversity colleges (other form of higher education, not comparable with American colleges) use the same scale from 0 to 20 as Belgian universities, although homework and presence may influence sometimes up to 50% or even more of these 20 points (situation {{As of|2011|02|lc=yes}}). It is more common to have a final exam counting for 100% of the grade if the course does not require laboratory work. Obtaining a grade higher than 16/20 is considered as a very good grade and a 19 or 20/20 is very rare.\n\nScaling varies significantly depending on the university or college.\n\n=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===\n{{main|Academic grading in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\nIn [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], grades from 5 to 1 are used in primary and secondary education, while grades from 10 to 5 are used at universities.\n\nPrimary and secondary education grading:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Every passing grade at or above the .50 mark is prefixed with the term of the higher grade. The minimum is 2.00; grades below 3.00 are failing grades, and the maximum is 6.00. Grades like \"Very good\" (5-) and \"Average\" (3+) are also possible - these are ignored in calculations.\n\nRoughly, the Bulgarian grade system can be equated to the American one as the following: 6=A, 5=B, 4=C, 3=D, and 2=F. Also, in accordance with the Australian system, 6=HD, 5=D, 4=Cr, 3=P, and 2=F.\n\nThe most common formula used in Bulgarian schools is currently Grade=(6* number of correct answers)/ total number of questions.\nThat way if a student has answered 7 out of 10 questions correctly, their mark should be: (6*7)/10=4.20, which is graded as Good 4 or an average performance.\n\n=== Croatia ===\n{{main|Academic grading in Croatia}}\n\nIn [[Croatia]], the following grade scale is used in schools:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| 5\n| ''Odli\u010dan'' or ''Izvrstan'' || ''Excellent'', best possible grade A\n|-\n! 4\n| ''Vrlo dobar'' || ''Very good'', next highest B\n|-\n! 3\n| ''Dobar'' || ''Good'', indicates average performance C\n|-\n! 2\n| ''Dovoljan'' || ''Sufficient'', lowest passing grade D\n|-\n! 1\n| ''Nedovoljan'' || ''Insufficient'', failing grade F\n|}\n\nAt the end of each semester the grades are averaged to form a Grade Point Average (''prosje\u010dna ocjena''), according to this scale:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| 5.00\u20134.50\n| ''Odli\u010dan'' or ''Izvrstan'' || ''Excellent'', best possible grade A\n|-\n! 4.49\u20133.50\n| ''Vrlo dobar'' || ''Very good'', next highest B\n|-\n! 3.49\u20132.50\n| ''Dobar'' || ''Good'', indicates average performance C\n|-\n! 2.49\u20131.50\n| ''Dovoljan'' || ''Sufficient'', lowest passing grade D\n|-\n! 1.49\u20131.0\n| ''Nedovoljan'' || ''Insufficient'', failing grade F\n|}\n\nIn colloquial Croatian, grades are referred to be their numerical values: ''jedinica'', ''dvojka'', ''trojka'', ''\u010detvorka'', ''petica''.\nStudents with failing grades (1 or F) are allowed to carry those grades throughout the school year, but are required to improve them to passing grades (2 or better) in order to finish the year. Failure to pass one class results in the student being held back a year.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]], a five-point grading scale is used in both primary and secondary schools:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

U.S. 'E/F' equivalent.\n|}\n\nPlus and minus signs are often used to further differentiate marks. For example, \"2+\" corresponds to the U.S. 'B+'. Half-intervals may also be used, such as \"2\u20133\", a grade halfway between 2 and 3.\n\nAt the university level, only grades 1, 2 and 3 are passing; anything worse than 3 is automatically a failing grade. Some universities use a six-point scale, with 'A' corresponding to \"1\", 'B' to \"1\u20132\", etc.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n{{main|Academic grading in Denmark}}\n\nThe current scale, ''syv-trins-skalaen'' (\"The 7-step-scale\"), was introduced in 2007, replacing the old ''13-skala'' (\"13-scale\"). The new scale is designed to be compatible with the [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS-scale]].\n\n''Syv-trins-skalaen'' consists of seven different grades, ranging from 12 to \u22123, with 12 being the highest. This new scale remains an \"absolute\" scale, meaning that, proportions are not taken into consideration.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade\n! ECTS Grade\n! Description\n!

The \"school grade\" system has historically been a scale of 0 to 10, but all grades lower than 4 have been discarded. Thus, it is now divided between 4, the failing grade, and 5\u201310, the succeeding grades. [[Upper secondary school]] has same grades for courses and course exams as comprehensive school but [[matriculation examination]] grades are in Latin. Universities and vocational institutions use a scale of 0 (fail) and 1\u20135 (pass), or fail/pass. Some schools e.g. Savon Ammatti- ja Aikuisopisto, uses grading from 0 (fail) and 1-3 (pass). The professor selects which grading scheme is used; short, optional courses typically have pass/fail grades.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in France}}\n\nIn France, schools grades typically range from either 0 (worst) to 20 (best) or, sometimes, from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). A mark below the average (10 out of 20 or 5 out of 10, depending on the scale) is usually a fail.\nFor the French National High School Level ([[baccalaur\u00e9at]]), a grade of 8\u201310 typically gives the right to take an additional oral exam in order to try to improve that average to 10 and pass. A grade between 10 and 12 is a simple pass (without grade); between 12 and 14 (more rarely 13\u201314) the grade is called \"assez bien\" (rather good); 14\u201316 is called \"bien\" (good); above 16 is \"tr\u00e8s bien\" (very good). An exams jury can award the \"F\u00e9licitations du Jury\" for any mark, though they usually reserve it to a candidate who has achieved 18/20 or more.\n\n[[World Education Services]] grade equivalence between France and the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wes.org/gradeconversionguide/index.asp |title=WES Grade Conversion Guide |publisher=[[World Education Services]] |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The perfect overall performance is named ''kit\u0171n\u0151'' or ''kiv\u00e1l\u00f3'' (excellent).\n\nThe bare five-point scale is used almost exclusively for final grades at all educational levels (elementary school, high school, university). During the academic year, however, teachers may use various modifiers, especially in elementary school. A comma (,) after the grade has a minus effect (\"al\u00e1\", below), and an apostrophe (\u2019) after the grade has a plus effect (\"f\u00f6l\u00e9\", above); a grade halfway between two integers is indicated by the lower and higher one separated by a solidus: 3''/''4 (\"h\u00e1romnegyed\") is equivalent to 3.5, and 4''/''5 is between 4 and 5, etc. Sometimes \"5*\", five starred (\"csillagos \u00f6t\u00f6s\") is used to indicate outstanding performance throughout the semester (only in primary school, as it would be considered childish in secondary school).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Previously, this consisted of lettered and numbered grades (A1, A2, B1, B2), with each grade separated by 5%, bar an A1 which was given for a mark over 90%. However, this was updated for the 2016/2017 Leaving Cert cycle and these letters were replaced by H (higher level), O (ordinary level) and F (foundation level).<ref>https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=scoring&s=lcepointsgrid</ref> Each grade is separated by 10%. A maximum of 6 subjects are counted, with a possible 100 points in each subject. For students sitting the higher level maths paper, an extra 25 points can be obtained by getting a grade above a H6. In practice, most students take 7 or 8 subjects and their best 6 results are counted. Each subject has 2 or 3 levels: higher, ordinary and foundation. The points are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Minimum passing is 6. As these symbols (except \u00bd) have no clear mathematical value (usually \u00b10.25), calculating end-year averages can be somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent; therefore, there has been a push since 2008 with the Gelmini reform to uniform the system to the 1\u201310 scale.<ref>[http://www.bigben.hu/page59kozepiskolaolaszorszagangol.htm High school, secondary school in Italy].

This stems from the practice that exams were traditionally given by 3 examiners. Each had to rate the student's examination performance on a 1\u201310 scale, and the final grade was the sum of the three ratings. On a 1\u201310 scale, passing is 6, so on a 1\u201330 scale the minimum passing grade is 3*6 = 18. Nowadays the form of each examination is decided by the professor{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} (number of examiners, whether written, oral, or both, etc.), but the traditional grading system remained.\n\nDegrees have an analogous point system, in which however the highest grade is 110. \nA ''[[cum laude]]'' notation (''e lode'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is used to augment the highest grade for both exams and degrees, in all its levels, to reflect truly outstanding performance.\n\n====Summary====\n*Primary and secondary school\n**10-point grading scale; highest result 10, pass result 6\n*Licenza media (commonly known as \"Terza media\")\n**10-point grading scale; highest result 10 e lode, pass result 6\n*Maturit\u00e0\n**100-point grading scale; highest result 100 e lode, pass result 60\n*University\n**Exams: 30-point grading scale; highest result 30 e lode, pass result 18 \n**Laurea (bachelor's degree) and laurea magistrale (master's degree): 110-point grading scale; highest result 110 e lode, pass result 66\n\n;Corresponding percentages\n*10: 100%\n*9: 90-99%\n*8: 80-89%\n*7: 70-79%\n*6: 60-69%\n*5 and below: 0-59%\n\n;Examples of intermediate grades\n*8-: 79%\n*8=: 76-78%\n*7\u00bd: 75%\n*7+: 71-74%\n\n===Kosovo=== \nIn Kosovo, grading is as follows:\n\n5-Shk\u00eblqyesh\u00ebm (Excellent)\n\n4-Shum\u00eb Mir\u00eb (Very Good)\n\n3-Mir\u00eb (Good)\n\n2-Mjaftuesh\u00ebm (Lowest passing grade)\n\n1-Dob\u00ebt (Failure)\n\n=== Latvia ===\n\nThe '''academic grading system in [[Latvia]]''' is using ten-point [[scale (descriptive set theory)|scale]], where \"10\" ({{lang-lv|desmit}}) is the highest achievable grade, and \"1\" ({{lang-lv|viens}}) is awarded for extremely poor performance. The minimal passing grade is \"4\" ({{lang-lv|\u010detri}}). In most universities,  to get the \"4\", you must acquire at least 50% correct on the work you hand in. Though some universities have a minimum passing grade of \"5\" ({{lang-lv|pieci}}).\n\nThe absence of any kind of performance is indicated by \"nv\" ({{lang-lv|nav v\u0113rt\u0113juma}} 'no assessment possible'); in the past, the mark for absence of work was \"0\" ({{lang-lv|nulle}}). [[Teacher]]s in lower classes and for minor [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s in higher classes are encouraged to award one of two grades: \"i\" ({{lang-lv|ieskait\u012bts}} 'counted') for a passing grade, and \"ni\" ({{lang-lv|neieskait\u012bts}} 'not counted') for a failing grade. The grade of 10 is reserved for exceptional achievements. 9 is most commonly used for a United States equivalent of an A. In some cases the grade can be rounded for example if a student got 67% the grade can sometime be rounded to a 7.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade !! Percentage !! Translation !!

This system can correspond to a percentage system (1 means 0\u20135% correct and 10 means 95\u2013100% correct) but sometimes pts are deducted for number of faults on a test (typically, on vocabulary or topographical tests with more than 10 questions, each fault will nonetheless lead to a reduction in score of one. So 2 faults on a 50 question vocabulary test would constitute an 8). The grades 9 and 10 are hardly ever given on large examinations (on average, a 9 is awarded in only 1.5%, and a 10 in 0.5% of the cases). Generally, either one or two decimal places are predominantly used in secondary and higher education. In primary education, fractions of grades are identified with a + or \u2212, which signifies a quarter (converted to either 0.8 or 0.3 if only one decimal place is used). Thus, a grade of 6.75 (or 6.8) could be written as 7\u2212, whereas a grade of 7+ would count for 7.25 or 7.3.\n\nA 5.5 constitutes a pass, whereas 5.4 and below constitute a fail. If no decimal places are used, 6 and up is a pass and 5 and below is a fail; however, in this case of grading in full numbers there exists sometimes \"6-\", which would officially translate to 5.75, but can be interpreted here as \"barely, but just good enough\". Roughly, a student scores a 5.5 (pass) when 2/3 (67%) of an exam is correct. If the grade would be a 5.49 and one decimal is used, the 5.49 will be a 5.5, but if no decimals are used (usually at the end of the year) the 5.49 will end up as a 5 which indicates a fail.\n\nDepending on the specific university, some students who finish their studies with an average of 8.0 or higher, could get the nomination ''[[Latin honors#Types|cum laude]]'' (which is comparable with ''summa cum laude'' as awarded in Germany and the United States).\n\nThe grade scale with its labels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, the teachers write an individual comment or analysis on tests and in the end of every term.\n\nLower secondary school (''Ungdomsskole''; age 13\u201316) and upper secondary school (''Videreg\u00e5ende skole''; age 16\u201319) use a scale running from 1 through 6, with 6 being the highest and 2 the lowest passing grade. It is not possible to fail a grade in Lower Secondary School, even 1 is a passing grade. For non-final tests and mid-term evaluations the grades are often post fixed with + or \u2212 (except 6+ and 1\u2212). It is also common to use grades such as 5/6 or 4/3 indicating borderline grades. However, the grades students get on their diploma (''Vitnem\u00e5l''), are single-digit grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The student's non-weighted grade point average is also given on the Vitnem\u00e5l.\n\nIn higher education, according to the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS-system]], grades for undergraduate and postgraduate examinations are awarded according to a graded scale from A (highest) to F (lowest), with E as the minimum passing grade. The ECTS system was implemented at Norway's universities and colleges in the early 2000s, with most schools having converted to ECTS by 2003.\n\nBefore 2003, the formerly most common system of grades used at university level was based on a scale running from 1.0 (highest) through 6.0 (lowest), with 4.0 being the lowest passing grade. The way the new Bologna system was introduced implies that students, who had started their studies while the old system still was in effect, will graduate with transcripts containing grades from both systems (i.e. both numbers and letters).\n\nAn academic year has two semesters, from August to December and from January to June, although exceptions occur. Courses are measured in \"studiepoeng\" according to the ECTS standard (European Credit Transfer System credits). A normal full-time study progression awards 60 credits (studiepoeng/stp) per year (30 per semester). Most institutions either use a 7.5, 8, 10, 12, 15 or 20 credit block system.\n\n=== Poland ===\n\nThe most commonly used system in Polish grade schools is as follows (with usual corresponding score percentages):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In examinations it is sometimes awarded for a perfect or near-perfect score (95\u2013100% or more, for example by answering extra-credit questions).\n\nGrades (especially expressed numerically) can be suffixed with + (plus) or - (minus). On rare occasions the = (double minus, 'rails') is used, especially as ''2='' to express the very lowest passing grade.\n\nBefore 1990, grades 1 and 6 were not used. It was the grade 2 that was called \"insufficient\". ''3='', also called ''trzy na szynach'' (literally: ''three on rails'') was the very lowest passing grade. The grade 6 might have been issued on very rare occasions (e.g. for \"making the teacher speechless\").\n\nPost-secondary institutions use a different system, usually consisting of the following grades (with usual corresponding score percentages):\n\n* ''niedostateczny'' (unsatisfactory) \u2013 2.0 \u2013 0\u201350%\n* ''dostateczny'' (satisfactory) \u2013 3.0 \u2013 51\u201360%\n* ''dostateczny plus'' (satisfactory plus) \u2013 3.5 \u2013 61\u201370%\n* ''dobry'' (good) \u2013 4.0 \u2013 71\u201380%\n* ''dobry plus'' (good plus) \u2013 4.5 \u2013 81\u201390%\n* ''bardzo dobry'' (very good) \u2013 5.0 \u2013 91\u2013100%\n* ''zaliczony'' (passed) \u2013 zal.\n* ''niezaliczony'' (not passed) \u2013 nzal.\n\nThe scores corresponding to each grade vary greatly from institution to institution and from course to course, but usually a score of 50% or 51% is required to obtain the lowest passing grade (3.0).\nThe notations ''zal.'' and ''nzal.'' are used when the course only requires attendance and/or is not important (such as sports).\n\n=== Portugal ===\n{{Main|Education in Portugal}}\n\nIn Portuguese primary and middle schools, up until the 9th grade inclusive, the grading system is as follows:\n\n* 5 (very good or excellent) is the best possible grade (90\u2013100%),\n* 4 (good) (70\u201389%),\n* 3 (satisfactory) indicates \"average\" performance (50\u201369%),\n* 2 (unsatisfactory) (20\u201349%),\n* 1 (poor) is the lowest possible grade (0\u201319%).\n\nFrom the 10th grade onwards, including [[tertiary education]], a 20-point grading scale is used, with 10 passing grades and 10 failing grades, with 20 being the highest grade possible and 9.5, rounded upwards to 10, the minimum grade for passing. This 20-point system is used both for test scores and grades.\n\n=== Romania ===\n\nThe system used in Romanian primary schools is as follows:\n\n* Foarte Bine (FB, very good)\n* Bine (B, good)\n* Suficient/Satisf\u0103c\u0103tor (S, pass)\n* Insuficient/Nesatisf\u0103c\u0103tor (I, fail)\n\nIn secondary schools, high schools, and academic institutions, a 10-point scale is used, 5 being the minimum grade for passing:\n\n* 10 (excellent)\n* 9 (very good)\n* 8 (good)\n* 6\u20137 (satisfactory)\n* 5 (sufficient)\n* 1\u20134 (unsatisfactory)\n\nThere is no 0.\nIf a student scores 86%, he will be given a grade of 8.60, which will be rounded to a 9.\nFurther, for a score of 94%, a grade of 9.40 is given that is rounded down to 9.\nThe average of grades are not rounded, thus a student can earn an average grade of e.g. 9.55.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Russia}}\n\nMost Russian educational institutions use a five-point grading scale:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Grade\n!Long name\n!Short name (ru)\n!Long name (pronunciation)\n!Short name (pronunciation)\n!Translation of name\n!Description\n!Percent\n|-\n|5\n|\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\n|\u043e\u0442\u043b\n|Otl\u00ec\u010dno\n|otl\n|Very good or Excellent\n|best possible grade\n|90% and above\n|-\n|4\n|\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\n|\u0445\u043e\u0440\n|Khoro\u0161\u00f2\n|khor\n|Good\n|Good\n|approximately 76\u201390%\n|-\n|3\n|\u0423\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\n|\u0443\u0434\n|Udovletvor\u00ectelno\n|ud\n|Satisfactory, sometimes translated into English as Fair\n|passing grade\n|60-75%\n|-\n|2\n|\u041d\u0435\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\n|\u043d\u0435\u0443\u0434\n|Nyeudovletvor\u00ectelno\n|nye\u00f9d\n|Unsatisfactory\n|failing\n|<59%\n|}\n\nQualifiers + and \u2212 are often used to add some degree of differentiation between the grades: e.g., 4+ is better than 4, but not quite as good as 5\u2212. Grading varies greatly from school to school, university to university, and even teacher to teacher, even for courses that lend themselves to objective marking, such as mathematics and applied sciences. Even though the grades technically range from 1 to 5, 1 is not common and is rarely given for academic reasons\u2014in many cases, a 1 is given as a result of failure to show up for or to complete an exam. A 2 grade usually means that the student showed no or little knowledge in a subject.\n\nIt may be worth mentioning that 1 is a fairly exotic grade in Russian schools, but it does officially exist. The generally used grades are 2 to 5. Plus (+) and minus (\u2212) modifiers follow the same tendency; they are rarely used in middle school and almost never in colleges or universities. Some institutions and teachers, dissatisfied with the five-point scale, work with various larger ones, but these grading systems are not recognized by the state and require conversion for official use.\n\nA considerably more complex grading system has been implemented for the recently introduced [[Education in Russia#Unified state examinations|Unified state examinations]]. In this system, a \"primary grade\" is the sum of points for completed tasks, with each of the tasks having a maximum number of points allocated to it. The maximum total primary grade varies by subject, so that one might obtain a primary grade of 23 out of 37 in mathematics and a primary grade of 43 out of 80 in French. The primary grades are then converted into final or \"test grades\" by means of a sophisticated statistical calculation, which takes into account the distribution of primary grades among the examinees. This system has been criticized for its lack of transparency.\n\nAt universities some subjects are graded \"Pass/No pass\"  or \"Credit/No Credit\" (\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0442/\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0442, pronounced \"zach\u00f2t/nyezach\u00f2t\"); the rest are typically graded on the five-point scale. The \"Pass/No Pass\" grades do not have any official numeric representation. When ''zach\u00f2t'' \u2013 (credit- or pass-) type subjects are graded as \"Pass/No pass\", this represents a student's knowledge of a subject. Each university applies its own standards with respect to the knowledge a student must have in order to pass a subject. ''Zach\u00f2t'' equival to pass with mark of minimum 77% to maximum 100%. Students in Russia must pass all prescribed courses in order to graduate.<ref name=\"xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai\">{{cite web |url=http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B/2974 |title=\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0420\u0424 |publisher=Xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai |date=2012-12-30 |accessdate=2013-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013220234/http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B/2974 |archive-date=2013-10-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSince the word ''zach\u00f2t'' can be translated variously into English (e.g. as \"credit\" or \"pass\"), this notation can create problems for Russian students applying to Western universities. Such grades may confuse Western universities and complicate accurate calculation of students' GPAs in Western systems. For Western system \"Pass\" calculation recommended to perform based on averages.\nWestern universities and equivalency organizations usually disregard ''zach\u00f2t'', despite the fact that this notation is typically used for about half of a student's course results. Consequently, most Western GPA conversions of Russian degrees reflect only part of a candidate's coursework.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.msu.ru/rus/education/students/documents/polozhenie/ |title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u0437\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u044d\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0413\u0423 |publisher=Phys.msu.ru |date=2001-04-26 |accessdate=2013-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101063834/http://www.phys.msu.ru/rus/education/students/documents/polozhenie/ |archive-date=2013-11-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAll course examinations and ''zachot'' tests must be passed at the time each is given, as there are no repeats, resits or grade appeals. Hence only those who satisfy all the requirements during the allotted examination period for each semester graduate, leaving a huge number of students behind who in the West would have had a chance to resit examinations and even get their grades reconsidered. Furthermore, grades in Russia are determined not only by examination results but also by other criteria such as class attendance and participation, term papers and projects, in-class and homework assignments, laboratory reports, presentations, and sometimes even grooming and behavior. All these must be passed during the semester before a 'final examination mark' and final ''zachot'' is awarded.\n\nRussian degrees do not have composite classifications such as in the British system of First Class, Upper/Lower Second Class, Third Class, Pass, etc. This is because each course is examined independently, students must pass all of them, and they do not add up or contribute to an average grade or 'class'. Another reason is that during the Russian Revolution, social stratification and classification were supposedly abolished in the interest of promoting social equality. Accordingly, all students would be expected to perform at or above the minimum level required to qualify and graduate. Calculation of an aggregate mark or GPA is not considered fair or even possible, as it would be felt to disregard much of a candidate's academic work. The ''zach\u00f2t'' notation would complicate such calculation, and the final thesis qualifying mark is usually considered as the final result. Students who have shown exceptional academic talent by getting ''5'''s in most of their courses are awarded a 'degree with excellence', which comes in a special red cover.<ref name=\"xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai\"/>\n\n=== Serbia ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Serbia}}\n\n[[Serbia]] has the same academic grading system of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Former Yugoslavia]].

Since decimal scores are common, a scale from 0 to 100 is often used to remove the decimal point.\n\nIn some universities, students who fail a subject have the option of taking an extraordinary test (''examen extraordinario'', often shortened to ''extra'') that evaluates the contents of the entire period. Once the test is finished and the score is assessed, this score becomes the entire subject's score, thus giving failing students a chance to pass their subjects. Those who fail the extraordinary test have two more chances to take it; if the last test is failed, the subject is marked as failed and pending, and depending on the school, the student may fail the entire year.\n\nSome private schools (particularly in higher levels of education) require a 70 to pass instead of the regular 60.\n\nGrades are often absolute and not class-specific. It may be the case that the top of the class gets a final grade of 79. Curve-adjustment is rare. Grad-level students are usually expected to have grades of 80 or above to graduate. Students in the honor roll are usually those with an overall GPA of 90 or higher upon graduation, and some private universities will award them a \"With Honors\" diploma. Additionally, in some private universities, the pass scores is higher or lower depending from the kind of studies that are related with (for example, in some universities, in the case of Engineering, the minimum score is 7.3 and for Art Sciences is 8.8) and lower than this score is not acceptable.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in the United States}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe most popular and commonly used grading system in the United States uses discrete evaluation in the form of letter grades. Many schools use a GPA (grade-point average) system in combination with letter grades. There are also many other systems in place. Some schools use a scale of 100 instead of letter grades. Others, including many [[Montessori]] schools, eschew discrete evaluation in favor of pure discursive evaluation. There is no standardized system of grading in the United States. As such, those issues are left up to individual universities, schools and the regulatory authority of the individual states.\n\nAt most schools, colleges and universities in the United States, letter grades follow a five-point system, using the letters A, B, C, D and E/F, with A indicating excellent, C indicating average and F indicating failing. Additionally, most schools calculate a student's grade point average (GPA) by assigning each letter grade a number and averaging those numerical values. Generally, American schools equate an A with a numerical value of 4.0. Most graduate schools require a 3.0 (B) average to take a degree, with C or C\u2212 being the lowest grade for course credit. Most undergraduate schools require a 2.0, or C average<!-- Hoping they mean 2.0 average... --> to obtain a degree with a minimum of D or D\u2212 to pass a course. For most secondary schools, the minimum overall and course passes are both D or D\u2212. Some districts, such as [[Mount Olive Township School District]] in [[New Jersey]], have eliminated D as a passing grade for their students due to a high failure rate.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130216706 At Some N.J. Schools, D No Longer Counts As Passing], [[NPR]].

The most common grading scales for normal courses and honors/[[Advanced Placement]] courses are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | \"Normal\" courses\n! colspan=\"2\" | Honors/AP courses\n|-\n!Grade\n!Percentage\n!GPA\n!Percentage\n!GPA\n|-\n!

Around the time of [[World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], several states{{Which|date=November 2010}} began to use E, while the majority of the country continued to use the F, which traces to the days of Pass/Fail grading (P and F). In recent years, some schools have begun using an N for failing grades, presumably to represent \"No Credit\". Another letter used to represent a failing grade is U, representing \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\nChromatic variants (\"+\" and \" \u2212 \") are used. In most 100-point grading systems, the letter grade without variants is centered around a value ending in five. The \"plus\" variant is then assigned the values near the nine digit and the \"minus\" variant is assigned the values near zero. Any decimal values are usually rounded. Thus, a score of 80 to 82 is a B\u2212, a score 83 to 87 is a B and a score of 87 to 89 is a B+. The four-point GPA scale, the letter grade without variants is assigned to the integer. The \"plus\" and \"minus\" variants are then assigned to .3 above the integer and .3 below the integer, respectively. Thus, a B is equal to 3.0, a B+ is equal to 3.3, and a B\u2212 is equal to 2.7.<ref>[http://studentspreunited.com/page/GPA4pointcalculator GPA Calculator], Studentspreunited.com. Accessed 12 November 2011.</ref>\n\nThe A range is often treated as a special case. In most American schools, a 4.00 is regarded as perfect and the highest GPA one can achieve. Thus, an A, being the prime grade, achieves the mark of a 4.00; for the A+ mark, most schools still assign a value of 4.00, equivalent to the A mark, to prevent deviation from the standard 4.00 GPA system. However, the A+ mark, then, becomes a mark of distinction that has no impact on the student's GPA. A few schools, however, do assign grade values of 4.33 or 4.30; but the ''scale'' is still called \"4.0\", because grading scales (or \"quality indices\") take their numerical names from the highest ''whole'' number.\n\nIn many American [[high school]]s, students may also score above 4.0 if taking advanced, honors, [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]], or [[International Baccalaureate]] classes (for example, a \"regular\" A would be worth four points, but an A earned in an advanced class might be worth 4.5 or 5 points towards the GPA.).<ref>[http://studentspreunited.com/page/highschoolgpa High School GPA Calculator], Studentpreunited.com. Accessed 12 November 2011.</ref> This is called a weighted GPA and is designed to reward students for taking more advanced courses. Although weighting GPAs is a widespread practice in the United States, there is little research into whether weighted GPAs are better than unweighted GPAs. In one study, weighted GPAs were not suitable for predicting any college outcomes, but unweighted GPA were strong predictors of college GPA.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Nagaishi|first2=Chanel|last3=Slade|first3=Michael K.|last4=Hermesmeyer|first4=Paul|last5=Peck|first5=Elizabeth Kimberli|title=Comparing weighted and unweighted grade point averages in predicting college success of diverse and low-income college students|journal=NASSP Bulletin|volume=98|issue=4|pages=261\u2013279|doi=10.1177/0192636514565171|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nThere has been dispute{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} over how colleges should look at grades from previous schools and high schools because one grade in one part of the country might not be the equivalent of a grade in another part of the country. In other words, an \"A\" might be 90\u2013100 somewhere, and a 94\u2013100 somewhere else. In middle and high schools that do not use a system based on [[academic credit]], the grade point average is computed by taking the mean of all grades. In colleges and universities that use discrete evaluation, the grade-point average is calculated by multiplying the quantitative values by the credit value of the correlative course, and then dividing the total by the sum of all credits.\n\nFor example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Class'''\n| '''Credits'''\n| '''Grade'''\n| '''Grade Points'''\n|-\n| ''Speech 101''\n| 3\n| A\n| 3 \u00d7 4.0 = 12.0\n|-\n| ''Biology 102''\n| 4\n| B+\n| 4 \u00d7 3.3 = 13.2\n|-\n| ''History 157''\n| 3\n| B\u2212\n| 3 \u00d7 2.7 = 8.1\n|-\n| ''Physical Education 104''\n| 1\n| C\n| 1 \u00d7 2.0 = 2.0\n|}\n\n* Total Credits: 11\n* Total Grade Points: 35.3\n* Grade Point Average: 35.3 / 11 = 3.209 or slightly below B+\n\nIn a standards-based grading system, a performance standard is set by a committee based on ranking anchor papers and grading rubrics, which demonstrate performance which is below, meeting, or exceeding the \"standard.\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This standard is intended to be a high, world-class level of performance, which must be met by every student regardless of ability or class, although they are actually set by a committee with no reference to any other national standard{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Levels are generally assigned numbers between zero and four. Writing papers may be graded separately on content (discussion) and conventions ([[spelling]] and [[grammar]]). Since grading is not based on a curve distribution, it is entirely possible to achieve a grading distribution in which all students pass and meet the standard. While such grading is generally used only for assessments, they have been proposed for alignment with classroom grading. However, in practice, grading can be much more severe than traditional letter grades. Even after ten years, some states, such as [[Washington (state)|Washington]], continue to evaluate over half of their students as \"below standard\" on the state mathematics assessment.\n\nHere is another example of a commonly used grading scale, currently in place at [[Wayzata High School]] in Plymouth, Minnesota. The Grade Point Average is not the traditional four-point scale, but uses the 12-point scale for unweighted classes and the 15-point scale for weighted classes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade\n!Percentage\n|-\n!A+\n| 96.50\u2013100.00\n|-\n!A\n| 92.50\u201396.49\n|-\n!A\u2212\n| 89.50\u201392.49\n|-\n!B+\n| 86.50\u201389.49\n|-\n!B\n| 82.50\u201386.49\n|-\n!B\u2212\n| 79.50\u201382.49\n|-\n!C+\n| 76.50\u201379.49\n|-\n!C\n| 72.50\u201376.49\n|-\n!C\u2212\n| 69.50\u201372.49\n|-\n!D+\n| 66.50\u201369.49\n|-\n!D\n| 62.50\u201366.49\n|-\n!D\u2212\n| 59.50\u201362.49\n|-\n!F\n| 0.00\u201359.49\n|}\n\nThe 12-point GPA scale works as follows. Students receive 12 points for an A or A+, 11 points for an A\u2212, 10 points for a B+, etc. for each grading period. Once a grading period is complete, the student's total grade points are divided by the total number of credits and a GPA is generated.\n\nFor example, here is one term of grades and a grade point average from a student whose school uses the 86-minute block schedule (such as Wayzata High School):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Math 4X (1 credit)\n| 95.06/A = 12 Grade Points\n|-\n!Chemistry X (1 credit)\n| 87.39/B+ = 10 Grade Points\n|-\n!Symphonic Band (1 credit)\n| 99.76/A+ = 12 Grade Points\n|-\n!AP United States History (1 credit)\n| 92.57/A\u2212 = 11 Grade Points\n|-\n!Total\n| 45 Grade Points/4 Credits = 11.25 GPA (Slightly better than A\u2212, equivalent to 3.75)\n|}\n\n==== Standards-based grading ====\nStandards-based grading is a well-known practice of assessment. It provides students with learning expectations and an in depth way of evaluation students.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Benefits of Standards-Based Grading: A Critical Evaluation of Modern Grading Practices.|last = Iamarino|first = D.L.|date = 2014|journal = Current Issues in Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> It is not the most common assessment method but it provides students with developmental feedback. Researchers have determined that students who were previously exposed to standards-based grading reflected higher performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Assessing the impact of \"Standards-Based\" Middle Grades Mathematics Curriculum materials on Student Achievement.|last = Reys|first = R.|date = 2003|journal = Google Scholar|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\n==== Alternative grading methods ====\nAlternative grading methods over a diverse way of assessing student progress. Recent studies reveal that alternative grading methods may lead to more applicable growth opportunities for students' overtime. These methods can include portfolios, narrative evaluations, contract grading, developmental meetings and verbal feedback. These methods provide insight to evaluation methods and emphasize student progress and improvement.<ref name=\"Busuladzic\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Case Study at a Waldorf School.|last = Busuladzic|first = E.|date = 2010|journal = Google Scholar|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> Some alternative grading methods include contract grading, the Waldorf assessment style, and narrative evaluation.\n\n[[Contract grading]] emphasizes learning behaviors. Most students are accepting of contract grading; however, the data shows that less than half of students noted they found it helpful and less stressful than letter grades. Most students that dislike this method were advanced students and found the process to be repetitive.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Simple Alternative to Grading|last = Potts|first = G.|date = 2010|journal = The Journal of Virginia Community Colleges|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] assessment style consists of developmental meetings and an evaluation letter. Waldorf grading methods focused more on what they were learning rather than how well each student applied it.<ref name=\"Busuladzic\" /> It emphasizes positive feedback and progress. Some people may label it as unstructured, others may describe it as a personalized and relaxed style of learning and assessment.  Waldorf philosophy strongly reiterates the growth and improvement of the students.\n\n[[Narrative evaluation]] can be defined as detailed written feedback. Studies show that over half of students really like narrative evaluation.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = High School Students' Perceptions of Narrative Evaluations as Summative Assessment|last = Bagley|first = S|date = 2008|journal = American Secondary Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> It focuses on improvement and provides personal detail of how students have grown. It allows for more personalized feedback and eliminates the competitive nature of students to compare themselves to their classmates.\n\n== Oceania ==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Australia}}\n\nBoth [[NAPLAN]] and final year secondary school gradings are specified in \"Bands\", approximately as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 90\u2013100 Marks || Band 6/Exemplary \n|-\n| 80-89 || Band 5\n|-\n| 70-79 || Band 4\n|-\n| 60-69 || Band 3\n|-\n| 50-59 || Band 2\n|-\n| 0-49 || Band 1\n|}\n\nDuring the final year of high school, Extension subjects, such as Mathematics (Extension 1) and Mathematics (Extension 2), are marked out of fifty, rather than the normal 100 marks, and thus, have slightly different criteria:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 45\u201350 Marks || Band E4 \n|-\n| 35-44 || Band E3\n|-\n| 25-34 || Band E2\n|-\n| 0-24 || Band E1\n|}\n\nThe majority of Australian tertiary institutions use the following grading structure:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-F\n! style=\"width:90px;\"|HD\n| 85% and above (High Distinction)\n|-\n! D\n| 75\u201384%  (Distinction)\n|-\n! Cr\n| 65\u201374% (Credit)\n|-\n! P\n| 50\u201364%  (Pass)\n|-\n! F\n| 49% and under (Fail)\n|}\n\nSome other Australian universities have a marking system similar to the Honours system used by British universities:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:90px;\"|H1\n| 80% and above (First Class Honours)\n|-\n! H2A\n| 75\u201379%  (Second Class Honours (A Division))\n|-\n! H2B\n| 70\u201374% (Second Class Honours (B Division))\n|-\n! H3\n| 65\u201369%  (Third Class Honours)\n|-\n! P\n| 50\u201364% (Pass)\n|-\n! N\n| below 50% (Fail)\n|}\n\nMany courses also have Non-Graded Pass (NGP) and Non-Graded Fail (NGF), in which it is considered more appropriate to have qualitative than quantitative assessment. However, in some universities, an F1 category may be given a 'Pass Conceded' if the student's Weighted Average is greater than a nominated threshold. (More often than not, this is around the 53\u201355 range.)\n\nGrade-point averages are not generally used in Australia below a tertiary level, but are important for selection into graduate entry courses such as Medicine and Law. They are calculated according to more complicated formula than some other nations, and may be customised for the particular course application when used as entry criteria into graduate entry degrees:\n\nGrade Point Average (GPA) = Sum of (grade points \u00d7 course unit values) / total number of credit points attempted, in which grade points are as follows:\n\n* High Distinction = 7\n* Distinction = 6\n* Credit = 5\n* Pass = 4\n* Fail level 1 = 1\n* Fail level 2 = 0\n\nAt some universities, among them [[Macquarie University]], [[University of Technology, Sydney]], [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (RMIT)<ref>[http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/Current%20students%2FAdministration%2FResults%2FGPA%20-%20Grade%20point%20average/ GPA \u2013 Grade point average]. RMIT. Retrieved on 28 September 2011.</ref> and [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, a GPA is calculated, with 4.0 being a High Distinction; 3.0 a Distinction, 2.0 a Credit, and 1.0 a pass. In certain faculties, such as law, it is therefore possible to graduate with \"honours\" with a GPA of less than 2.5. Whenever a course result is a Non-Graded Pass, the result will normally be disregarded in GPA calculations.\n\nThe term ''course unit values'' is used to distinguish between courses which have different weightings e.g. between a full year course and a single semester course.\n\nThe grading of secondary school graduates varies from state to state, but in most states the [[ATAR]] (Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank) system determines which students are offered positions in tertiary courses. Government Supported Positions are offered to applicants for a course who are ranked above a particular ATAR threshold, which commonly varies from course to course, institution to institution, and year to year. (An example of this is an ATAR of 85 for Civil Engineering at the [[University of New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uac.edu.au/pdf/2007_uai_coffs_csp_main.pdf |accessdate=May 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414054002/http://www.uac.edu.au/pdf/2007_uai_coffs_csp_main.pdf |archivedate=April 14, 2008 }}</ref>) A student's ATAR signifies that student's rank relative to their year 7 [[Cohort (educational group)|cohort]], including students that did not complete year 12. A student with an ATAR of 80.00, for example, has performed, in their final year of secondary schooling, better than 80 percent of that student's year 7 cohort, had all those year 7 students completed year 12 and been eligible for an ATAR.\n\nOn the other hand, graduating Year 12 students in [[Queensland]] are given an Overall Position (OP) from 1 to 25, with 1 being the highest band. OPs are calculated from a student's grades in their year 12 (and in some cases, year 11) courses, and also from Student Achievement Indicators (SAIs) which are allocated by the student's teachers.<ref>https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/630.html</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in New Zealand}}\nMost New Zealand secondary schools use the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (NCEA) marking schedule, even in pre-NCEA years for commonality. There are four grades, from lowest to highest, Not Achieved (N/A or N), Achieved (A), Achieved with Merit (M), and Achieved with Excellence (E). These can also be marked at certain levels for junior exams and general assignments as well as exams once the student has started NCEA. The grading for these specific marks are as follows, Not Achieved minus (N/A1 or N1), Not Achieved plus (N/A2 or N1), Achieved (A3), Achieved plus (A4), Merit (M5), Merit plus (M6), Excellence (E7) and Excellence plus (E8). It is possible to get an achieved, merit or excellence minus, but would be marked as the first number used for the grade. The difference between an achieved plus and merit minus is simply if the student has applied all of the achieved requirements but not enough merit requirements or has applied all of the achieved requirements and just enough merit requirements to reach merit. However, these grades are often check marked if that is the case and regardless of whether the student got a merit minus or straight merit, they will be rewarded with merit level credits for the assessment. The minority of schools using other secondary school qualifications (usually CIE or IB) have different grades. Grading at tertiary institutions generally centers around a letter scale, with a corresponding nine-point GPA scale (C\u2212=1, A+=9).\n\n== South America ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\nIn Argentina the [[Grade Point Average|GPA]] is calculated quarterly, each semester, or annually. Grades usually range from 1 to 10. The passing mark is typically 70% or around two thirds, which in secondary school is represented by a grade of 7.\n\nDepending on the university, admittance may require:\n\n* Completion of secondary school.\n* A [http://www.cbc.uba.ar/ common basic year] to all degrees or an entrance exam for some of the more popular degree programs.\n\nUniversity grades are also on a scale of 1 to 10, but a passing mark is represented by 4, which usually corresponds to a mark of 70-75%, or higher.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n\nIn Brazil the GPA \u2013 known as ''Coeficiente de Rendimento'', or ''\u00cdndice de Rendimento Acad\u00eamico'' \u2013 is calculated per semester or per year or both. The High School GPA is almost never used for college entrance evaluation in public universities (state funded and free of charge). To enter state colleges, Brazilian students must attend to entrance exams called ''vestibulares''. The most famous ones are ''FUVEST'', the entrance exam for University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and ''ENEM'', a national exam that ranks high school students to be accepted by federal funded colleges. The private colleges system also apply entrance exams, but some might use the GPA as an evaluation method.\nDuring college, the GPA is calculated as a weighted average of grade and course hours and have a bigger importance than in the high school as it determines priority in receiving scholarships, for example.\n\nThe majority of schools adopt a 0.00 (worst) to 10.00 (best) scale for grading, and some of the Brazilian schools adopt the following grading system:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:90px;\"|A (Excellent)\n| 8.1\u201310\n|-\n! B (Very Good)\n| 6.1\u20138.0\n|-\n! C (Good)\n| 4.1\u20136.0\n|-\n! D (Unsatisfactory)\n| 2.1\u2013 4.0\n|-\n! E (Fail)\n| 0\u20132.0\n|}\n\nA grade below 4.0 is surely a fail, although some schools have passing criteria of 6.0 to 7.0, as 60% to 70%.\n\n=== Chile ===\n\nGrades are assigned with a numeric scale from 1.0 to 7.0, including at least one decimal, with 4.0 as the lowest passing grade (equivalent to either 50%, 60% or even 70%, depending on the teacher). Everything under a 4.0 is considered a \"red mark,\" which equates to failing. For the PSU, ''Prueba de Selecci\u00f3n Universitaria'' (UST, University Selection Test), the scale goes from 150 to 850 points. The points follow a normal distribution, being 500 the average result. Depending on the university and the major, the student will need a minimum score to get accepted. The final score will depend on the points obtained in each test: Mathematics and Linguistics (both mandatory); Natural Sciences and History (only one of them mandatory) and the NEM score, ''Notas de Ense\u00f1anza Media'' (High School Grades which is the same as GPA) converted into the PSU Scale.\n\nNumerical system from 1,0 to 7,0:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Numerical system\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|US Letter grades\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 6,9 - 7,0 || A\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 6,5 - 6,8 || A-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 5,9 - 6,4 || B+\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 5,4 - 5,8 || B\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 5,0 - 5,3 || B-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4,4 - 4,9 || C+\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4,0 - 4,3 || C\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 3,9 - 3,5 || C-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 3,4 - 2,4 || D\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| \u2264 2,3 || F\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Colombia ===\n\nThe most used grading systems are the numerical from 0 to 5 or from 0 to 10 and commonly is approved with 3 or 6, respectively. The letter system consist of E, S, A, I, D and is approved with A. The letter system is based on the numerical, meaning that the numerical system guides the letter one. While the universities only use the numerical system, with 3.0 being the passing grade, because it is more complex and students have more difficulty in approving a course.

The minimum grade required to pass a year is 7, depending on how schools are organized. Since 2012 enjoy complete autonomy in Ecuador, so that some establishments maintain supplementary examination for those with less than 7, and other approved intensive recovery, but if the grade obtained is lower than 5, students are automatically disqualified and disciplinary actions are taken. If a student got 10 out of 10 in 90% of subjects in the first period, he is promoted to a senior year, after taking an entrance examination. Notes and academic qualifications and groups them reasoning thus:\n\n* 10\u20139.5 = Rated Excellent (A)\n* 9.4\u20139.0 = Rated Outstanding (B)\n* 8.9\u20138.0 = very good credit rating (C)\n* 7.9\u20136.5 = Rating Sufficient or Good Sufficient (D)\n* 6.4\u20135.1 = Fail failing grade with Recovery option or supplementary examination (E)\n* 5.0\u20131.0 = Fail automatically (F)\n\nThis system is still applied to universities, being the \"Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas - ESPE\" the only exception, as they do not allow their students to take supplementary exams after every course.\n\n=== Paraguay ===\n\nThe grades vary from 1 to 5, where 5 is the maximum grade achievable and 1 the lowest. The minimum for pass is 2 (equivalent to 60%).\n\n* 5: Excellent\n* 4: Very Good\n* 3: Good\n* 2: Acceptable\n* 1: Fail\n\n=== Peru ===\n\nGrades range from 0 to 20, in an almost unique grading table. The passing grade is 11 in most schools and universities. In some preschool facilities, grades usually range from F to A+, following the American system, and in a few colleges, the passing grade is 10.\n\nFor most Peruvian universities the grading system is as follows:<ref>https://www.foreigncredits.com/Resources/GPA-Calculator/Peru</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icpna.edu.pe/education-usa/education-usa/asesoria-educational/educational-and-grading-system-peru/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613212534/http://www.icpna.edu.pe/education-usa/education-usa/asesoria-educational/educational-and-grading-system-peru/ |archive-date=2017-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Numerical system\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Description\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|US Letter grades\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 14.00\u201320.00 || ''Excelente'' || A\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 11.99\u201313.99 || ''Muy bueno'' || B\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 11.00\u201311.99|| ''Aprobado'' || C\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 10.00\u201310.99 || ''Aplazado'' || D\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 0.00\u20139.99 || ''Desaprobado'' || F\n|-\n|}\n\nFrom 2017, Peru will adopt a new evaluation system.

In  primary school, grades range in this order:\n\n*S (Sobresaliente) \u2013 Outstanding, highest grade. Also commonly called \"sote\".\n*SMB (Sobresaliente Muy Bueno) \u2013 Excellent\n*MBS (Muy Bueno Sobresaliente) \u2013 Very good, almost excellent\n*MB (Muy Bueno) \u2013 Very good\n*MBB (Muy Bueno Bueno) \u2013 Good, almost very good\n*BMB (Bueno Muy Bueno) \u2013 Good\n*B (Bueno) \u2013 Approved\n*BR (Bueno Regular) \u2013 Not approved\n*RB (Regular Bueno) \u2013 Requires much more work\n*R (Regular) \u2013 Very bad job, lowest grade\n\nIn secondary school, grades range from 1 to 12. 1 is the lowest and 12 is the highest. Passing an exam or course requires 6 out of 12 in high school or at a private university (although some subjects in secondary school require a grade of 7 or 8 to pass), and 3 out of 12 at a public university. In high school a 6 corresponds to 50% on an exam or in a course while in a public university, a 3 corresponds to a 60% in a course or exam. Grades of 10, 11, and 12 are considered excellent. Some private universities grade their students on a percentage basis, generally setting the passing benchmark between 60% and 70%.\n\nBecause of the acronym of the word \"Sobresaliente\" (Ste.) it is usual to pronounce it as \"Sote\".\n\n=== Venezuela ===\n\nGrades in Venezuela may vary according to the education level, but normally the grading system is numerical, and ranges from 00 to 20, 00 being the lowest and 20 being the highest, and 10 being the pass mark, equivalent to a \"D\" in the United States. This system is not required, however, and several schools in Venezuela deviate from it by following a letter-grade system similar or identical to those in the United States.\n\nShown here is the Venezuelan grading system in probable comparison with the United States grading system:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In addition, grading  scales at university level institutions have changed frequently. Grading scales  can be 1 to 7, 1 to 5, or A through F, where A is on a 4.0 scale or on a 5.0  scale. The most common scale is now 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest grade obtained.   In addition, degrees are awarded in a Class, depending on the grades  received. Degrees may be awarded in the First Class, Second Class (Upper  Division), Second Class (Lower Division), Third Class and Pass  Class. Grading scales for secondary certificates are standard. Below is the grading system of Nigerian universities:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Percentage\n!Grade\n!Description\n|-\n|70 - 100%\n|A\n|First class\n|-\n|60 - 69%\n|B\n|Second class, Upper Division\n|-\n|50 - 59%\n|C\n|Second Class, Lower Division\n|-\n|45 - 49%\n|D\n|Third Class\n|-\n|40 - 44%\n|E\n|Pass\n|-\n|0 - 39%\n|F\n|Fail\n|}\n\n=== South Africa ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in South Africa}}\n\nMost universities follow a model based on the British system. Thus, at the University of Cape Town and the University of South Africa (UNISA), the percentages are calibrated as follows: a 1st class pass is given for 75% and above, a second (division one) for 70 - 74%, a second (division two) for 60% - 69%, and a third for 50 - 59%. Any lower than 40% is a fail. The University of the Witwatersrand considers an A to be 75% and above.\n\n===Tanzania===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Percentage !! Grade !!

Most schools use a 0\u201320 scale where the passing grade is 10 out of 20 (Minimum passing grade may be as low as 7). It depends on the programme the school is offering: if French/Lebanese Baccalaureate the 0-20 scale is used with some exceptions (Some schools offer the Lebanese baccalaureate but instead of the 0-20 scale a 100-point scale is used) IB schools unanimously use a 100-point scale if not an American grading scale (Refer to the American grading system).\n\nIn the typical school offering a Lebanese curriculum (to which the outcome is a Lebanese Baccalaureate) getting high grades is very hard because teachers do not use the full scale. For instance the highest score one can earn in essay writing in some schools is 14 out of 20 (with the class averaging 9 or 10). Each subject has a weight and thus contributes differently towards the overall score: the \"General Average\" (Taken from the French Moyenne G\u00e9n\u00e9rale). This weight is determined by the credit hours. For instance math (6hours/week) x 20 (the base grade) = 120 (weight)\nExample: Sample grades: (Maths 13.33/20, English 13.4/20, Biology 8.25/20)\n\nEnglish: 5 credits \u00d7 13.4 = 67 out of possible 100\n\nMath: 6 credits \u00d7 13.33 = 79.98 out of possible 120\n\nBiology: 2 credits \u00d7 8.25 = 16.5 out of possible 40\n\n'''Total points earned = 163.48 out of possible 260'''\n\n'''General Average / Moyenne G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  12.575'''\n(Considered a good average, a B+ if not A- US Equivalent since the standards are different: Grade 12 in Lebanese Baccalaureate or French Baccalaureate is equivalent to a US College Freshman, moreover all Lebanese programmes include 3 Languages and a total of 18 subjects yearly with summer homework)\nStudents Graduating Lebanese or French Bacc. enter universities as sophomores not freshmen and can complete their degrees in 3 years.\n\nU.S. Equivalence <br />\nScale / U.S. Grade Equiv.<br />\n14\u201320 / A+<br />\n13\u201313.9 / A<br />\n11\u201312.9 / B+<br />\n10\u201310.9 / B<br />\n9.5\u20139.9 / B\u2212<br />\n9.1\u20139.4 / C+<br />\n9 / C<br />\n8\u20138.9 / C\u2212<br />\n6.5\u20137.9 / D<br />\nBelow 6 / F\n\nIn some universities the American grading system is used. Others use the 0\u2013100 scale where the passing grade is 60 or 70 depending on the course. French system universities use the 0\u201320 grading scale.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n\nMalaysia has its own educational grading system. Different level and institution of education uses different grading scheme.

A percentage above 65% is referred as 1st Division and indicates high intellectual level. Some universities follow weighted average pattern to calculate percentage:\n1st and 2nd Semester \u2013 40% of the aggregate marks,\n3rd and 4th Semester \u2013 60% of the aggregate marks,\n5th and 6th Semester \u2013 80% of the aggregate marks,\n7th and 8th Semester \u2013 100% of the aggregate marks.\nThe 10-point GPA is categorized as follows: 10\u20139.1 (O ( out of standing ) or A+) \u2013 Best, 9\u20138.1 (A) \u2013 Excellent, 8\u20137.1 (B+) \u2013 exceptionally good, 7\u20136.1 (B) \u2013 very good, 6\u20135.1 (C+) \u2013 good, 5\u20134.1 (C) \u2013 average, 4\u20133.1 (D+) \u2013 fair, 3.1\u20132 (D) \u2013 Pass, 2\u20130 (E+\u2013E) \u2013 fail.

The grading is managed by the Ministry of Education ([http://www.moe.gov.ae/english/pages/default.aspx MOE]). However, there are also many schools run by expatriates that are equally successful with their own grading system, or an accepted grading system of the country where the schools are affiliated to or share common standards with. At most universities and colleges, the United Arab Emirates' grading system is very similar to the United States' system.\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Vietnam}}\n\nThe grade scale in Vietnam is from 10 to 1 where 10 is the highest, as follows.\n\n*10 - Outstanding\n*9 - Very good\n*8 - Good\n*7 - Acceptable\n*5-6 - Satisfactory\n*2-4 - Insufficient\n*1 - Fail\n\nSchools and universities in Vietnam use a 10-point grading scale, with 10 being the highest and 0 being the lowest, as follows.\n*8-10 - Distinction\n*6.5-8 - Good\n*5-6.5 - Intermediate\n*3.5-5 - Insufficient\n*Lower than 3.5 - Fail\nThe grading may vary from school to school. It depends on the difficulty of each.\n\nThe distribution of grades differs from standards in Western countries and strongly depends on the university. In Vietnamese universities, a ten or nine is nearly impossible. Students hardly get more than 8.0 of the final results.\n\n== Central America ==\n\n=== Costa Rica ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Costa Rica}}\n\n=== Nicaragua ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Nicaragua}}\n\n=== Panama ===\n\nGrading system in Panama is different from universities than schools.\n\nUniversities use 0\u2013100 point grade scaling similar to the United States grading. 71 is required to pass or the same as a C. While schools use the 1\u20135 point system. meaning if a student has a 4.5 that is the equivalent of an A- or somewhere around the 95 point range.\n\nWhen it comes to the GPA Scale though, Panama uses 0\u20133 point scale to determine the student's GPA. So if a student has a 2.5 that is roughly the same as a U.S. student having a 3.0\u20133.5.\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== Albania ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date= May 2017}}\nIn [[Albania]], grades from 4 to 10 are used, with some schools allowing decimals (up to the hundredth digit) and some others only allowing whole numbers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Grade\n!Qualification\n|-\n|9.00\u201310.00\n| Excellent\n|-\n|8.00\u20138.99\n| Very good\n|-\n|7.00\u20137.99\n| Good\n|-\n|6.00\u20136.99\n| Satisfactory\n|-\n|5.00\u20135.99\n| Sufficient\n|-\n|1.00\u20134.99\n| Insufficient\n|}\n\nMost universities evaluate classes with two mid exams and a final. The [[final exam]] encompasses the whole course syllabus, whereas the mid exams usually review half. In some schools, if the average grade of the two mid exams is equal to or higher than 7.00, the student is able to pass the class without the need to take a final exam (since there are only two exams, some teachers also pass students who average 6.50; others weigh in the decision based on the student's performance in class). An average of less than 4.00 is failing; students who score such an average are not allowed to take the final exam.\n\nIn high schools, the year is divided into three trimesters and classes are usually yearlong. Students need an average of 6.00 or higher in the three trimestral exams to avoid having to take a final to pass the class. In the event of a student scoring less than 6.00 in the third trimester, he or she would have to take a final exam, regardless of average. This is considered controversial, since the last trimestral exam is not more important than the first two, but the rule stands to prevent students who have already reached the minimum average (e.g., two 10.00 in the first two give a student the lowest possible average of 6.33) from not making an effort during the last three months of the year. The university lasts 3\u20135 years.\n\n=== Austria ===\n\nIn Austria, grades from 1 to 5 are used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade\n! Percentage\n!

A total average of around 14 (70%) gets you a distinction grade (cum laude), around 16 (80%) means high distinction (magna cum laude) and an average of around 18 (90%) yields the highest distinction (summa/maxima cum laude). The exact scores for each grade differ between different universities.<ref>https://admin.kuleuven.be/rd/interuniversitaire_opl_examenregl.html</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/helpdesk/rechten/knowledgebase.php?article=133 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235557/http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/helpdesk/rechten/knowledgebase.php?article=133 |archive-date=2018-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBelgian secondary schools use a scale from 0 to 100 or even above for exams (50 usually being the passing grade). On report cards, certain schools also give grades on a percentage scale (0 to 100) while others use a 0\u201310 scale. Those total scores are weighted averages of exams and tests.\nIn Belgian secondary schools, there are 6 years. In the first three years, students have to do exams every term. The scores are usually given in percentages. On the end of the school year, a total average score is given.\n\nUniversity colleges (other form of higher education, not comparable with American colleges) use the same scale from 0 to 20 as Belgian universities, although homework and presence may influence sometimes up to 50% or even more of these 20 points (situation {{As of|2011|02|lc=yes}}). It is more common to have a final exam counting for 100% of the grade if the course does not require laboratory work. Obtaining a grade higher than 16/20 is considered as a very good grade and a 19 or 20/20 is very rare.\n\nScaling varies significantly depending on the university or college.\n\n=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===\n{{main|Academic grading in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\nIn [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], grades from 5 to 1 are used in primary and secondary education, while grades from 10 to 5 are used at universities.\n\nPrimary and secondary education grading:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Every passing grade at or above the .50 mark is prefixed with the term of the higher grade. The minimum is 2.00; grades below 3.00 are failing grades, and the maximum is 6.00. Grades like \"Very good\" (5-) and \"Average\" (3+) are also possible - these are ignored in calculations.\n\nRoughly, the Bulgarian grade system can be equated to the American one as the following: 6=A, 5=B, 4=C, 3=D, and 2=F. Also, in accordance with the Australian system, 6=HD, 5=D, 4=Cr, 3=P, and 2=F.\n\nThe most common formula used in Bulgarian schools is currently Grade=(6* number of correct answers)/ total number of questions.\nThat way if a student has answered 7 out of 10 questions correctly, their mark should be: (6*7)/10=4.20, which is graded as Good 4 or an average performance.\n\n=== Croatia ===\n{{main|Academic grading in Croatia}}\n\nIn [[Croatia]], the following grade scale is used in schools:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| 5\n| ''Odli\u010dan'' or ''Izvrstan'' || ''Excellent'', best possible grade A\n|-\n! 4\n| ''Vrlo dobar'' || ''Very good'', next highest B\n|-\n! 3\n| ''Dobar'' || ''Good'', indicates average performance C\n|-\n! 2\n| ''Dovoljan'' || ''Sufficient'', lowest passing grade D\n|-\n! 1\n| ''Nedovoljan'' || ''Insufficient'', failing grade F\n|}\n\nAt the end of each semester the grades are averaged to form a Grade Point Average (''prosje\u010dna ocjena''), according to this scale:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20px;\"| 5.00\u20134.50\n| ''Odli\u010dan'' or ''Izvrstan'' || ''Excellent'', best possible grade A\n|-\n! 4.49\u20133.50\n| ''Vrlo dobar'' || ''Very good'', next highest B\n|-\n! 3.49\u20132.50\n| ''Dobar'' || ''Good'', indicates average performance C\n|-\n! 2.49\u20131.50\n| ''Dovoljan'' || ''Sufficient'', lowest passing grade D\n|-\n! 1.49\u20131.0\n| ''Nedovoljan'' || ''Insufficient'', failing grade F\n|}\n\nIn colloquial Croatian, grades are referred to be their numerical values: ''jedinica'', ''dvojka'', ''trojka'', ''\u010detvorka'', ''petica''.\nStudents with failing grades (1 or F) are allowed to carry those grades throughout the school year, but are required to improve them to passing grades (2 or better) in order to finish the year. Failure to pass one class results in the student being held back a year.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]], a five-point grading scale is used in both primary and secondary schools:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

U.S. 'E/F' equivalent.\n|}\n\nPlus and minus signs are often used to further differentiate marks. For example, \"2+\" corresponds to the U.S. 'B+'. Half-intervals may also be used, such as \"2\u20133\", a grade halfway between 2 and 3.\n\nAt the university level, only grades 1, 2 and 3 are passing; anything worse than 3 is automatically a failing grade. Some universities use a six-point scale, with 'A' corresponding to \"1\", 'B' to \"1\u20132\", etc.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n{{main|Academic grading in Denmark}}\n\nThe current scale, ''syv-trins-skalaen'' (\"The 7-step-scale\"), was introduced in 2007, replacing the old ''13-skala'' (\"13-scale\"). The new scale is designed to be compatible with the [[ECTS grading scale|ECTS-scale]].\n\n''Syv-trins-skalaen'' consists of seven different grades, ranging from 12 to \u22123, with 12 being the highest. This new scale remains an \"absolute\" scale, meaning that, proportions are not taken into consideration.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade\n! ECTS Grade\n! Description\n!

The \"school grade\" system has historically been a scale of 0 to 10, but all grades lower than 4 have been discarded. Thus, it is now divided between 4, the failing grade, and 5\u201310, the succeeding grades. [[Upper secondary school]] has same grades for courses and course exams as comprehensive school but [[matriculation examination]] grades are in Latin. Universities and vocational institutions use a scale of 0 (fail) and 1\u20135 (pass), or fail/pass. Some schools e.g. Savon Ammatti- ja Aikuisopisto, uses grading from 0 (fail) and 1-3 (pass). The professor selects which grading scheme is used; short, optional courses typically have pass/fail grades.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in France}}\n\nIn France, schools grades typically range from either 0 (worst) to 20 (best) or, sometimes, from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). A mark below the average (10 out of 20 or 5 out of 10, depending on the scale) is usually a fail.\nFor the French National High School Level ([[baccalaur\u00e9at]]), a grade of 8\u201310 typically gives the right to take an additional oral exam in order to try to improve that average to 10 and pass. A grade between 10 and 12 is a simple pass (without grade); between 12 and 14 (more rarely 13\u201314) the grade is called \"assez bien\" (rather good); 14\u201316 is called \"bien\" (good); above 16 is \"tr\u00e8s bien\" (very good).

There is one failing grade: 1 \u2013 ''el\u00e9gtelen'' (insufficient). In general, the lowest passing mark is either 50% or 60%, or one mark (point) higher. Passing grades are 2 \u2013 ''el\u00e9gs\u00e9ges'' (sufficient or pass), 3 \u2013 ''k\u00f6zepes'' (mediocre or satisfactory), 4 \u2013 ''j\u00f3'' (good) and 5 \u2013 ''jeles'' (very good). The perfect overall performance is named ''kit\u0171n\u0151'' or ''kiv\u00e1l\u00f3'' (excellent).\n\nThe bare five-point scale is used almost exclusively for final grades at all educational levels (elementary school, high school, university). During the academic year, however, teachers may use various modifiers, especially in elementary school. A comma (,) after the grade has a minus effect (\"al\u00e1\", below), and an apostrophe (\u2019) after the grade has a plus effect (\"f\u00f6l\u00e9\", above); a grade halfway between two integers is indicated by the lower and higher one separated by a solidus: 3''/''4 (\"h\u00e1romnegyed\") is equivalent to 3.5, and 4''/''5 is between 4 and 5, etc. Sometimes \"5*\", five starred (\"csillagos \u00f6t\u00f6s\") is used to indicate outstanding performance throughout the semester (only in primary school, as it would be considered childish in secondary school).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Previously, this consisted of lettered and numbered grades (A1, A2, B1, B2), with each grade separated by 5%, bar an A1 which was given for a mark over 90%. However, this was updated for the 2016/2017 Leaving Cert cycle and these letters were replaced by H (higher level), O (ordinary level) and F (foundation level).<ref>https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=scoring&s=lcepointsgrid</ref> Each grade is separated by 10%. A maximum of 6 subjects are counted, with a possible 100 points in each subject. For students sitting the higher level maths paper, an extra 25 points can be obtained by getting a grade above a H6. In practice, most students take 7 or 8 subjects and their best 6 results are counted. Each subject has 2 or 3 levels: higher, ordinary and foundation. The points are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, UCD ([[University College Dublin]]) awards letter grades and corresponding GPA values similar to the United States system, but 1, 2.1, 2.2 etc. for degrees, while TCD ([[Trinity College Dublin]]) awards all grades as 1, 2.1, 2.2 etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=sb|title=Description Of Certificate Examinations|publisher=Department of Education|accessdate=6 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nIn Italy, Primary and Mid School grades may vary from 10 (excellent) to 1 (impossible to assess), with passing being 6.\n\nWhen a professor wants to apply a more precise scale and ranking for students assessments, instead of using the full 1\u201310 scale (which would make the scale inconsistent with that of other professors), s/he may sometimes have recourse to a plethora of symbols and decimals: the range between 5 and 6 is then expressed, in ascending order, by 5+, 5\u00bd, and 6\u2212. Minimum passing is 6. As these symbols (except \u00bd) have no clear mathematical value (usually \u00b10.25), calculating end-year averages can be somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent; therefore, there has been a push since 2008 with the Gelmini reform to uniform the system to the 1\u201310 scale.<ref>[http://www.bigben.hu/page59kozepiskolaolaszorszagangol.htm High school, secondary school in Italy].

This stems from the practice that exams were traditionally given by 3 examiners. Each had to rate the student's examination performance on a 1\u201310 scale, and the final grade was the sum of the three ratings. On a 1\u201310 scale, passing is 6, so on a 1\u201330 scale the minimum passing grade is 3*6 = 18. Nowadays the form of each examination is decided by the professor{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} (number of examiners, whether written, oral, or both, etc.), but the traditional grading system remained.\n\nDegrees have an analogous point system, in which however the highest grade is 110. \nA ''[[cum laude]]'' notation (''e lode'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is used to augment the highest grade for both exams and degrees, in all its levels, to reflect truly outstanding performance.\n\n====Summary====\n*Primary and secondary school\n**10-point grading scale; highest result 10, pass result 6\n*Licenza media (commonly known as \"Terza media\")\n**10-point grading scale; highest result 10 e lode, pass result 6\n*Maturit\u00e0\n**100-point grading scale; highest result 100 e lode, pass result 60\n*University\n**Exams: 30-point grading scale; highest result 30 e lode, pass result 18 \n**Laurea (bachelor's degree) and laurea magistrale (master's degree): 110-point grading scale; highest result 110 e lode, pass result 66\n\n;Corresponding percentages\n*10: 100%\n*9: 90-99%\n*8: 80-89%\n*7: 70-79%\n*6: 60-69%\n*5 and below: 0-59%\n\n;Examples of intermediate grades\n*8-: 79%\n*8=: 76-78%\n*7\u00bd: 75%\n*7+: 71-74%\n\n===Kosovo=== \nIn Kosovo, grading is as follows:\n\n5-Shk\u00eblqyesh\u00ebm (Excellent)\n\n4-Shum\u00eb Mir\u00eb (Very Good)\n\n3-Mir\u00eb (Good)\n\n2-Mjaftuesh\u00ebm (Lowest passing grade)\n\n1-Dob\u00ebt (Failure)\n\n=== Latvia ===\n\nThe '''academic grading system in [[Latvia]]''' is using ten-point [[scale (descriptive set theory)|scale]], where \"10\" ({{lang-lv|desmit}}) is the highest achievable grade, and \"1\" ({{lang-lv|viens}}) is awarded for extremely poor performance. The minimal passing grade is \"4\" ({{lang-lv|\u010detri}}). In most universities,  to get the \"4\", you must acquire at least 50% correct on the work you hand in. Though some universities have a minimum passing grade of \"5\" ({{lang-lv|pieci}}).\n\nThe absence of any kind of performance is indicated by \"nv\" ({{lang-lv|nav v\u0113rt\u0113juma}} 'no assessment possible'); in the past, the mark for absence of work was \"0\" ({{lang-lv|nulle}}). [[Teacher]]s in lower classes and for minor [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s in higher classes are encouraged to award one of two grades: \"i\" ({{lang-lv|ieskait\u012bts}} 'counted') for a passing grade, and \"ni\" ({{lang-lv|neieskait\u012bts}} 'not counted') for a failing grade. The grade of 10 is reserved for exceptional achievements. 9 is most commonly used for a United States equivalent of an A. In some cases the grade can be rounded for example if a student got 67% the grade can sometime be rounded to a 7.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade !! Percentage !! Translation !!

This system can correspond to a percentage system (1 means 0\u20135% correct and 10 means 95\u2013100% correct) but sometimes pts are deducted for number of faults on a test (typically, on vocabulary or topographical tests with more than 10 questions, each fault will nonetheless lead to a reduction in score of one. So 2 faults on a 50 question vocabulary test would constitute an 8). The grades 9 and 10 are hardly ever given on large examinations (on average, a 9 is awarded in only 1.5%, and a 10 in 0.5% of the cases). Generally, either one or two decimal places are predominantly used in secondary and higher education. In primary education, fractions of grades are identified with a + or \u2212, which signifies a quarter (converted to either 0.8 or 0.3 if only one decimal place is used). Thus, a grade of 6.75 (or 6.8) could be written as 7\u2212, whereas a grade of 7+ would count for 7.25 or 7.3.\n\nA 5.5 constitutes a pass, whereas 5.4 and below constitute a fail. If no decimal places are used, 6 and up is a pass and 5 and below is a fail; however, in this case of grading in full numbers there exists sometimes \"6-\", which would officially translate to 5.75, but can be interpreted here as \"barely, but just good enough\". Roughly, a student scores a 5.5 (pass) when 2/3 (67%) of an exam is correct. If the grade would be a 5.49 and one decimal is used, the 5.49 will be a 5.5, but if no decimals are used (usually at the end of the year) the 5.49 will end up as a 5 which indicates a fail.\n\nDepending on the specific university, some students who finish their studies with an average of 8.0 or higher, could get the nomination ''[[Latin honors#Types|cum laude]]'' (which is comparable with ''summa cum laude'' as awarded in Germany and the United States).\n\nThe grade scale with its labels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, the teachers write an individual comment or analysis on tests and in the end of every term.\n\nLower secondary school (''Ungdomsskole''; age 13\u201316) and upper secondary school (''Videreg\u00e5ende skole''; age 16\u201319) use a scale running from 1 through 6, with 6 being the highest and 2 the lowest passing grade. It is not possible to fail a grade in Lower Secondary School, even 1 is a passing grade. For non-final tests and mid-term evaluations the grades are often post fixed with + or \u2212 (except 6+ and 1\u2212). It is also common to use grades such as 5/6 or 4/3 indicating borderline grades. However, the grades students get on their diploma (''Vitnem\u00e5l''), are single-digit grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The student's non-weighted grade point average is also given on the Vitnem\u00e5l.\n\nIn higher education, according to the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS-system]], grades for undergraduate and postgraduate examinations are awarded according to a graded scale from A (highest) to F (lowest), with E as the minimum passing grade. The ECTS system was implemented at Norway's universities and colleges in the early 2000s, with most schools having converted to ECTS by 2003.\n\nBefore 2003, the formerly most common system of grades used at university level was based on a scale running from 1.0 (highest) through 6.0 (lowest), with 4.0 being the lowest passing grade. The way the new Bologna system was introduced implies that students, who had started their studies while the old system still was in effect, will graduate with transcripts containing grades from both systems (i.e. both numbers and letters).\n\nAn academic year has two semesters, from August to December and from January to June, although exceptions occur. Courses are measured in \"studiepoeng\" according to the ECTS standard (European Credit Transfer System credits). A normal full-time study progression awards 60 credits (studiepoeng/stp) per year (30 per semester). Most institutions either use a 7.5, 8, 10, 12, 15 or 20 credit block system.\n\n=== Poland ===\n\nThe most commonly used system in Polish grade schools is as follows (with usual corresponding score percentages):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In examinations it is sometimes awarded for a perfect or near-perfect score (95\u2013100% or more, for example by answering extra-credit questions).\n\nGrades (especially expressed numerically) can be suffixed with + (plus) or - (minus). On rare occasions the = (double minus, 'rails') is used, especially as ''2='' to express the very lowest passing grade.\n\nBefore 1990, grades 1 and 6 were not used. It was the grade 2 that was called \"insufficient\". ''3='', also called ''trzy na szynach'' (literally: ''three on rails'') was the very lowest passing grade. The grade 6 might have been issued on very rare occasions (e.g. for \"making the teacher speechless\").\n\nPost-secondary institutions use a different system, usually consisting of the following grades (with usual corresponding score percentages):\n\n* ''niedostateczny'' (unsatisfactory) \u2013 2.0 \u2013 0\u201350%\n* ''dostateczny'' (satisfactory) \u2013 3.0 \u2013 51\u201360%\n* ''dostateczny plus'' (satisfactory plus) \u2013 3.5 \u2013 61\u201370%\n* ''dobry'' (good) \u2013 4.0 \u2013 71\u201380%\n* ''dobry plus'' (good plus) \u2013 4.5 \u2013 81\u201390%\n* ''bardzo dobry'' (very good) \u2013 5.0 \u2013 91\u2013100%\n* ''zaliczony'' (passed) \u2013 zal.\n* ''niezaliczony'' (not passed) \u2013 nzal.\n\nThe scores corresponding to each grade vary greatly from institution to institution and from course to course, but usually a score of 50% or 51% is required to obtain the lowest passing grade (3.0).\nThe notations ''zal.'' and ''nzal.'' are used when the course only requires attendance and/or is not important (such as sports).\n\n=== Portugal ===\n{{Main|Education in Portugal}}\n\nIn Portuguese primary and middle schools, up until the 9th grade inclusive, the grading system is as follows:\n\n* 5 (very good or excellent) is the best possible grade (90\u2013100%),\n* 4 (good) (70\u201389%),\n* 3 (satisfactory) indicates \"average\" performance (50\u201369%),\n* 2 (unsatisfactory) (20\u201349%),\n* 1 (poor) is the lowest possible grade (0\u201319%).\n\nFrom the 10th grade onwards, including [[tertiary education]], a 20-point grading scale is used, with 10 passing grades and 10 failing grades, with 20 being the highest grade possible and 9.5, rounded upwards to 10, the minimum grade for passing. This 20-point system is used both for test scores and grades.\n\n=== Romania ===\n\nThe system used in Romanian primary schools is as follows:\n\n* Foarte Bine (FB, very good)\n* Bine (B, good)\n* Suficient/Satisf\u0103c\u0103tor (S, pass)\n* Insuficient/Nesatisf\u0103c\u0103tor (I, fail)\n\nIn secondary schools, high schools, and academic institutions, a 10-point scale is used, 5 being the minimum grade for passing:\n\n* 10 (excellent)\n* 9 (very good)\n* 8 (good)\n* 6\u20137 (satisfactory)\n* 5 (sufficient)\n* 1\u20134 (unsatisfactory)\n\nThere is no 0.\nIf a student scores 86%, he will be given a grade of 8.60, which will be rounded to a 9.\nFurther, for a score of 94%, a grade of 9.40 is given that is rounded down to 9.\nThe average of grades are not rounded, thus a student can earn an average grade of e.g. 9.55.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Russia}}\n\nMost Russian educational institutions use a five-point grading scale:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Grade\n!Long name\n!Short name (ru)\n!Long name (pronunciation)\n!Short name (pronunciation)\n!Translation of name\n!Description\n!Percent\n|-\n|5\n|\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\n|\u043e\u0442\u043b\n|Otl\u00ec\u010dno\n|otl\n|Very good or Excellent\n|best possible grade\n|90% and above\n|-\n|4\n|\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\n|\u0445\u043e\u0440\n|Khoro\u0161\u00f2\n|khor\n|Good\n|Good\n|approximately 76\u201390%\n|-\n|3\n|\u0423\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\n|\u0443\u0434\n|Udovletvor\u00ectelno\n|ud\n|Satisfactory, sometimes translated into English as Fair\n|passing grade\n|60-75%\n|-\n|2\n|\u041d\u0435\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\n|\u043d\u0435\u0443\u0434\n|Nyeudovletvor\u00ectelno\n|nye\u00f9d\n|Unsatisfactory\n|failing\n|<59%\n|}\n\nQualifiers + and \u2212 are often used to add some degree of differentiation between the grades: e.g., 4+ is better than 4, but not quite as good as 5\u2212. Grading varies greatly from school to school, university to university, and even teacher to teacher, even for courses that lend themselves to objective marking, such as mathematics and applied sciences. Even though the grades technically range from 1 to 5, 1 is not common and is rarely given for academic reasons\u2014in many cases, a 1 is given as a result of failure to show up for or to complete an exam. A 2 grade usually means that the student showed no or little knowledge in a subject.\n\nIt may be worth mentioning that 1 is a fairly exotic grade in Russian schools, but it does officially exist. The generally used grades are 2 to 5. Plus (+) and minus (\u2212) modifiers follow the same tendency; they are rarely used in middle school and almost never in colleges or universities. Some institutions and teachers, dissatisfied with the five-point scale, work with various larger ones, but these grading systems are not recognized by the state and require conversion for official use.\n\nA considerably more complex grading system has been implemented for the recently introduced [[Education in Russia#Unified state examinations|Unified state examinations]]. In this system, a \"primary grade\" is the sum of points for completed tasks, with each of the tasks having a maximum number of points allocated to it. The maximum total primary grade varies by subject, so that one might obtain a primary grade of 23 out of 37 in mathematics and a primary grade of 43 out of 80 in French. The primary grades are then converted into final or \"test grades\" by means of a sophisticated statistical calculation, which takes into account the distribution of primary grades among the examinees. This system has been criticized for its lack of transparency.\n\nAt universities some subjects are graded \"Pass/No pass\"  or \"Credit/No Credit\" (\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0442/\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0442, pronounced \"zach\u00f2t/nyezach\u00f2t\"); the rest are typically graded on the five-point scale. The \"Pass/No Pass\" grades do not have any official numeric representation. When ''zach\u00f2t'' \u2013 (credit- or pass-) type subjects are graded as \"Pass/No pass\", this represents a student's knowledge of a subject. Each university applies its own standards with respect to the knowledge a student must have in order to pass a subject. ''Zach\u00f2t'' equival to pass with mark of minimum 77% to maximum 100%. Students in Russia must pass all prescribed courses in order to graduate.<ref name=\"xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai\">{{cite web |url=http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B/2974 |title=\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0420\u0424 |publisher=Xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai |date=2012-12-30 |accessdate=2013-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013220234/http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B/2974 |archive-date=2013-10-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSince the word ''zach\u00f2t'' can be translated variously into English (e.g. as \"credit\" or \"pass\"), this notation can create problems for Russian students applying to Western universities. Such grades may confuse Western universities and complicate accurate calculation of students' GPAs in Western systems. For Western system \"Pass\" calculation recommended to perform based on averages.\nWestern universities and equivalency organizations usually disregard ''zach\u00f2t'', despite the fact that this notation is typically used for about half of a student's course results. Consequently, most Western GPA conversions of Russian degrees reflect only part of a candidate's coursework.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.msu.ru/rus/education/students/documents/polozhenie/ |title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u0437\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u044d\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0413\u0423 |publisher=Phys.msu.ru |date=2001-04-26 |accessdate=2013-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101063834/http://www.phys.msu.ru/rus/education/students/documents/polozhenie/ |archive-date=2013-11-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAll course examinations and ''zachot'' tests must be passed at the time each is given, as there are no repeats, resits or grade appeals. Hence only those who satisfy all the requirements during the allotted examination period for each semester graduate, leaving a huge number of students behind who in the West would have had a chance to resit examinations and even get their grades reconsidered. Furthermore, grades in Russia are determined not only by examination results but also by other criteria such as class attendance and participation, term papers and projects, in-class and homework assignments, laboratory reports, presentations, and sometimes even grooming and behavior. All these must be passed during the semester before a 'final examination mark' and final ''zachot'' is awarded.\n\nRussian degrees do not have composite classifications such as in the British system of First Class, Upper/Lower Second Class, Third Class, Pass, etc. This is because each course is examined independently, students must pass all of them, and they do not add up or contribute to an average grade or 'class'. Another reason is that during the Russian Revolution, social stratification and classification were supposedly abolished in the interest of promoting social equality. Accordingly, all students would be expected to perform at or above the minimum level required to qualify and graduate. Calculation of an aggregate mark or GPA is not considered fair or even possible, as it would be felt to disregard much of a candidate's academic work. The ''zach\u00f2t'' notation would complicate such calculation, and the final thesis qualifying mark is usually considered as the final result. Students who have shown exceptional academic talent by getting ''5'''s in most of their courses are awarded a 'degree with excellence', which comes in a special red cover.<ref name=\"xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai\"/>\n\n=== Serbia ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Serbia}}\n\n[[Serbia]] has the same academic grading system of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Former Yugoslavia]].

Since decimal scores are common, a scale from 0 to 100 is often used to remove the decimal point.\n\nIn some universities, students who fail a subject have the option of taking an extraordinary test (''examen extraordinario'', often shortened to ''extra'') that evaluates the contents of the entire period. Once the test is finished and the score is assessed, this score becomes the entire subject's score, thus giving failing students a chance to pass their subjects. Those who fail the extraordinary test have two more chances to take it; if the last test is failed, the subject is marked as failed and pending, and depending on the school, the student may fail the entire year.\n\nSome private schools (particularly in higher levels of education) require a 70 to pass instead of the regular 60.\n\nGrades are often absolute and not class-specific. It may be the case that the top of the class gets a final grade of 79. Curve-adjustment is rare. Grad-level students are usually expected to have grades of 80 or above to graduate. Students in the honor roll are usually those with an overall GPA of 90 or higher upon graduation, and some private universities will award them a \"With Honors\" diploma. Additionally, in some private universities, the pass scores is higher or lower depending from the kind of studies that are related with (for example, in some universities, in the case of Engineering, the minimum score is 7.3 and for Art Sciences is 8.8) and lower than this score is not acceptable.\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in the United States}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe most popular and commonly used grading system in the United States uses discrete evaluation in the form of letter grades. Many schools use a GPA (grade-point average) system in combination with letter grades. There are also many other systems in place. Some schools use a scale of 100 instead of letter grades. Others, including many [[Montessori]] schools, eschew discrete evaluation in favor of pure discursive evaluation. There is no standardized system of grading in the United States. As such, those issues are left up to individual universities, schools and the regulatory authority of the individual states.\n\nAt most schools, colleges and universities in the United States, letter grades follow a five-point system, using the letters A, B, C, D and E/F, with A indicating excellent, C indicating average and F indicating failing. Additionally, most schools calculate a student's grade point average (GPA) by assigning each letter grade a number and averaging those numerical values. Generally, American schools equate an A with a numerical value of 4.0. Most graduate schools require a 3.0 (B) average to take a degree, with C or C\u2212 being the lowest grade for course credit. Most undergraduate schools require a 2.0, or C average<!-- Hoping they mean 2.0 average... --> to obtain a degree with a minimum of D or D\u2212 to pass a course. For most secondary schools, the minimum overall and course passes are both D or D\u2212. Some districts, such as [[Mount Olive Township School District]] in [[New Jersey]], have eliminated D as a passing grade for their students due to a high failure rate.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130216706 At Some N.J. Schools, D No Longer Counts As Passing], [[NPR]]. Accessed 24 October 2010.</ref>\n\nWhereas most American graduate schools use four-point grading (A, B, C, and E/F),<!-- Above, it just said most universities/colleges used five-point grading [A, B, C, D, E/F]. Clarification needed! --> several\u2014mostly in the west, especially in California\u2014do award D grades but still require a B average for degree qualification. Some American graduate schools use nine- or ten-point grading scales, formerly including the Rackham School of Graduate Studies at the [[University of Michigan]], where 9.0 = A+, 8.0 = A, 7.0 = A\u2212, and so on. (Rackham switched to a more conventional four-point scale in August 2013.)<ref>[https://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/gpa Rackham School of Graduate Studies: GPA Conversion Announcement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526011122/http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/gpa |date=2014-05-26 }}, [[University of Michigan]].

The most common grading scales for normal courses and honors/[[Advanced Placement]] courses are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | \"Normal\" courses\n! colspan=\"2\" | Honors/AP courses\n|-\n!Grade\n!Percentage\n!GPA\n!Percentage\n!GPA\n|-\n!

Around the time of [[World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], several states{{Which|date=November 2010}} began to use E, while the majority of the country continued to use the F, which traces to the days of Pass/Fail grading (P and F). In recent years, some schools have begun using an N for failing grades, presumably to represent \"No Credit\". Another letter used to represent a failing grade is U, representing \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\nChromatic variants (\"+\" and \" \u2212 \") are used. In most 100-point grading systems, the letter grade without variants is centered around a value ending in five. The \"plus\" variant is then assigned the values near the nine digit and the \"minus\" variant is assigned the values near zero. Any decimal values are usually rounded. Thus, a score of 80 to 82 is a B\u2212, a score 83 to 87 is a B and a score of 87 to 89 is a B+. The four-point GPA scale, the letter grade without variants is assigned to the integer. The \"plus\" and \"minus\" variants are then assigned to .3 above the integer and .3 below the integer, respectively. Thus, a B is equal to 3.0, a B+ is equal to 3.3, and a B\u2212 is equal to 2.7.<ref>[http://studentspreunited.com/page/GPA4pointcalculator GPA Calculator], Studentspreunited.com. Accessed 12 November 2011.</ref>\n\nThe A range is often treated as a special case. In most American schools, a 4.00 is regarded as perfect and the highest GPA one can achieve. Thus, an A, being the prime grade, achieves the mark of a 4.00; for the A+ mark, most schools still assign a value of 4.00, equivalent to the A mark, to prevent deviation from the standard 4.00 GPA system. However, the A+ mark, then, becomes a mark of distinction that has no impact on the student's GPA. A few schools, however, do assign grade values of 4.33 or 4.30; but the ''scale'' is still called \"4.0\", because grading scales (or \"quality indices\") take their numerical names from the highest ''whole'' number.\n\nIn many American [[high school]]s, students may also score above 4.0 if taking advanced, honors, [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]], or [[International Baccalaureate]] classes (for example, a \"regular\" A would be worth four points, but an A earned in an advanced class might be worth 4.5 or 5 points towards the GPA.).<ref>[http://studentspreunited.com/page/highschoolgpa High School GPA Calculator], Studentpreunited.com. Accessed 12 November 2011.</ref> This is called a weighted GPA and is designed to reward students for taking more advanced courses. Although weighting GPAs is a widespread practice in the United States, there is little research into whether weighted GPAs are better than unweighted GPAs. In one study, weighted GPAs were not suitable for predicting any college outcomes, but unweighted GPA were strong predictors of college GPA.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Nagaishi|first2=Chanel|last3=Slade|first3=Michael K.|last4=Hermesmeyer|first4=Paul|last5=Peck|first5=Elizabeth Kimberli|title=Comparing weighted and unweighted grade point averages in predicting college success of diverse and low-income college students|journal=NASSP Bulletin|volume=98|issue=4|pages=261\u2013279|doi=10.1177/0192636514565171|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nThere has been dispute{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} over how colleges should look at grades from previous schools and high schools because one grade in one part of the country might not be the equivalent of a grade in another part of the country. In other words, an \"A\" might be 90\u2013100 somewhere, and a 94\u2013100 somewhere else. In middle and high schools that do not use a system based on [[academic credit]], the grade point average is computed by taking the mean of all grades. In colleges and universities that use discrete evaluation, the grade-point average is calculated by multiplying the quantitative values by the credit value of the correlative course, and then dividing the total by the sum of all credits.\n\nFor example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Class'''\n| '''Credits'''\n| '''Grade'''\n| '''Grade Points'''\n|-\n| ''Speech 101''\n| 3\n| A\n| 3 \u00d7 4.0 = 12.0\n|-\n| ''Biology 102''\n| 4\n| B+\n| 4 \u00d7 3.3 = 13.2\n|-\n| ''History 157''\n| 3\n| B\u2212\n| 3 \u00d7 2.7 = 8.1\n|-\n| ''Physical Education 104''\n| 1\n| C\n| 1 \u00d7 2.0 = 2.0\n|}\n\n* Total Credits: 11\n* Total Grade Points: 35.3\n* Grade Point Average: 35.3 / 11 = 3.209 or slightly below B+\n\nIn a standards-based grading system, a performance standard is set by a committee based on ranking anchor papers and grading rubrics, which demonstrate performance which is below, meeting, or exceeding the \"standard.\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This standard is intended to be a high, world-class level of performance, which must be met by every student regardless of ability or class, although they are actually set by a committee with no reference to any other national standard{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Levels are generally assigned numbers between zero and four. Writing papers may be graded separately on content (discussion) and conventions ([[spelling]] and [[grammar]]). Since grading is not based on a curve distribution, it is entirely possible to achieve a grading distribution in which all students pass and meet the standard. While such grading is generally used only for assessments, they have been proposed for alignment with classroom grading. However, in practice, grading can be much more severe than traditional letter grades. Even after ten years, some states, such as [[Washington (state)|Washington]], continue to evaluate over half of their students as \"below standard\" on the state mathematics assessment.\n\nHere is another example of a commonly used grading scale, currently in place at [[Wayzata High School]] in Plymouth, Minnesota. The Grade Point Average is not the traditional four-point scale, but uses the 12-point scale for unweighted classes and the 15-point scale for weighted classes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade\n!Percentage\n|-\n!A+\n| 96.50\u2013100.00\n|-\n!A\n| 92.50\u201396.49\n|-\n!A\u2212\n| 89.50\u201392.49\n|-\n!B+\n| 86.50\u201389.49\n|-\n!B\n| 82.50\u201386.49\n|-\n!B\u2212\n| 79.50\u201382.49\n|-\n!C+\n| 76.50\u201379.49\n|-\n!C\n| 72.50\u201376.49\n|-\n!C\u2212\n| 69.50\u201372.49\n|-\n!D+\n| 66.50\u201369.49\n|-\n!D\n| 62.50\u201366.49\n|-\n!D\u2212\n| 59.50\u201362.49\n|-\n!F\n| 0.00\u201359.49\n|}\n\nThe 12-point GPA scale works as follows. Students receive 12 points for an A or A+, 11 points for an A\u2212, 10 points for a B+, etc. for each grading period. Once a grading period is complete, the student's total grade points are divided by the total number of credits and a GPA is generated.\n\nFor example, here is one term of grades and a grade point average from a student whose school uses the 86-minute block schedule (such as Wayzata High School):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Math 4X (1 credit)\n| 95.06/A = 12 Grade Points\n|-\n!Chemistry X (1 credit)\n| 87.39/B+ = 10 Grade Points\n|-\n!Symphonic Band (1 credit)\n| 99.76/A+ = 12 Grade Points\n|-\n!AP United States History (1 credit)\n| 92.57/A\u2212 = 11 Grade Points\n|-\n!Total\n| 45 Grade Points/4 Credits = 11.25 GPA (Slightly better than A\u2212, equivalent to 3.75)\n|}\n\n==== Standards-based grading ====\nStandards-based grading is a well-known practice of assessment. It provides students with learning expectations and an in depth way of evaluation students.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Benefits of Standards-Based Grading: A Critical Evaluation of Modern Grading Practices.|last = Iamarino|first = D.L.|date = 2014|journal = Current Issues in Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> It is not the most common assessment method but it provides students with developmental feedback.

Recent studies reveal that alternative grading methods may lead to more applicable growth opportunities for students' overtime.

These methods provide insight to evaluation methods and emphasize student progress and improvement.<ref name=\"Busuladzic\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Case Study at a Waldorf School.|last = Busuladzic|first = E.|date = 2010|journal = Google Scholar|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> Some alternative grading methods include contract grading, the Waldorf assessment style, and narrative evaluation.\n\n[[Contract grading]] emphasizes learning behaviors. Most students are accepting of contract grading; however, the data shows that less than half of students noted they found it helpful and less stressful than letter grades. Most students that dislike this method were advanced students and found the process to be repetitive.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Simple Alternative to Grading|last = Potts|first = G.|date = 2010|journal = The Journal of Virginia Community Colleges|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] assessment style consists of developmental meetings and an evaluation letter. Waldorf grading methods focused more on what they were learning rather than how well each student applied it.<ref name=\"Busuladzic\" /> It emphasizes positive feedback and progress. Some people may label it as unstructured, others may describe it as a personalized and relaxed style of learning and assessment.  Waldorf philosophy strongly reiterates the growth and improvement of the students.\n\n[[Narrative evaluation]] can be defined as detailed written feedback. Studies show that over half of students really like narrative evaluation.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = High School Students' Perceptions of Narrative Evaluations as Summative Assessment|last = Bagley|first = S|date = 2008|journal = American Secondary Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> It focuses on improvement and provides personal detail of how students have grown. It allows for more personalized feedback and eliminates the competitive nature of students to compare themselves to their classmates.\n\n== Oceania ==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in Australia}}\n\nBoth [[NAPLAN]] and final year secondary school gradings are specified in \"Bands\", approximately as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 90\u2013100 Marks || Band 6/Exemplary \n|-\n| 80-89 || Band 5\n|-\n| 70-79 || Band 4\n|-\n| 60-69 || Band 3\n|-\n| 50-59 || Band 2\n|-\n| 0-49 || Band 1\n|}\n\nDuring the final year of high school, Extension subjects, such as Mathematics (Extension 1) and Mathematics (Extension 2), are marked out of fifty, rather than the normal 100 marks, and thus, have slightly different criteria:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 45\u201350 Marks || Band E4 \n|-\n| 35-44 || Band E3\n|-\n| 25-34 || Band E2\n|-\n| 0-24 || Band E1\n|}\n\nThe majority of Australian tertiary institutions use the following grading structure:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-F\n! style=\"width:90px;\"|HD\n| 85% and above (High Distinction)\n|-\n! D\n| 75\u201384%  (Distinction)\n|-\n! Cr\n| 65\u201374% (Credit)\n|-\n! P\n| 50\u201364%  (Pass)\n|-\n! F\n| 49% and under (Fail)\n|}\n\nSome other Australian universities have a marking system similar to the Honours system used by British universities:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:90px;\"|H1\n| 80% and above (First Class Honours)\n|-\n! H2A\n| 75\u201379%  (Second Class Honours (A Division))\n|-\n! H2B\n| 70\u201374% (Second Class Honours (B Division))\n|-\n! H3\n| 65\u201369%  (Third Class Honours)\n|-\n! P\n| 50\u201364% (Pass)\n|-\n! N\n| below 50% (Fail)\n|}\n\nMany courses also have Non-Graded Pass (NGP) and Non-Graded Fail (NGF), in which it is considered more appropriate to have qualitative than quantitative assessment. However, in some universities, an F1 category may be given a 'Pass Conceded' if the student's Weighted Average is greater than a nominated threshold. (More often than not, this is around the 53\u201355 range.)\n\nGrade-point averages are not generally used in Australia below a tertiary level, but are important for selection into graduate entry courses such as Medicine and Law. They are calculated according to more complicated formula than some other nations, and may be customised for the particular course application when used as entry criteria into graduate entry degrees:\n\nGrade Point Average (GPA) = Sum of (grade points \u00d7 course unit values) / total number of credit points attempted, in which grade points are as follows:\n\n* High Distinction = 7\n* Distinction = 6\n* Credit = 5\n* Pass = 4\n* Fail level 1 = 1\n* Fail level 2 = 0\n\nAt some universities, among them [[Macquarie University]], [[University of Technology, Sydney]], [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (RMIT)<ref>[http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/Current%20students%2FAdministration%2FResults%2FGPA%20-%20Grade%20point%20average/ GPA \u2013 Grade point average]. RMIT. Retrieved on 28 September 2011.</ref> and [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, a GPA is calculated, with 4.0 being a High Distinction; 3.0 a Distinction, 2.0 a Credit, and 1.0 a pass. In certain faculties, such as law, it is therefore possible to graduate with \"honours\" with a GPA of less than 2.5. Whenever a course result is a Non-Graded Pass, the result will normally be disregarded in GPA calculations.\n\nThe term ''course unit values'' is used to distinguish between courses which have different weightings e.g. between a full year course and a single semester course.\n\nThe grading of secondary school graduates varies from state to state, but in most states the [[ATAR]] (Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank) system determines which students are offered positions in tertiary courses. Government Supported Positions are offered to applicants for a course who are ranked above a particular ATAR threshold, which commonly varies from course to course, institution to institution, and year to year. (An example of this is an ATAR of 85 for Civil Engineering at the [[University of New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uac.edu.au/pdf/2007_uai_coffs_csp_main.pdf |accessdate=May 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414054002/http://www.uac.edu.au/pdf/2007_uai_coffs_csp_main.pdf |archivedate=April 14, 2008 }}</ref>) A student's ATAR signifies that student's rank relative to their year 7 [[Cohort (educational group)|cohort]], including students that did not complete year 12. A student with an ATAR of 80.00, for example, has performed, in their final year of secondary schooling, better than 80 percent of that student's year 7 cohort, had all those year 7 students completed year 12 and been eligible for an ATAR.\n\nOn the other hand, graduating Year 12 students in [[Queensland]] are given an Overall Position (OP) from 1 to 25, with 1 being the highest band. OPs are calculated from a student's grades in their year 12 (and in some cases, year 11) courses, and also from Student Achievement Indicators (SAIs) which are allocated by the student's teachers.<ref>https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/630.html</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n{{Main|Academic grading in New Zealand}}\nMost New Zealand secondary schools use the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (NCEA) marking schedule, even in pre-NCEA years for commonality. There are four grades, from lowest to highest, Not Achieved (N/A or N), Achieved (A), Achieved with Merit (M), and Achieved with Excellence (E). These can also be marked at certain levels for junior exams and general assignments as well as exams once the student has started NCEA. The grading for these specific marks are as follows, Not Achieved minus (N/A1 or N1), Not Achieved plus (N/A2 or N1), Achieved (A3), Achieved plus (A4), Merit (M5), Merit plus (M6), Excellence (E7) and Excellence plus (E8). It is possible to get an achieved, merit or excellence minus, but would be marked as the first number used for the grade. The difference between an achieved plus and merit minus is simply if the student has applied all of the achieved requirements but not enough merit requirements or has applied all of the achieved requirements and just enough merit requirements to reach merit. However, these grades are often check marked if that is the case and regardless of whether the student got a merit minus or straight merit, they will be rewarded with merit level credits for the assessment. The minority of schools using other secondary school qualifications (usually CIE or IB) have different grades. Grading at tertiary institutions generally centers around a letter scale, with a corresponding nine-point GPA scale (C\u2212=1, A+=9).\n\n== South America ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\nIn Argentina the [[Grade Point Average|GPA]] is calculated quarterly, each semester, or annually. Grades usually range from 1 to 10. The passing mark is typically 70% or around two thirds, which in secondary school is represented by a grade of 7.\n\nDepending on the university, admittance may require:\n\n* Completion of secondary school.\n* A [http://www.cbc.uba.ar/ common basic year] to all degrees or an entrance exam for some of the more popular degree programs.\n\nUniversity grades are also on a scale of 1 to 10, but a passing mark is represented by 4, which usually corresponds to a mark of 70-75%, or higher.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n\nIn Brazil the GPA \u2013 known as ''Coeficiente de Rendimento'', or ''\u00cdndice de Rendimento Acad\u00eamico'' \u2013 is calculated per semester or per year or both. The High School GPA is almost never used for college entrance evaluation in public universities (state funded and free of charge). To enter state colleges, Brazilian students must attend to entrance exams called ''vestibulares''. The most famous ones are ''FUVEST'', the entrance exam for University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and ''ENEM'', a national exam that ranks high school students to be accepted by federal funded colleges. The private colleges system also apply entrance exams, but some might use the GPA as an evaluation method.\nDuring college, the GPA is calculated as a weighted average of grade and course hours and have a bigger importance than in the high school as it determines priority in receiving scholarships, for example.\n\nThe majority of schools adopt a 0.00 (worst) to 10.00 (best) scale for grading, and some of the Brazilian schools adopt the following grading system:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:90px;\"|A (Excellent)\n| 8.1\u201310\n|-\n! B (Very Good)\n| 6.1\u20138.0\n|-\n! C (Good)\n| 4.1\u20136.0\n|-\n! D (Unsatisfactory)\n| 2.1\u2013 4.0\n|-\n! E (Fail)\n| 0\u20132.0\n|}\n\nA grade below 4.0 is surely a fail, although some schools have passing criteria of 6.0 to 7.0, as 60% to 70%.\n\n=== Chile ===\n\nGrades are assigned with a numeric scale from 1.0 to 7.0, including at least one decimal, with 4.0 as the lowest passing grade (equivalent to either 50%, 60% or even 70%, depending on the teacher). Everything under a 4.0 is considered a \"red mark,\" which equates to failing. For the PSU, ''Prueba de Selecci\u00f3n Universitaria'' (UST, University Selection Test), the scale goes from 150 to 850 points. The points follow a normal distribution, being 500 the average result. Depending on the university and the major, the student will need a minimum score to get accepted. The final score will depend on the points obtained in each test: Mathematics and Linguistics (both mandatory); Natural Sciences and History (only one of them mandatory) and the NEM score, ''Notas de Ense\u00f1anza Media'' (High School Grades which is the same as GPA) converted into the PSU Scale.\n\nNumerical system from 1,0 to 7,0:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Numerical system\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|US Letter grades\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 6,9 - 7,0 || A\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 6,5 - 6,8 || A-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 5,9 - 6,4 || B+\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 5,4 - 5,8 || B\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 5,0 - 5,3 || B-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4,4 - 4,9 || C+\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4,0 - 4,3 || C\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 3,9 - 3,5 || C-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 3,4 - 2,4 || D\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| \u2264 2,3 || F\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Colombia ===\n\nThe most used grading systems are the numerical from 0 to 5 or from 0 to 10 and commonly is approved with 3 or 6, respectively. The letter system consist of E, S, A, I, D and is approved with A. The letter system is based on the numerical, meaning that the numerical system guides the letter one. While the universities only use the numerical system, with 3.0 being the passing grade, because it is more complex and students have more difficulty in approving a course.

The minimum grade required to pass a year is 7, depending on how schools are organized. Since 2012 enjoy complete autonomy in Ecuador, so that some establishments maintain supplementary examination for those with less than 7, and other approved intensive recovery, but if the grade obtained is lower than 5, students are automatically disqualified and disciplinary actions are taken. If a student got 10 out of 10 in 90% of subjects in the first period, he is promoted to a senior year, after taking an entrance examination. Notes and academic qualifications and groups them reasoning thus:\n\n* 10\u20139.5 = Rated Excellent (A)\n* 9.4\u20139.0 = Rated Outstanding (B)\n* 8.9\u20138.0 = very good credit rating (C)\n* 7.9\u20136.5 = Rating Sufficient or Good Sufficient (D)\n* 6.4\u20135.1 = Fail failing grade with Recovery option or supplementary examination (E)\n* 5.0\u20131.0 = Fail automatically (F)\n\nThis system is still applied to universities, being the \"Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas - ESPE\" the only exception, as they do not allow their students to take supplementary exams after every course.\n\n=== Paraguay ===\n\nThe grades vary from 1 to 5, where 5 is the maximum grade achievable and 1 the lowest. The minimum for pass is 2 (equivalent to 60%).\n\n* 5: Excellent\n* 4: Very Good\n* 3: Good\n* 2: Acceptable\n* 1: Fail\n\n=== Peru ===\n\nGrades range from 0 to 20, in an almost unique grading table. The passing grade is 11 in most schools and universities. In some preschool facilities, grades usually range from F to A+, following the American system, and in a few colleges, the passing grade is 10.\n\nFor most Peruvian universities the grading system is as follows:<ref>https://www.foreigncredits.com/Resources/GPA-Calculator/Peru</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icpna.edu.pe/education-usa/education-usa/asesoria-educational/educational-and-grading-system-peru/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613212534/http://www.icpna.edu.pe/education-usa/education-usa/asesoria-educational/educational-and-grading-system-peru/ |archive-date=2017-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Numerical system\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Description\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|US Letter grades\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 14.00\u201320.00 || ''Excelente'' || A\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 11.99\u201313.99 || ''Muy bueno'' || B\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 11.00\u201311.99|| ''Aprobado'' || C\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 10.00\u201310.99 || ''Aplazado'' || D\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 0.00\u20139.99 || ''Desaprobado'' || F\n|-\n|}\n\nFrom 2017, Peru will adopt a new evaluation system. AD (Excellent), A (Very good), B (Good), C (Fair), D (Fail).{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Uruguay ===\n\nIn Uruguay, high grades are very hard to achieve. In  primary school, grades range in this order:\n\n*S (Sobresaliente) \u2013 Outstanding, highest grade. Also commonly called \"sote\".\n*SMB (Sobresaliente Muy Bueno) \u2013 Excellent\n*MBS (Muy Bueno Sobresaliente) \u2013 Very good, almost excellent\n*MB (Muy Bueno) \u2013 Very good\n*MBB (Muy Bueno Bueno) \u2013 Good, almost very good\n*BMB (Bueno Muy Bueno) \u2013 Good\n*B (Bueno) \u2013 Approved\n*BR (Bueno Regular) \u2013 Not approved\n*RB (Regular Bueno) \u2013 Requires much more work\n*R (Regular) \u2013 Very bad job, lowest grade\n\nIn secondary school, grades range from 1 to 12. 1 is the lowest and 12 is the highest. Passing an exam or course requires 6 out of 12 in high school or at a private university (although some subjects in secondary school require a grade of 7 or 8 to pass), and 3 out of 12 at a public university. In high school a 6 corresponds to 50% on an exam or in a course while in a public university, a 3 corresponds to a 60% in a course or exam. Grades of 10, 11, and 12 are considered excellent. Some private universities grade their students on a percentage basis, generally setting the passing benchmark between 60% and 70%.\n\nBecause of the acronym of the word \"Sobresaliente\" (Ste.) it is usual to pronounce it as \"Sote\".\n\n=== Venezuela ===\n\nGrades in Venezuela may vary according to the education level, but normally the grading system is numerical, and ranges from 00 to 20, 00 being the lowest and 20 being the highest, and 10 being the pass mark, equivalent to a \"D\" in the United States. This system is not required, however, and several schools in Venezuela deviate from it by following a letter-grade system similar or identical to those in the United States.\n\nShown here is the Venezuelan grading system in probable comparison with the United States grading system:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

This title was awarded by a proclamation from the [[King of Travancore]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin|King of Cochin]]. The Prime jurisdiction regarding the temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual \nadministration of the [[Malankara Church]] is vested in the Malankara Metropolitan. Malankara Metropolitan is believed to reign it faithful from the Apostolic See of Saint Thomas.His Holiness Moran Mor Baselios Marthoma Paulose II (Indian Orthodox Church) Catholicos is the Present Malankara Metropolitan on the apostlic Throne of st Thomas in Malankara.\n\n\n==History==\nIt was when Col. Munroe the resident of Travancore, Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop Ramban was ordained as a bishop by Geevarghese Philexenos (Kidangan) (1811\u201329) of [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] (Thozhyoor Church) on 22 March 1815. He was given the episcopal title Dionysius, the second bishop in the Malankara Church to get this title. After the death of Thoma VIII, he was made the head of the Malankara Church by a Royal proclamation issued by the King of Travancore and later by the King of Cochin. The proclamation insisted every Syrian Christian of Travancore-Cochin obey the Malankara Metropolitan. From then onwards the head of the [[Malankara Syrian Church]] legally came to be known as Malankara Metropolitan. The position of the Malankara Metropolitan in the 19th century is an upgrowth from the position of the previous Thomas and Archdeacons.  The power and authority of the Malankara Metropolitan got more recognition than the power and authority of the previous Archdeacons' and Marthomas' because of some political changes in the country through the establishment of British rule.\n\nFrom 1816, Dionysius II, Dionysius III, Dionysius IV, Mathews Athanasius, Thomas Athanasius and Pulikkottil 1st were the Malankara Metropolitans in the 19th century. Among these Mathews Athanasius of Palakkunnathu exercised enormous spiritual as well as temporal powers inside and outside the community. He was the Malankara Metropolitan at the time of '''Mulanthuruthy Padiyola''' in (1876). However inspired by the western missionaries cooperated in the old seminary at Kottayam, he wanted to inculcate reformist ideas in the traditional Syrian church. A parallel group under Dionysius V was working against the ruling Malankara Metropolitan's reformist ideas. During the latter half of the 19th century there occurred two factions in the community; the minority faction that favored reformation and supported the Reformists and the majority faction who were against the introduction of new changes which was against the Syrian tradition of the church got stood with the Pulikkotil Joseph Dionysius 2 (Syrian traditionalists). This also invited a closer interference of the Patriarch of Antioch in Malankara Church. Dionysius V stood with the Patriarch of Antioch against the ruling metropolitan, Mathews Athanasius of Palakkunnathu. A series of court cases followed thereafter. The Travancore Royal court on 14 July 1889 declared that Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius and the Reformist faction has no rights in the physical properties of Malankara Church . Later the Reformist faction renamed themselves as[[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]. \n\nThe practice of issuing Royal proclamation ceased after the time of Palakkunnathu [[Mathews Mar Athanasius|Mathews Athanasius]]. Dionysius V of the (Syrian traditionalists) invited and brought Patriarch Peter III of Antioch to Malankara in 1875. The Patriarch divided the Malankara church into seven dioceses; Dionysius V was declared as the Malankara Metropolitan and was given charge of Quilon Diocese in the '''Synod of Mulanthuruthy'''(27 to 30 June 1876). Neither the reigning Malankara Metropolitan, Palakkunathu Mathews Athanasius nor the Churches favoring him participated in the synod.\n\nLater on, a series of court cases and stronger rift occurred in the church. The head of Malankara Church, Malankara Metropolitan Dionysius V approached the Royal Court of Travancore against Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius reigning as Malankara Metropolitan and against occupying assets of church and seminary. Appellant Dionysius V won the case in 1889 and Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius was deprived of the title of Malankara Metropolitan and evicted from Syrian Seminary.\n\nMeanwhile, the defeated reformist faction organized themselves under reigning Malankara Metropolitan who was evicted from the position after Royal court verdict .Reformist faction renamed themselves as  [[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]  \n*[[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]: Independent Oriental Orthodox Church under the jurisdiction of  Marthoma Metropolitan Throne of Malankara See\n*[[Malankara Syrian Church]]: following Oriental Orthodox beliefs under the jurisdiction of Malankara Metropolitan with the spiritual guidance of Patriarch of Antioch\n\nHowever, later after the establishment of Catholicate in Malankara in 1912, again a rift occurred among Malankara Syrian Church over the spiritual authority of Patriarch of Antioch. There were several years of litigation between the two factions, the Metran faction, and the Bava faction.The [[Supreme court of India]] declared that the Patriarch has no power in Malankara Church and spiritual power had also come to vanishing point since the establishment of Catholicate.\n\n*[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: '''Malankara Metropolitan and Catholicos of the East enthroned on the Apostolic Throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]]''' is the primate of the church.\n*[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Church]] : under the local jurisdiction of '''Maphrian''' of [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch, later in 2002 established '''[[Catholicos of India]]'''.\n\nThe Primate of Malankara Church (Orthodox Syrian Church of the East) is Catholicos ( [[Catholicos of the East]]). He enjoys spiritual powers as well, as the Malankara Metropolitan. Malankara Metropolitan has the prime jurisdiction regarding temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual administration of Malankara Church subject to the riders provided in the 1934 Constitution. In the temporal matters, Patriarch has no  power and the spiritual power had also come to the 'vanishing point' by his own acts as noticed by the Supreme  Court of India in the 1995 and other judgments. The legitimate Malankara church is the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]].\n\n==Lineage==\nHistorically the primate or the leader of St Thomas Christians were known as Jathikku Karthavyan (leader of Community), Malankara Moopen (Elder of the Community), [[Archdeacon]] or Arkadyokon (High Priest). In the 16th century to resist the Latinization attempts of the Jesuits, it became necessary to elevate the Archdeacon to a position of 'Metropolitan Bishop' named as Mar Thoma.  In 1653 the Archdeacon position was elevated to Bishopric by laying hands of twelve priests in the absence of a valid Bishop. This was an emergency step. Then onwards the Metropolitan Bishop assumed the honorific ecclesiastical title '''Marthoma'''. This title was used from 1653 to 1815. Later a regular 'Bishopric' was established in Malankara with the help of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]]. Until a few hundred years back, the leadership of St Thomas Christian Community was dynastically held by members of the Pakalomattom family.\n\n===Mar Thoma (title)===\n*[[Mar Thoma I]] \u2013 In 1653, Thomas of Palamattam Thravadu was consecrated with the title Marthoma I by 12 priests in 1653 after Coonan cross oath.\nMarthoma I had survived a number of assassination attempts.

This title was awarded by a proclamation from the [[King of Travancore]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin|King of Cochin]]. The Prime jurisdiction regarding the temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual \nadministration of the [[Malankara Church]] is vested in the Malankara Metropolitan. Malankara Metropolitan is believed to reign it faithful from the Apostolic See of Saint Thomas.\n\n==History==\nIt was when Col. Munroe the resident of Travancore, Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop Ramban was ordained as a bishop by Geevarghese Philexenos (Kidangan) (1811\u201329) of [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] (Thozhyoor Church) on 22 March 1815. He was given the episcopal title Dionysius, the second bishop in the Malankara Church to get this title. After the death of Thoma VIII, he was made the head of the Malankara Church by a Royal proclamation issued by the King of Travancore and later by the King of Cochin. The proclamation insisted every Syrian Christian of Travancore-Cochin obey the Malankara Metropolitan. From then onwards the head of the [[Malankara Syrian Church]] legally came to be known as Malankara Metropolitan. The position of the Malankara Metropolitan in the 19th century is an upgrowth from the position of the previous Thomas and Archdeacons.  The power and authority of the Malankara Metropolitan got more recognition than the power and authority of the previous Archdeacons' and Marthomas' because of some political changes in the country through the establishment of British rule.\n\nFrom 1816, Dionysius II, Dionysius III, Dionysius IV, Mathews Athanasius, Thomas Athanasius and Pulikkottil 1st were the Malankara Metropolitans in the 19th century. Among these Mathews Athanasius of Palakkunnathu exercised enormous spiritual as well as temporal powers inside and outside the community. He was the Malankara Metropolitan at the time of '''Mulanthuruthy Padiyola''' in (1876). However inspired by the western missionaries cooperated in the old seminary at Kottayam, he wanted to inculcate reformist ideas in the traditional Syrian church. A parallel group under Dionysius V was working against the ruling Malankara Metropolitan's reformist ideas. During the latter half of the 19th century there occurred two factions in the community; the minority faction that favored reformation and supported the Reformists and the majority faction who were against the introduction of new changes which was against the Syrian tradition of the church got stood with the Pulikkotil Joseph Dionysius 2 (Syrian traditionalists). This also invited a closer interference of the Patriarch of Antioch in Malankara Church. Dionysius V stood with the Patriarch of Antioch against the ruling metropolitan, Mathews Athanasius of Palakkunnathu. A series of court cases followed thereafter. The Travancore Royal court on 14 July 1889 declared that Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius and the Reformist faction has no rights in the physical properties of Malankara Church . Later the Reformist faction renamed themselves as[[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]. \n\nThe practice of issuing Royal proclamation ceased after the time of Palakkunnathu [[Mathews Mar Athanasius|Mathews Athanasius]]. Dionysius V of the (Syrian traditionalists) invited and brought Patriarch Peter III of Antioch to Malankara in 1875. The Patriarch divided the Malankara church into seven dioceses; Dionysius V was declared as the Malankara Metropolitan and was given charge of Quilon Diocese in the '''Synod of Mulanthuruthy'''(27 to 30 June 1876). Neither the reigning Malankara Metropolitan, Palakkunathu Mathews Athanasius nor the Churches favoring him participated in the synod.\n\nLater on, a series of court cases and stronger rift occurred in the church. The head of Malankara Church, Malankara Metropolitan Dionysius V approached the Royal Court of Travancore against Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius reigning as Malankara Metropolitan and against occupying assets of church and seminary. Appellant Dionysius V won the case in 1889 and Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius was deprived of the title of Malankara Metropolitan and evicted from Syrian Seminary.\n\nMeanwhile, the defeated reformist faction organized themselves under reigning Malankara Metropolitan who was evicted from the position after Royal court verdict .Reformist faction renamed themselves as  [[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]  \n*[[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]: Independent Oriental Orthodox Church under the jurisdiction of  Marthoma Metropolitan Throne of Malankara See\n*[[Malankara Syrian Church]]: following Oriental Orthodox beliefs under the jurisdiction of Malankara Metropolitan with the spiritual guidance of Patriarch of Antioch\n\nHowever, later after the establishment of Catholicate in Malankara in 1912, again a rift occurred among Malankara Syrian Church over the spiritual authority of Patriarch of Antioch. There were several years of litigation between the two factions, the Metran faction, and the Bava faction.The [[Supreme court of India]] declared that the Patriarch has no power in Malankara Church and spiritual power had also come to vanishing point since the establishment of Catholicate.\n\n*[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: '''Malankara Metropolitan and Catholicos of the East enthroned on the Apostolic Throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]]''' is the primate of the church.\n*[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Church]] : under the local jurisdiction of '''Maphrian''' of [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch, later in 2002 established '''[[Catholicos of India]]'''.\n\nThe Primate of Malankara Church (Orthodox Syrian Church of the East) is Catholicos ( [[Catholicos of the East]]). He enjoys spiritual powers as well, as the Malankara Metropolitan. Malankara Metropolitan has the prime jurisdiction regarding temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual administration of Malankara Church subject to the riders provided in the 1934 Constitution. In the temporal matters, Patriarch has no  power and the spiritual power had also come to the 'vanishing point' by his own acts as noticed by the Supreme  Court of India in the 1995 and other judgments. The legitimate Malankara church is the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]].\n\n==Lineage==\nHistorically the primate or the leader of St Thomas Christians were known as Jathikku Karthavyan (leader of Community), Malankara Moopen (Elder of the Community), [[Archdeacon]] or Arkadyokon (High Priest). In the 16th century to resist the Latinization attempts of the Jesuits, it became necessary to elevate the Archdeacon to a position of 'Metropolitan Bishop' named as Mar Thoma.  In 1653 the Archdeacon position was elevated to Bishopric by laying hands of twelve priests in the absence of a valid Bishop. This was an emergency step. Then onwards the Metropolitan Bishop assumed the honorific ecclesiastical title '''Marthoma'''. This title was used from 1653 to 1815. Later a regular 'Bishopric' was established in Malankara with the help of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]]. Until a few hundred years back, the leadership of St Thomas Christian Community was dynastically held by members of the Pakalomattom family.\n\n===Mar Thoma (title)===\n*[[Mar Thoma I]] \u2013 In 1653, Thomas of Palamattam Thravadu was consecrated with the title Marthoma I by 12 priests in 1653 after Coonan cross oath.\nMarthoma I had survived a number of assassination attempts.
