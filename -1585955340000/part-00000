All governmental offices, agencies, and courts in Ohio use variations of the state seal. Its primary feature is a circular coat of arms that depicts a sunrise in [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]], Ohio's first capital, along with symbols of the state's origins. The seal sometimes appears with the state motto, \"[[With God, all things are possible]]\".\n\nShortly after its establishment in 1803, the state adopted a seal based on a sketch by [[Ohio Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Creighton, Jr.]] Except for a brief period during the 1860s, the layout and details were left largely unregulated until a standardized [[coat of arms]], based on the original design, was introduced in 1967. The coat of arms was modified most recently in 1996.\n\nEach of Ohio's 88 counties maintains its own official seal based on the state seal.\n\n==Design==\n{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name             = Coat of arms of the State of Ohio \n|image            = Coat of arms of Ohio.svg\n|image_width      = 150\n|middle           = \n|middle_width     = \n|middle_caption   = \n|lesser           = \n|lesser_width     = \n|lesser_caption   = \n|image2           = \n|image2_width     = \n|image2_caption   = \n|image3           = \n|image3_width     = \n|image3_caption   = \n|armiger          = State of Ohio\n|year_adopted     = 1953<ref name=\"Profile Ohio\">{{cite web|title=Ohio|work=State of Ohio|publisher=gwav.tripod.com|accessdate=2011-09-21|url=http://gwav.tripod.com/ohio.htm}}</ref> (current form in 1996)\n|crest            = \n|torse            = \n|shield           = \n|supporters       = \n|compartment      = \n|motto            = \n|orders           = \n|other_elements   = \n|earlier_versions = \n|use              = State and local government offices, older [[Vehicle registration plates of Ohio|license plate]]s\n}}\n\nThe design of the Great Seal of the State of Ohio is defined in [[Ohio Revised Code]] section 5.10:\n\n{{quote|The great seal of the state shall be two and one-half inches in diameter and shall consist of the coat of arms of the state within a circle having a diameter of one and three-fourths inches, surrounded by the words \"THE GREAT SEAL OF THE STATE OF OHIO\" in [[News Gothic|news gothic]] capitals.|{{ORC||5|10}}}}\n\nThe coat of arms is defined in section 5.04:\n\n{{quote|The coat of arms of the state shall consist of the following device: a circular shield; in the right foreground of the shield a full [[grain sheaf|sheaf]] of [[wheat]] bound and standing erect; in the left foreground, a cluster of seventeen [[arrow]]s bound in the center and resembling in form the sheaf of wheat; in the background, a representation of [[Mount Logan (Ohio)|Mount Logan]], [[Ross County, Ohio|Ross county]], as viewed from [[Adena Mansion|Adena state memorial]]; over the mount, a rising sun three-quarters exposed and radiating thirteen rays to represent the thirteen original colonies shining over the first state in the [[Northwest Territory|northwest territory]], the exterior extremities of which rays form a semicircle; and uniting the background and foreground, a representation of the [[Scioto River|Scioto river]] and cultivated fields.\n\nThe coat of arms of the state shall correspond substantially with the following design:\n\n[...]\n\nWhen the coat of arms of the state is reproduced in color, the colors used shall be substantially the same as the natural color of the terrain and objects shown.|{{ORC||5|04}}}}\n\nThe hills shown in the seal are managed by the [[Ohio Department of Natural Resources|Department of Natural Resources]] as [[Great Seal State Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Seal State Park|publisher=Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Parks and Recreation|accessdate=July 31, 2014|url=http://parks.ohiodnr.gov/greatseal#history}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOhio's state seal has been redesigned at least ten times in the state's history.<ref name=\"Statehouse rotunda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/pages/capitol_square/rotunda.cfm?submenu=statehouse|title=Rotunda|work=The Ohio Statehouse|publisher=Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board|date=2005-12-20|accessdate=2007-08-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929041947/http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/pages/capitol_square/rotunda.cfm?submenu=statehouse <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref> From 1805 to 1866, the seal's design was left unspecified, a situation unique among the states.<ref name=\"Sloane\" />\n\n===Territorial seal===\n[[File:Seal of the Northwest Territory.png|thumb|Seal of the Territory of the United States [[Northwest Territory|Northwest]] of the [[River Ohio]]<br>Motto: {{lang|la|Meliorem lapsa locavit}} (\"He has planted one better than the one fallen\")]]\n\nBefore Ohio's statehood, the territorial government of the [[Northwest Territory]] had its own seal.
