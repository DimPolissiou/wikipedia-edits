Which runs down the east coast of India between [[Howrah Junction]] (HWH) in Kolkata and [[Chennai Central]] (MAS) on daily basis. It is one of the first earliest Superfast in the history of IR. Most of the people going to Chennai prefer this train as the train arrives early then [[Howrah Chennai Mail]]. The train runs jampacked throughout the year.\n\n==History==\nThe land of the [[Chola dynasty]] was called Cholamandalam in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], literally translated as \u201cthe realm of the Cholas\u201d, from which Coromandel is derived. The Coromandel Coast is the name given to the southeastern coast of the Indian peninsula. The Eastern Coast of India along the [[Bay of Bengal]] is called the [[Coromandel Coast]] and hence the name was given to this train, as it traverses the entire length of the Coromandel coast. This train belongs to the [[South Eastern Railway zone]].\n\n==Loco links==\nThis train is currently hauled by [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works|CLW]] manufactured [[WAP-4]] or [[WAP-7]] class electric locomotives maintained by Electric Loco Shed [[Santragachi]] of South Eastern Railway from [[Howrah Junction]] to [[Visakhapatanam]] and [[Lallaguda]] or [[Royapuram]] based [[WAP-7]] class electric locomotives to [[Chennai Central]] . These 5000&nbsp;hp & 6350&nbsp;hp locomotives are fit to run at 140&nbsp;km/h but due to limitation of sectional speed, coromandel express runs at a maximum permissible speed of 120&nbsp;km/h. Immediately after electrification, this train was hauled by [[Lallaguda]] based [[WAP-4]] loco from Chennai to Howrah but due to difficulty and excessive time required to reverse loco at Visakhapatnam, subsequently it was decided to run it by Santragachi-based Loco from Howrah to Visakhapatnam and from Visakhapatnam to Chennai by Erode-based WAP-4. When Royapuram shed came up near Chennai, Royapuram based loco is utilized to haul it from Visakhapatnam to Chennai.\n\nPrior to completion of electrification of east coast line, there was no alternative but to run this train by double-diesel [[WDM-4]] (From [[Kharagpur]] Diesel Loco Shed). Reason for using two diesel locomotives was to run this 24 coach train at 120&nbsp;km/h and this train has the permissible speed of 120&nbsp;km/h. After electrification, single [[WAP-4]] or [[WAP-7]] electric locomotive is adequate. Thus there was straightway saving of one locomotive for Indian Railway. There was saving of time as well due faster acceleration.\n\nThis train had numerous serious accidents.  In a particular accident which occurred during 2009 in which apart from other damages and casualties the Santragachi-based [[WAP-4]] 22330 loco got damaged beyond economical repair and therefore had to be condemned.\n\nSince 2015 [[WAP-7]] loco pulls the train from Visakhapatnam to Chennai and Chennai to Visakhapatnam. From Howrah to Visakhapatnam and Visakhapatnam to Howrah Santragachi-based [[WAP-4]] or {{WAP-7]] loco pulls the train.\n\n==Route==\nThe train is particularly famous for non-stop run between [[Vijayawada]] and [[Chennai]], and it runs up to [[Visakhapatnam]] with two stops at [[Eluru]] and [[Rajamundry]]. The other stops are [[Berhampur|Brahmapur]], [[Jatani|Khurda Road]], [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Cuttack]], [[Bhadrak]], [[Balasore]] and [[Kharagpur]]. Hence, it has five stops in [[Andhra Pradesh]], seven in [[Odisha]], two in [[West Bengal]]. When it was introduced in 1977, it was a bi-weekly train & it had stops only at Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar & it used to bypass [[Cuttack]] and [[Khurda Road]] was a technical halt. It used to cover the journey that time in only 23 hrs 30 mins time. Timings that time were:- Howrah 17.15 hrs dep, Madras 16.45 hrs arrival next day. In return Madras 09.00 hrs dep, Howrah 08.30 hrs arr next day. Later many stops were introduced which slowed down this train by at least 3 hours. It had a distinct livery when it was introduced in 1977. On an experimental basis additional stops at [[Tadepalligudem]] (TDD), [[Andhra Pradesh]] is introduced since 2015.\n\n==Speed==\nThis train traverses the total distance of 1664&nbsp;km in a total time of 26 hours 00 minutes & 27 hrs 00 mins with the maximum speed of 120&nbsp;km/hr. it receives the highest priorities during its run from [[Howrah]] to [[Chennai]] and vice-versa\n\n==Bridges==\nThe train passes over some important rivers of India:\n#[[Creek]] in [[Ennore]] near [[Chennai]].\n#[[Penna]] river in [[Nellore]]\n#[[Paleru]] river in [[Ongole]].\n#[[Krishna]] river in [[Vijayawada]].\n#[[Godavari]] river in [[Rajahmundry]].\n#[[Nagavalli]] river in [[Srikakulam]]\n#[[Vamsadhara]] river in [[Srikakulam]]\n#[[Rushikulya]] river in [[Ganjam]]\n#[[Mahanadi river|Mahanadi]] in [[Cuttack]].\n#[[Kathjori]] river (Mahanadi distributary) in [[Cuttack]].\n#[[Kuakhai]] river (Mahanadi distributary) near [[Barang]].\n#[[Birupa]] river (Mahanadi distributary) near [[Kendrapara]].\n#[[Brahmani]] river in [[Jenapur]].\n#[[Baitarani]] river in [[Jajpur Keonjhar Rd.]].\n#[[Budhabalanga]] river in [[Balasore]]. \n#[[Subarnarekha]] river in [[Rupsa]]. \n#[[Rupnarayan]] river in [[Kolaghat]] near [[Mecheda]].\n#[[Damodar]] river near [[Bagnan]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Coromandal Express at Kharagpur.jpg|Coromandel Express halted at [[Kharagpur Junction]]\nFile:Coromandal Exp.

Schleicher was the first scholar to compose a text in PIE. The fable is entitled {{PIE|''Avis akv\u0101sas ka''}} (\"The Sheep [Ewe] and the Horses [Eoh]\"). At later dates, various scholars have published revised versions of Schleicher's fable, as the idea of what PIE should look like has changed over time. The fable may serve as an illustration of the significant changes that the reconstructed language has gone through during the last 150 years of scholarly efforts.\n\nThe first revision of Schleicher's fable was made by [[Hermann Hirt]] (published by Arntz in 1939). A second revision was published by [[Winfred P. Lehmann|Winfred Lehmann]] and [[Ladislav Zgusta]] in 1979.<ref>[http://www.ciep.fr/reform/genetique/genetique26.htm EXCURSUS : Une fable en indo-europ\u00e9en &#91;COMPARAISON 23&#93;]</ref> Another version by [[Douglas Q.

However, many other differences are to be explained by widely diverging views on the [[Phonology|phonological]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] systems of PIE.\n\n'''Schleicher'''{{'}}s reconstruction assumed that the ''o/e'' vocalism was secondary, and his version of PIE is much more closely based on [[Sanskrit]] than modern reconstructions.\n\n'''Hirt''' introduced the ''o/e'' vocalism, [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic resonants]], [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]]s and [[Velar|palatalized velars]].\n\n'''Lehmann and Zgusta''' introduced a few alternative lexemes (the relative pronoun ''{{PIE|k\u02b7esjo}}''; the word ''{{PIE|n\u0113r}}'' 'man'), and made some first steps into the direction of accepting [[laryngeals]]. Their text features an ''h'' (''{{PIE|wl\u0325hn\u0101}}'') for what they seem to accept as a single laryngeal of PIE.\n\n'''Adams''' was the first one to fully reflect the [[laryngeal theory]] in his version of the fable. Judging from the text, he seems to assume four different laryngeal [[phoneme]]s. Consequently, Adam's text no longer shows long ''\u0101''.\n\n'''Kortlandt'''{{'}}s version is a radical deviation from the prior texts in a number of ways. First, he followed the [[glottalic theory]], writing glottalic [[plosive]]s with a following apostrophe (''t\u2019'') and omitting aspirated voiced plosives. Second, he substitutes the abstract laryngeal signs with their supposed phonetic values: ''{{PIE|h<sub>1</sub>}}'' = ''{{PIE|\u0294}}'' ([[glottal stop]]), ''{{PIE|h<sub>2</sub>}}'' = ''{{PIE|\u0295}}'' ([[pharyngeal fricative]]), ''{{PIE|h<sub>3</sub>}}'' = ''{{PIE|\u0295\u02b7}}'' (pharyngeal fricative with lip rounding). Kortlandt also has a different opinion about ablaut grades in many verbal and nominal forms, compared to the other scholars.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPIE is used in a short dialogue between the human astronauts and an alien \"Engineer\" in [[Ridley Scott]]'s movie ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4008|title=Proto-Indo-European in Prometheus?| publisher=Languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu|date=2012-06-08|accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> In an early scene, the android 'David' (played by [[Michael Fassbender]]) practices reciting Schleicher's fable to the interactive computer, in preparation for first contact with the \"Engineers\".<ref>''Stu Holmes'', [http://thebioscopist.com/2012/06/20/the-linguistics-of-prometheus-what-david-says-to-the-engineer/ The Linguistics of Prometheus \u2014 What David Says to the Engineer]. // THE BIOSCOPIST. thebioscopist.com. \u2014 JUNE 20, 2012</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Serbo-Croatian language#Dialects|Serbo-Croatian language]] for a rendering of the fable into varieties of Serbo-Croatian\n*[[The king and the god]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Arntz, Helmut (ed.), Hirt, Hermann: ''Die Hauptprobleme der indogermanischen Sprachwissenschaft''.

Schleicher was the first scholar to compose a text in PIE. The fable is entitled {{PIE|''Avis akv\u0101sas ka''}} (\"The Sheep [Ewe] and the Horses [Eoh]\"). At later dates, various scholars have published revised versions of Schleicher's fable, as the idea of what PIE should look like has changed over time. The fable may serve as an illustration of the significant changes that the reconstructed language has gone through during the last 150 years of scholarly efforts.\n\nThe first revision of Schleicher's fable was made by [[Hermann Hirt]] (published by Arntz in 1939).

However, many other differences are to be explained by widely diverging views on the [[Phonology|phonological]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] systems of PIE.\n\n'''Schleicher'''{{'}}s reconstruction assumed that the ''o/e'' vocalism was secondary, and his version of PIE is much more closely based on [[Sanskrit]] than modern reconstructions.\n\n'''Hirt''' introduced the ''o/e'' vocalism, [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic resonants]], [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]]s and [[Velar|palatalized velars]].\n\n'''Lehmann and Zgusta''' introduced a few alternative lexemes (the relative pronoun ''{{PIE|k\u02b7esjo}}''; the word ''{{PIE|n\u0113r}}'' 'man'), and made some first steps into the direction of accepting [[laryngeals]]. Their text features an ''h'' (''{{PIE|wl\u0325hn\u0101}}'') for what they seem to accept as a single laryngeal of PIE.\n\n'''Adams''' was the first one to fully reflect the [[laryngeal theory]] in his version of the fable. Judging from the text, he seems to assume four different laryngeal [[phoneme]]s. Consequently, Adam's text no longer shows long ''\u0101''.\n\n'''Kortlandt'''{{'}}s version is a radical deviation from the prior texts in a number of ways. First, he followed the [[glottalic theory]], writing glottalic [[plosive]]s with a following apostrophe (''t\u2019'') and omitting aspirated voiced plosives. Second, he substitutes the abstract laryngeal signs with their supposed phonetic values: ''{{PIE|h<sub>1</sub>}}'' = ''{{PIE|\u0294}}'' ([[glottal stop]]), ''{{PIE|h<sub>2</sub>}}'' = ''{{PIE|\u0295}}'' ([[pharyngeal fricative]]), ''{{PIE|h<sub>3</sub>}}'' = ''{{PIE|\u0295\u02b7}}'' (pharyngeal fricative with lip rounding). Kortlandt also has a different opinion about ablaut grades in many verbal and nominal forms, compared to the other scholars.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPIE is used in a short dialogue between the human astronauts and an alien \"Engineer\" in [[Ridley Scott]]'s movie ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4008|title=Proto-Indo-European in Prometheus?| publisher=Languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu|date=2012-06-08|accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> In an early scene, the android 'David' (played by [[Michael Fassbender]]) practices reciting Schleicher's fable to the interactive computer, in preparation for first contact with the \"Engineers\".<ref>''Stu Holmes'', [http://thebioscopist.com/2012/06/20/the-linguistics-of-prometheus-what-david-says-to-the-engineer/ The Linguistics of Prometheus \u2014 What David Says to the Engineer]. // THE BIOSCOPIST. thebioscopist.com. \u2014 JUNE 20, 2012</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Serbo-Croatian language#Dialects|Serbo-Croatian language]] for a rendering of the fable into varieties of Serbo-Croatian\n*[[The king and the god]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Arntz, Helmut (ed.), Hirt, Hermann: ''Die Hauptprobleme der indogermanischen Sprachwissenschaft''.

It was built next to a level crossing on the road between Ketton and Collyweston.  The handsome station building was built in a Victorian ecclesiastical Tudor pattern of local stone and Collyweston tiles.  For good measure it included a small belfry though whether this was ever used is not known.  On the other platform was a smaller building in a combination of stone and timber.\n\nTo gain a more direct route, in 1879 the LNWR built a line from {{stnlnk|Seaton|Rutland}} to Yarwell junction near [[Wansford railway station|Wansford]] on its [[Northampton railway station|Northampton]] to [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] line, thus bypassing the section through Luffenham, though it continued to run a few trains.\n\nOn both sides of the double track were ample sidings, particularly on the down Peterborough side where three lines served a good shed and loading dock with a crane. Unusually, access to the three  minor sidings was by means of a wagon turntable rather than points.  There was a signal box on the other side of the road.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century the station saw six or seven Midland Railway trains per day and five LNWR trains between Seaton and Stamford. After the war this reduced to five a day on the Midland routes with a few on the branch from Seaton.\n\nAt [[Railways Act 1921|grouping]] in 1923 it became part of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]]. It received its final name in 1935.\n\nThe line from Seaton was closed and lifted in 1966, but the main Midland line is still in operation for trains from Leicester to Peterborough. The station buildings no longer exist.\n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{Rail line two routes |next=[[Stamford railway station|Stamford]]<br /><small>Line and station open</small> |previous=[[Luffenham railway station|Luffenham]]<br /><small>Line open, station closed</small> |route1=[[Midland Railway]]<br><small>Leicester to Peterborough line</small> |col1={{MR colour}}\n|route2=[[London and North Western Railway]]<br><small>Seaton branch</small> |col2={{LNWR colour}}}}\n{{rail end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#498,304,1 Ketton and Collyweston station on navigable 1946 O.

On the other platform was a smaller building in a combination of stone and timber.\n\nTo gain a more direct route, in 1879 the LNWR built a line from {{stnlnk|Seaton|Rutland}} to Yarwell junction near [[Wansford railway station|Wansford]] on its [[Northampton railway station|Northampton]] to [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] line, thus bypassing the section through Luffenham, though it continued to run a few trains.\n\nOn both sides of the double track were ample sidings, particularly on the down Peterborough side where three lines served a good shed and loading dock with a crane. Unusually, access to the three  minor sidings was by means of a wagon turntable rather than points.  There was a signal box on the other side of the road.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century the station saw six or seven Midland Railway trains per day and five LNWR trains between Seaton and Stamford. After the war this reduced to five a day on the Midland routes with a few on the branch from Seaton.\n\nAt [[Railways Act 1921|grouping]] in 1923 it became part of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]]. It received its final name in 1935.\n\nThe line from Seaton was closed and lifted in 1966, but the main Midland line is still in operation for trains from Leicester to Peterborough. The station buildings no longer exist.\n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{Rail line two routes |next=[[Stamford railway station|Stamford]]<br /><small>Line and station open</small> |previous=[[Luffenham railway station|Luffenham]]<br /><small>Line open, station closed</small> |route1=[[Midland Railway]]<br><small>Leicester to Peterborough line</small> |col1={{MR colour}}\n|route2=[[London and North Western Railway]]<br><small>Seaton branch</small> |col2={{LNWR colour}}}}\n{{rail end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#498,304,1 Ketton and Collyweston station on navigable 1946 O.

It controlled the [[Mongolian Plateau]] from 647 to 682.\n\nIt was first established as [[Khangai Mountains|Yanran]] at [[Shanyu Tai]], southwest of present-day [[Urad Middle Banner|Urat Middle Banner]], the northern slope of [[Lang Shan]]. This was later shifted to Hanhai and controlled by Uighurs instead of Han Chinese, around the banks of the [[Orkhon River]], and named from its namesakes for a short period before it was changed to Anbei. The seat of governance remained there until the year 687.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 646 the Tang dynasty conquered the Xuyantuo and on 9 January 647, thirteen Tiele and Uyghur tribes surrendered to the Tang. Tang Taizong organized them into six commanderies and seven tributary prefectures under the [[Jimi system]]. The six commanderies were Hanhai (\u7ff0\u6d77\u5e9c), Jinwei (\u91d1\u5fae\u5e9c), Yanran (\u71d5\u7136\u5e9c), Youling (\u5e7d\u9675\u5e9c), Guilin (\u9f9c\u6797\u5e9c), and Lushan (\u76e7\u5c71\u5e9c). The seven prefectures were Gaolan (\u7690\u862d\u5dde), Gaoque (\u9ad8\u95d5\u5dde), Jilu (\u96de\u9e7f\u5dde), Jitian (\u96de\u7530\u5dde), Yuxi (\u6986\u6eaa\u5dde), Dailin (\u8e5b\u6797\u5dde), and Douyan (\u7ac7\u984f\u5dde). Collectively these were known as the \"Cantian Khan Circuit.\" On 10 April the Yanran Protectorate was created at the foothills of the Shanyu Plateau, southwest of present-day [[Urad Middle Banner]], and governorship of the 13 tribes was handed over to the protector general, Li Suli (\u674e\u7d20\u7acb), who served from 647\u2013649.\n\nOn 5 February 663 the Yanran Protectorate was renamed Hanhai Protectorate.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=203}}\n\nIn August 669 the Hanhai Protectorate was renamed the Protectorate General to Pacify the North, otherwise known as the Anbei Duhufu.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} Its seat was relocated to the city of Datong in present-day [[Ejin Banner]].\n\nIn 687 the seat of Anbei was moved to the city of [[Xi'an]] near modern [[Minle County]] due to incursions by the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 698 the seat was moved to Yunzhong near modern [[Horinger]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 708 the seat of Anbei was moved to the western Shouxiang city near modern [[Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 714 the Anbei and Chanyu protectorates were separated. Chanyu was re-located to Yunzhong while Anbei was re-located to the middle [[Shouxian|Shouxiang]] city, near modern [[Baotou]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 749 the seat was moved to the military settlement of [[Hengshi, Hunan|Hengsai]], near modern-day Urad Middle Banner.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nDue to unfavorable farming conditions near the Hengsai settlement, [[Guo Ziyi]] resettled the army near modern [[Urad Front Banner]] in 755.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nFollowing the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], the Chanyu and Anbei protectorates lost any real authority and survived in name only. Due to the [[taboo]] of An Lushan's name, the Anbei Protectorate was renamed the [[Zhenbei Protectorate]] in 757, which has the meaning of \"Protectorate General to Suppress the North.\"{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 758 the Hengsai Army changed its name to [[Tiande Army]] and came under control of the [[Zhenwu Jiedushi]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=679}} \n\nIn 840 a group of [[Uyghurs]] attacked the Tiande Army.{{sfn|Drompp|2005|p=39}}\n\nIn 843 the Chanyu Protectorate was renamed back to Anbei Protectorate{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=82}}\n[[File:Tang Protectorates.png|thumb|260px|Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty.

The six commanderies were Hanhai (\u7ff0\u6d77\u5e9c), Jinwei (\u91d1\u5fae\u5e9c), Yanran (\u71d5\u7136\u5e9c), Youling (\u5e7d\u9675\u5e9c), Guilin (\u9f9c\u6797\u5e9c), and Lushan (\u76e7\u5c71\u5e9c). The seven prefectures were Gaolan (\u7690\u862d\u5dde), Gaoque (\u9ad8\u95d5\u5dde), Jilu (\u96de\u9e7f\u5dde), Jitian (\u96de\u7530\u5dde), Yuxi (\u6986\u6eaa\u5dde), Dailin (\u8e5b\u6797\u5dde), and Douyan (\u7ac7\u984f\u5dde). Collectively these were known as the \"Cantian Khan Circuit.\" On 10 April the Yanran Protectorate was created at the foothills of the Shanyu Plateau, southwest of present-day [[Urad Middle Banner]], and governorship of the 13 tribes was handed over to the protector general, Li Suli (\u674e\u7d20\u7acb), who served from 647-649.\n\nOn 5 February 663 the Yanran Protectorate was renamed Hanhai Protectorate.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=203}}\n\nIn August 669 the Hanhai Protectorate was renamed the Protectorate General to Pacify the North, otherwise known as the Anbei Duhufu.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} Its seat was relocated to the city of Datong in present day [[Ejin Banner]].\n\nIn 687 the seat of Anbei was moved to the city of [[Xi'an]] near modern [[Minle County]] due to incursions by the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 698 the seat was moved to Yunzhong near modern [[Horinger]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 708 the seat of Anbei was moved to the western Shouxiang city near modern [[Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 714 the Anbei and Chanyu protectorates were separated. Chanyu was re-located to Yunzhong while Anbei was re-located to the middle [[Shouxian|Shouxiang]] city, near modern [[Baotou]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 749 the seat was moved to the military settlement of [[Hengshi, Hunan|Hengsai]], near modern day Urad Middle Banner.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nDue to unfavorable farming conditions near the Hengsai settlement, [[Guo Ziyi]] resettled the army near modern [[Urad Front Banner]] in 755.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nFollowing the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], the Chanyu and Anbei protectorates lost any real authority and survived in name only. Due to the [[taboo]] of An Lushan's name, the Anbei Protectorate was renamed the [[Zhenbei Protectorate]] in 757, which has the meaning of \"Protectorate General to Suppress the North.\"{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 758 the Hengsai Army changed its name to [[Tiande Army]] and came under control of the [[Zhenwu Jiedushi]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=679}} \n\nIn 840 a group of [[Uyghurs]] attacked the Tiande Army.{{sfn|Drompp|2005|p=39}}\n\nIn 843 the Chanyu Protectorate was renamed back to Anbei Protectorate{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=82}}\n[[File:Tang Protectorates.png|thumb|260px|Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty.

Although most of these groups spoke different forms of [[Boro-Garo languages]] in historical times, today a majority of them speak Assamese. \n\nThe [[Bodo language]], one of the languages in the Boro-Garo group, has been recognised as an eighth scheduled Indian language since 2004.

The belief that Bodo-Kacharis were early settlers of the river valleys is taken from the fact that most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra valley today carry Tibeto-Burman names\u2014Dibang, Dihang, Dikhou, Dihing, Doiyang, Doigrung etc.\u2014where ''Di/Doi-'' means water in Boro-Garo languages.\n\nSome of the groups, such as Moran and Saraniya consider themselves as lower-caste Hindus under [[Ekasarana Dharma]]. Other groups, such as the Garo, Rabha, Lalung and Hajong having been isolated from the parental stock, have established separate identities. With the exception of the Garo, which is still a matrilineal society, the other groups do not follow rules of matrilineal society.\n\nThe Mech in Western Assam, the Boro in central Assam; the Dimasa in Dima Hasao District (DHD) formerly North Cachar Hills, Cachar district and Nagaland state and the Sonowal and Thengal in the eastern part of the Brahmaputra now represent the Kachari.\n\n==Etymologies==\n===Bodo===\nThe term ''Bodo'' was published by [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Hodgson]] in 1847, to denote the [[Mech tribe|Mech]] people of Darjeeling district and their language,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{harv|Narjinari|2000|p=4}}{{harv|Grierson|1903|p=1}}</ref> though this term was never used in the sources of history of Assam.<ref>\"The term Bodo was first used by Brian H Hodgson in his book ''On the Koch, Bodo and Dhimal Tribes'' in 1847 and no reference of the term is seen in any sources in the history of Assam.\" {{harvcol|Bathari|2014|p=14}}</ref> [[George Abraham Grierson|Grierson]] took this term to denote a section of the Assam-Burma group of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] speakers of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] speech family,{{sfn|Choudhury|2007|p=1}} which included the languages of (1) Mech; (2) Rabha; (3) Lalung (Tiwa); (4) Dimasa (Hills Kachari); (5) Garo (6) Tiprasa and (7) Chutiya.{{sfn|Grierson|1903|p=2}} Over time, for anthropological and linguistic purposes, ''Bodo'' came to denote all people in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh that spoke related languages now or in the past, or claimed a shared ancestry.<ref>\"[I]t seems that the term Bodo is used particularly to denote sections of people having an agnatic relationship in terms of speech practices and a strong sense of shared ancestry.

Some Dimasa scholars opined that they were also known as Bodosa at some point of time in History<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69516/7/07_chapter%202.pdf The Dimasa were known as Bodosa who migrated to Dimapur region and settled on the banks of Dhansiri, and later came to be known as Dimasa]</ref>\n\n===Chutiya-Burok===\n{{main|Chutiya people}}\nAmong [[Chutiya people|Chutias]], Burok means noble/great men. The Buroks formed a major part of the tribe. The Chutias who were thought to be healthy and strong was termed as Burok and took up the administrative and military roles in the Chutia kingdom. All Chutia royalty belonged to the Burok clan. Even the Motok king [[Sarbananada Singha|Sarbananda Singha]] belonged to the Burok Chutia clan.<ref>[http://atributetosankaradeva.org/mayamara.pdf Nath, D. ''The Mataks and their Revolt'', p.13]</ref> Surnames like Bora, Borha, Borua have their origins in the Chutia kingdom and are related to Bara/Bodo/Buruk only. There is mention of Manik Chandra Barua, Dhela Bora, Borhuloi Barua as commanders of Chutia army. Later the Ahoms adopted the title after the downfall of Chutias.<ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 145, Surnames like Bora, Saikia, Kataki, Tamuli,etc. were found in Chutia kingdom. It is clearly stated in the Deodhai Buranji that when Ahom king Suhungmung attacked the Chutia kingdom on the banks of Dihing river, the Chutia army was led by one Manik Chandra Baruah. The surname \"Neog\" was probably derived from the Chutia \"Nayak\" whose duty was the same. Deori folklores also mention the myths behind the creation of each of these titles. For instance, \"Bora\" was said to be derived from the \"Buruk\" clan and acted either as a military official or a temple guard...</ref><ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 129, The Chutia army was led by Borhuloi Borua and Dhela Bora.</ref>\n\n===Moran-Bodousa===\nThe Morans called their leader/chief as Bodousa (great son) where 'sa' means child or son in Moran language . The origin folklore of the Morans is same as that of Boruk Chutias which indicate that they were a faction which split at an early time.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69486/9/09_chapter%202.pdf Moran chief Badaucha]</ref> They were also known as Habungiya or earth-folk or autochthones which means son of soil<ref>{{Harvcol|Endle|1911|p=88}}</ref>\n\n===Deori-Burok===\nThe Deoris (who were priests by profession) also have the Burok clan among them.\n\n===Twipuri-Borok===\nThe Tripuris often call themselves Boroks and their language is called Kokborok.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69486/9/09_chapter%202.pdf Tripuris are called Boroks]</ref>\n\n===Reang-Bru===\nThe Reang people of Assam, Tripura and Mizoram call themselves Bru which means \"great men\".\n\n==Origins==\nThey were first classified by S. Endle as the Kacharis. They are considered to have reached the Brahmaputra valley via Tibet and South China, and settled in the foothills of the eastern Himalayan range which includes the whole of Assam, Tripura, North Bengal and parts of Bangladesh. That the Bodo-Kacharis were early colonizers of the river valleys is taken from the fact that most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra valley today carry Tibeto-Burman names \u2014 Dibang, Dihang, Dikhou, Dihing, etc. \u2014 where Di- means water in [[Bodo language|Bodo]]/Deori-Chutia, Moran, Dimasa, other dialects Bodo languages.

The Buroks formed a major part of the tribe. The Chutias who were thought to be healthy and strong was termed as Burok and took up the administrative and military roles in the Chutia kingdom. All Chutia royalty belonged to the Burok clan. Even the Motok king [[Sarbananada Singha|Sarbananda Singha]] belonged to the Burok Chutia clan.<ref>[http://atributetosankaradeva.org/mayamara.pdf Nath, D. ''The Mataks and their Revolt'', p.13]</ref> Surnames like Bora, Borha, Borua have their origins in the Chutia kingdom and are related to Bara/Bodo/Buruk only. There is mention of Manik Chandra Barua, Dhela Bora, Borhuloi Barua as commanders of Chutia army. Later the Ahoms adopted the title after the downfall of Chutias.<ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 145, Surnames like Bora, Saikia, Kataki, Tamuli,etc. were found in Chutia kingdom. It is clearly stated in the Deodhai Buranji that when Ahom king Suhungmung attacked the Chutia kingdom on the banks of Dihing river, the Chutia army was led by one Manik Chandra Baruah. The surname \"Neog\" was probably derived from the Chutia \"Nayak\" whose duty was the same. Deori folklores also mention the myths behind the creation of each of these titles. For instance, \"Bora\" was said to be derived from the \"Buruk\" clan and acted either as a military official or a temple guard...</ref><ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 129, The Chutia army was led by Borhuloi Borua and Dhela Bora.</ref>\n\n===Moran-Bodousa===\nThe Morans called their leader/chief as Bodousa (great son) where 'sa' means child or son in Moran language .

Endle as the Kacharis. They are considered to have reached the Brahmaputra valley via Tibet and South China, and settled in the foothills of the eastern Himalayan range which includes the whole of Assam, Tripura, North Bengal and parts of Bangladesh. That the Bodo-Kacharis were early colonizers of the river valleys is taken from the fact that most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra valley today carry Tibeto-Burman names \u2014 Dibang, Dihang, Dikhou, Dihing, etc. \u2014 where Di- means water in [[Bodo language|Bodo]]/Deori-Chutia, Moran, Dimasa, other dialects Bodo languages. (\"Ti\" in Lalung (Tiwa) language, \"Twi\" in Tripuri language, \"Dwi\" in 8th scheduled Boro & \"Chi\" in Garo). There are many places name given by Bodo-Kachari people are Dispur, Dinajpur, Dimapur, Dibrugarh, Hajo, Mongoldoi, Diphu etc.\n\n==Groups==\nBased on an 1881 census, there were 19 groups within the Kachari\nclassification:\n#[[Boro Tribe|Boro]]\n#[[Chutia people|Chutiya]]\n#[[Dhimal]]\n#[[Garo people|Garo]]\n#[[Hajong people|Hajong]]\n#[[Koch people|Koch]]\n#[[Lalung]] (Tiwa)\n# Mech\n#\tMoran\n#       Modahi\n#\tPhulgaria\n#[[Deuri people|Deuri]]\n#\t[[Rabha tribe|Rabha]]\n#\t[[Sonowal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Sarania kachari|Sarania Kachari]]\n#\tSolaimiya\n#       [[Thengal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Tripuri people|Tiprasa]] \u2013 [[Bru Tribe |Bru]]([[Reang]]) , Jamatia, Uchai, Noatia(Tripura), Debbarma, Murasing, Roaza, etc.\n\nSome of the groups, such as Moran and Sarania consider themselves as lower-caste Hindus.

Consequently, the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Kingdom]] was added, bringing the total number of major factions to four.\n\n*This game's Musou mode is not character based but kingdom based.\n*The Renbu combat system has been removed, replaced by the return to the familiar charge system, which allows players to end increasingly longer combos with a charge attack of varying effect depending on the current situation. Characters are also allowed to wield more than one weapon during battle, with the ability to execute a special attack upon switching. In addition, both aerial musou attacks (depending on the character) and certain aerial combos have been introduced. Players will still be able to adjust the camera angle.\n*Character and weapon level development/customisation can now be done during battle. Players can also choose to switch their equipped weapons during battle and can obtain new weapons by defeating officers.\n*Characters have a special attack with a weapon indicated with an EX icon. The EX attack uses a sequence of attacks and/or charge attacks, and the result will vary with most characters. Characters also have 2 musou attacks that they perform using their Ex Weapon which can consist of grapples, midair, charges, quick/heavy strikes or a combo of hits performed in certain ways.\n*An additional mode known as Conquest Mode (Chronicle Mode for the Japanese version) has been incorporated into the game. Gameplay features include a player-forged path through China in which the player can also choose to play \"Other\" characters in the kingdom, due to the fact that they have not been given their own story in Story Mode. Conquest Mode will also feature both online and offline co-operative play. This mode also replaces the old Free Mode present in previous titles.\n*The morale bar has been removed from the visual interface; however, the morale system itself still remains and will be reflected from the messages of officers and their respective facial expressions (neutral, happy, sad, angry etc.) when said message appears.\n*Some of the major battles are split into two parts, so the player can have a different perspectives of the battle. One example would be in Shu's [[Battle of Changban|Changban]] stage \u2014 the first part concentrating on Zhao Yun and the second part on Zhang Fei.\n*Swimming and climbing ladders from the previous ''[[Dynasty Warriors 6]]'' are once again present.\n* The Weapon system has been changed dramatically from previous titles and players can now choose up to 10 or 11 weapons from each weapon category, unique Weapons are once again available after being cut from ''Dynasty Warriors 6''\n*Support animals which aid players in battle are included in this installment \u2014 some will follow and battle with the player; some can be ridden. Available animals are horses, bears, pandas, elephants, wolves, tigers and falcons.\n*Downloadable Content will be available. Content will include stages, music and costumes from previous games and some original costumes plus new weapons and the option to use the original Japanese Voices.\n\n===Characters===\n''* Denotes new characters to the series''<br>\n''** Denotes characters added in Dynasty Warriors 7: Xtreme Legends''<br>\n''*** Denotes characters added in Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires''<br>\n'''Bold''' ''denotes default characters''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The game features 3 new characters, only for [[Wei (state)|Wei]]: [[Guo Jia]] (who won a poll conducted by Famitsu), [[Wang Yi (wife of Zhao Ang)|Wang Yi]], and [[Pang De]] (who returns to the flagship title for the first time since ''[[Dynasty Warriors 5]]''). The game features the ability to port saved data from ''Dynasty Warriors 7'', and the MIX-JOY system allows new modes and weapons from Xtreme Legends to be combined with those from ''Dynasty Warriors 7''. Free Mode returns, along with a co-op Story Mode, both of which were absent in ''Dynasty Warriors 7''. Two more modes, Challenge Mode and Legend Mode, are added. It was released on September 29, 2011 in Japan, November 15, 2011 in United States, and November 18, 2011 in Europe as a PlayStation 3 exclusive title. Thus far, there have been no plans to release the game on other platforms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeiwarriors.co.uk/dw7-xtremelegends.php |title=A site for KOEI Information.

As with other ''Empires'' expansion, the game is more focused on political and tactical battle system.

Consequently, the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Kingdom]] was added, bringing the total number of major factions to four.\n\n*This game's Musou mode is not character based but kingdom based.\n*The Renbu combat system has been removed, replaced by the return to the familiar charge system, which allows players to end increasingly longer combos with a charge attack of varying effect depending on the current situation. Characters are also allowed to wield more than one weapon during battle, with the ability to execute a special attack upon switching. In addition, both aerial musou attacks (depending on the character) and certain aerial combos have been introduced. Players will still be able to adjust the camera angle.\n*Character and weapon level development/customisation can now be done during battle. Players can also choose to switch their equipped weapons during battle and can obtain new weapons by defeating officers.\n*Characters have a special attack with a weapon indicated with an EX icon. The EX attack uses a sequence of attacks and/or charge attacks, and the result will vary with most characters. Characters also have 2 musou attacks that they perform using their Ex Weapon which can consist of grapples, midair, charges, quick/heavy strikes or a combo of hits performed in certain ways.\n*An additional mode known as Conquest Mode (Chronicle Mode for the Japanese version) has been incorporated into the game. Gameplay features include a player-forged path through China in which the player can also choose to play \"Other\" characters in the kingdom, due to the fact that they have not been given their own story in Story Mode. Conquest Mode will also feature both online and offline co-operative play. This mode also replaces the old Free Mode present in previous titles.\n*The morale bar has been removed from the visual interface; however, the morale system itself still remains and will be reflected from the messages of officers and their respective facial expressions (neutral, happy, sad, angry etc.) when said message appears.\n*Some of the major battles are split into two parts, so the player can have a different perspectives of the battle. One example would be in Shu's [[Battle of Changban|Changban]] stage \u2014 the first part concentrating on Zhao Yun and the second part on Zhang Fei.\n*Swimming and climbing ladders from the previous ''[[Dynasty Warriors 6]]'' are once again present.\n* The Weapon system has been changed dramatically from previous titles and players can now choose up to 10 or 11 weapons from each weapon category, unique Weapons are once again available after being cut from ''Dynasty Warriors 6''\n*Support animals which aid players in battle are included in this installment \u2014 some will follow and battle with the player; some can be ridden. Available animals are horses, bears, pandas, elephants, wolves, tigers and falcons.\n*Downloadable Content will be available. Content will include stages, music and costumes from previous games and some original costumes plus new weapons and the option to use the original Japanese Voices.\n\n===Characters===\n''* Denotes new characters to the series''<br>\n''** Denotes characters added in Dynasty Warriors 7: Xtreme Legends''<br>\n''*** Denotes characters added in Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires''<br>\n'''Bold''' ''denotes default characters''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He scored the game 5/10.<ref>{{cite web|author= Colin Moriarty |url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/115/1158577p1.html |title=Dynasty Warriors 7 Review - PlayStation 3 Review at IGN |publisher=Ps3.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15}}</ref>\n\n''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine was quite less critical, and awarded the game a total of 36/40, composed of a 9/9/9/9 score and was considered a great improvement over previous titles.

It was released on August 25, 2012. During E3, Koei announced that the game will not be sold overseas, but that a new Dynasty Warriors game called ''[[Dynasty Warriors Next]]'' was in development for PS Vita and will be sold overseas instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2011-playstation-vita/715020 |title=PlayStation Vita Video Game, E3 2011: Games Montage (Stream) &#124; Video Clip &#124; Game Trailers & Videos |publisher=GameTrailers.com |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2011-12-15}}</ref>\n\nOn the 29th of June, [[Famitsu Magazine]] released information about the new ''Dynasty Warriors 7 Xtreme Legends''. The game features 3 new characters, only for [[Wei (state)|Wei]]: [[Guo Jia]] (who won a poll conducted by Famitsu), [[Wang Yi (wife of Zhao Ang)|Wang Yi]], and [[Pang De]] (who returns to the flagship title for the first time since ''[[Dynasty Warriors 5]]''). The game features the ability to port saved data from ''Dynasty Warriors 7'', and the MIX-JOY system allows new modes and weapons from Xtreme Legends to be combined with those from ''Dynasty Warriors 7''. Free Mode returns, along with a co-op Story Mode, both of which were absent in ''Dynasty Warriors 7''. Two more modes, Challenge Mode and Legend Mode, are added. It was released on September 29, 2011 in Japan, November 15, 2011 in United States, and November 18, 2011 in Europe as a PlayStation 3 exclusive title. Thus far, there have been no plans to release the game on other platforms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeiwarriors.co.uk/dw7-xtremelegends.php |title=A site for KOEI Information.

However, their dual-weapon ability is removed and characters are fixed to wield certain weapon types.\n\nIn May 2012, the ''Empires'' expansion for the game was announced to be released on PlayStation 3 on November 8, 2012 in Japan. As with other ''Empires'' expansion, the game is more focused on political and tactical battle system. It includes a new character named Xu Shu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/1205/game120529b.shtml |title=Shin Sangoku Musou 6 Empires [Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires] |publisher=The Magic Box |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}</ref> The game was also released in North America and Europe on February 26<ref name=\"DW7E NA date\" /> and 22, 2013<ref name=\"DW7E EU date\" /> respectively, though the game only translates the texts while still using the original Japanese dubs.
