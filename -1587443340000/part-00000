It is the peacetime equivalent of the [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), and is awarded for the \"most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent valour or self-sacrifice\" other than in the face of the enemy. The decoration may be awarded either to military or civilian personnel.\n\nFlt. Lt. [[Suhas Biswas]] was the first [[Indian Air Force]] officer to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra<!--wasn't he the first person of any description?  why single out the air force?-->. Subsequent awards of the Ashoka Chakra are recognized by a bar to the medal ribbon. A recipient can be awarded the [[Kirti Chakra]] or [[Shaurya Chakra]] in addition for separate acts of gallantry.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe medal was originally established on 4 January 1952 as the \"Ashoka Chakra, Class I\" as the first step of a three-class sequence of non-combatant bravery decorations. In 1967, these decorations were removed from the \"class-based\" system and renamed as the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. This is an important point in understanding the independent Indian view of decorations. It would also lead to changes in the Padma Vibhushan series, the distinguished service medal series, the life saving medal series, and the Defence Security Corps medal series.\n\nFrom 1 February 1999, the central government instituted a monthly stipend for Ashoka Chakra recipients of Rs. 1400. Jammu and Kashmir awarded a cash award of Rs. 1500 for recipients of this award.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n'''Obverse:''' Circular gold gilt, 1-3/8&nbsp;inches in diameter. In the center, the chakra (wheel) of Ashoka, surrounded by a lotus wreath and with an ornate edge. Suspended by a straight bar suspender. The medal is named on the edge.\n\n'''Reverse:''' Blank in the center, with \"Ashoka Chakra\" in [[Hindi]] along the upper edge on the medal and the same name in English along the lower rim. On either side is a lotus design. The center is blank, perhaps with the intent that details of the award be engraved there. There is no indication of the class on the pre-1967 awards, and, in fact, there is no difference between these medals & the post-1967 awards.\n\n'''Ribbon:''' 32&nbsp;mm, dark green with a 2&nbsp;mm central saffron stripe.\n\nTo date, 83 people have been awarded the \"Ashoka Chakra\".</small><ref name=\"gallantryawards.gov.in\"/><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref><!--have any been awarded a bar?-->\n\n== Ashoka Chakra recipients ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n|align=center style=\"width:50px;background-color:#e3d9ff;\"|{{Hash}}\n|Indicates a posthumous honour\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ List of award recipients, showing the year\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n!Rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient\n!Branch\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |{{Tooltip|Refs.|Reference}}\n|-\n| 2019 \n|[[Lance naik|Lance Naik]]||[[ Nazir Ahmad Wani]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref>{{cite web|title=411 Republic Day Gallantry and Other Defence Decorations Announced|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=187777|website=pib.nic.in}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018 \n|[[Corporal]]||[[Jyoti Prakash Nirala]] #\n|[[Indian Air Force|Indian Airforce]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2018\"/<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref>\n|-\n| 2017 \n|[[Havildar]]||[[Hangpan Dada]]#\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| 2016 \n|[[Lance naik|Lance Naik]]||[[Lance Naik Mohan Goswami|Mohan Goswami]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2014\n|[[Major]]||[[Mukund Varadarajan]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|[[Naik (military rank)|Naik]]||[[Neeraj Kumar Singh]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|[[Sub-inspector|Sub-Inspector]]||[[K.

Posthoumesly.\n}}\n\nThe '''Ashoka Chakra''' (alternative spelling: '''Ashok Chakra''') is India's highest peacetime [[military decoration]] awarded for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice away from the battlefield. It is the peacetime equivalent of the [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), and is awarded for the \"most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent valour or self-sacrifice\" other than in the face of the enemy. The decoration may be awarded either to military or civilian personnel.\n\nFlt. Lt. [[Suhas Biswas]] was the first [[Indian Air Force]] officer to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra<!--wasn't he the first person of any description?  why single out the air force?-->. Subsequent awards of the Ashoka Chakra are recognized by a bar to the medal ribbon. A recipient can be awarded the [[Kirti Chakra]] or [[Shaurya Chakra]] in addition for separate acts of gallantry.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe medal was originally established on 4 January 1952 as the \"Ashoka Chakra, Class I\" as the first step of a three-class sequence of non-combatant bravery decorations. In 1967, these decorations were removed from the \"class-based\" system and renamed as the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. This is an important point in understanding the independent Indian view of decorations. It would also lead to changes in the Padma Vibhushan series, the distinguished service medal series, the life saving medal series, and the Defence Security Corps medal series.\n\nFrom 1 February 1999, the central government instituted a monthly stipend for Ashoka Chakra recipients of Rs. 1400. Jammu and Kashmir awarded a cash award of Rs. 1500 for recipients of this award.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n'''Obverse:''' Circular gold gilt, 1-3/8&nbsp;inches in diameter. In the center, the chakra (wheel) of Ashoka, surrounded by a lotus wreath and with an ornate edge. Suspended by a straight bar suspender. The medal is named on the edge.\n\n'''Reverse:''' Blank in the center, with \"Ashoka Chakra\" in [[Hindi]] along the upper edge on the medal and the same name in English along the lower rim. On either side is a lotus design. The center is blank, perhaps with the intent that details of the award be engraved there. There is no indication of the class on the pre-1967 awards, and, in fact, there is no difference between these medals & the post-1967 awards.\n\n'''Ribbon:''' 32&nbsp;mm, dark green with a 2&nbsp;mm central saffron stripe.\n\nTo date, 83 people have been awarded the \"Ashoka Chakra\".</small><ref name=\"gallantryawards.gov.in\"/><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref><!--have any been awarded a bar?-->\n\n== Ashoka Chakra recipients ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n|align=center style=\"width:50px;background-color:#e3d9ff;\"|{{Hash}}\n|Indicates a posthumous honour\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ List of award recipients, showing the year\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n!Rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient\n!Branch\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |{{Tooltip|Refs.|Reference}}\n|-\n| 2019 \n|[[Lance naik|Lance Naik]]||[[ Nazir Ahmad Wani]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref>{{cite web|title=411 Republic Day Gallantry and Other Defence Decorations Announced|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=187777|website=pib.nic.in}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018 \n|[[Corporal]]||[[Jyoti Prakash Nirala]] #\n|[[Indian Air Force|Indian Airforce]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2018\"/<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref>\n|-\n| 2017 \n|[[Havildar]]||[[Hangpan Dada]]#\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| 2016 \n|[[Lance naik|Lance Naik]]||[[Lance Naik Mohan Goswami|Mohan Goswami]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2014\n|[[Major]]||[[Mukund Varadarajan]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|[[Naik (military rank)|Naik]]||[[Neeraj Kumar Singh]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|[[Sub-inspector|Sub-Inspector]]||[[K.

Students falling behind would struggle even more as they would receive less support from teacher who are helping other students. Students who are ahead also need more assistance that they would not receive. This would cause ahead students to start falling behind. They would feel unintelligent as they aren't able to learn the topics. Others say that having separate classes for students with different skill levels would be more beneficial.  Maths Pathways is also causes unhealthy competition. It causes students to compare their grades and some might be discouraged. Some teachers post their students' growth rate on a wall which may make students who are ahead or behind to feel unhappy as they aren't able to do as many modules since their modules are a bit difficult for them. While on the other hand An overwhelming majority of students using this program just add modules that they don't understand to their test and simply just cheat in the test. This flawed system allows students to cheat during a test with ease. This would allow students to raise their growth rate significantly without having to learn anything. Students' grades might be up, but the skill level wouldn't be as their grade says. \n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.mathspathway.com}}\n\n[[Category:Educational math software]]\n[[Category:Australian companies established in 2015]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2015]]\n[[Category:Australian educational websites]]\n[[Category:Online companies of Australia]]\n[[Category:Privately held companies of Australia]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Education companies of Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Orphan|date=November 2019}}\n\n'''Maths Pathway''' is an [[Educational technology|online educational]] [[website]] based in [[Melbourne]], used in Australian [[school]]s to teach [[mathematics]].

Both hardcore punk and post-hardcore are genres of punk rock. --->[[punk rock]] band formed in 1976 in [[Hermosa Beach, California]]. Initially called Panic, the band was established by [[Greg Ginn]], the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes in the band. They are widely considered to be one of the first [[hardcore punk]] bands, as well as one of the pioneers of {{nowrap|[[post-hardcore]].}} After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag reunited in 2003 and again in 2013.<ref name=reunion>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=185346 |title=Black Flag Is Back |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> The second reunion lasted well over a year, during which they released their first studio album in over two decades, ''[[What The\u2026]]'' (2013).

The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] and [[Counterculture|nonconformist]] message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of [[social isolation]], [[neurosis]], [[poverty]], and [[paranoia]]. These themes were explored further when [[Henry Rollins]] joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's independent record label [[SST Records]].\n\nOver the course of the 1980s, Black Flag's sound, as well as their notoriety, evolved in ways that both embraced and alienated much of their early audience. As well as being central to the creation of hardcore punk, they were innovators in the first wave of American West Coast punk rock and are considered a key influence on punk subculture in the United States and abroad. Along with being among the earliest punk rock groups to incorporate elements and the influence of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] melodies and rhythm, there were often overt freestyles, [[free jazz]], [[breakbeat]] and [[contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]] elements in their sound, especially in Ginn's guitar playing, and the band interspersed records and performances with instrumentals throughout their career. They also played longer, slower, and more complex songs at a time when other bands in their milieu performed a raw, fast, [[three-chord song|three-chord]] format. As a result, their extensive discography is more stylistically varied than many of their punk rock contemporaries.\n\nBlack Flag has been well-respected within the [[punk subculture]], primarily for their tireless promotion of an autonomous [[DIY punk ethic]] and aesthetic. They are often regarded as pioneers in the movement of [[Underground music|underground]] [[independent record label|do-it-yourself record labels]] that flourished among 1980s punk rock bands. Through constant touring throughout the United States and Canada, and occasionally Europe, Black Flag established a dedicated [[cult following]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1976\u201381)===\nInitially called Panic, Black Flag was formed in 1976 in [[Hermosa Beach, California]] located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles. Ginn insisted that the band rehearse several hours a day.<ref name=guitarworld>Grad, David. \"Fade to Black.\" ''Spin''. July 1997</ref> This work ethic proved too challenging for some early members; Ginn and singer [[Keith Morris]] had an especially difficult time finding a reliable bass guitarist, and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor that contributed to the development of Ginn's distinctive guitar sound. Ginn's brother [[Raymond Pettibon]] and SST house record producer-to-be [[Spot (producer)|Spot]] filled in during rehearsals. In the beginning, Ginn and Morris were inspired by the raw, stripped-down attitude of bands such as the [[Ramones]] and [[the Stooges]]. Ginn has said \"We were influenced by the Stooges and then the Ramones; they inspired us. Keith and myself saw the Ramones when they first toured LA in 1976. After we saw them, I said if they could do it we could do it. I thought Keith would be a good singer and after seeing the Ramones, it made him think that he doesn't have to be some classical operatic singer.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Stay Thirsty Media, Inc.

The band held their first performance in December 1977 in [[Redondo Beach, California]]. To avoid confusion with another band called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in late 1978.<ref name=guitarworld/> They played their first show under this name on January 27, 1979, at the Moose Lodge Hall in Redondo Beach, California.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALLEYCATS AT THE MOOSE LODGE|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/alleycats-at-the-moose-lodge-1979-01-27|work=It All Happened \u2013 A Living History of Live Music|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> This was the first time [[Dez Cadena]] saw the band perform.\n\nThe name was suggested by Ginn's brother, artist [[Raymond Pettibon]], who also designed the band's logo: a stylized black flag represented as four black bars.<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0u04EqNVjo|work=The Art of Punk|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Pettibon stated \"If a white flag means surrender, a black flag represents anarchy.\" Their new name was reminiscent of the [[Anarchist symbolism|anarchist symbol]], [[Black Flag (insecticide)|the insecticide of the same name]], and of the British heavy metal band [[Black Sabbath]], one of Ginn's favorite bands.

Pettibon also created much of their cover artwork.\n\nThere were few opportunities for [[punk rock]] bands to perform in [[Southern California]]. (Los Angeles club [[The Masque]] was the center of the L.A. punk scene, but was also rather parochial, and did not often admit bands from outside L.A. proper.) Black Flag organized their own gigs, performing at picnics, house parties, schools; any place that was available. They called club owners themselves to arrange appearances, and plastered hundreds of flyers\u2014usually Pettibon's severe, haunting [[comic strip]] style panels\u2014on any available surface to publicize performances. Dukowski reported that the \"minimum [number of flyers] that went out was 500 for a show.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = A 12-Step Program in Self-Reliance | work = LA Weekly | url = http://www.laweekly.com/ink/01/31/2001:-babcock.php | accessdate = May 27, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030215101616/https://www.laweekly.com/ink/01/31/2001:-babcock.php | archivedate = February 15, 2003 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough Ginn was the band's leader, special note should be made to Dukowski's contributions to Black Flag. Ginn was tireless and profoundly disciplined; however, he was also rather quiet. Dukowski's intelligent, fast-talking, high-energy persona attracted significant attention, and he was often Black Flag's spokesman to the press. Dukowski acted as the group's tour manager even after he no longer performed with them, and he was likely as important as Ginn in establishing the band's [[DIY punk ethic]] and demanding work ethic. Dukowski's bass guitar was a vital part of the early Black Flag sound; \"[[TV Party (EP)|TV Party]]\" for instance, was one of many songs \"driven more by Chuck Dukowski's percolating bass line than Ginn's stun-gun guitar.\"<ref name=\"Song review \u2013 TV Party\">{{cite web | title = Song review \u2013 TV Party | work=Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2281479|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nMorris performed as vocalist on Black Flag's earliest recordings, and his energized, manic stage presence was pivotal in the band earning a reputation in Southern California. Migdol was replaced by the enigmatic Colombian drummer [[Robo (musician)|Robo]], whose numerous clicking metallic bracelets became part of his drum sound.

With Reyes, Black Flag recorded the ''Jealous Again'' 12-inch EP and appeared in the film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]''. This was also the line-up that toured up and down the West Coast for the first time, the version most fans outside of L.A. first saw.\n\nIn 1980, Reyes quit Black Flag mid-performance at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach because of escalating violence.

With Cadena on board, Black Flag began national touring in earnest, and arguably saw two peaks: first as a commercial draw (they sold out the 3,500-seat [[Santa Monica]] Civic Auditorium, a feat they were never able to manage again); and second, perhaps seeing the peak of attention from police in the Los Angeles area, due to the violence associated with Black Flag and punk rock in general. The band members have often insisted, however, that the police instigated far more problems than they solved.\n\nBy the summer of 1981, however, Cadena's voice was worn. He had no formal training or previous experience as a singer, and had severely strained his voice during Black Flag's nonstop touring, and he wanted to play guitar rather than perform vocals.\n\n===Rollins era (1981\u20131985)===\nTwenty-year-old fan [[Henry Rollins]] (birth name Henry Garfield)\u2014then living in Washington, D.C. and singing for hardcore band [[State of Alert]]. S.O.A. drummer Ivor Hanson had a father who was a top [[admiral]] in the [[US Navy]] and his family shared living quarters with the [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[United States Naval Observatory]]. The band held their practices there and would have to be let in by [[United States Secret Service]] agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119194742/https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archivedate=November 19, 2018 |title=An incomplete oral history of Henry Rollins' D.C. years |first=Ryan |last=Kearney |date=February 9, 2012 |work=[[WJLA-TV]] |access-date=November 19, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nS.O.A. had corresponded with Black Flag, and met them when they performed on the U.S. east coast. At an impromptu show at A7 in New York City, he asked the band to perform \"Clocked In\", and the band offered to let him sing the song. Since vocalist Dez Cadena was switching to guitar, the band then invited Rollins to audition. Impressed by his stage demeanor, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist.<ref>''American Hardcore''. Dir. Paul Rachman. AHC Productions LLC, 2006. Film.</ref> Despite some doubts, he accepted, due in part to [[Ian MacKaye]]'s encouragement. Rollins acted as [[roadie]] for the remainder of the tour while learning Black Flag's songs during sound checks and encores, while Cadena crafted guitar parts that meshed with Ginn's. Rollins also impressed Black Flag with his broad musical interests during an era when punk rock music and fans were increasingly factionalized; he introduced Black Flag to Washington D.C.'s [[go-go]], a distinctive take on [[funk music]].\n\nRollins was Black Flag's longest-lasting vocalist. When he joined Black Flag, he brought a different attitude and perspective than previous singers. Some earlier songs, such as \"Six Pack\" (a song written about original singer Keith Morris) blended a sense of black humor with driving punk rock. Rollins was an intense performer, who usually appeared onstage wearing only shorts. Ginn once stated that after Rollins joined, \"We couldn't do songs with a sense of humor anymore; he got into the serious way-out poet thing.\"<ref name=\"Song review \u2013 TV Party\" /> In an interview, Rollins stated that the band was influenced by heavy metal via the band [[Black Sabbath]].<ref>[http://www.exhibitagallery.com/blog/2010/05/metal-of-honor-interview-henry-rollins-former-lead-singer-of-black-flag/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911081830/http://www.exhibitagallery.com/blog/2010/05/metal-of-honor-interview-henry-rollins-former-lead-singer-of-black-flag/ |date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename= BlackFlagNervousBreakdown.ogg\n|title=Nervous Breakdown\n|description= Sample of Black Flag \"Nervous Breakdown\" from ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' EP (1978)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{Listen\n|filename=BlackFlagSlipItIn.ogg\n|title=Slip It In\n|description= Sample of Black Flag \"Slip It In\" from ''[[Slip It In]]'' (1984)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nWith Rollins, Black Flag began work on their first full-length album. The sessions for the album (chronicled in [[Michael Azerrad]]'s book ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'') were a source of conflict between the band and engineer/producer [[Spot (producer)|Spot]], who had worked with the band and the [[SST Records|SST]] label since their early years. Spot had already recorded many of the ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'' tracks with Dez Cadena on vocals (as well as Keith Morris and Ron Reyes) and felt that the band's sound was ruined with the two guitar line-up (these versions can be heard on the albums ''[[Everything Went Black]]'' and ''[[The First Four Years]]''). Whereas the earlier four-piece versions are more focused and much cleaner sounding, the ''Damaged'' recordings are more akin to a live recording, with little stereo separation of guitars, and somewhat muddy. When asked about the lo-fidelity production, Spot has said \"They ''wanted'' it to sound that way.\" However, the artistic content and expression on the album showed the band pushing punk or hardcore music to a new level, with deeply personal and intensely emotional lyrics. As such, ''Damaged'' is generally regarded as Black Flag's most focused recording. One critic has written that ''Damaged'' was \"perhaps the best album to emerge from the quagmire that was early-'80s California [[Punk rock|punk]] ... the visceral, intensely physical presence of ''Damaged'' has yet to be equaled, although many bands have tried.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/damaged-r1955/review|title=Review: ''Damaged''|last=Dougan|first=John|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}</ref> ''Damaged'' was released in the fall of 1981, and the group began an extensive tour in support of it, forging an independent network for touring independent music acts that would form a cornerstone of the independent music scene for the decade to come.\n\nThe previous year 1980 saw the U.S. punk rock movement hitting a peak in popularity. With ''Damaged'' and their growing reputation as an impressive live band, Black Flag seemed poised on the cusp of a commercial breakthrough. The record was to be distributed by now-defunct Unicorn Records, a subsidiary of [[MCA Records|MCA]]. Trouble began when MCA refused to handle ''Damaged'' after MCA executive Al Bergamo determined the album was an \"Anti-Parent\" record.<ref>{{cite web | title = Black Flag | work=Sounds magazine | url = http://www.micksinclair.com/sounds/bf.html | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref> However, according to longtime SST employee [[Joe Carducci]]<ref>Carducci, Joe, ''Rock & the Pop Narcotic''; [[2.13.61|2.13.61 Publications]], 1995, {{ISBN|978-1-880985-11-3}}</ref> the \"Anti-Parent\" statement was not the real reason for MCA's refusing to distribute ''Damaged''; Carducci reported that Unicorn Records was so poorly managed and so deeply in debt that MCA stood to lose money by distributing the album, regardless of its content. This was the beginning of a legal dispute that would, for several years, disallow Black Flag from using their own name on any record after ''Damaged'' was released on [[SST Records]] and a copy of the \"Anti-Parent\" statement was placed on the album's cover.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title= Black Flag|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/black-flag-p3689/biography|website=Allmusic|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith their new singer, Black Flag and [[Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]] made their first tour of the UK in the Winter of 1981/1982. During that tour, the band met punk icon [[Richard Hell]] and opened a concert for him. Rollins later published his diaries from that tour in his book ''[[Get in the Van]]''. As the front man, Rollins was a frequent target of violent audience members, and became known for fist-fights with audience members. Rollins developed a distinct showmanship on stage, where he could entertain an audience just by talking to them.\n\nAs Black Flag was about to return home, UK customs detained Colombian drummer Robo due to visa problems, and he was not able to return with the rest of the band. This would be the end of his tenure with the band (he was able to eventually re-enter the United States in mid-1982, at which point he would promptly join the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] as one of that band's last drummers before its 1983 breakup). The loss of Robo put an end to extensive touring for a while. [[Emil Johnson]] of Twisted Roots filled in for one tour, but it was clear he was only temporary.\n\nWhile on that tour in Vancouver, the band found out that drummer [[Chuck Biscuits]] was leaving [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] He was quickly drafted on board, traveling with the band for the rest of the tour (cut short because of Henry Rollins' injured knee) to learn the songs. This lineup recorded the later-bootlegged cassette ''[[1982 Demos]]'', showing the direction the band would go in for the ''My War'' album.\n\nHowever, due to personality conflicts \u2014in ''Get in the Van'', Rollins described Biscuits as a \"fuck up\"\u2014 and the Unicorn court injunction-forced inactivity of Black Flag, Biscuits left to join their rivals the Circle Jerks. (Later, Biscuits joined ex-Misfits singer Glenn Danzig's solo project [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]]). Black Flag eventually got [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] of [[Descendents]] to join permanently (he had filled in from time-to-time before). While the Unicorn Records court injunction prevented the group from releasing a new studio album, they nonetheless continued to work on new material, and embarked on a period which would mark a pronounced change in the group's direction (and that of underground music in general).\n\nIt is possible that the violence of the previous tour had an effect on the band's direction. The band had also become increasingly interested in music other than punk rock, such as [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], and some of the members (particularly Ginn) used [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. (However, various members had been fans of such music long before Black Flag, with Ginn being an avid [[Grateful Dead]] fan, and Cadena a fan of [[Hawkwind]].) Newer material (which can be heard on the ''[[1982 Demos]]'' bootleg) was slower and less like typical punk music, with classic rock and blues influences seeping in. Cadena left to form his own band [[DC3 (band)|DC3]]. He would take some of the new songs he had written for Black Flag with him and record them for DC3's debut album.\n\nAdditionally, by late 1983, Dukowski had retired from performing with Black Flag (some accounts report he was \"edged out\" by Ginn<ref>{{cite web | title = Band line-ups | work=The Mighty Black Flag | url = http://www.ipass.net/jthrush/flagline.htm | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref>); Azerrad reports that Ginn was dissatisfied with Dukowski's failure to progress as an instrumentalist, and made things difficult for Dukowski in an attempt to make him quit, but in the end, Rollins took it on himself to fire Dukowski.<ref>Azerrad, 41.</ref> However, a few of Dukowski's songs were featured on later albums, and he continued acting in his capacity as tour manager.\n\n1983 found Black Flag with fresh songs and a new direction, but without a bass player, and embroiled in a legal dispute over distribution due to SST's issuing ''Damaged'' (Ginn argued that since MCA was no longer involved, the Unicorn deal was not legally binding, while Unicorn disagreed and sued SST and Black Flag). Until the matter was sorted out, the band were prevented by a court [[injunction]] from using the name \"Black Flag\" on any recordings. They released a compilation record, ''Everything Went Black'', which was credited to the individual musicians, not \"Black Flag\". In fact, wherever the original album artwork had the words \"Black Flag\", they had been covered up with small slips of paper, thus adhering to the letter of the law.\n\nAfter Unicorn Records declared bankruptcy, Black Flag were released from the injunction, and returned with a vengeance, starting with the release of ''[[My War]]''. The album was both a continuation of ''Damaged'', and a vast leap forward. While the general mood and lyrics continue in the confrontational and emotional tone of ''Damaged'', the album would prove influential to [[grunge]] music as the decade progressed. Lacking a bass player, Ginn played bass guitar, using the pseudonym Dale Nixon. On the May 1, 2007 episode of his radio program ''Harmony in My Head'', Rollins reported that one of Ginn's favorite albums during this era was [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]]'s ''[[Birds of Fire]]'' (1973), and opined that [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s guitar work influenced Ginn.\n\nFreed legally to release albums, Black Flag was re-energized and ready to continue full steam ahead. The band recruited bassist [[Kira Roessler]] (sister of punk keyboardist [[Paul Roessler]], of [[45 Grave]]) to replace Dukowski, and began its most prolific period. With Roessler, Black Flag had arguably found their best bassist. Dukowski was a powerful player, but Roessler brought a level of sophistication and finesse to match Ginn's increasingly ambitious music, without sacrificing any of the visceral impact required for punk rock.\n\n1984 saw Black Flag (and the SST label) at their most ambitious. This year they would release three full-length albums, and toured nearly constantly, with Rollins noting 178 performances for the year, and about that many for 1985. With Dukowski gone, Ginn ceded much of the spotlight to Rollins, who had expressed some discomfort<ref>see the track \"Henry\" from the spoken word compilation double album \"English As a Second Language\" (1984)</ref> over being the group's ''de facto'' spokesman, while Ginn was the recognized leader (Ginn wrote the majority of the group's songs and lyrics).\n\nWith Roessler on board, Black Flag began earnest experimentation, sometimes to critical and audience disdain: One critic writes that ''Slip It In'' \"blurs the line between moronic punk and moronic metal\";<ref name=\"trouser\" /> another writes ''My War'' is \"a pretentious mess of a record with a totally worthless second side.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Review \u2013 My War | work=Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1966|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref> Rollins reports that Black Flag's set-lists in this era rarely included older crowd favorites like \"Six Pack\" or \"Nervous Breakdown\", and that audiences were often irritated by the new, slower Black Flag. Violence against the band (and especially Rollins) was ever-present, although the vocalist was now an avid weight lifter, and more than able to defend himself. Furthermore, to Rollins' chagrin, Ginn's interest in marijuana steadily increased; as Rollins put it, \"By '86 it was 'Cannot separate the man from his Anvil case with a big-ass stash.'\"<ref>Azerrad, 58.</ref> Despite the initial resistance to the new music and quasi-psychedelic direction, ''My War'' would later be cited as a formative influence on the grunge, stoner and sludge metal genres. The band would continue to evolve toward a more heavy metal sound, with 1985's ''[[Loose Nut]]'' featuring more polished production.\n\n===Later period and break up (1985\u201386)===\nDespite 1984\u201385 being the most fruitful period for the band and their record label, Ginn and Rollins would ultimately decide to eject Roessler from Black Flag, citing erratic behavior. It has also been suggested that Ginn's accommodating Roessler's college schedule created tension in the band. Her absence, and the lack of a steady drummer (Stevenson quit and was replaced by [[Anthony Martinez (drummer)|Anthony Martinez]]), contributed to the comparatively weak reputation of the last few Black Flag tours.{{whom?|date=February 2020}}\n\nBy 1986, Black Flag's members had grown tired of the tensions of their relentless touring schedule, infighting, and of living in near-poverty.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The band had been together almost a decade, and true commercial success and stability had eluded them. The band's erratic artistic changes were a barrier to their retaining an audience \u2013 Ginn was so creatively restless that Black Flag's albums were often very dissimilar.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} At one point, Rollins apparently said, \"Why don't we make a record that was like the last one so people won't always be trying to catch up with what we're doing?\"<ref>Azerrad, 59.</ref> The next album, ''[[In My Head (album)|In My Head]]'', with its powerful bluesy proto-grunge-metal, did seem to finally be a cohesive follow-up to their previous album ''Loose Nut'', but it would be their last.\n\nBlack Flag played its final show on June 27, 1986, in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. In his book ''Get in the Van'', Rollins wrote that Ginn telephoned him in August 1986: \"He told me he was quitting the band. I thought that was strange considering it was his band and all. So in one short phone call, it was all over.\"\n\n===Post-Black Flag and reunions (1987\u20132012)===\nSince Black Flag's break-up, Rollins has had the most visible public profile as a musician, writer, and actor. Most Black Flag members have also remained active in music, especially Ginn, who continued playing with bands such as [[Gone (band)|Gone]], [[October Faction (band)|October Faction]], and Screw Radio, and [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Stevenson]], who continued on with the [[Descendents]], [[All (band)|All]], [[Only Crime]], and the reformed [[The Lemonheads|Lemonheads]]. Kira Roessler continues to record and perform with the band DOS, a duet with then-husband and Minutemen bassist [[Mike Watt]].\n\nIn September 2003, Black Flag played three reunion shows, two at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] and one at Alex's Bar in [[Long Beach, California]], to benefit cat rescue organizations (a current passion of Ginn's). The line-up for the shows was [[Dez Cadena]] on vocals and guitar, [[Greg Ginn]] on guitar, [[Robo (musician)|Robo]] on drums, and [[C'el Revuelta]] on bass.

Much of the band's history is chronicled in Henry Rollins' own published tour diary ''[[Get in the Van]]''. Black Flag were reportedly blacklisted by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and Hollywood rock clubs because of the destructiveness of their fans, though Rollins has claimed that police caused far more problems than they solved.\n\nSST Records, an independent American record label that was initially founded to release Black Flag's debut single, released recordings by influential bands such as [[Bad Brains]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Descendents]], [[Meat Puppets]], and [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]].

As the band gained popularity the logo was [[graffiti]]ed in and around Los Angeles, drawing the attention of the police to the band's activities.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 21.\">Azerrad, 21.</ref>]]Black Flag's visual imagery and artwork complemented the themes found in the band's music. Greg Ginn's brother Raymond Ginn, under the pseudonym [[Raymond Pettibon]], created the artwork for all of the band's studio releases with the exceptions of ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'' and the \"[[TV Party (EP)|TV Party]]\" single, as well as providing artwork for the band members to transform into merchandise and [[gig (musical performance)|gig]] [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]].<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\">Azerrad, 51.</ref> When the band found it necessary to change their name from Panic in 1977, it was Pettibon who suggested the new name Black Flag and designed their iconic logo: four vertical black rectangles comprising a stylized rippling black flag. The logo evoked a number of meanings: it was the polar opposite of a [[white flag]] of surrender, as well as a symbol for [[anarchism]] and a traditional emblem of [[piracy|pirates]].<ref name=\"Azerrad, 19.\">Azerrad, 19.</ref> As the band gained popularity the logo was [[graffiti]]ed on numerous highway [[overpass]]es and other public and private surfaces in and around Los Angeles, drawing the attention of the authorities and contributing to an increase in police presence at Black Flag shows.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 21.\" />\n\nPettibon's artwork for the band's albums and flyers was equally stark and confrontational. He typically worked in one panel using only [[pen and ink]], so the message conveyed had to be direct and powerful due to lack of space and color.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\" /> According to [[Michael Azerrad]] in ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', the artwork \"was a perfect visual analogue to the music it promoted \u2013 gritty, stark, violent, smart, provocative, and utterly American.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\" /> It also provided a cerebral aspect to the band's image: as the mainstream media caricatured Black Flag as a mindlessly aggressive act, the pairing of their music with high-concept artwork hinted at a greater intelligence at work that was unknown to outsiders.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\" />\n\n[[Henry Rollins]], in his journal collection ''[[Get in the Van]]'', notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C.<ref>Rollins, ''Get in the Van'', 3.</ref> The album cover for ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: \"The record's cover art said it all.

I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life.\"<ref>Rollins, ''Get in the Van'', 9.</ref> [[File:Black Flag Police Story sticker.jpg|thumb|left|Pettibon's drawing of a police officer being held at gunpoint was used on flyers and merchandise promoting the \"Police Story\" single.

If that's me with my [[gun|gat]] \u2013 my gat's larger than the one depicted \u2013 we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [[.357 Magnum|.357]] barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his [[adenoid]]s, or down his throat.

Pettibon himself recalls that:\n\n{{quote|These drawings just represented what I was thinking. Except for a few instances, the flyers weren't done as commercial art or advertising.

They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls going out on a flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of [[adhesive|paste]] onto a [[utility pole|telephone pole]], stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance.<ref>Rollins, ''Get in the Van'', 21.</ref> Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 54.\">Azerrad, 54.</ref> <blockquote>\"To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or [[correction fluid|whited out]], and I'd always ask nicely, 'Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?'

Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 54.\" />\n\n==Members==\n{{details|List of Black Flag band members}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Greg Ginn]] \u2013 lead guitar (1976\u201386, 2003, 2013\u2013present)\n* [[Mike Vallely]] \u2013 vocals (2003, 2013\u2013present)\n* Joseph Noval \u2013 bass (2019\u2013present)<ref name=\"artsdesk\"/>\n* Isaias Gil \u2013 drums (2019\u2013present) <ref name=drum/><ref name=isaias/>\n\n===Former members===\n* [[Dez Cadena]] \u2013 rhythm guitar (1981\u201383, 2003), vocals (1980\u201381, 2003)\n* [[Keith Morris]] \u2013 vocals (1976\u201379)\n* [[Ron Reyes]] \u2013 vocals (1979\u201380, 2013)\n* [[Henry Rollins]] \u2013 vocals (1981\u201386)\n* [[Raymond Pettibon]] \u2013 bass (1976)\n* Kansas \u2013 bass (1977)\n* [[Spot (producer)|Glen \"Spot\" Lockett]] \u2013 bass (1977)\n* [[Chuck Dukowski]] \u2013 bass (1977\u201383)\n* [[Kira Roessler]] \u2013 bass (1983\u201385)\n* [[C'el Revuelta]] \u2013 bass (1986, 2003)\n* [[Dave Klein (punk musician)|Dave Klein]] \u2013 bass (2013\u201314)\n* Bryan Migdol \u2013 drums (1977\u201379)\n* [[Robo (musician)|Roberto \"ROBO\" Valverde]] \u2013 drums (1979\u201381, 2003)\n* [[Emil Johnson]] \u2013 drums (1982)\n* [[Chuck Biscuits]] \u2013 drums (1982)\n* [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] \u2013 drums (1982\u201385)\n* [[Anthony Martinez (drummer)|Anthony Martinez]] \u2013 drums (1985\u201386)\n* [[List of Black Flag band members#Gregory Moore|Gregory Moore]] \u2013 drums (2003, 2013\u201314)\n* Brandon Pertzborn \u2013 drums (2014\u20132019)\n* Tyler Smith \u2013 bass (2014\u20132019)\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Black Flag discography}}\n\n'''Studio albums'''\n* ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[My War]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Family Man (Black Flag album)|Family Man]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Slip It In]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Loose Nut]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[In My Head (album)|In My Head]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[What The...]]'' (2013)\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Azerrad|title=[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981\u20131991]]|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year=2001|ISBN=0-316-78753-1}}\n* {{citation|last=Chick|first=Stevie|title=Spray Paint the Walls: The Story of Black Flag|publisher=[[PM Press]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-1-60486-418-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781604864182}}\n* {{citation|last=Rollins|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Rollins|title=[[Get in the Van|Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag]]|publisher=[[2.13.61|2.1<!-- -->3.61 Publications]]|year=2004|ISBN=1-880985-76-4}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Black Flag (band)}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106054925/http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/suburbanvoiceblackflag.html Suburban Voice Interview] \u2013 Black Flag interview from 1984\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106054533/http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/flipsideblackflag.html Flipside Interview] \u2013 Black Flag interview from 1980\n* [http://noisey.vice.com/blog/here-is-pretty-much-every-single-black-flag-flyer-designed-by-raymond-pettibon Gallery of Black Flag Posters by Raymond Pettibon]\n* [https://archive.org/details/BlatchNumber10NormanOK/page/n3 1984 Article and Photos, bLATCH zine]\n\n{{Black Flag|state=expanded}}\n{{Henry Rollins}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black Flag}}\n[[Category:Black Flag (band)| ]]\n[[Category:Hardcore punk groups from California]]\n[[Category:American post-hardcore musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1976]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1986]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2003]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2003]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2013]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2014]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2019]]\n[[Category:SST Records artists]]\n[[Category:1976 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Alternative Tentacles artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American hardcore punk band}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{review|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name             = Black Flag\n| image            = Black_Flag_performing_at_the_Electric_Ballroom_Camden_2019.jpg\n| alt              = Black Flag onstage\n| landscape        = yes\n| caption          = Black Flag performing at the Electric Ballroom in Camden 2019\n| background       = group_or_band\n| origin           = [[Hermosa Beach, California]]\n| genre            = <!-- Do NOT add unsourced genres!

Initially called Panic, the band was established by [[Greg Ginn]], the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes in the band. They are widely considered to be one of the first [[hardcore punk]] bands, as well as one of the pioneers of {{nowrap|[[post-hardcore]].}} After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag reunited in 2003 and again in 2013.<ref name=reunion>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=185346 |title=Black Flag Is Back |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> The second reunion lasted well over a year, during which they released their first studio album in over two decades, ''[[What The\u2026]]'' (2013).

The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] and [[Counterculture|nonconformist]] message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of [[social isolation]], [[neurosis]], [[poverty]], and [[paranoia]]. These themes were explored further when [[Henry Rollins]] joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's independent record label [[SST Records]].\n\nOver the course of the 1980s, Black Flag's sound, as well as their notoriety, evolved in ways that both embraced and alienated much of their early audience. As well as being central to the creation of hardcore punk, they were innovators in the first wave of American West Coast punk rock and are considered a key influence on punk subculture in the United States and abroad. Along with being among the earliest punk rock groups to incorporate elements and the influence of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] melodies and rhythm, there were often overt freestyles, [[free jazz]], [[breakbeat]] and [[contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]] elements in their sound, especially in Ginn's guitar playing, and the band interspersed records and performances with instrumentals throughout their career. They also played longer, slower, and more complex songs at a time when other bands in their milieu performed a raw, fast, [[three-chord song|three-chord]] format. As a result, their extensive discography is more stylistically varied than many of their punk rock contemporaries.\n\nBlack Flag has been well-respected within the [[punk subculture]], primarily for their tireless promotion of an autonomous [[DIY punk ethic]] and aesthetic. They are often regarded as pioneers in the movement of [[Underground music|underground]] [[independent record label|do-it-yourself record labels]] that flourished among 1980s punk rock bands. Through constant touring throughout the United States and Canada, and occasionally Europe, Black Flag established a dedicated [[cult following]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1976\u201381)===\nInitially called Panic, Black Flag was formed in 1976 in [[Hermosa Beach, California]] located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles. Ginn insisted that the band rehearse several hours a day.<ref name=guitarworld>Grad, David. \"Fade to Black.\" ''Spin''. July 1997</ref> This work ethic proved too challenging for some early members; Ginn and singer [[Keith Morris]] had an especially difficult time finding a reliable bass guitarist, and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor that contributed to the development of Ginn's distinctive guitar sound. Ginn's brother [[Raymond Pettibon]] and SST house record producer-to-be [[Spot (producer)|Spot]] filled in during rehearsals. In the beginning, Ginn and Morris were inspired by the raw, stripped-down attitude of bands such as the [[Ramones]] and [[the Stooges]]. Ginn has said \"We were influenced by the Stooges and then the Ramones; they inspired us. Keith and myself saw the Ramones when they first toured LA in 1976. After we saw them, I said if they could do it we could do it. I thought Keith would be a good singer and after seeing the Ramones, it made him think that he doesn't have to be some classical operatic singer.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Stay Thirsty Media, Inc.

The band held their first performance in December 1977 in [[Redondo Beach, California]]. To avoid confusion with another band called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in late 1978.<ref name=guitarworld/> They played their first show under this name on January 27, 1979, at the Moose Lodge Hall in Redondo Beach, California.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALLEYCATS AT THE MOOSE LODGE|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/alleycats-at-the-moose-lodge-1979-01-27|work=It All Happened \u2013 A Living History of Live Music|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> This was the first time [[Dez Cadena]] saw the band perform.\n\nThe name was suggested by Ginn's brother, artist [[Raymond Pettibon]], who also designed the band's logo: a stylized black flag represented as four black bars.<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0u04EqNVjo|work=The Art of Punk|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Pettibon stated \"If a white flag means surrender, a black flag represents anarchy.\" Their new name was reminiscent of the [[Anarchist symbolism|anarchist symbol]], [[Black Flag (insecticide)|the insecticide of the same name]], and of the British heavy metal band [[Black Sabbath]], one of Ginn's favorite bands. Ginn suggested that he was \"comfortable with ''all'' the implications of the name.\"<ref>Azerrad, Michael.

Pettibon also created much of their cover artwork.\n\nThere were few opportunities for [[punk rock]] bands to perform in [[Southern California]]. (Los Angeles club [[The Masque]] was the center of the L.A. punk scene, but was also rather parochial, and did not often admit bands from outside L.A. proper.) Black Flag organized their own gigs, performing at picnics, house parties, schools; any place that was available. They called club owners themselves to arrange appearances, and plastered hundreds of flyers\u2014usually Pettibon's severe, haunting [[comic strip]] style panels\u2014on any available surface to publicize performances. Dukowski reported that the \"minimum [number of flyers] that went out was 500 for a show.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = A 12-Step Program in Self-Reliance | work = LA Weekly | url = http://www.laweekly.com/ink/01/31/2001:-babcock.php | accessdate = May 27, 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030215101616/https://www.laweekly.com/ink/01/31/2001:-babcock.php | archivedate = February 15, 2003 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough Ginn was the band's leader, special note should be made to Dukowski's contributions to Black Flag. Ginn was tireless and profoundly disciplined; however, he was also rather quiet. Dukowski's intelligent, fast-talking, high-energy persona attracted significant attention, and he was often Black Flag's spokesman to the press. Dukowski acted as the group's tour manager even after he no longer performed with them, and he was likely as important as Ginn in establishing the band's [[DIY punk ethic]] and demanding work ethic. Dukowski's bass guitar was a vital part of the early Black Flag sound; \"[[TV Party (EP)|TV Party]]\" for instance, was one of many songs \"driven more by Chuck Dukowski's percolating bass line than Ginn's stun-gun guitar.\"<ref name=\"Song review \u2013 TV Party\">{{cite web | title = Song review \u2013 TV Party | work=Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2281479|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nMorris performed as vocalist on Black Flag's earliest recordings, and his energized, manic stage presence was pivotal in the band earning a reputation in Southern California. Migdol was replaced by the enigmatic Colombian drummer [[Robo (musician)|Robo]], whose numerous clicking metallic bracelets became part of his drum sound. The band played with a speed and ferocity that was all but unprecedented in rock music; critic [[Ira Robbins]] declared that \"Black Flag was, for all intents and purposes, America's first hardcore band.\"<ref name=\"trouser\">{{cite web | title = Black Flag | work=[[TrouserPress.com]] | url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=black_flag | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref> Morris quit in 1979, citing, among other reasons, creative differences with Ginn, and his own \"freaking out on [[cocaine]] and speed.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Black Flag \u2013 the first five years | work=Mojo | url = http://jaybabcock.com/blackflag.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122224004/http://jaybabcock.com/blackflag.html | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | accessdate = September 17, 2011 }}</ref> Morris would subsequently form the [[Circle Jerks]].\n\nAfter Morris's departure, Black Flag recruited fan [[Ron Reyes]] as singer. With Reyes, Black Flag recorded the ''Jealous Again'' 12-inch EP and appeared in the film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]''. This was also the line-up that toured up and down the West Coast for the first time, the version most fans outside of L.A. first saw.\n\nIn 1980, Reyes quit Black Flag mid-performance at the Fleetwood in Redondo Beach because of escalating violence.  For the remainder of that gig, the band played an extended version of \"[[Louie Louie]]\" and invited audience members to take turns singing.<ref name=guitarworld />\n\nThe more reliable [[Dez Cadena]] \u2013 another fan \u2013 then joined as a vocalist. With Cadena on board, Black Flag began national touring in earnest, and arguably saw two peaks: first as a commercial draw (they sold out the 3,500-seat [[Santa Monica]] Civic Auditorium, a feat they were never able to manage again); and second, perhaps seeing the peak of attention from police in the Los Angeles area, due to the violence associated with Black Flag and punk rock in general. The band members have often insisted, however, that the police instigated far more problems than they solved.\n\nBy the summer of 1981, however, Cadena's voice was worn. He had no formal training or previous experience as a singer, and had severely strained his voice during Black Flag's nonstop touring, and he wanted to play guitar rather than perform vocals.\n\n===Rollins era (1981\u20131985)===\nTwenty-year-old fan [[Henry Rollins]] (birth name Henry Garfield)\u2014then living in Washington, D.C. and singing for hardcore band [[State of Alert]]. S.O.A. drummer Ivor Hanson had a father who was a top [[admiral]] in the [[US Navy]] and his family shared living quarters with the [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[United States Naval Observatory]]. The band held their practices there and would have to be let in by [[United States Secret Service]] agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119194742/https://wjla.com/news/entertainment/a-brief-oral-history-of-henry-rollins-s-brief-career-in-d-c--8387 |archivedate=November 19, 2018 |title=An incomplete oral history of Henry Rollins' D.C. years |first=Ryan |last=Kearney |date=February 9, 2012 |work=[[WJLA-TV]] |access-date=November 19, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nS.O.A. had corresponded with Black Flag, and met them when they performed on the U.S. east coast. At an impromptu show at A7 in New York City, he asked the band to perform \"Clocked In\", and the band offered to let him sing the song. Since vocalist Dez Cadena was switching to guitar, the band then invited Rollins to audition. Impressed by his stage demeanor, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist.<ref>''American Hardcore''. Dir. Paul Rachman. AHC Productions LLC, 2006. Film.</ref> Despite some doubts, he accepted, due in part to [[Ian MacKaye]]'s encouragement. Rollins acted as [[roadie]] for the remainder of the tour while learning Black Flag's songs during sound checks and encores, while Cadena crafted guitar parts that meshed with Ginn's. Rollins also impressed Black Flag with his broad musical interests during an era when punk rock music and fans were increasingly factionalized; he introduced Black Flag to Washington D.C.'s [[go-go]], a distinctive take on [[funk music]].\n\nRollins was Black Flag's longest-lasting vocalist. When he joined Black Flag, he brought a different attitude and perspective than previous singers. Some earlier songs, such as \"Six Pack\" (a song written about original singer Keith Morris) blended a sense of black humor with driving punk rock. Rollins was an intense performer, who usually appeared onstage wearing only shorts. Ginn once stated that after Rollins joined, \"We couldn't do songs with a sense of humor anymore; he got into the serious way-out poet thing.\"<ref name=\"Song review \u2013 TV Party\" /> In an interview, Rollins stated that the band was influenced by heavy metal via the band [[Black Sabbath]].<ref>[http://www.exhibitagallery.com/blog/2010/05/metal-of-honor-interview-henry-rollins-former-lead-singer-of-black-flag/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911081830/http://www.exhibitagallery.com/blog/2010/05/metal-of-honor-interview-henry-rollins-former-lead-singer-of-black-flag/ |date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename= BlackFlagNervousBreakdown.ogg\n|title=Nervous Breakdown\n|description= Sample of Black Flag \"Nervous Breakdown\" from ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' EP (1978)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{Listen\n|filename=BlackFlagSlipItIn.ogg\n|title=Slip It In\n|description= Sample of Black Flag \"Slip It In\" from ''[[Slip It In]]'' (1984)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nWith Rollins, Black Flag began work on their first full-length album. The sessions for the album (chronicled in [[Michael Azerrad]]'s book ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'') were a source of conflict between the band and engineer/producer [[Spot (producer)|Spot]], who had worked with the band and the [[SST Records|SST]] label since their early years. Spot had already recorded many of the ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'' tracks with Dez Cadena on vocals (as well as Keith Morris and Ron Reyes) and felt that the band's sound was ruined with the two guitar line-up (these versions can be heard on the albums ''[[Everything Went Black]]'' and ''[[The First Four Years]]''). Whereas the earlier four-piece versions are more focused and much cleaner sounding, the ''Damaged'' recordings are more akin to a live recording, with little stereo separation of guitars, and somewhat muddy. When asked about the lo-fidelity production, Spot has said \"They ''wanted'' it to sound that way.\" However, the artistic content and expression on the album showed the band pushing punk or hardcore music to a new level, with deeply personal and intensely emotional lyrics. As such, ''Damaged'' is generally regarded as Black Flag's most focused recording. One critic has written that ''Damaged'' was \"perhaps the best album to emerge from the quagmire that was early-'80s California [[Punk rock|punk]] ... the visceral, intensely physical presence of ''Damaged'' has yet to be equaled, although many bands have tried.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/damaged-r1955/review|title=Review: ''Damaged''|last=Dougan|first=John|work=Allmusic|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}</ref> ''Damaged'' was released in the fall of 1981, and the group began an extensive tour in support of it, forging an independent network for touring independent music acts that would form a cornerstone of the independent music scene for the decade to come.\n\nThe previous year 1980 saw the U.S. punk rock movement hitting a peak in popularity. With ''Damaged'' and their growing reputation as an impressive live band, Black Flag seemed poised on the cusp of a commercial breakthrough. The record was to be distributed by now-defunct Unicorn Records, a subsidiary of [[MCA Records|MCA]]. Trouble began when MCA refused to handle ''Damaged'' after MCA executive Al Bergamo determined the album was an \"Anti-Parent\" record.<ref>{{cite web | title = Black Flag | work=Sounds magazine | url = http://www.micksinclair.com/sounds/bf.html | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref> However, according to longtime SST employee [[Joe Carducci]]<ref>Carducci, Joe, ''Rock & the Pop Narcotic''; [[2.13.61|2.13.61 Publications]], 1995, {{ISBN|978-1-880985-11-3}}</ref> the \"Anti-Parent\" statement was not the real reason for MCA's refusing to distribute ''Damaged''; Carducci reported that Unicorn Records was so poorly managed and so deeply in debt that MCA stood to lose money by distributing the album, regardless of its content. This was the beginning of a legal dispute that would, for several years, disallow Black Flag from using their own name on any record after ''Damaged'' was released on [[SST Records]] and a copy of the \"Anti-Parent\" statement was placed on the album's cover.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title= Black Flag|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/black-flag-p3689/biography|website=Allmusic|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith their new singer, Black Flag and [[Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]] made their first tour of the UK in the Winter of 1981/1982. During that tour, the band met punk icon [[Richard Hell]] and opened a concert for him. Rollins later published his diaries from that tour in his book ''[[Get in the Van]]''. As the front man, Rollins was a frequent target of violent audience members, and became known for fist-fights with audience members. Rollins developed a distinct showmanship on stage, where he could entertain an audience just by talking to them.\n\nAs Black Flag was about to return home, UK customs detained Colombian drummer Robo due to visa problems, and he was not able to return with the rest of the band. This would be the end of his tenure with the band (he was able to eventually re-enter the United States in mid-1982, at which point he would promptly join the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] as one of that band's last drummers before its 1983 breakup). The loss of Robo put an end to extensive touring for a while. [[Emil Johnson]] of Twisted Roots filled in for one tour, but it was clear he was only temporary.\n\nWhile on that tour in Vancouver, the band found out that drummer [[Chuck Biscuits]] was leaving [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] He was quickly drafted on board, traveling with the band for the rest of the tour (cut short because of Henry Rollins' injured knee) to learn the songs. This lineup recorded the later-bootlegged cassette ''[[1982 Demos]]'', showing the direction the band would go in for the ''My War'' album.\n\nHowever, due to personality conflicts \u2014in ''Get in the Van'', Rollins described Biscuits as a \"fuck up\"\u2014 and the Unicorn court injunction-forced inactivity of Black Flag, Biscuits left to join their rivals the Circle Jerks. (Later, Biscuits joined ex-Misfits singer Glenn Danzig's solo project [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]]). Black Flag eventually got [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] of [[Descendents]] to join permanently (he had filled in from time-to-time before). While the Unicorn Records court injunction prevented the group from releasing a new studio album, they nonetheless continued to work on new material, and embarked on a period which would mark a pronounced change in the group's direction (and that of underground music in general).\n\nIt is possible that the violence of the previous tour had an effect on the band's direction. The band had also become increasingly interested in music other than punk rock, such as [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], and some of the members (particularly Ginn) used [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. (However, various members had been fans of such music long before Black Flag, with Ginn being an avid [[Grateful Dead]] fan, and Cadena a fan of [[Hawkwind]].) Newer material (which can be heard on the ''[[1982 Demos]]'' bootleg) was slower and less like typical punk music, with classic rock and blues influences seeping in. Cadena left to form his own band [[DC3 (band)|DC3]]. He would take some of the new songs he had written for Black Flag with him and record them for DC3's debut album.\n\nAdditionally, by late 1983, Dukowski had retired from performing with Black Flag (some accounts report he was \"edged out\" by Ginn<ref>{{cite web | title = Band line-ups | work=The Mighty Black Flag | url = http://www.ipass.net/jthrush/flagline.htm | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref>); Azerrad reports that Ginn was dissatisfied with Dukowski's failure to progress as an instrumentalist, and made things difficult for Dukowski in an attempt to make him quit, but in the end, Rollins took it on himself to fire Dukowski.<ref>Azerrad, 41.</ref> However, a few of Dukowski's songs were featured on later albums, and he continued acting in his capacity as tour manager.\n\n1983 found Black Flag with fresh songs and a new direction, but without a bass player, and embroiled in a legal dispute over distribution due to SST's issuing ''Damaged'' (Ginn argued that since MCA was no longer involved, the Unicorn deal was not legally binding, while Unicorn disagreed and sued SST and Black Flag). Until the matter was sorted out, the band were prevented by a court [[injunction]] from using the name \"Black Flag\" on any recordings. They released a compilation record, ''Everything Went Black'', which was credited to the individual musicians, not \"Black Flag\". In fact, wherever the original album artwork had the words \"Black Flag\", they had been covered up with small slips of paper, thus adhering to the letter of the law.\n\nAfter Unicorn Records declared bankruptcy, Black Flag were released from the injunction, and returned with a vengeance, starting with the release of ''[[My War]]''. The album was both a continuation of ''Damaged'', and a vast leap forward. While the general mood and lyrics continue in the confrontational and emotional tone of ''Damaged'', the album would prove influential to [[grunge]] music as the decade progressed. Lacking a bass player, Ginn played bass guitar, using the pseudonym Dale Nixon. On the May 1, 2007 episode of his radio program ''Harmony in My Head'', Rollins reported that one of Ginn's favorite albums during this era was [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]]'s ''[[Birds of Fire]]'' (1973), and opined that [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s guitar work influenced Ginn.\n\nFreed legally to release albums, Black Flag was re-energized and ready to continue full steam ahead. The band recruited bassist [[Kira Roessler]] (sister of punk keyboardist [[Paul Roessler]], of [[45 Grave]]) to replace Dukowski, and began its most prolific period. With Roessler, Black Flag had arguably found their best bassist. Dukowski was a powerful player, but Roessler brought a level of sophistication and finesse to match Ginn's increasingly ambitious music, without sacrificing any of the visceral impact required for punk rock.\n\n1984 saw Black Flag (and the SST label) at their most ambitious. This year they would release three full-length albums, and toured nearly constantly, with Rollins noting 178 performances for the year, and about that many for 1985. With Dukowski gone, Ginn ceded much of the spotlight to Rollins, who had expressed some discomfort<ref>see the track \"Henry\" from the spoken word compilation double album \"English As a Second Language\" (1984)</ref> over being the group's ''de facto'' spokesman, while Ginn was the recognized leader (Ginn wrote the majority of the group's songs and lyrics).\n\nWith Roessler on board, Black Flag began earnest experimentation, sometimes to critical and audience disdain: One critic writes that ''Slip It In'' \"blurs the line between moronic punk and moronic metal\";<ref name=\"trouser\" /> another writes ''My War'' is \"a pretentious mess of a record with a totally worthless second side.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Review \u2013 My War | work=Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1966|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = May 27, 2006 }}</ref> Rollins reports that Black Flag's set-lists in this era rarely included older crowd favorites like \"Six Pack\" or \"Nervous Breakdown\", and that audiences were often irritated by the new, slower Black Flag. Violence against the band (and especially Rollins) was ever-present, although the vocalist was now an avid weight lifter, and more than able to defend himself. Furthermore, to Rollins' chagrin, Ginn's interest in marijuana steadily increased; as Rollins put it, \"By '86 it was 'Cannot separate the man from his Anvil case with a big-ass stash.'\"<ref>Azerrad, 58.</ref> Despite the initial resistance to the new music and quasi-psychedelic direction, ''My War'' would later be cited as a formative influence on the grunge, stoner and sludge metal genres. The band would continue to evolve toward a more heavy metal sound, with 1985's ''[[Loose Nut]]'' featuring more polished production.\n\n===Later period and break up (1985\u201386)===\nDespite 1984\u201385 being the most fruitful period for the band and their record label, Ginn and Rollins would ultimately decide to eject Roessler from Black Flag, citing erratic behavior. It has also been suggested that Ginn's accommodating Roessler's college schedule created tension in the band. Her absence, and the lack of a steady drummer (Stevenson quit and was replaced by [[Anthony Martinez (drummer)|Anthony Martinez]]), contributed to the comparatively weak reputation of the last few Black Flag tours.{{whom?|date=February 2020}}\n\nBy 1986, Black Flag's members had grown tired of the tensions of their relentless touring schedule, infighting, and of living in near-poverty.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The band had been together almost a decade, and true commercial success and stability had eluded them. The band's erratic artistic changes were a barrier to their retaining an audience \u2013 Ginn was so creatively restless that Black Flag's albums were often very dissimilar.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} At one point, Rollins apparently said, \"Why don't we make a record that was like the last one so people won't always be trying to catch up with what we're doing?\"<ref>Azerrad, 59.</ref> The next album, ''[[In My Head (album)|In My Head]]'', with its powerful bluesy proto-grunge-metal, did seem to finally be a cohesive follow-up to their previous album ''Loose Nut'', but it would be their last.\n\nBlack Flag played its final show on June 27, 1986, in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. In his book ''Get in the Van'', Rollins wrote that Ginn telephoned him in August 1986: \"He told me he was quitting the band. I thought that was strange considering it was his band and all. So in one short phone call, it was all over.\"\n\n===Post-Black Flag and reunions (1987\u20132012)===\nSince Black Flag's break-up, Rollins has had the most visible public profile as a musician, writer, and actor. Most Black Flag members have also remained active in music, especially Ginn, who continued playing with bands such as [[Gone (band)|Gone]], [[October Faction (band)|October Faction]], and Screw Radio, and [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Stevenson]], who continued on with the [[Descendents]], [[All (band)|All]], [[Only Crime]], and the reformed [[The Lemonheads|Lemonheads]]. Kira Roessler continues to record and perform with the band DOS, a duet with then-husband and Minutemen bassist [[Mike Watt]].\n\nIn September 2003, Black Flag played three reunion shows, two at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] and one at Alex's Bar in [[Long Beach, California]], to benefit cat rescue organizations (a current passion of Ginn's). The line-up for the shows was [[Dez Cadena]] on vocals and guitar, [[Greg Ginn]] on guitar, [[Robo (musician)|Robo]] on drums, and [[C'el Revuelta]] on bass. Professional skateboarder and singer [[Mike Vallely]] also sang all the songs from ''[[My War]]'' at these shows while [[Gone (band)|Gregory Moore]] was on drums for the My War set.<ref name=\"meeeh\">{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Black Flag founder, Mike Vallely launch band |publisher=Lambgoat |url=http://lambgoat.com/news/19671/Black-Flag-founder-Mike-Vallely-launch-band |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref>\n\nOn July 24, 2010, in celebration of [[Ron Reyes]]'s 50th birthday, [[Greg Ginn]] and Reyes played a set of three Black Flag songs together in addition to his own set with the Ron Reyes Band.<ref name=\"Beadle (2010)\">{{cite web|last=Beadle|first=Scott|title=Ron Reyes 50th Birthday Celebration with the Jolts, Ron Reyes Band, Modernettes, Little Guitar Army, and I Braineater \u2013 Rickshaw Theatre (Vancouver BC), July 24, 2010|url=http://www.bigtakeover.com/concerts/ron-reyes-50th-birthday-celebration-with-the-jolts-ron-reyes-band-modernettes-little-guitar-army-and-i-braineater-rickshaw-theatre-vancouver-bc-july-24-2010|publisher=The Big Takeover|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Black Flag - 2019.jpg|alt=Black Flag (Greg Ginn, Mike Vallely, Tyler Smith, Isaias Gil) Denver, CO 2019|thumb|250x250px|Black Flag (Greg Ginn, Mike Vallely, Tyler Smith, Isaias Gil) Denver, CO 2019]]\nOn December 18, 2011, Keith Morris, Chuck Dukowski, Bill Stevenson, and the Descendents' Stephen Egerton played the ''Nervous Breakdown'' EP in its entirety for the Goldenvoice 30th anniversary show called GV 30.

In the same action, SST and Ginn also sued Henry Rollins and Keith Morris to oppose and cancel the trademark applications filed in September 2012 by Rollins and Morris.  SST and Ginn alleged that Rollins and Morris lied to the Patent and Trademark Office on their trademark applications regarding claimed use of the Black Flag name and logo by Rollins and Morris on records, T-shirts, and with regard to live performances.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/black-flag-founder-sues-bandmates-599117 |title=Black Flag Co-Founder Sues Ex-Bandmates Over Use of Punk Group's Logo, Name |magazine=Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2013, a federal judge denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, brought by Ginn and SST against Morris, Dukowski, Stevenson, Cadena, and Egerton.

As the band gained popularity the logo was [[graffiti]]ed in and around Los Angeles, drawing the attention of the police to the band's activities.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 21.\">Azerrad, 21.</ref>]]Black Flag's visual imagery and artwork complemented the themes found in the band's music. Greg Ginn's brother Raymond Ginn, under the pseudonym [[Raymond Pettibon]], created the artwork for all of the band's studio releases with the exceptions of ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'' and the \"[[TV Party (EP)|TV Party]]\" single, as well as providing artwork for the band members to transform into merchandise and [[gig (musical performance)|gig]] [[flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]].<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\">Azerrad, 51.</ref> When the band found it necessary to change their name from Panic in 1977, it was Pettibon who suggested the new name Black Flag and designed their iconic logo: four vertical black rectangles comprising a stylized rippling black flag. The logo evoked a number of meanings: it was the polar opposite of a [[white flag]] of surrender, as well as a symbol for [[anarchism]] and a traditional emblem of [[piracy|pirates]].<ref name=\"Azerrad, 19.\">Azerrad, 19.</ref> As the band gained popularity the logo was [[graffiti]]ed on numerous highway [[overpass]]es and other public and private surfaces in and around Los Angeles, drawing the attention of the authorities and contributing to an increase in police presence at Black Flag shows.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 21.\" />\n\nPettibon's artwork for the band's albums and flyers was equally stark and confrontational. He typically worked in one panel using only [[pen and ink]], so the message conveyed had to be direct and powerful due to lack of space and color.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\" /> According to [[Michael Azerrad]] in ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', the artwork \"was a perfect visual analogue to the music it promoted \u2013 gritty, stark, violent, smart, provocative, and utterly American.\"<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\" /> It also provided a cerebral aspect to the band's image: as the mainstream media caricatured Black Flag as a mindlessly aggressive act, the pairing of their music with high-concept artwork hinted at a greater intelligence at work that was unknown to outsiders.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 51.\" />\n\n[[Henry Rollins]], in his journal collection ''[[Get in the Van]]'', notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C.<ref>Rollins, ''Get in the Van'', 3.</ref> The album cover for ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: \"The record's cover art said it all. A man with his back to the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life.\"<ref>Rollins, ''Get in the Van'', 9.</ref> [[File:Black Flag Police Story sticker.jpg|thumb|left|Pettibon's drawing of a police officer being held at gunpoint was used on flyers and merchandise promoting the \"Police Story\" single.

If that's me with my [[gun|gat]] \u2013 my gat's larger than the one depicted \u2013 we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [[.357 Magnum|.357]] barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his [[adenoid]]s, or down his throat.

Pettibon himself recalls that:\n\n{{quote|These drawings just represented what I was thinking. Except for a few instances, the flyers weren't done as commercial art or advertising. You could have stuck anything on a [[photocopier|photocopy machine]] and put the band name and made an advertising flyer, but these weren't done like that.

They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls going out on a flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of [[adhesive|paste]] onto a [[utility pole|telephone pole]], stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance.<ref>Rollins, ''Get in the Van'', 21.</ref> Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 54.\">Azerrad, 54.</ref> <blockquote>\"To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or [[correction fluid|whited out]], and I'd always ask nicely, 'Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?' Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I'm not venting or complaining, just stating fact.\"<ref name=\"We Got the Neutron Bomb\" /></blockquote> Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used on the cover of the ''[[Loose Nut]]'' album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.<ref name=\"Azerrad, 54.\" />\n\n==Members==\n{{details|List of Black Flag band members}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Greg Ginn]] \u2013 lead guitar (1976\u201386, 2003, 2013\u2013present)\n* [[Mike Vallely]] \u2013 vocals (2003, 2013\u2013present)\n* Joseph Noval \u2013 bass (2019\u2013present)<ref name=\"artsdesk\"/>\n* Isaias Gil \u2013 drums (2019\u2013present) <ref name=drum/><ref name=isaias/>\n\n===Former members===\n* [[Dez Cadena]] \u2013 rhythm guitar (1981\u201383, 2003), vocals (1980\u201381, 2003)\n* [[Keith Morris]] \u2013 vocals (1976\u201379)\n* [[Ron Reyes]] \u2013 vocals (1979\u201380, 2013)\n* [[Henry Rollins]] \u2013 vocals (1981\u201386)\n* [[Raymond Pettibon]] \u2013 bass (1976)\n* Kansas \u2013 bass (1977)\n* [[Spot (producer)|Glen \"Spot\" Lockett]] \u2013 bass (1977)\n* [[Chuck Dukowski]] \u2013 bass (1977\u201383)\n* [[Kira Roessler]] \u2013 bass (1983\u201385)\n* [[C'el Revuelta]] \u2013 bass (1986, 2003)\n* [[Dave Klein (punk musician)|Dave Klein]] \u2013 bass (2013\u201314)\n* Bryan Migdol \u2013 drums (1977\u201379)\n* [[Robo (musician)|Roberto \"ROBO\" Valverde]] \u2013 drums (1979\u201381, 2003)\n* [[Emil Johnson]] \u2013 drums (1982)\n* [[Chuck Biscuits]] \u2013 drums (1982)\n* [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] \u2013 drums (1982\u201385)\n* [[Anthony Martinez (drummer)|Anthony Martinez]] \u2013 drums (1985\u201386)\n* [[List of Black Flag band members#Gregory Moore|Gregory Moore]] \u2013 drums (2003, 2013\u201314)\n* Brandon Pertzborn \u2013 drums (2014\u20132019)\n* Tyler Smith \u2013 bass (2014\u20132019)\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Black Flag discography}}\n\n'''Studio albums'''\n* ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[My War]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Family Man (Black Flag album)|Family Man]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Slip It In]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Loose Nut]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[In My Head (album)|In My Head]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[What The...]]'' (2013)\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Azerrad|title=[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981\u20131991]]|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year=2001|ISBN=0-316-78753-1}}\n* {{citation|last=Chick|first=Stevie|title=Spray Paint the Walls: The Story of Black Flag|publisher=[[PM Press]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-1-60486-418-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781604864182}}\n* {{citation|last=Rollins|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Rollins|title=[[Get in the Van|Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag]]|publisher=[[2.13.61|2.1<!-- -->3.61 Publications]]|year=2004|ISBN=1-880985-76-4}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Black Flag (band)}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106054925/http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/suburbanvoiceblackflag.html Suburban Voice Interview] \u2013 Black Flag interview from 1984\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106054533/http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/flipsideblackflag.html Flipside Interview] \u2013 Black Flag interview from 1980\n* [http://noisey.vice.com/blog/here-is-pretty-much-every-single-black-flag-flyer-designed-by-raymond-pettibon Gallery of Black Flag Posters by Raymond Pettibon]\n* [https://archive.org/details/BlatchNumber10NormanOK/page/n3 1984 Article and Photos, bLATCH zine]\n\n{{Black Flag|state=expanded}}\n{{Henry Rollins}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Black Flag}}\n[[Category:Black Flag (band)| ]]\n[[Category:Hardcore punk groups from California]]\n[[Category:American post-hardcore musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1976]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1986]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2003]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2003]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2013]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2014]]\n[[Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2019]]\n[[Category:SST Records artists]]\n[[Category:1976 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Alternative Tentacles artists]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1012:b021:28cc:2d75:3181:7d65:108b", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Flag_(band)"}
