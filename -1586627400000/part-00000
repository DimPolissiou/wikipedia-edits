C. McNeile''' or the pseudonym '''Sapper''', was a British soldier and author. Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the [[World War I|First World War]], he started writing short stories and getting them published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names, he was given the [[pen name]] \"Sapper\" by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], the owner of the ''Daily Mail''; the nickname was based on that of his corps, the [[Royal Engineers]].\n\nAfter the war McNeile left the army and continued writing, although he changed from war stories to [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]]. In 1920 he published [[Bulldog Drummond (novel)|''Bulldog Drummond'']], whose [[Bulldog Drummond|eponymous hero]] became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, on his friend [[Gerard Fairlie]] and on English gentlemen generally. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and [[Bulldog Jack|a screenplay]].\n\nMcNeile interspersed his Drummond work with other [[List of works by H. C. McNeile|novels and story collections]] that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works, Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish. He was one of the most successful British popular authors of the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]] before his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which has been attributed to damage sustained from a gas attack in the war.\n\nMcNeile's stories are either directly about the war, or contain people whose lives have been shaped by it. His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories, with [[upper class]] Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it. Although he was seen at the time as \"simply an upstanding [[Tory]] who spoke for many of his countrymen\",{{sfn|McNeile|Trewin|1983|p=xi|ps=: as quoted in {{harvnb|Jaillant|2011|p=163}}}} after the Second World War his work was criticised as having [[Fascism|fascist]] overtones, while also displaying the [[xenophobia]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] apparent in some other writers of the period. \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Quadrangle of Cheltenham College - geograph.org.uk - 194659.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cheltenham College]], where McNeile enjoyed playing sports, but did not excel at them{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=111}}]]\n\nMcNeile was born in [[Bodmin]], [[Cornwall]].

When he started writing thrillers, Hodder & Stoughton advertised  McNeile  as a \"light and entertaining\" writer,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=140}} and began publishing his works in the \"Yellow Jacket\" series.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=160}} Magazine editors competed vigorously for Sapper's stories and paid extravagant prices for them. Gerald Fairlie, his close friend and collaborator, has put it on record that Sapper was the highest-paid short story writer of his time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sapper - The Best Short Stories, Introduction by Jack Adrian|last=Sapper|first=|publisher=J.M Dent & Sons Ltd|year=1984|isbn=0-460-04672-1|location=Great Britain|pages=vii}}</ref>\n\n===Style and technique===\n[[File:William Sydney Porter by doubleday.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[O. Henry]] was a literary model for McNeile]]\nMcNeile's early works, the war stories published before 1919, are either \"plot-driven adventure narrative[s]\", such as the short stories \"The Song of the Bayonet\" and \"Private Meyrick, Company Idiot\", or \"atmospheric vignette[s]\", such as \"The Land of Topsy Turvy\" and \"The Human Touch\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=118}} McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=113}}{{sfn|Fairlie|1952|p=30}} The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having \"little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clich\u00e9d and often repetitive\";{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=113}} [[Richard Usborne]] agreed, adding that the female characters were \"cardboard\" and that McNeile was \"wonderfully forgetful\" about characters dead in one book and alive in the next.{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=148}} In  the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies  the central character  as \"a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama\".{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=65}} The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique, credible or well-rounded, his books \"make no claim to literary excellence\",{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} and are instead, \"good, solid thrillers\".{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told.{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=146}} Meyer classifies the non-war stories as [[middlebrow]], with \"sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=115}} His early novels, particularly ''Bull-Dog Drummond'' and ''The Black Gang'', were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=52}} The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile's lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile \"mastered the tricks of his trade\".{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=53}}\n\nDelFattore outlines the use of double adjectives to reinforce feelings towards enemies in both his war stories and thrillers, such as \"filthy, murdering Boche\", and \"stinking, cowardly Bolshevik\".{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} She and the scholar Lise Jaillant also comment on the dehumanisation of the enemy, comparing them to animals and vermin.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=163}}{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} Watson noted the frequency of the use of the word \"devil\"\u2014and variations\u2014when discussing antagonists.{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=65}}\n\n===Major themes===\n\n====First World War====\nThe major theme running throughout McNeile's works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections of short stories published about the war,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=140}} while his post-war fiction can be seen as an extension of those stories, as \"both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=152}} His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a \"celebration of the qualities of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Old Contemptibles]]\".{{sfn|Hynes|1990|p=48}} McNeile's view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals,{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=119}} even if that purpose was later wasted: a \"valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=121}} The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in ''The Making of an Officer'', his series of articles in ''The Times'', in which he wrote about \"the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to 'inspire' subalterns\",{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=151}} a theme he returned to in his war stories\u2014particularly ''The Lieutenant and Others'' and ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E''{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=121}}{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=151}}\u2014and then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=152}}\n\nMcNeile's fictional work\u2014particularly his Drummond series of books\u2014shows characters who have served in the war and have been affected by it; Jaillant comments that Drummond's war-time experience \"has shaped his social identity, his skills, and even his physical appearance\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=163}} The Drummond character has been \"brutalized by war\",{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=153}} which accounts for his physical approach when dealing with Peterson and others.{{sfn|Watson|1971|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n====England====\n[[File:Bulldog Drummond 1st edition cover, 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition cover of ''[[Bulldog Drummond (novel)|Bulldog Drummond]]'']]\nMcNeile provided Drummond with a \"flamboyantly aggressive patriotism\" towards England,{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=64}} which Drummond defends physically against those who challenge its stability or morality.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} Hans Bertens argued that the patriotism demonstrated by Drummond was closer to nationalistic pride and a paranoia about threats directed at the upper middle classes, of which Drummond was a member.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=55}} Drummond's nickname\u2014Bulldog\u2014is symbolic of England, and he and his English gentlemen friends\u2014\"the Breed\"\u2014fight the conspiracy of foreigners threatening England's stability.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=155}}{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=81}} McNeile's thriller stories do not often pit Englishman against Englishman as the main characters; most of the foreigners in his books are the villains.{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=147}}\n\n====Sport====\nRunning throughout McNeile's books is the metaphor of warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.'', he writes, \"To bag a man with a gun is one thing; there is sport\u2014there is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all, even if they are Germans\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=150}} The motif was continued into the Drummond novels.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=153}} McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports,{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=64}} or of boxing, poker or hunting.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=62}} The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: ''The Third Round'', ''The Final Count'', ''Knock-Out'' and ''Challenge''.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=62}}\n\n===Reception===\nMcNeile's war story collections sold well; nearly 50,000 copies of his first book, ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.'', were purchased in its first year, and nearly 58,000 copies the following year.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=116}} His thrillers were also popular, with ''Bulldog Drummond'' selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copies benchmark for \"best-sellers\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=122}} At his peak in the 1920s, he was the highest paid short story writer in the world,<ref name=\"Indie: Fowler\" /> and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around \u00a310,000 a year;<ref name=\"S Times: Obit\" /> the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' estimated that during his writing career he had earned \u00a385,000.<ref name=\"Mirror: \u00a385,000\" />\n\n[[File:Bulldog Drummond Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Poster for the 1922 film [[Bulldog Drummond (1922 film)|''Bulldog Drummond'']], based on McNeile's play of the same name]]\nMcNeile's war stories were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the mainstream press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing ''Men, Women, and Guns'' for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', Francis Henry Gribble wrote that \"Sapper has been successful in previous volumes of war stories&nbsp;... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim to be included in the list will call for serious examination.\"{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=144}} The reviewer of ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.'' for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Constitution]]'' reminded its readers that McNeile \"has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army.\"{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=144}} Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as \"a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=158}} When reviewing ''Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back''{{efn|The novel was first published in the UK under the title ''Knock-Out'' and was renamed ''Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back'' for the US market.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|pp=221\u2013222}}}} for ''[[The New York Times]]'', the critic observed that \"if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond\";<ref name=\"NYT: Knock-out\" /> for the novel ''Bulldog Drummond at Bay'', the reviewer considered that \"as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate\".<ref name=\"NYT: BD at bay\" /> In the British market, ''The Times Literary Supplement'' also characterised him as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=158}}\n\n====Controversy====\nFrom the 1950s on, McNeile's work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=138}} and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were \"carrying the [[F\u00fchrerprinzip|F\u00fchrer-principle]]\".{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=136}} DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel\u2014''The Black Gang'' (1922)\u2014is when the [[Fascism|fascist]] element was introduced.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=163}} while the academic [[Ion Trewin]] considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as \"simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen\".{{sfn|McNeile|Trewin|1983|p=xi|ps=: as quoted in {{harvnb|Jaillant|2011|p=163}}}}\n\nThroughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile's characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by DelFattore to be \"intensely conservative by modern standards\";{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as [[Agatha Christie]], \"exhibit the inevitable [[xenophobia]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] of the period, McNeile's go far beyond the 'polite' norms\".{{sfn|Green|2004}} J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Bourn considers his language to be \"rather distasteful\",{{sfn|Bourn|1990|p=26}} while the academic [[Michael Denning]] observed that \"Drummond is a bundle of [[chauvinism]]s, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners\".{{sfn|Denning|1987|p=55}}\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of works by H.

C. McNeile''' or the pseudonym '''Sapper''', was a British soldier and author. Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the [[World War I|First World War]], he started writing short stories and getting them published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names, he was given the [[pen name]] \"Sapper\" by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], the owner of the ''Daily Mail''; the nickname was based on that of his corps, the [[Royal Engineers]].\n\nAfter the war McNeile left the army and continued writing, although he changed from war stories to [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]]. In 1920 he published [[Bulldog Drummond (novel)|''Bulldog Drummond'']], whose [[Bulldog Drummond|eponymous hero]] became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, on his friend [[Gerard Fairlie]] and on English gentlemen generally. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and [[Bulldog Jack|a screenplay]].\n\nMcNeile interspersed his Drummond work with other [[List of works by H. C. McNeile|novels and story collections]] that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works, Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish. He was one of the most successful British popular authors of the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]] before his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which has been attributed to damage sustained from a gas attack in the war.\n\nMcNeile's stories are either directly about the war, or contain people whose lives have been shaped by it. His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories, with [[upper class]] Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it. Although he was seen at the time as \"simply an upstanding [[Tory]] who spoke for many of his countrymen\",{{sfn|McNeile|Trewin|1983|p=xi|ps=: as quoted in {{harvnb|Jaillant|2011|p=163}}}} after the Second World War his work was criticised as having [[Fascism|fascist]] overtones, while also displaying the [[xenophobia]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] apparent in some other writers of the period. \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Quadrangle of Cheltenham College - geograph.org.uk - 194659.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cheltenham College]], where McNeile enjoyed playing sports, but did not excel at them{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=111}}]]\n\nMcNeile was born in [[Bodmin]], [[Cornwall]].

Those works published between 1915 and 1918 are his war stories, and relate directly to his experiences during the First World War, while the later works are largely thrillers.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=137}}{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=116}} His war stories were marketed by the ''Daily Mail'' and Hodder & Stoughton as a soldier's eyewitness accounts. When he started writing thrillers, Hodder & Stoughton advertised  McNeile  as a \"light and entertaining\" writer,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=140}} and began publishing his works in the \"Yellow Jacket\" series.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=160}} Magazine editors competed vigorously for Sapper's stories and paid extravagant prices for them. Gerald Fairlie, his close friend and collaborator, has put it on record that Sapper was the highest-paid short story writer of his time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sapper - The Best Short Stories, Introduction by Jack Adrian|last=Sapper|first=|publisher=J.M Dent & Sons Ltd|year=1984|isbn=0-460-04672-1|location=Great Britain|pages=vii}}</ref>\n\n===Style and technique===\n[[File:William Sydney Porter by doubleday.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[O. Henry]] was a literary model for McNeile]]\nMcNeile's early works, the war stories published before 1919, are either \"plot-driven adventure narrative[s]\", such as the short stories \"The Song of the Bayonet\" and \"Private Meyrick, Company Idiot\", or \"atmospheric vignette[s]\", such as \"The Land of Topsy Turvy\" and \"The Human Touch\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=118}} McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work.{{sfn|Treadwell|2001|p=113}}{{sfn|Fairlie|1952|p=30}} The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having \"little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clich\u00e9d and often repetitive\";{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=113}} [[Richard Usborne]] agreed, adding that the female characters were \"cardboard\" and that McNeile was \"wonderfully forgetful\" about characters dead in one book and alive in the next.{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=148}} In  the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies  the central character  as \"a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama\".{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=65}} The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique, credible or well-rounded, his books \"make no claim to literary excellence\",{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} and are instead, \"good, solid thrillers\".{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told.{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=146}} Meyer classifies the non-war stories as [[middlebrow]], with \"sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=115}} His early novels, particularly ''Bull-Dog Drummond'' and ''The Black Gang'', were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=52}} The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile's lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile \"mastered the tricks of his trade\".{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=53}}\n\nDelFattore outlines the use of double adjectives to reinforce feelings towards enemies in both his war stories and thrillers, such as \"filthy, murdering Boche\", and \"stinking, cowardly Bolshevik\".{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} She and the scholar Lise Jaillant also comment on the dehumanisation of the enemy, comparing them to animals and vermin.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=163}}{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} Watson noted the frequency of the use of the word \"devil\"\u2014and variations\u2014when discussing antagonists.{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=65}}\n\n===Major themes===\n\n====First World War====\nThe major theme running throughout McNeile's works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections of short stories published about the war,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=140}} while his post-war fiction can be seen as an extension of those stories, as \"both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=152}} His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a \"celebration of the qualities of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Old Contemptibles]]\".{{sfn|Hynes|1990|p=48}} McNeile's view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals,{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=119}} even if that purpose was later wasted: a \"valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=121}} The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in ''The Making of an Officer'', his series of articles in ''The Times'', in which he wrote about \"the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to 'inspire' subalterns\",{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=151}} a theme he returned to in his war stories\u2014particularly ''The Lieutenant and Others'' and ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E''{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=121}}{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=151}}\u2014and then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=152}}\n\nMcNeile's fictional work\u2014particularly his Drummond series of books\u2014shows characters who have served in the war and have been affected by it; Jaillant comments that Drummond's war-time experience \"has shaped his social identity, his skills, and even his physical appearance\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=163}} The Drummond character has been \"brutalized by war\",{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=153}} which accounts for his physical approach when dealing with Peterson and others.{{sfn|Watson|1971|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n====England====\n[[File:Bulldog Drummond 1st edition cover, 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition cover of ''[[Bulldog Drummond (novel)|Bulldog Drummond]]'']]\nMcNeile provided Drummond with a \"flamboyantly aggressive patriotism\" towards England,{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=64}} which Drummond defends physically against those who challenge its stability or morality.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} Hans Bertens argued that the patriotism demonstrated by Drummond was closer to nationalistic pride and a paranoia about threats directed at the upper middle classes, of which Drummond was a member.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=55}} Drummond's nickname\u2014Bulldog\u2014is symbolic of England, and he and his English gentlemen friends\u2014\"the Breed\"\u2014fight the conspiracy of foreigners threatening England's stability.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=155}}{{sfn|Panek|1981|p=81}} McNeile's thriller stories do not often pit Englishman against Englishman as the main characters; most of the foreigners in his books are the villains.{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=147}}\n\n====Sport====\nRunning throughout McNeile's books is the metaphor of warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.'', he writes, \"To bag a man with a gun is one thing; there is sport\u2014there is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all, even if they are Germans\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=150}} The motif was continued into the Drummond novels.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=153}} McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports,{{sfn|Watson|1971|p=64}} or of boxing, poker or hunting.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=62}} The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: ''The Third Round'', ''The Final Count'', ''Knock-Out'' and ''Challenge''.{{sfn|Bertens|1990|p=62}}\n\n===Reception===\nMcNeile's war story collections sold well; nearly 50,000 copies of his first book, ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.'', were purchased in its first year, and nearly 58,000 copies the following year.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=116}} His thrillers were also popular, with ''Bulldog Drummond'' selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copies benchmark for \"best-sellers\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=122}} At his peak in the 1920s, he was the highest paid short story writer in the world,<ref name=\"Indie: Fowler\" /> and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around \u00a310,000 a year;<ref name=\"S Times: Obit\" /> the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' estimated that during his writing career he had earned \u00a385,000.<ref name=\"Mirror: \u00a385,000\" />\n\n[[File:Bulldog Drummond Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Poster for the 1922 film [[Bulldog Drummond (1922 film)|''Bulldog Drummond'']], based on McNeile's play of the same name]]\nMcNeile's war stories were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the mainstream press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing ''Men, Women, and Guns'' for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', Francis Henry Gribble wrote that \"Sapper has been successful in previous volumes of war stories&nbsp;... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim to be included in the list will call for serious examination.\"{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=144}} The reviewer of ''Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.'' for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Constitution]]'' reminded its readers that McNeile \"has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army.\"{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=144}} Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as \"a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness\".{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=158}} When reviewing ''Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back''{{efn|The novel was first published in the UK under the title ''Knock-Out'' and was renamed ''Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back'' for the US market.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|pp=221\u2013222}}}} for ''[[The New York Times]]'', the critic observed that \"if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond\";<ref name=\"NYT: Knock-out\" /> for the novel ''Bulldog Drummond at Bay'', the reviewer considered that \"as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate\".<ref name=\"NYT: BD at bay\" /> In the British market, ''The Times Literary Supplement'' also characterised him as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=158}}\n\n====Controversy====\nFrom the 1950s on, McNeile's work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=138}} and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were \"carrying the [[F\u00fchrerprinzip|F\u00fchrer-principle]]\".{{sfn|Usborne|1983|p=136}} DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel\u2014''The Black Gang'' (1922)\u2014is when the [[Fascism|fascist]] element was introduced.{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=224}} Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War,{{sfn|Jaillant|2011|p=163}} while the academic [[Ion Trewin]] considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as \"simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen\".{{sfn|McNeile|Trewin|1983|p=xi|ps=: as quoted in {{harvnb|Jaillant|2011|p=163}}}}\n\nThroughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile's characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by DelFattore to be \"intensely conservative by modern standards\";{{sfn|DelFattore|1988|p=223}} Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as [[Agatha Christie]], \"exhibit the inevitable [[xenophobia]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] of the period, McNeile's go far beyond the 'polite' norms\".{{sfn|Green|2004}} J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Bourn considers his language to be \"rather distasteful\",{{sfn|Bourn|1990|p=26}} while the academic [[Michael Denning]] observed that \"Drummond is a bundle of [[chauvinism]]s, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners\".{{sfn|Denning|1987|p=55}}\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of works by H.

During [[United Kingdom Special Forces Selection|aptitude trials]] for the S.A.S. he narrowly failed to pass through injury, and was held over in Regiment's training cadre pending physical recovery to try again. After several months with the Regiment's training cadre, he chose to abandon his application to join it, and left the British Army in December 1975.<ref>Biographical profile of \"Tom Carew\", published on 'Army Rumour Service'. http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Tom_Carew</ref>\n\nAfter the army he worked on the family farm, but grew restless, and subsequently found employment using his military training as a [[mercenary]] soldier, with ex-members of the SAS, seeing service as an advisor to the [[Sri Lankan Army]] in counter-insurgency warfare in 1979, and in [[Afghanistan]]/[[Pakistan]] in the early 1980s with the [[United States Government]]'s [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], training the Afghan [[Mujahideen]] to fight the [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1980s-1990's he was involved in conflicts in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Bosnia War]], [[South America]] and [[South Africa]].<ref>'Death of an SAS fantasist', Daily Mail, 27 January 2009. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1128630/Death-SAS-fantasist-Was-Tom-Carew-murdered--did-fake-death.html</ref><ref>Profile of \"Tom Carew\", Army Rumour Service, http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/Tom_Carew</ref>\n\nIn 1991, he faked his own death to give the impression that he had been killed by a car bomb in [[Croatia]], possibly trying to get out of paying maintenance to his estranged wife at their family home in Hereford, afterwards breaking off all contact with his family to maintain the ruse and relocating to Belgium, living under the assumed name of \"Philip Stevenson\".

(2000)==\nIn 1999, with the assistance of a [[ghost writer]] ([[Adrian Weale]]) Sessargo wrote an account of his military experiences in the [[Afghan-Soviet War]] entitled ''Jihad! - The Secret War in Afghanistan'', which was published in 2000, stating erroneously in its text that he had been in that theatre of operations as a trooper in the Special Air Service. The book sold reasonably well, being serialized in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', with print-runs in several European countries, as well as Australia. A paperback edition was published in 2001. On 11 September 2001 Arabic Jihadist terrorists staged an [[9/11|attack]] within the continental United States of America, hi-jacking several commercial air-liners and suicidally crashing them into key commercial and governmental landmark buildings, and the aftermath of the event created an immense demand for information on the nature and motivation of the attackers, which transferred into a surge in sales of ''Jihad!'' in excess of 50,000 copies, making it a best-seller, and Sessarego (using the [[pen-name]] of \"Tom Carew\") an in-demand figure in the British media for expert comment on [[Islam|Mohammedan]] [[Jihad]]ism.<ref>'The fantasy life & lonely death of the SAS veteran who never was', 'The Guardian', 24 January 2009.</ref>\n\nJournalists interviewing him regularly referred to his SAS trooper background in line with the book's text, which Sessarego played along with, until being exposed by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] reporter George Eykyn, after the BBC had been contacted by a former member of the Regiment notifying it that Sessarego's claims in this regard were false. Sessarego was subsequently lured to the BBC on the pretense of an interview about Afghanistan, where on arrival he was aggressively evidentially confronted mid-interview by Eykyn accusing him of being an imposter, who had invented a non-existent career with the Special Air Service.<ref>Film of the Eykyn-Sessarego confrontation, BBC Newsnight, 2001.

His publisher's attempts to defend the book's validity by offering to remove a small part of its text which had made the erroneous claims regarding the Regiment (with the book's ghostwriter Adrian Weale defending its content by ripping out one page of its text during an interview with the BBC as an illustration of how little space had been taken up with the claims regarding the Special Air Service) were not sufficient in stemming the media's condemnation, and the book was subsequently withdrawn from further sale.
