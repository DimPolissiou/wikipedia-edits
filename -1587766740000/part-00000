It is based on both the 2013 South Korean-Czech [[Snowpiercer|film of the same name]], directed by [[Bong Joon-ho]], and the 1982 French graphic novel ''[[Le Transperceneige]]'', from which the film was adapted, by [[Jacques Lob]], Benjamin Legrand, and [[Jean-Marc Rochette]].\n\nThe series, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the film's continuity, follows the passengers of the Snowpiercer, a gigantic, perpetually moving train that circles the globe carrying the remnants of humanity seven years after the world becomes a frozen wasteland. ''Snowpiercer'' questions class warfare, social injustice, and the politics of survival. [[Daveed Diggs]] and [[Jennifer Connelly]] are set to star alongside [[Mickey Sumner]], [[Annalise Basso]], Sasha Frolova, [[Alison Wright]], Benjamin Haigh, Roberto Urbina, Katie McGuinness, [[Susan Park]], [[Lena Hall]], [[Sheila Vand]], [[Sam Otto]], [[Iddo Goldberg]], and Jaylin Fletcher. [[Rowan Blanchard]], [[Steven Ogg]], and [[Sean Bean]] will also join the main cast in the second season.\n\nWhile in development at TNT for over three years, the series faced numerous production issues and delays arising from creative differences between the series' producers and the network. The series remained in [[development hell]] until May 2019, when it was announced that the series would instead air on TNT's sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] for a spring 2020 release, and that it was already renewed for a second season. However, in September 2019, the decision to change networks was reversed.\n\nThe new season is set to premiere on April 17, 2020 on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT Network]].\n\n== Premise ==\n''Snowpiercer'' is set seven years after the world becomes a frozen wasteland and follows the remnants of humanity who inhabit a gigantic, perpetually moving train that circles the globe.

It is based on both the 2013 South Korean-Czech [[Snowpiercer|film of the same name]], directed by [[Bong Joon-ho]], and the 1982 French graphic novel ''[[Le Transperceneige]]'', from which the film was adapted, by [[Jacques Lob]], Benjamin Legrand, and [[Jean-Marc Rochette]].\n\nThe series, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the film's continuity, follows the passengers of the Snowpiercer, a gigantic, perpetually moving train that circles the globe carrying the remnants of humanity seven years after the world becomes a frozen wasteland. ''Snowpiercer'' questions class warfare, social injustice, and the politics of survival. [[Daveed Diggs]] and [[Jennifer Connelly]] are set to star alongside [[Mickey Sumner]], [[Annalise Basso]], Sasha Frolova, [[Alison Wright]], Benjamin Haigh, Roberto Urbina, Katie McGuinness, [[Susan Park]], [[Lena Hall]], [[Sheila Vand]], [[Sam Otto]], [[Iddo Goldberg]], and Jaylin Fletcher. [[Rowan Blanchard]], [[Steven Ogg]], and [[Sean Bean]] will also join the main cast in the second season.\n\nWhile in development at TNT for over three years, the series faced numerous production issues and delays arising from creative differences between the series' producers and the network. The series remained in [[development hell]] until May 2019, when it was announced that the series would instead air on TNT's sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] for a spring 2020 release, and that it was already renewed for a second season. However, in September 2019, the decision to change networks was reversed.\n\nThe new season is set to premiere on April 17, 2020 on TNT.\n\n== Premise ==\n''Snowpiercer'' is set seven years after the world becomes a frozen wasteland and follows the remnants of humanity who inhabit a gigantic, perpetually moving train that circles the globe.
