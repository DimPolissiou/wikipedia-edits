It originally aired on [[NBC]] on September&nbsp;20, 2012. The episode was written and directed by series creator [[Greg Daniels]]; this is his first writing credit for the series since the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] episode \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", and his first directing credit since \"[[PDA (The Office)|PDA]]\".\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, two new employees ([[Clark Duke]] and [[Jake Lacy]]) are hired by the Scranton branch and cause trouble for [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]). [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) returns from manager training, hoping for revenge on [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]). [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) considers adopting [[Angela Martin|Angela Lipton]]'s ([[Angela Kinsey]]) cat. [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) tries to save a turtle.\n\n\"New Guys\" was the inception of several story arcs and saw the departures of [[Mindy Kaling]] as [[Kelly Kapoor]] and [[B. J. Novak]] as [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], due to their involvement in the former's own sitcom ''[[The Mindy Project]]''. \"New Guys\" received largely positive pre-release reviews from television critics. Post-release reviews were moderately positive; while many felt that the episode was a distinct step in the right direction for the show, others took issues with some of the comedic aspects of the episode. \"New Guys\" was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, making it the show's lowest-rated season premiere. The episode ranked second in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nOver the summer, [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) tried to save a turtle that he ran over, but only ended up killing it. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) talking to the camera, [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([dea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because it would not be good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that they expect to live a calm, normal life, given their work and children.\n\n==Production==\nOn May&nbsp;11, 2012, [[NBC]] renewed ''The Office'' for a ninth season and it was later announced that [[Greg Daniels]], who had been the series showrunner from season one through five, would be returning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/NBC-Renews-Office-Parks-Rec-Up-All-Night-1047375.aspx|title=NBC Renews The Office, Parks and Recreation, Up All Night and Whitney|work=[[TV Guide]]|first=Robyn|last=Ross|date=May 11, 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref> \"New Guys\" was written and directed by Daniels.<ref name=prerelease/> This is his first writing credit for the series since the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] entry, \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\",<ref>{{Cite episode | title = Goodbye, Michael| titlelink=Goodbye, Michael |credits=[[Paul Feig]] (director); [[Greg Daniels]] (writer) |  series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | network = [[NBC]] | airdate = April 28, 2011 | season = 7 | number = 22}}</ref> and his first directing credited since season seven's \"[[PDA (The Office)|PDA]]\".<ref>{{Cite episode | title = PDA| titlelink=PDA (The Office) |credits=[[Robert Padnick]] (director); [[Greg Daniels]] (writer) | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = February 10, 2011 | season = 7 | number = 16}}</ref> This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the [[The Office (U.S. season 1)|first season]] episode \"[[Basketball (The Office)|Basketball]]\" and the [[The Office (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] opener, \"[[Fun Run]]\".<ref>{{Cite episode | title = Basketball| titlelink=Basketball (The Office) | credits=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer and director) | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = April 19, 2005| season = 1 | number = 5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode | title = Fun Run| titlelink=Fun Run | credits=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer and director) | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = September 27, 2007 | season = 4 | number = 1}}</ref> Daniels later revealed that \"New Guys\" would be the inception of big [[Story arc|season arcs]].<ref name=vulture/> He went on the record saying \"I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thevote/2012/07/greg-daniels.html |title=Greg Daniels and the future of 'The Office' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |first=Jon |last=Weisman |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709092927/http://weblogs.variety.com/thevote/2012/07/greg-daniels.html |archivedate=July 9, 2012}}</ref> Jenna Fischer later stated that part of the Jim and Pam arc would be dependent on \"things that happened in seasons past that didn't seem very relevant at the time and [that] they're going to become important this season.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=ScreenTeamMedia|title=Jenna Fischer 'The Office' Season 9 Interview!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTWiKHteCbM&feature=player_embedded|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=September 21, 2012|date=September 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"New Guys\" featured one of the final few performances of [[Mindy Kaling]] as [[Kelly Kapoor]], who left the series to star in her own [[television comedy|comedy]] television series ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', which was created for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Neal |first=Sean |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/today-in-potential-omens-of-the-offices-demise-min,68530/ |title=Today in potential omens of The Office's demise: Mindy Kaling attached to star in a new Fox series |publisher=[[The Onion]]|work=[[The A.V.

It originally aired on [[NBC]] on September&nbsp;20, 2012. The episode was written and directed by series creator [[Greg Daniels]]; this is his first writing credit for the series since the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] episode \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", and his first directing credit since \"[[PDA (The Office)|PDA]]\".\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, two new employees ([[Clark Duke]] and [[Jake Lacy]]) are hired by the Scranton branch and cause trouble for [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]). [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) returns from manager training, hoping for revenge on [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]). [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) considers adopting [[Angela Martin|Angela Lipton]]'s ([[Angela Kinsey]]) cat. [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) tries to save a turtle.\n\n\"New Guys\" was the inception of several story arcs and saw the departures of [[Mindy Kaling]] as [[Kelly Kapoor]] and [[B. J. Novak]] as [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], due to their involvement in the former's own sitcom ''[[The Mindy Project]]''. \"New Guys\" received largely positive pre-release reviews from television critics. Post-release reviews were moderately positive; while many felt that the episode was a distinct step in the right direction for the show, others took issues with some of the comedic aspects of the episode. \"New Guys\" was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, making it the show's lowest-rated season premiere. The episode ranked second in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nOver the summer, [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) tried to save a turtle that he ran over, but only ended up killing it. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) moved to Ohio with her fianc\u00e9 Ravi and [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) also moved to Ohio for \"unrelated reasons.\" [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) learned that he is not the biological father of [[Angela Martin|Angela Lipton]]'s ([[Angela Kinsey]]) baby.\n\nWhile talking to the camera, [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) reveal that Jim was offered an [[entrepreneur]]ial sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because it would not be good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that they expect to live a calm, normal life, given their work and children.\n\nTwo new employees, [[Clark Green]] ([[Clark Duke]]) and [[Pete Miller]] ([[Jake Lacy]]), who are quickly dubbed \"Dwight, Jr.\" and \"The New Jim,\" are hired by the Scranton branch and cause trouble for Jim and Dwight. At first, Dwight is happy to have a [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]], acting as a fatherly figure to Clark due to the office noting their visual similarity, but soon begins to fear that Clark is after his job. Jim, on the other hand, does not feel that Pete is anything like him. However, after hearing Pete discuss his future plans, Jim realizes that he used to have Pete's ambition but has become stuck at the same job for over nine years.  Meanwhile, Angela puts one of her cats, Comstock, up for adoption as her baby is allergic to it. [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) initially refuses to adopt Comstock despite Angela's pleas, but agrees to adopt it after learning that it is her husband Robert's ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]) favorite cat. It is implied that Robert and Oscar are having an affair, as Robert told Angela he was having a business dinner on the night he actually had plans with Oscar.\n\n[[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) returns from [[Outward Bound]] manager training\u2014where he became more \"decisive and confident\"\u2014hoping for revenge on [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) for commandeering his job during [[The Office (U.S. season 8)|the previous spring]]. To do this, Andy sets up a slackline in the parking lot and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in her heels and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the printer he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while [[Creed Bratton (The Office)|Creed Bratton]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act. While everyone is outside crowding around Dwight, Jim calls up his old college friend and tells him that he wants to be involved in the new business deal, even though he did not have Pam's approval.\n\n==Production==\nOn May&nbsp;11, 2012, [[NBC]] renewed ''The Office'' for a ninth season and it was later announced that [[Greg Daniels]], who had been the series showrunner from season one through five, would be returning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/NBC-Renews-Office-Parks-Rec-Up-All-Night-1047375.aspx|title=NBC Renews The Office, Parks and Recreation, Up All Night and Whitney|work=[[TV Guide]]|first=Robyn|last=Ross|date=May 11, 2012|accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref> \"New Guys\" was written and directed by Daniels.<ref name=prerelease/> This is his first writing credit for the series since the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] entry, \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\",<ref>{{Cite episode | title = Goodbye, Michael| titlelink=Goodbye, Michael |credits=[[Paul Feig]] (director); [[Greg Daniels]] (writer) |  series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | network = [[NBC]] | airdate = April 28, 2011 | season = 7 | number = 22}}</ref> and his first directing credited since season seven's \"[[PDA (The Office)|PDA]]\".<ref>{{Cite episode | title = PDA| titlelink=PDA (The Office) |credits=[[Robert Padnick]] (director); [[Greg Daniels]] (writer) | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = February 10, 2011 | season = 7 | number = 16}}</ref> This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the [[The Office (U.S. season 1)|first season]] episode \"[[Basketball (The Office)|Basketball]]\" and the [[The Office (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] opener, \"[[Fun Run]]\".<ref>{{Cite episode | title = Basketball| titlelink=Basketball (The Office) | credits=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer and director) | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = April 19, 2005| season = 1 | number = 5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode | title = Fun Run| titlelink=Fun Run | credits=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer and director) | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = September 27, 2007 | season = 4 | number = 1}}</ref> Daniels later revealed that \"New Guys\" would be the inception of big [[Story arc|season arcs]].<ref name=vulture/> He went on the record saying \"I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thevote/2012/07/greg-daniels.html |title=Greg Daniels and the future of 'The Office' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |first=Jon |last=Weisman |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709092927/http://weblogs.variety.com/thevote/2012/07/greg-daniels.html |archivedate=July 9, 2012}}</ref> Jenna Fischer later stated that part of the Jim and Pam arc would be dependent on \"things that happened in seasons past that didn't seem very relevant at the time and [that] they're going to become important this season.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=ScreenTeamMedia|title=Jenna Fischer 'The Office' Season 9 Interview!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTWiKHteCbM&feature=player_embedded|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=September 21, 2012|date=September 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"New Guys\" featured one of the final few performances of [[Mindy Kaling]] as [[Kelly Kapoor]], who left the series to star in her own [[television comedy|comedy]] television series ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', which was created for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Neal |first=Sean |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/today-in-potential-omens-of-the-offices-demise-min,68530/ |title=Today in potential omens of The Office's demise: Mindy Kaling attached to star in a new Fox series |publisher=[[The Onion]]|work=[[The A.V.

During the fall it was encamped for some time at Bladensburg, did duty on the Potomac above Washington, built Fort Lincoln, moved to Budd's Ferry, and was variously engaged until spring when it became a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, Heintzelman's (3d) Corps, and was transferred to the Peninsula.\n\nOn April 6 it was in action before Yorktown, and on May 5 it suffered heavily at Williamsburg.

The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent being the symbol of Islam.

It may be flavoured with dried fruit such as [[Sultana (grape)|sultanas]] or [[raisins]], or other fruits such as [[apple]]s. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with [[almond]] filling.\nIn the [[United States]], sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with [[ham]] and [[cheese]], or [[feta cheese]] and [[spinach]]. In the [[Levant]], croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or [[zaatar]]. In [[Germany]], croissants are sometimes filled with [[Nutella]] or [[persipan]]; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with [[lye]] (''Laugencroissant''). In the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], the croissant is typically called a ''Gipfeli''; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.\n\n=== Argentina and Uruguay ===\nCroissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast, ''aperitivo'' (a light mid-morning meal), or ''[[merienda]]'' (a mid-afternoon meal). They are referred to as ''medialunas'' (\"half moons\") because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (''medialunas de manteca'', \"half moons of butter\"). Another variant is a ''medialuna de grasa'' (\"half moon of lard\"), which is not always sweet.\n\n=== Italy ===\nA cousin of the croissant is the Italian ''[[Cornetto (pastry)|cornetto]]'' (in the [[Central Italy|Center]] and [[Southern Italy|South]]) or ''[[brioche]]'' (in the [[Northern Italy|North]]). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the ''cornetto vuoto'' (Italian: \"empty cornetto\") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include ''crema pasticciera'' ([[custard]]), [[apricot jam]] or [[chocolate]] cream. They often come covered with [[powdered sugar]] or other toppings. ''Cornetto'' with [[cappuccino]] at the bar is considered{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to be the one of the most common [[breakfast]]s in Italy.\n\n=== Poland ===\nOn 11 November, St. Martin's Day is celebrated in [[Greater Poland]], mainly in its capital city [[Pozna\u0144]]. On this day, the people of Pozna\u0144 buy and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called ''rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie'' (\"[[St. Martin's croissant]]s\"). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry with a filling made of ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts.\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb| ''[[Rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski]]'']]\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, \"doce de ovo\". It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered a sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: \"croissant\") but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese p\u00e2tisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.\n\n=== Spain ===\nBesides of the regular croissant, a variation called \"cuerno\" (meaning \"horn\") is sold. It is half of a croissant stuffed usually with cream.\n\n=== Turkey ===\n\nA remote similarity of the croissant shape is the Turkish ''ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi''.

To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step.<ref name=\":0\" /> Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other [[Pastry|pastries]]. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19&nbsp;\u00b0C, to best hydrate the ingredients.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|title=Information Sheets- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220164457/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second step is the [[Laminated dough|lamination]] process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers.<ref name=\":5\" /> After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained.<ref name=\":0\" /> The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.\n\nAfter lamination, the dough is formed into its famous [[crescent]] shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe third step is the [[fermentation]] process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast which, during proofing, increase the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at 31&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":5\" /> The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times its original volume.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe fourth step is the baking process. Also known as \"pastry lift\" or \"dough lift,\" the dough expands as water is converted to [[steam]], thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165&nbsp;\u00b0C to 205&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking.\n\n==Ingredient functionality during processing==\n\n===Predough===\n[[Gluten]] proteins affect the water absorption and [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of the predough.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ooms|first=Nand|last2=Pareyt|first2=Bram|last3=Brijs|first3=Kristof|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2016-10-02|title=Ingredient Functionality in Multilayered Dough-margarine Systems and the Resultant Pastry Products: A Review|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=56|issue=13|pages=2101\u20132114|doi=10.1080/10408398.2014.928259|issn=1040-8398|pmid=26177127}}</ref> The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated [[glutenin]] proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated [[gliadin]] proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough\u2019s viscosity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wieser|first=Herbert|date=2007-04-01|title=Chemistry of gluten proteins|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.07.004|issn=0740-0020|pmid=17008153}}</ref>\n\n[[Starch]] also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=H.|last2=Brijs|first2=K.|last3=Veraverbeke|first3=W.

The granules may not be intact, as the process of [[Milling (machining)|milling]] wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater content affects the mechanical behavior of predough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the [[viscosity]] of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough\u2019s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Weining|last2=Kim|first2=Yangsoo|last3=Li|first3=Xianyu|last4=Rayas-Duarte|first4=Patricia|date=2008-11-01|title=Rheofermentometer parameters and bread specific volume of frozen sweet dough influenced by ingredients and dough mixing temperature|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=48|issue=3|pages=639\u2013646|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2008.02.008}}</ref> Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter\u2019s incorporation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product.<ref name=\":0\" /> As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.\n\n===Lamination===\nIn [[Laminated dough|laminated]] croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains fewer layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Technology of Breadmaking|last=Bent|first=Alan J.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387385631|pages=245\u2013274|language=en|doi=10.1007/0-387-38565-7_9|chapter = Speciality Fermented Goods}}</ref> The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next.\n\nRoll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In [[Laminated dough|laminated]] dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.\n\nThe type of roll-in fat used is typically [[butter]] or [[margarine]]. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil [[emulsion]]s, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McClements|first=David Julian|date=2010-03-04|title=Emulsion Design to Improve the Delivery of Functional Lipophilic Components|journal=Annual Review of Food Science and Technology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=241\u2013269|doi=10.1146/annurev.food.080708.100722|pmid=22129337|issn=1941-1413}}</ref> While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers.<ref name=\":0\" /> On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 44&nbsp;\u00b0C, at least 3&nbsp;\u00b0C higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Baked Products|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=9780470995907|editor-last=Cauvain|editor-first=Stanley P.|pages=72\u201398|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470995907.ch4|editor-last2=Young|editor-first2=Linda S.|df=dmy-all|chapter = Ingredients and Their Influences}}</ref> At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.\n\n===Fermentation===\n[[File:Croissant, cross section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section, showing texture]]\nCroissants contain yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|title=Rising (fermentation)- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163539/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic [[fermentation]]. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide. Once CO2 saturates the dough\u2019s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single CO2 molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable <ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of cereal science and technology|last=Carl|first=Hoseney, R.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=AACC International|oclc=457130408}}</ref>\n\nIn order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with [[steam]] production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse.<ref name=\":1\" /> During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain less layers than other puff pastries.\n\n===Baking===\n[[File:La parisienne unbaked croissant.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Unbaked dough.]]\nDuring baking, the transient [[gluten]] network turns into a permanent network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=Hans|last2=Slade|first2=Louise|last3=Levine|first3=Harry|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2009-11-01|title=Amylases and bread firming \u2013 an integrated view|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|series=Special Section: Enzymes in Grain Processing|volume=50|issue=3|pages=345\u2013352|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2009.04.010}}</ref> At higher temperatures, intermolecular [[Disulfide|disulfide bonds]] form between glutenin molecules, as well as between [[gliadin]] and [[glutenin]].

Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation\u2019s dough lift.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarch undergoes [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinization]] as a result of baking.<ref name=\":3\" /> Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough\u2019s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, [[amylopectin]] crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the same time, [[starch gelatinization]] actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of [[amylose]] leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.\n\nRoll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last=Sievert|first=Dietmar|last2=Hoseney|first2=R.

The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borwankar|first=R.

The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. It is important to note that during the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.\n\n===Storage===\nThe effect of [[gluten]] proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bosmans|first=Geertrui M.|last2=Lagrain|first2=Bert|last3=Ooms|first3=Nand|last4=Fierens|first4=Ellen|last5=Delcour|first5=Jan A.|date=2013-05-15|title=Biopolymer Interactions, Water Dynamics, and Bread Crumb Firming|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=61|issue=19|pages=4646\u20134654|doi=10.1021/jf4010466|pmid=23631677|issn=0021-8561|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/422718}}</ref>\n\nStarch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. [[Amylopectin]] retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more [[crystalline]] structure.<ref name=\":0\" /> The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. [[Retrogradation (starch)|Starch retrogradation]] actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from [[gluten]] to [[starch]] as a result of [[Retrogradation (starch)|starch retrogradation]]. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous [[starch]] fraction and [[gluten]] network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.a.|last2=Bemiller|first2=J.n.|date=2003-01-01|title=Bread Staling: Molecular Basis and Control|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2003.tb00011.x|issn=1541-4337|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity.

It may be flavoured with dried fruit such as [[Sultana (grape)|sultanas]] or [[raisins]], or other fruits such as [[apple]]s. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with [[almond]] filling.\nIn the [[United States]], sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with [[ham]] and [[cheese]], or [[feta cheese]] and [[spinach]]. In the [[Levant]], croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or [[zaatar]]. In [[Germany]], croissants are sometimes filled with [[Nutella]] or [[persipan]]; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with [[lye]] (''Laugencroissant''). In the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], the croissant is typically called a ''Gipfeli''; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.\n\n=== Argentina and Uruguay ===\nCroissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast, ''aperitivo'' (a light mid-morning meal), or ''[[merienda]]'' (a mid-afternoon meal). They are referred to as ''medialunas'' (\"half moons\") because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (''medialunas de manteca'', \"half moons of butter\"). Another variant is a ''medialuna de grasa'' (\"half moon of lard\"), which is not always sweet.\n\n=== Italy ===\nA cousin of the croissant is the Italian ''[[Cornetto (pastry)|cornetto]]'' (in the [[Central Italy|Center]] and [[Southern Italy|South]]) or ''[[brioche]]'' (in the [[Northern Italy|North]]). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the ''cornetto vuoto'' (Italian: \"empty cornetto\") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include ''crema pasticciera'' ([[custard]]), [[apricot jam]] or [[chocolate]] cream. They often come covered with [[powdered sugar]] or other toppings. ''Cornetto'' with [[cappuccino]] at the bar is considered{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to be the one of the most common [[breakfast]]s in Italy.\n\n=== Poland ===\nOn 11 November, St. Martin's Day is celebrated in [[Greater Poland]], mainly in its capital city [[Pozna\u0144]]. On this day, the people of Pozna\u0144 buy and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called ''rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie'' (\"[[St. Martin's croissant]]s\"). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry with a filling made of ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts.\n[[file:Rogale \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144skie RB1.JPG|thumb| ''[[Rogal \u015bwi\u0119tomarci\u0144ski]]'']]\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, \"doce de ovo\". It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered a sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: \"croissant\") but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese p\u00e2tisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.\n\n=== Spain ===\nBesides of the regular croissant, a variation called \"cuerno\" (meaning \"horn\") is sold. It is half of a croissant stuffed usually with cream.\n\n=== Turkey ===\n\nA remote similarity of the croissant shape is the Turkish ''ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi''.

To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step.<ref name=\":0\" /> Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other [[Pastry|pastries]]. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19&nbsp;\u00b0C, to best hydrate the ingredients.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|title=Information Sheets- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220164457/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second step is the [[Laminated dough|lamination]] process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers.<ref name=\":5\" /> After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained.<ref name=\":0\" /> The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.\n\nAfter lamination, the dough is formed into its famous [[crescent]] shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe third step is the [[fermentation]] process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast which, during proofing, increase the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at 31&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":5\" /> The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times its original volume.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe fourth step is the baking process. Also known as \"pastry lift\" or \"dough lift,\" the dough expands as water is converted to [[steam]], thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165&nbsp;\u00b0C to 205&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking.\n\n==Ingredient functionality during processing==\n\n===Predough===\n[[Gluten]] proteins affect the water absorption and [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of the predough.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ooms|first=Nand|last2=Pareyt|first2=Bram|last3=Brijs|first3=Kristof|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2016-10-02|title=Ingredient Functionality in Multilayered Dough-margarine Systems and the Resultant Pastry Products: A Review|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=56|issue=13|pages=2101\u20132114|doi=10.1080/10408398.2014.928259|issn=1040-8398|pmid=26177127}}</ref> The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated [[glutenin]] proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated [[gliadin]] proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough\u2019s viscosity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wieser|first=Herbert|date=2007-04-01|title=Chemistry of gluten proteins|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.07.004|issn=0740-0020|pmid=17008153}}</ref>\n\n[[Starch]] also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=H.|last2=Brijs|first2=K.|last3=Veraverbeke|first3=W.

The granules may not be intact, as the process of [[Milling (machining)|milling]] wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater content affects the mechanical behavior of predough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the [[viscosity]] of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough\u2019s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Weining|last2=Kim|first2=Yangsoo|last3=Li|first3=Xianyu|last4=Rayas-Duarte|first4=Patricia|date=2008-11-01|title=Rheofermentometer parameters and bread specific volume of frozen sweet dough influenced by ingredients and dough mixing temperature|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=48|issue=3|pages=639\u2013646|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2008.02.008}}</ref> Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter\u2019s incorporation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product.<ref name=\":0\" /> As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.\n\n===Lamination===\nIn [[Laminated dough|laminated]] croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains fewer layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Technology of Breadmaking|last=Bent|first=Alan J.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387385631|pages=245\u2013274|language=en|doi=10.1007/0-387-38565-7_9|chapter = Speciality Fermented Goods}}</ref> The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next.\n\nRoll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In [[Laminated dough|laminated]] dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.\n\nThe type of roll-in fat used is typically [[butter]] or [[margarine]]. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil [[emulsion]]s, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McClements|first=David Julian|date=2010-03-04|title=Emulsion Design to Improve the Delivery of Functional Lipophilic Components|journal=Annual Review of Food Science and Technology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=241\u2013269|doi=10.1146/annurev.food.080708.100722|pmid=22129337|issn=1941-1413}}</ref> While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32&nbsp;\u00b0C, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers.<ref name=\":0\" /> On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 44&nbsp;\u00b0C, at least 3&nbsp;\u00b0C higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Baked Products|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=9780470995907|editor-last=Cauvain|editor-first=Stanley P.|pages=72\u201398|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470995907.ch4|editor-last2=Young|editor-first2=Linda S.|df=dmy-all|chapter = Ingredients and Their Influences}}</ref> At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.\n\n===Fermentation===\n[[File:Croissant, cross section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section, showing texture]]\nCroissants contain yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|title=Rising (fermentation)- BakeInfo (Baking Industry Research Trust)|last=Bakeinfo|website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163539/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic [[fermentation]]. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide. Once CO2 saturates the dough\u2019s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single CO2 molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable <ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of cereal science and technology|last=Carl|first=Hoseney, R.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=AACC International|oclc=457130408}}</ref>\n\nIn order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with [[steam]] production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse.<ref name=\":1\" /> During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain less layers than other puff pastries.\n\n===Baking===\n[[File:La parisienne unbaked croissant.jpg|thumb|right|222px|Unbaked dough.]]\nDuring baking, the transient [[gluten]] network turns into a permanent network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goesaert|first=Hans|last2=Slade|first2=Louise|last3=Levine|first3=Harry|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2009-11-01|title=Amylases and bread firming \u2013 an integrated view|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|series=Special Section: Enzymes in Grain Processing|volume=50|issue=3|pages=345\u2013352|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2009.04.010}}</ref> At higher temperatures, intermolecular [[Disulfide|disulfide bonds]] form between glutenin molecules, as well as between [[gliadin]] and [[glutenin]]. With more bonds being made, the gluten network becomes more rigid, strengthening the croissant\u2019s crumb texture. Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation\u2019s dough lift.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarch undergoes [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinization]] as a result of baking.<ref name=\":3\" /> Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough\u2019s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, [[amylopectin]] crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the same time, [[starch gelatinization]] actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of [[amylose]] leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.\n\nRoll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last=Sievert|first=Dietmar|last2=Hoseney|first2=R.

The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borwankar|first=R.

The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough.<ref name=\":0\" /> As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. It is important to note that during the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.\n\n===Storage===\nThe effect of [[gluten]] proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bosmans|first=Geertrui M.|last2=Lagrain|first2=Bert|last3=Ooms|first3=Nand|last4=Fierens|first4=Ellen|last5=Delcour|first5=Jan A.|date=2013-05-15|title=Biopolymer Interactions, Water Dynamics, and Bread Crumb Firming|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=61|issue=19|pages=4646\u20134654|doi=10.1021/jf4010466|pmid=23631677|issn=0021-8561|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/422718}}</ref>\n\nStarch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. [[Amylopectin]] retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more [[crystalline]] structure.<ref name=\":0\" /> The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. [[Retrogradation (starch)|Starch retrogradation]] actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWater migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from [[gluten]] to [[starch]] as a result of [[Retrogradation (starch)|starch retrogradation]]. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous [[starch]] fraction and [[gluten]] network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.a.|last2=Bemiller|first2=J.n.|date=2003-01-01|title=Bread Staling: Molecular Basis and Control|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1\u201321|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2003.tb00011.x|issn=1541-4337|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Roca|first=Elisabeth|last2=Guillard|first2=Val\u00e9rie|last3=Guilbert|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Gontard|first4=Nathalie|date=2006-03-01|title=Moisture migration in a cereal composite food at high water activity: Effects of initial porosity and fat content|url=|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=43|issue=2|pages=144\u2013151|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2005.08.008}}</ref> As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads.\n\nFat also affects the quality of croissants in storage. On one hand, an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is likely attributed to the high-fat content of croissants, as increased fat levels decrease moisture diffusion.<ref name=\":2\" /> On the other hand, although roll-in fat softens the croissant\u2019s initial crumb, its effect on croissant hardness during storage is still unclear.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Croissan'wich]]\n* [[Cronut]]\n* [[Cruffin]]\n* [[Danish pastry]]\n* [[Cornetto (pastry)|Cornetto]]\n* [[List of brunch foods]]\n* [[List of butter dishes]]\n* [[List of French dishes]]\n* [[List of pastries]]\n* [[Torpedo dessert]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''The [[Oxford Companion to Food]]''\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|croissant}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Baked goods with religious iconography}}\n{{Pastries}}\n\n[[Category:Foods featuring butter]]\n[[Category:Austrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:French pastries]]\n", "name_user": "Croissant10101", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(banme :0)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant"}
