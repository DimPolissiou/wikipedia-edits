{"title_page": "Consul", "text_new": "{{About|the term \"Consul\" as a high-ranking government executive|the term \"Consul\" in modern diplomacy|Consul (representative)|\"Consul\" as a colonial or occupying administrator|Administrative consul|other uses of the word|Consul (disambiguation)}}\n{{wiktionary|consul}}\n'''Consul''' (abbrev. ''cos.''; [[Latin]] plural ''consules'') was the title of one of the two chief [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] of the [[Roman Republic]], and subsequently also an important title under the [[Roman Empire]]. The title was used in other European [[city state]]s through antiquity and the Middle Ages, then revived in modern [[State (polity)|states]], notably in the [[First French Republic]]. The related adjective is '''consular''', from the Latin ''[[consularis]]''.\n\nThis usage contrasts with modern terminology, where a consul is a [[Consul (representative)|type of diplomat]].\n{{main article|Consul (representative)}}\n\n==Roman consul==\n{{main article|Roman consul}}\nA consul held the highest elected political office of the [[Roman Republic]] (509 to 27 BC), and ancient Romans considered the consulship the highest level of the [[cursus honorum]] (an ascending sequence of public offices to which politicians aspired). Consuls were elected to office and held power for one year. There were always two consuls in power at any time.\n\n===See also ===\n* Chronological listings of Roman consuls (in law always republican Magistrates):\n** [[List of Roman Consuls|List of Roman consuls]]\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[Pauly\u2013Wissowa]]\n* [[Political institutions of Rome]]\n* [[Hypatos]]\n\n==Other uses in antiquity==\n\n===Private sphere===\nIt was not uncommon for an organization under Roman private law to copy the terminology of state and city institutions for its own statutory agents. The founding statute, or contract, of such an organisation was called ''lex'', 'law'. The people elected each year were [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], members of the upper class.\n\n===City states===\nWhile many cities, including the Gallic states and the [[Carthaginian Republic]], had a double-headed chief magistracy, another [[title]] was often used, such as the [[Punic]] ''[[sufet]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Brenda |title=ROMAN LITERARY ATTITUDES TO FOREIGN TERMS AND THE CARTHAGINIAN 'SUFETES' |journal=Classical Association of South Africa |date=1989 |volume=32 |pages=29\u201336 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24591869 |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> ''Duumvir'', or native styles like ''Meddix''.\n\n==Medieval city states, communes and municipalities==\nThroughout most of southern [[Kingdom of France|France]], a consul ({{lang-fr|consul}} or ''{{lang|fr|consule}}'') was an office equivalent to the {{Interlanguage link multi|\u00c9chevin (France)|fr|3=\u00c9chevin|lt=\u00e9chevins}} of the north and roughly similar with [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[alderman|aldermen]]. The most prominent were those of [[Bordeaux]] and [[Toulouse]], which came to be known as [[jurat]]s and [[capitoul]]s, respectively. The capitouls of Toulouse were granted transmittable nobility. In many other smaller towns the first consul was the equivalent of a mayor today, assisted by a variable number of secondary consuls and jurats. His main task was to levy and collect tax.\n\nThe [[Duke]]s of [[Gaeta]] often used also the title of \"consul\" in its Greek form \"[[Hypatos]]\" (see [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta]]).\n\nThe city-state of [[Genoa]], unlike ancient Rome, bestowed the title of ''consul'' on various state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these were Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role included helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local authorities.

''cos.''; [[Latin]] plural ''consules'') was the title of one of the two chief [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]] of the [[Roman Republic]], and subsequently also an important title under the [[Roman Empire]]. The title was used in other European [[city state]]s through antiquity and the Middle Ages, then revived in modern [[State (polity)|states]], notably in the [[First French Republic]]. The related adjective is '''consular''', from the Latin ''[[consularis]]''.\n\nThis usage contrasts with modern terminology, where a consul is a [[Consul (representative)|type of diplomat]].\n{{main article|Consul (representative)}}\n\n==Roman consul==\n{{main article|Roman consul}}\nA consul held the highest elected political office of the [[Roman Republic]] (509 to 27 BC), and ancient Romans considered the consulship the highest level of the [[cursus honorum]] (an ascending sequence of public offices to which politicians aspired). Consuls were elected to office and held power for one year. There were always two consuls in power at any time.\n\n===See also ===\n* Chronological listings of Roman consuls (in law always republican Magistrates):\n** [[List of Roman Consuls|List of Roman consuls]]\n* [[List of topics related to ancient Rome]]\n* [[Pauly\u2013Wissowa]]\n* [[Political institutions of Rome]]\n* [[Hypatos]]\n\n==Other uses in antiquity==\n\n===Private sphere===\nIt was not uncommon for an organization under Roman private law to copy the terminology of state and city institutions for its own statutory agents. The founding statute, or contract, of such an organisation was called ''lex'', 'law'. The people elected each year were [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], members of the upper class.\n\n===City states===\nWhile many cities, including the Gallic states and the [[Carthaginian Republic]], had a double-headed chief magistracy, another [[title]] was often used, such as the [[Punic]] ''[[sufet]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Brenda |title=ROMAN LITERARY ATTITUDES TO FOREIGN TERMS AND THE CARTHAGINIAN 'SUFETES' |journal=Classical Association of South Africa |date=1989 |volume=32 |pages=29\u201336 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24591869 |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> ''Duumvir'', or native styles like ''Meddix''.\n\n==Medieval city states, communes and municipalities==\nThroughout most of southern [[Kingdom of France|France]], a consul ({{lang-fr|consul}} or ''{{lang|fr|consule}}'') was an office equivalent to the {{Interlanguage link multi|\u00c9chevin (France)|fr|3=\u00c9chevin|lt=\u00e9chevins}} of the north and roughly similar with [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[alderman|aldermen]]. The most prominent were those of [[Bordeaux]] and [[Toulouse]], which came to be known as [[jurat]]s and [[capitoul]]s, respectively. The capitouls of Toulouse were granted transmittable nobility. In many other smaller towns the first consul, was the equivalent of a mayor today, assisted by a variable number of secondary consuls and jurats. His main task was to levy and collect tax.\n\nThe [[Duke]]s of [[Gaeta]] often used also the title of \"consul\" in its Greek form \"[[Hypatos]]\" (see [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta]]).\n\nThe city-state of [[Genoa]], unlike ancient Rome, bestowed the title of ''consul'' on various state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these were Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role included helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local authorities.

(often referred to as '''the Met''' or '''Metropolitan''') was a former Canadian chain of [[variety store]]s based in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. The Metropolitan Stores chain was founded in 1920 and also operated junior department and clothing stores under the '''[[SAAN Stores|SAAN]]''', '''Greenberg''' and '''Red Apple''' banners. At its peak, Metropolitan was one of the four largest variety chain store organizations in [[Canada]] with 180 stores in all the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]]. The chain's headquarters was located at 1370 Sony Place in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] and its warehouse distribution centre was situated at 3075 [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Quebec]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe chain began in 1908 when F.H. Brewster, the founder, opened his first [[Variety store#North America|five-and-ten cent store]] eponymously named '''F.H. Brewster & Company''' at 483-485 Talbot Street in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]]. Other stores were opened under the name of \"F.H. Brewster & Company\" in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]], [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham]] and other [[Ontario]] cities. Brewster lost his first two stores in London: one before it even opened when the neighbouring crockery store \"Reid's Crystal Hall\" collapsed into it during a renovation to the building on July 16, 1907, as two salesgirls were sorting out stock for the grand opening later that week;<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=41&dat=19070718&id=pRQKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HygDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3856,954056&hl=en ''Dawson Daily News'': Whole Block Collapses and Nine are Killed]</ref> the other store was lost in a [[Dundas Street]] fire only a year or two after operation on the night of November 3, 1911. Brewster's new store, which appeared the following year, was built and designed for the owner Sir George Gibbons by London architects Watt & Blackwell.<ref>[https://metropolitanmarket.wordpress.com/2011/04/09/history-of-metropolitan-market/ ''History of Metropolitan Market''] at metropolitanmarket.wordpress.com</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 1913, Brewster's new three-storey store at 146-148 Colborne Street in [[Brantford]], Ontario, was also damaged by a fire to the extent of $25,000. The fire erupted in the morning when the store was open and employees and customers were inside. The store's large stock of flammable material flashed into a blazing furnace.<ref>[http://virtual.brantfordexpositor.ca/doc/Brantford-Expositor/a-walk-on-the-south-side/2010060101/23.html#22 ''Colborne Street Calamities''] at [[Brantford Expositor]]</ref>\n\nThe company was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in Canada as '''Metropolitan Stores Ltd.''' on May 11, 1920, and commenced business after \"Metropolitan 5 to 50\u00a2 Stores Inc.\" of the [[United States]] purchased control of the \"Canadian Smallwares Company\" chain of seven stores and merged it with four units of the \"Variety 5\u00a2 and 10\u00a2 Stores\" of [[Montreal]], numbering eleven stores in all. At the close of 1928, Metropolitan Stores was operating a chain of 130 stores from coast to coast in Canada and the United States, with 31 Canadian stores alone located in four provinces: [[Quebec]], Ontario, [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=906129&fcfToken=6b5839302f733142494777766d516b5931456776437755415339424c375651657a4163545a4f454b31366e76352f704e7566622b71436a466a2b6d3878736247 ''The Ottawa Journal''] November 26, 1963</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1929, the newly renovated and expanded Metropolitan Store and its Canadian head office opened at 136, 138 and 140 Dundas Street in London. The buildings at 136, 138 and 140 Dundas Street were also built by London architects Watt & Blackwell in 1914: 136 and 138 Dundas Street was built for the Metropolitan Store, while 140 Dundas Street was combined and renovated with 136 and 138 Dundas to house the Canadian head office for Metropolitan Stores.\n\n===Rise and expansion===\nBy 1930, Metropolitan Stores Ltd. was operating 52 stores and had assets of $10 million, sales of $7.4 million and a net profit of $423,000. On October 6, 1930, \"Metropolitan 5 to 50\u00a2 Stores Inc.\" sold its Canadian [[subsidiary]] to [[H. L. Green Company|F. & W.

Green Company Inc.]] (also of the United States) acquired them both on July 26, 1933. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan name disappeared in the U.S. but it remained in Canada. In subsequent years, the Metropolitan Store chain prospered and expanded at a conservative rate, operating 85 stores in practically all of the principal cities in Canada between 1933 and 1960.\n\nAfter 40 years of being controlled by United States interests, H.L. Green Company Inc. signed an agreement on March 3, 1961, for the sale of the operating assets of its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of Metropolitan Stores Ltd. to investment bankers [[Richardson International|James Richardson & Sons Ltd.]] of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] for approximately $19 million in cash, which returned the company to 100 per cent Canadian ownership. The agreement brought 86 stores and one warehouse located mainly in Ontario, Quebec and Winnipeg with annual sales in excess of $20 million and an annual profit after taxes of more than $1 million. Following the purchase, James Richardson & Sons transferred the business of Metropolitan Stores Ltd. to a newly formed Canadian corporation that became known as '''Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd.'''<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=690762&fcfToken=32574c674b4356696e5462507943704a31586958715936396d36784f7174756c4962782f563435484133436d4b41462b56374c3858795965685234574a4e6736 ''Winnipeg Firm Buys Metropolitan Stores''] at ''[[Ottawa Journal]]'' March 4, 1961</ref>\n\nTwo months later on May 15, 1961, [[Albert D. Cohen]], President of the Cohen family-owned real estate and investment company [[Albert D. Cohen#Gendis today|General Distributors Ltd.]] (headquartered in Winnipeg and whose name was changed to Gendis Inc. in 1983) announced that he and his associates had purchased a major interest in Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. and, under his leadership, plans were underway for substantial expansion and development, including the opening of new Metropolitan Stores in shopping centres across the country. Soon after General Distributors acquired Metropolitan Stores, it closed the London, Ontario executive office and relocated that function to the new executive office and warehouse in [[Pointe-Claire]], Quebec. By 1963, Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. was the fourth-largest variety chain store organization in Canada, behind [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], [[Kmart#Early history|Kresge]] and [[Zellers]], operating 111 stores from coast to coast.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19610516&id=MC4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rOUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5707,271215&hl=en ''Metropolitan Stores Under New Owners''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' May 16, 1961</ref>\n\nMetropolitan Stores continued to expand directly and through its subsidiaries (Greenberg Stores and [[SAAN Stores]]) throughout the 1960s and 1970s, totalling 180 stores in all Canadian provinces, including 64 junior department stores operated by Greenberg Stores and 73 stores operated by SAAN Stores, with 24 Metropolitan stores which opened between 1973 and 1976. Of the 180 stores in the Metropolitan chain, there were 50 in Ontario, 15 in Nova Scotia, 17 in New Brunswick, 35 in Quebec, 8 in Manitoba, 7 in [[Saskatchewan]], 11 in [[Alberta]], 6 in [[British Columbia]], 2 in [[Prince Edward Island]] and 29 in [[Western Canada]]. By the mid-1970s, General Distributors' portfolio of Metropolitan Stores and its subsidiaries was riding high and annual sales stood at $137 million.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LlMUAQAAMAAJ&q=metropolitan+stores:+department+and+variety+stores&dq=metropolitan+stores:+department+and+variety+stores&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNvJG2rf3NAhUi0YMKHeBRABIQ6AEIMzAB Levine, Sumner N.

Metropolitan and its subsidiary Greenberg Stores struggled financially in the 1990s as the Canadian retail landscape changed with the 1994 entry of [[Walmart Canada]] followed by its acquisition of 122 [[Woolco]] stores which exerted significant additional competitive pressure on retail stores.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=TxZUDAAAQBAJ&pg=RA3-PA80&lpg=RA3-PA80&dq=metropolitan+stores:+bankrupt:+1994&source=bl&ots=k4j8SxEl4A&sig=05Cl0AoKeH1G244H8A1xJcV0H4k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjj8mcs-7NAhUT2WMKHQF2AqQQ6AEIJzAE#v=onepage&q=metropolitan%20stores%3A%20bankrupt%3A%201994&f=false ''Canadian Bankruptcy/Insolvency and Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Law''] Maither, Lyndon, CFE, B.Comm.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, some of the Metropolitan store locations were renamed '''The Met''' while other stores continued to operate under the full Metropolitan banner. In 1993, Gendis Inc. began converting Metropolitan Stores and Greenberg Stores to a new department store format called '''MetMart''' as an attempt to compete against Walmart; however, the MetMart conversion strategy proved to be unsuccessful and was short-lived.\n\nBy 1996, cracks began to appear in the Gendis retail empire due to declining sales revenues and their MMG Management Group of Montreal was voluntarily assigned into bankruptcy on February 11, 1997. When Gendis closed its remaining 169 Metropolitan Stores, MetMart and Greenberg Stores for good in February 1997, SAAN acquired 89 of these outlets at a cost of $31 million and rebranded them under the SAAN Stores and '''Red Apple Stores''' banners.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Gendis+Inc.+Withdraws+Financial+Support+for+MMG+Management+Group+MMG...-a019107050 Gendis Inc.

The stores carried [[household items]] ([[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[Lock (security device)|locks]], [[screwdriver]]s, [[hammer]]s, [[saw]]s, [[wrench]]es, [[pliers]], [[Diagonal pliers|wire cutters]], [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]], [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]], [[screw]]s, [[shovel]]s, [[pitchfork]]s, [[Drill bit|hand spades]], [[Drill bit|spades]], [[Rake (tool)|rakes]], [[Hose|watering hoses]], [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinklers]]), [[Dry goods|sundries]], seasonal products, [[clothing]] and [[footwear]] (men, women, children, infants), food and [[snack]]s, [[jewellery]], [[stationery]], [[Tableware|crockery]], [[Cosmetics|beauty products]], [[furniture]], [[toy]]s (namely dolls, doll clothing including dresses, sleepwear and accessories, model cars, miniature pick-up trucks, container trucks, wheels, rigs and doll play bags), [[electronics]], creative products like [[Needlework|needlecrafts]], [[Textile|fabrics]] and Phentex [[yarn]].\n\nThe Metropolitan Stores [[slogan]]s have included the following:\n\n*\"Where Your Money Buys More\"\n*\"Thrifty Canadians find it pays to shop at the Met\"\n*\"Your friendly Met Store\"\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Store logo.png|thumbnail|right|Metropolitan's original logo used during 1960s and 1970s]]\nOn September 15, 1966, Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. adopted its company [[logo]] consisting of a large letter \"M\" which bears a stylized blue [[maple leaf]] as its centre containing \"MET\" lettered in white color.<ref>[http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do?lang=eng&status=OK&fileNumber=0475502&extension=0&startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1 Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. trade-mark data] at [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]</ref>\n\n===Cafe Met===\nFor many years, Metropolitan featured in-store [[lunch counter]]-style restaurants known as '''Cafe Met''' which were usually located at the back of the stores or, when a store had a second sales floor, they were located either in the basement or upstairs on the first floor. However, as the years went on and many larger stores were either closed or converted, fewer Metropolitan Stores had cafes in them. They served a fairly standard menu of hot and cold drinks, [[hamburger]]s, [[hot dog]]s, [[French fries|fries]], and such other sandwiches as [[Cheese sandwich|grilled cheese]], hot turkey and turkey [[club sandwich]]es.\n\n===Subsidiaries===\n*'''SAAN Stores''' was a chain of [[discount store]]s which began in Winnipeg in 1947. Surplus items from the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] were the company's first supply source until its sales grew and more SAAN stores opened. After filing for bankruptcy, SAAN closed its 126 stores nationwide with a going-out-of-business sale in 2008. The chain was purchased out of bankruptcy in August 2008 by Genuity Capital, the owner of [[The Bargain! Shop]] chain at that time, and stores reopened as Bargain! Shop locations.\n*'''Greenberg Stores''' was a small-size discount store chain operated by Gendis and were located in smaller towns. It was mainly a clothing store but also included a restaurant, toys, small appliances, candies and other departments. When Greenberg closed in 1997, many stores were reopened as SAAN Stores.\n*'''Red Apple Stores''' is a small chain of clearance stores and a former division of SAAN founded in 1989 in [[Western Canada]] which offers consumers discount pricing on quality family clothing, clothing basics, housewares, snacks as well as limited grocery items. The Red Apple and SAAN names were purchased when SAAN was acquired by Genuity Capital in August 2008.\n\n===Rideau Street store===\n\nThe largest of the flagship Metropolitan Stores chain in Canada was located at 80 [[Rideau Street]], a major street of primary retail thoroughfares in [[Downtown Ottawa]], Ontario, which opened on April 7, 1949. The Metropolitan building, situated at the southwest corner of Rideau and Mosgrove streets (later renamed Freiman Street), was the setting of a three-storey shopping center (basement and two storeys at 11300 sq. ft. per level) which included complete wearing apparel sections for men, women, children and infants, a [[lunch counter]], an elevator and escalator from the first to the second floor, a wide stairway, a [[pastry]] department and a customers' lounge were also featured in this spacious store. The store's exterior facade included wide visual all-glass windows from floor to ceiling, presenting a complete view of the interior from front to rear walls; above the doors and window frontage, the full Metropolitan name was illuminated in red letters on a grey vitrolite frieze, abbreviated to \"Metro\" (and later to \"Met\") along the Mosgrove side street.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19490406&id=chMvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gdwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6278,1547137&hl=en ''First Metropolitan Store Opens in Ottawa Thursday''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' April 6, 1949.</ref>\n\nThe Metropolitan continued to operate at this location until the early 1980s. By January 1981, when a whole block of stores on the south side of Rideau Street was torn down to make room for the construction of the [[Rideau Centre]] shopping complex, the Metropolitan remained opened for a few months longer and was in the middle of the stretch of Rideau that was being developed. The store was not expropriated at the time surrounding properties were taken over by the federal government. The Metropolitan was to be originally incorporated into Rideau Centre with plans to convert it from a nickel-and-dime store into a [[luxury goods]] store, but the plans were cancelled.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=76IyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ze4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6852,4382508&dq=edelson+rideau+street&hl=en ''Rideau Street evictions anger small merchants''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' December 4, 1980</ref>\n\nInstead, the City of Ottawa and General Distributors of Winnipeg agreed in December 1981 to close Metropolitan and approved a $1.5-million redevelopment of the store's building as part of the Rideau Centre project. Once the Metropolitan Store closed in early 1982, the building's two-storey interior was completely renovated (with a third floor added) and subdivided into smaller spaces to be rented to a dozen retail stores. The facade was replaced to match the exterior of the Rideau Centre, and the interior shopping mall linked the Metropolitan building with the rest of the complex. The former building continued to be owned and leased to various stores by Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. after the Rideau Centre opened in 1983.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19811202&id=QL4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jO4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4179,1374180&hl=en ''Store Renovations Approved''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' December 2, 1981.</ref>\n\nToday, the vast majority of the first and second floor spaces of the old Metropolitan Store building in the Rideau Centre is occupied by [[Forever 21]] store, and the other subdivided spaces are still being rented by retail stores.\n\n===Presidents===\n*F.H.

Customers and employees were ordered by store officials to vacate the premises as soon as the smoke was first noticed. The building was re-designed and upgraded in 1962.

(often referred to as '''the Met''' or '''Metropolitan''') was a former Canadian chain of [[variety store]]s based in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. The Metropolitan Stores chain was founded in 1920 and also operated junior department and clothing stores under the '''[[SAAN Stores|SAAN]]''', '''Greenberg''' and '''Red Apple''' banners. At its peak, Metropolitan was one of the four largest variety chain store organizations in [[Canada]] with 180 stores in all the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]]. The chain's headquarters was located at 1370 Sony Place in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] and its warehouse distribution centre was situated at 3075 [[Trans-Canada Highway]] in [[Pointe-Claire]], [[Quebec]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe chain began in 1908 when F.H. Brewster, the founder, opened his first [[Variety store#North America|five-and-ten cent store]] eponymously named '''F.H. Brewster & Company''' at 483-485 Talbot Street in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]]. Other stores were opened under the name of \"F.H. Brewster & Company\" in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]], [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham]] and other [[Ontario]] cities. Brewster lost his first two stores in London: one before it even opened when the neighbouring crockery store \"Reid's Crystal Hall\" collapsed into it during a renovation to the building on July 16, 1907, as two salesgirls were sorting out stock for the grand opening later that week;<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=41&dat=19070718&id=pRQKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HygDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3856,954056&hl=en ''Dawson Daily News'': Whole Block Collapses and Nine are Killed]</ref> the other store was lost in a [[Dundas Street]] fire only a year or two after operation on the night of November 3, 1911. Brewster's new store, which appeared the following year, was built and designed for the owner Sir George Gibbons by London architects Watt & Blackwell.<ref>[https://metropolitanmarket.wordpress.com/2011/04/09/history-of-metropolitan-market/ ''History of Metropolitan Market''] at metropolitanmarket.wordpress.com</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 1913, Brewster's new three-storey store at 146-148 Colborne Street in [[Brantford]], Ontario, was also damaged by a fire to the extent of $25,000. The fire erupted in the morning when the store was open and employees and customers were inside. The store's large stock of flammable material flashed into a blazing furnace.<ref>[http://virtual.brantfordexpositor.ca/doc/Brantford-Expositor/a-walk-on-the-south-side/2010060101/23.html#22 ''Colborne Street Calamities''] at [[Brantford Expositor]]</ref>\n\nThe company was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in Canada as '''Metropolitan Stores Ltd.''' on May 11, 1920, and commenced business after \"Metropolitan 5 to 50\u00a2 Stores Inc.\" of the [[United States]] purchased control of the \"Canadian Smallwares Company\" chain of seven stores and merged it with four units of the \"Variety 5\u00a2 and 10\u00a2 Stores\" of [[Montreal]], numbering eleven stores in all. At the close of 1928, Metropolitan Stores was operating a chain of 130 stores from coast to coast in Canada and the United States, with 31 Canadian stores alone located in four provinces: [[Quebec]], Ontario, [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=906129&fcfToken=6b5839302f733142494777766d516b5931456776437755415339424c375651657a4163545a4f454b31366e76352f704e7566622b71436a466a2b6d3878736247 ''The Ottawa Journal''] November 26, 1963</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1929, the newly renovated and expanded Metropolitan Store and its Canadian head office opened at 136, 138 and 140 Dundas Street in London. The buildings at 136, 138 and 140 Dundas Street were also built by London architects Watt & Blackwell in 1914: 136 and 138 Dundas Street was built for the Metropolitan Store, while 140 Dundas Street was combined and renovated with 136 and 138 Dundas to house the Canadian head office for Metropolitan Stores.\n\n===Rise and expansion===\nBy 1930, Metropolitan Stores Ltd. was operating 52 stores and had assets of $10 million, sales of $7.4 million and a net profit of $423,000. On October 6, 1930, \"Metropolitan 5 to 50\u00a2 Stores Inc.\" sold its Canadian [[subsidiary]] to [[H. L. Green Company|F. & W. Grand-Silver Stores Inc.]] of the [[United States]] and when this latter company went into receivership three years later, [[H. L. Green Company|H.L. Green Company Inc.]] (also of the United States) acquired them both on July 26, 1933. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan name disappeared in the U.S. but it remained in Canada. In subsequent years, the Metropolitan Store chain prospered and expanded at a conservative rate, operating 85 stores in practically all of the principal cities in Canada between 1933 and 1960.\n\nAfter 40 years of being controlled by United States interests, H.L. Green Company Inc. signed an agreement on March 3, 1961, for the sale of the operating assets of its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of Metropolitan Stores Ltd. to investment bankers [[Richardson International|James Richardson & Sons Ltd.]] of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] for approximately $19 million in cash, which returned the company to 100 per cent Canadian ownership. The agreement brought 86 stores and one warehouse located mainly in Ontario, Quebec and Winnipeg with annual sales in excess of $20 million and an annual profit after taxes of more than $1 million. Following the purchase, James Richardson & Sons transferred the business of Metropolitan Stores Ltd. to a newly formed Canadian corporation that became known as '''Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd.'''<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=690762&fcfToken=32574c674b4356696e5462507943704a31586958715936396d36784f7174756c4962782f563435484133436d4b41462b56374c3858795965685234574a4e6736 ''Winnipeg Firm Buys Metropolitan Stores''] at ''[[Ottawa Journal]]'' March 4, 1961</ref>\n\nTwo months later on May 15, 1961, [[Albert D. Cohen]], President of the Cohen family-owned real estate and investment company [[Albert D. Cohen#Gendis today|General Distributors Ltd.]] (headquartered in Winnipeg and whose name was changed to Gendis Inc. in 1983) announced that he and his associates had purchased a major interest in Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. and, under his leadership, plans were underway for substantial expansion and development, including the opening of new Metropolitan Stores in shopping centres across the country. Soon after General Distributors acquired Metropolitan Stores, it closed the London, Ontario executive office and relocated that function to the new executive office and warehouse in [[Pointe-Claire]], Quebec. By 1963, Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. was the fourth-largest variety chain store organization in Canada, behind [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], [[Kmart#Early history|Kresge]] and [[Zellers]], operating 111 stores from coast to coast.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19610516&id=MC4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rOUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5707,271215&hl=en ''Metropolitan Stores Under New Owners''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' May 16, 1961</ref>\n\nMetropolitan Stores continued to expand directly and through its subsidiaries (Greenberg Stores and [[SAAN Stores]]) throughout the 1960s and 1970s, totalling 180 stores in all Canadian provinces, including 64 junior department stores operated by Greenberg Stores and 73 stores operated by SAAN Stores, with 24 Metropolitan stores which opened between 1973 and 1976. Of the 180 stores in the Metropolitan chain, there were 50 in Ontario, 15 in Nova Scotia, 17 in New Brunswick, 35 in Quebec, 8 in Manitoba, 7 in [[Saskatchewan]], 11 in [[Alberta]], 6 in [[British Columbia]], 2 in [[Prince Edward Island]] and 29 in [[Western Canada]]. By the mid-1970s, General Distributors' portfolio of Metropolitan Stores and its subsidiaries was riding high and annual sales stood at $137 million.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LlMUAQAAMAAJ&q=metropolitan+stores:+department+and+variety+stores&dq=metropolitan+stores:+department+and+variety+stores&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNvJG2rf3NAhUi0YMKHeBRABIQ6AEIMzAB Levine, Sumner N. ''Financial Analyst's Handbook: Methods, theory, and portfolio management''] Dow Jones-Irwin, 1975</ref>\n\n===Closures, bankruptcy and acquisition by SAAN===\nDuring the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, several of the Metropolitan Stores were either closed or converted into [[SAAN Stores]] due to the harsh economic climate, as well as intense retail competition in eastern Canada. Metropolitan and its subsidiary Greenberg Stores struggled financially in the 1990s as the Canadian retail landscape changed with the 1994 entry of [[Walmart Canada]] followed by its acquisition of 122 [[Woolco]] stores which exerted significant additional competitive pressure on retail stores.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=TxZUDAAAQBAJ&pg=RA3-PA80&lpg=RA3-PA80&dq=metropolitan+stores:+bankrupt:+1994&source=bl&ots=k4j8SxEl4A&sig=05Cl0AoKeH1G244H8A1xJcV0H4k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjjj8mcs-7NAhUT2WMKHQF2AqQQ6AEIJzAE#v=onepage&q=metropolitan%20stores%3A%20bankrupt%3A%201994&f=false ''Canadian Bankruptcy/Insolvency and Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Law''] Maither, Lyndon, CFE, B.Comm.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, some of the Metropolitan store locations were renamed '''The Met''' while other stores continued to operate under the full Metropolitan banner. In 1993, Gendis Inc. began converting Metropolitan Stores and Greenberg Stores to a new department store format called '''MetMart''' as an attempt to compete against Walmart; however, the MetMart conversion strategy proved to be unsuccessful and was short-lived.\n\nBy 1996, cracks began to appear in the Gendis retail empire due to declining sales revenues and their MMG Management Group of Montreal was voluntarily assigned into bankruptcy on February 11, 1997. When Gendis closed its remaining 169 Metropolitan Stores, MetMart and Greenberg Stores for good in February 1997, SAAN acquired 89 of these outlets at a cost of $31 million and rebranded them under the SAAN Stores and '''Red Apple Stores''' banners.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Gendis+Inc.+Withdraws+Financial+Support+for+MMG+Management+Group+MMG...-a019107050 Gendis Inc.

The stores carried [[household items]] ([[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[Lock (security device)|locks]], [[screwdriver]]s, [[hammer]]s, [[saw]]s, [[wrench]]es, [[pliers]], [[Diagonal pliers|wire cutters]], [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]], [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]], [[screw]]s, [[shovel]]s, [[pitchfork]]s, [[Drill bit|hand spades]], [[Drill bit|spades]], [[Rake (tool)|rakes]], [[Hose|watering hoses]], [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinklers]]), [[Dry goods|sundries]], seasonal products, [[clothing]] and [[footwear]] (men, women, children, infants), food and [[snack]]s, [[jewellery]], [[stationery]], [[Tableware|crockery]], [[Cosmetics|beauty products]], [[furniture]], [[toy]]s (namely dolls, doll clothing including dresses, sleepwear and accessories, model cars, miniature pick-up trucks, container trucks, wheels, rigs and doll play bags), [[electronics]], creative products like [[Needlework|needlecrafts]], [[Textile|fabrics]] and Phentex [[yarn]].\n\nThe Metropolitan Stores [[slogan]]s have included the following:\n\n*\"Where Your Money Buys More\"\n*\"Thrifty Canadians find it pays to shop at the Met\"\n*\"Your friendly Met Store\"\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Store logo.png|thumbnail|right|Metropolitan's original logo used during 1960s and 1970s]]\nOn September 15, 1966, Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. adopted its company [[logo]] consisting of a large letter \"M\" which bears a stylized blue [[maple leaf]] as its centre containing \"MET\" lettered in white color.<ref>[http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do?lang=eng&status=OK&fileNumber=0475502&extension=0&startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1 Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. trade-mark data] at [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]</ref>\n\n===Cafe Met===\nFor many years, Metropolitan featured in-store [[lunch counter]]-style restaurants known as '''Cafe Met''' which were usually located at the back of the stores or, when a store had a second sales floor, they were located either in the basement or upstairs on the first floor. However, as the years went on and many larger stores were either closed or converted, fewer Metropolitan Stores had cafes in them. They served a fairly standard menu of hot and cold drinks, [[hamburger]]s, [[hot dog]]s, [[French fries|fries]], and such other sandwiches as [[Cheese sandwich|grilled cheese]], hot turkey and turkey [[club sandwich]]es.\n\n===Subsidiaries===\n*'''SAAN Stores''' was a chain of [[discount store]]s which began in Winnipeg in 1947. Surplus items from the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] were the company's first supply source until its sales grew and more SAAN stores opened. After filing for bankruptcy, SAAN closed its 126 stores nationwide with a going-out-of-business sale in 2008. The chain was purchased out of bankruptcy in August 2008 by Genuity Capital, the owner of [[The Bargain! Shop]] chain at that time, and stores reopened as Bargain! Shop locations.\n*'''Greenberg Stores''' was a small-size discount store chain operated by Gendis and were located in smaller towns. It was mainly a clothing store but also included a restaurant, toys, small appliances, candies and other departments. When Greenberg closed in 1997, many stores were reopened as SAAN Stores.\n*'''Red Apple Stores''' is a small chain of clearance stores and a former division of SAAN founded in 1989 in [[Western Canada]] which offers consumers discount pricing on quality family clothing, clothing basics, housewares, snacks as well as limited grocery items. The Red Apple and SAAN names were purchased when SAAN was acquired by Genuity Capital in August 2008.\n\n===Rideau Street store===\n\nThe largest of the flagship Metropolitan Stores chain in Canada was located at 80 [[Rideau Street]], a major street of primary retail thoroughfares in [[Downtown Ottawa]], Ontario, which opened on April 7, 1949. The Metropolitan building, situated at the southwest corner of Rideau and Mosgrove streets (later renamed Freiman Street), was the setting of a three-storey shopping center (basement and two storeys at 11300 sq. ft. per level) which included complete wearing apparel sections for men, women, children and infants, a [[lunch counter]], an elevator and escalator from the first to the second floor, a wide stairway, a [[pastry]] department and a customers' lounge were also featured in this spacious store. The store's exterior facade included wide visual all-glass windows from floor to ceiling, presenting a complete view of the interior from front to rear walls; above the doors and window frontage, the full Metropolitan name was illuminated in red letters on a grey vitrolite frieze, abbreviated to \"Metro\" (and later to \"Met\") along the Mosgrove side street.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19490406&id=chMvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gdwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6278,1547137&hl=en ''First Metropolitan Store Opens in Ottawa Thursday''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' April 6, 1949.</ref>\n\nThe Metropolitan continued to operate at this location until the early 1980s. By January 1981, when a whole block of stores on the south side of Rideau Street was torn down to make room for the construction of the [[Rideau Centre]] shopping complex, the Metropolitan remained opened for a few months longer and was in the middle of the stretch of Rideau that was being developed. The store was not expropriated at the time surrounding properties were taken over by the federal government. The Metropolitan was to be originally incorporated into Rideau Centre with plans to convert it from a nickel-and-dime store into a [[luxury goods]] store, but the plans were cancelled.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=76IyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ze4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6852,4382508&dq=edelson+rideau+street&hl=en ''Rideau Street evictions anger small merchants''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' December 4, 1980</ref>\n\nInstead, the City of Ottawa and General Distributors of Winnipeg agreed in December 1981 to close Metropolitan and approved a $1.5-million redevelopment of the store's building as part of the Rideau Centre project. Once the Metropolitan Store closed in early 1982, the building's two-storey interior was completely renovated (with a third floor added) and subdivided into smaller spaces to be rented to a dozen retail stores. The facade was replaced to match the exterior of the Rideau Centre, and the interior shopping mall linked the Metropolitan building with the rest of the complex. The former building continued to be owned and leased to various stores by Metropolitan Stores of Canada Ltd. after the Rideau Centre opened in 1983.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19811202&id=QL4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jO4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4179,1374180&hl=en ''Store Renovations Approved''] at ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' December 2, 1981.</ref>\n\nToday, the vast majority of the first and second floor spaces of the old Metropolitan Store building in the Rideau Centre is occupied by [[Forever 21]] store, and the other subdivided spaces are still being rented by retail stores.\n\n===Presidents===\n*F.H.

The fire was brought under control by the local fire department, with the assistance of one pumper and 17 firemen from the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] department. The damage was estimated at nearly $150,000.

Kingsmill Company department store which eventually spread to adjoining shops, including a dry goods store and a crockery company.

The building, valued at approximately $100,000, was gutted the following day on the second and third floors and much of the stock (valued at $250,000) was damaged. Customers and employees were ordered by store officials to vacate the premises as soon as the smoke was first noticed. The building was re-designed and upgraded in 1962. When the Metropolitan Store left the building in the early 1980s, the building was converted into offices and was later demolished in 1990.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19380912&id=l4kxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bqgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6869,1505422&hl=en ''Store in Edmonton Damaged by Blaze''] at ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' September 12, 1938</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 1957, a fire which destroyed a whole corner block of stores and second-storey apartments, spread quickly to the adjoining Metropolitan Store and the Lady Ann Dress Shop at the Treasure Island Mall on [[List of roads in London, Ontario#Wellington Road|Wellington Road]] in [[Tillsonburg]], [[Ontario]].

The local Fire Chief was full of praise for his staff's work, as well as the volunteers who helped keep the fire from spreading to adjacent business locations. Shortly thereafter, the Metropolitan Store was rebuilt and reopened for business and the new store featured modern fixtures and a larger lunch counter.<ref>[http://eedition.cpheraldleader.com/doc/cp-herald-leader_eedition/heraldleader/2014072405/8.html#8 Green, Les.

An investigation found that three small doors on a furnace air unit were propped open, allowing carbon monoxide and other poisonous gases to pollute air in the store's main sales area. Ottawa Gas Company tests confirmed that carbon monoxide was the cause of the symptoms the victims suffered and that a buildup of carbon in the furnace and in the chimney were a contributing factor.

Ten people were killed and one hundred injured. The explosion blew out the building's rear wall and the second floor collapsed, trapping employees and customers, many of whom were senior citizens who had been sitting earlier at the lunch counter. Hundreds of rescuers, many of them volunteers, scrambled through the rubble searching for the wounded and the dead. The furnace was being changed from coal to gas.\n\nThe cause of the explosion was a broken gas line in the basement. The main floor blew out, allowing the upper two floors to collapse into the space. The plumbing contractor was found at fault for not using proper procedures.

Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween.

Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is.

Mildred's spell apparently goes wrong and turns Headmistress Miss Cackle into shattered glass. Mildred is sent to The Correctional School for Undesirable Witches, Wormwood, where she is befriended by Camilla Clove (played by Madeleine Edmondson) and menaced by the cruel jailer Miss Splinter (played by Sue Vincent). Meanwhile Maud analyses playback and realises someone else caused Miss Cackle's demise and deliberately gets herself sent to Wormwood too with a plan to free Mildred. Ethel was doing Agatha (Ada's evil twin) Cackle's bidding and tricked Felicity into sabotaging Mildred's spell. Ethel frees Agatha. Mildred and Maud make their escape from Wormwood.\nIn a sub-plot, an attempt to comfort (the soon to be dismissed) Mr Daisy with a Happiness Potion goes wrong, when he dances in an over familiar way with Miss Hardbroom.\n|LineColor       = #904000\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 52\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n|Title           = The Witching Hour: Part 2\n|DirectedBy      = Lindy Heymann\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9r/2020/04/20|title=BBC TV Guide|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n|Viewers         =\n|ShortSummary    = Agatha Cackle, impersonating headmistress Ada, promotes Ethel to head girl, and at the school assembly tricks everyone else into the Banishment plane of existence, including Mildred's mum (who had been messaged by Maud).

She also demands the Great Wizard hands over his title.\nMildred's mum organises tower building with junk in the banishment plane, and they escape. \n\nMildred and Maud search for the magic reversal word to reverse the banishment and in the process discover Mr. Daisy locked away. He agrees to use his potion machine, so while Mildred and Maud delay Agatha with distractions, his machine's potion restores Miss Cackle. She in turn saves Mildred's Mum with the secret word.

Ethel Hallow makes a good first impression on the teachers. Mildred helps Maud, whose glasses were broken in the crash, get to school, but they both crash-land in the pond. They tell Miss Hardbroom that Mildred was supposed to attend Pentangle's, but decided that Cackle's is better. Esmerelda Hallow, Ethel's older sister, gives the students a tour and Miss Cackle helps Mildred cope with the effects of a transfer spell. Mildred and Maud sneak off to look at the kittens and Ethel eavesdrops on them discussing how Mildred is not from a magical family. They lose a kitten, but find it in the kitchens. Later, Mildred struggles with the written exam. Miss Cackle encourages her to do what she is good at, but she only manages to get 1%, due to filling her paper with drawings instead of answers, as her best subject is art. Miss Cackle's twin sister, Agatha, turns up, and Miss Cackle gives her permission to speak to Miss Hardbroom for an internet article. The students make their potions and Mildred successfully manages to levitate, after taking some of Ethel's pondweed from her dragon potion (due to Ethel having taken all of it), making Ethel wrongly turn into a worm.\n\n''First appearances'': [[Bella Ramsey]] as [[Mildred Hubble]], Meibh Campbell as Maud Spellbody, Jenny Richardson as [[Ethel Hallow]], Miriam Petche as Esmerelda Hallow, Tallulah Milligan as [[Drusilla Paddock]], Dagny Rollins as Felicity Foxglove, [[Clare Higgins]] as Miss Ada Cackle/Agatha Cackle, [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hecate Hardbroom, [[Wendy Craig]] as Miss Bat, [[Shauna Shim]] as Miss Drill, [[Kacey Ainsworth]] as Miss Gullet, [[Zita Sattar]] as Miss Tapioca and [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Julie Hubble\n\n''Note'': Episode 1 and 2 aired in a 1 hour episode.\n|LineColor       = 69AFFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n|Title           = Tabby\n|DirectedBy      = Brian Grant\n|WrittenBy       = Emma Reeves\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|18|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cbbc/status/819213818|title=CBBC (@cbbc) - Twitter|website=twitter.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.334\n|ShortSummary    = On their first day, Mildred's phone is confiscated by Miss Hardbroom.

Mildred tells Maud and Enid and when Miss Bat falls asleep while covering potions class, Mildred, Maud and Enid sneak off to the magic council to show support for Miss Cackle.

Miss Pentangle is summoned to Miss Cackle's office and admits she has been asked to be headmistress at Cackles as well as Pentangles. Miss Pentangle impresses the first years with her modern chanting and gives Mildred a power boost in order to perform an invisibility spell in potions. Sybil faints in chanting after performing a chant with confidence and Mildred confides in Miss Pentangle over wanting to get Miss Cackle reinstated. Mildred sneaks off to Miss Cackle's office during chanting to see the petition when her classmates say their parents never signed and Miss Pentangle watches Miss Cackle help Sybil with her spells and potions when she becomes emotional after struggling.

The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval. Esmerelda is forced to gain powers from the stone when Sybil has climbed out of the roof and on the verge of falling, which delights Ethel, but the stone dies.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 25 <hr />26\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 12 <hr />13\n|Title           = All Hallow's Eve\n|AltTitle        = The Big Freeze\n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.414\n|ShortSummary    = (All Hallow's Eve) Esmerelda attempts to give the powers back to the stone, but fails. Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers. The school is saved and later celebrates Halloween.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n===Series 3 (2019)===\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#FF36FF |overall=6 |series=6 |title=30 |director=14 |writer=20 |airdate=14 |viewers=10 |country=UK | viewersR=<ref name=\"BARB2\">[https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/ Weekly top programmes on four screens (from Sept 2018)] Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB)</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 27\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = The Wishing Star\n|DirectedBy      = Dirk Campbell\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|7|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9r/2019/01/07|title=BBC TV Guide|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.279\n|ShortSummary    = Mildred enters the Great Wizard\u2019s broomstick-flying contest to win a Wishing Star so she can wish her Mum magical, but trouble arises when she competes with her new stray dog rather than Tabby.

With access to the internet and the fast-growing [[World Wide Web]], online social movements brought awareness to issues both political and social. Online social movements have been praised and criticized; the former for its ability to raise awareness to important causes, and the latter for its ability to perpetuate problems like [[slacktivism]]. Although online activism has received criticism, it has had real impacts on social movements.\n\n====== History of Online Social Movements ======\nThe earliest social movements were minimally related to the internet. For instance, Charles Tilly recognizes the first social movements in Britain and the US in the 1750s and 1760s, after the 7 Years War. [[John Wilkes]] led the \"Wilkes and Liberty\" movement to achieve legal and parliamentary reform. Across the Atlantic, the Boston merchants and the activists in the [[Sons of Liberty]] initiated the opposition to the British that eventually lead to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tilly, Charles 1929-2008 Verfasser.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1126812829|title=Social movements, 1768-2018|isbn=978-0-367-07607-8|oclc=1126812829}}</ref>\n\nThe mentality behind these was spurred on by sovereignty within British politics through the Reformation and informed John Wilkes and his followers about alternative societal rule. Thus, in 1768, members of the English lower class began to mobilize underneath Wilkes\u2019 movement against the sovereignty of the ruling class.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Cash, Arthur.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/952732211|title=John Wilkes : the Scandalous Father of Civil Liberty.|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10871-0|oclc=952732211}}</ref> On May 10, 1768, Wilkes\u2019 supporters and the king\u2019s soldiers at St. George\u2019s field began fighting, resulting in about six to eleven protesters dead.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Rudbeck|first=Jens|date=2012-10-05|title=Popular sovereignty and the historical origin of the social movement|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|journal=Theory and Society|volume=41|issue=6|pages=581\u2013601|doi=10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|issn=0304-2421}}</ref> This event sparked speculation about where sovereignty lies. The rise of the Wilkes movement marked the beginning of a new phase in British politics where the notion of popular sovereignty became dominant.<ref name=\":7\" /> Wilkes and his followers consistently challenged the leading authority through actions taken outside of parliament and on the basis of contesting laws. They created something that was so new that it laid the groundwork for political struggles to come: social movements.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThese situations, while different in nature from social movements we experience today, started the idea of mass-gathering to contest an issue. Modern examples of social movements include the Movement of the Unemployed in the 1930s, the Free Speech and Civil Rights Movements in the 1960s, the lower-profile 1990s movements and the many movements in the 21st century.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nSocial movements have evolved to a more dynamic, organized, effective, and prominent state than ever before, in part due to social movements presence on social media. The earliest online social movements began right after the Internet revolution. While the Arab Springs are commonly associated with the earliest online movements, in reality, social movements began through email. In 1990, software company Lotus and credit bureau Equifax gained access to names, addresses and purchasing behavior of 120 million Americans in CD-ROM format. In response, nearly 30,000 consumers organised through emails and message boards in protest, halting the release of the database by 1991.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gurak, Laura J.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/40927039|title=Persuasion and privacy in cyberspace : the online protests over Lotus Marketplace and the Clipper Chip.|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07864-1|oclc=40927039}}</ref>\n\nMany people have conflicting views on social media and its effectiveness when put to the task of activism. Interestingly, Pew Research Centre found that some 64% of Americans feel that the statement \u2018social media help give a voice to underrepresented groups\u2019 describes these sites very or somewhat well. But a larger share say social networking sites distract people from issues that are truly important (77% feel this way), and 71% agree with the assertion that \u2018social media makes people believe they\u2019re making a difference even when they really are not really making change.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/07/11/activism-in-the-social-media-age/|title=Activism in the Social Media Age|last=NW|first=1615 L.

movements has been substantial since the introduction of the internet. With the ever-growing medium of social media, internet activism has reached the forefront of the internet. Through the use of social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and content-sharing sites as [[YouTube]], the opportunity for wide-scale, online social participation has increased.<ref>Rotman, D., Preece, J., Vieweg, S., Shneiderman, B., Yardi, S., Pirolli, P., Chi, E.H., Glaisyer, T.

The online world enables the synchronisation of opinions across disparate geographies, creating new norms of behavior and belief through regular repetition and affirmation of messages.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the political sphere, active online groups increase political participation by providing a framework for discussion, leading petitions, and collecting donations in order to further a political agenda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-social-movements-are-using-internet-change-politics|title=How Social Movements are Using the Internet to Change Politics {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref> This alignment of values has often results in the potential to organise, such as fund raising in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that raised $100 million in just 30 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-082914.html|title=The ALS Association Expresses Sincere Gratitude to Over Three Million Donors|website=ALSA.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}</ref>\nOnline movements are able to sustain attention across boundaries, physical and temporal. For instance, during the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, Facebook\u2019s event function allowed for people to organise protests, which would then be acted out upon in real-life. Similarly, the Occupy movement was able to gather an online following around the world through the Tumblr blog, titled \u201cWe are the 99%\u201d. The function of being able to post on a shared website supported the gathering of different narratives, unifying people. In fact, online social movements epitomises the notion of \u201cmany yeses, one no\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> This motto highlights how the online world brings together diverse voices against something they all feel strongly about, by acting as integrating screens since people use these devices to connect with others, rather than to isolate themselves. In many ways, social media has created networks conducive for unification across different identities, supporting intersectional approaches to fighting injustice. For instance, the [[Zapatistas]] attempted to emphasise their inclusivity of the movement, which had begun as somewhat of a peasants revolt. The leader of the movement, Marcos, was famously presented in numerous identities, of different exploited and marginalised minorities who are saying \u201cEnough\u201d to their situation:<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Marcos|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/professionals-of-hope-the-selected-writings-of-subcomandante-marcos/oclc/1004260843|title=Professionals of hope: the selected writings of Subcomandante Marcos|last2=Jauregui|first2=Gabriela|date=2017|isbn=978-0-9967786-5-7|oclc=1004260843}}</ref><blockquote>\u201cYes, Marcos is gay.

Marcos is all the exploited, marginalised, oppressed minorities resisting and saying 'Enough.' He is every minority who is now beginning to speak, and every majority that must shut up and listen. He is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak. Everything that makes power and the good consciences of those in power uncomfortable\u2014this is Marcos.\u201d -Subcommandant Marcos, from Social Justice E-Zine #27 <ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>Social media is also able to provide a creative milieu that is conducive for narrative building. Memes, in particular, have proven to be a useful tool when it comes to repeat certain ideas so that they enter the public consciousness and are able to retain attention. Often, the large numbers of people online allow for intentional overproduction.<ref name=\":2\" /> Amanda D. Lotz noted that this is a key strategy, where multiple shows and commercials are created in order to compete, so that the most effective version can succeed, while the others disappear.<ref name=\":2\" /> In online social movements, hashtag culture functions by having many people copy each other and come up with new permutations, allowing for the most successful version to spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSocial media platforms are harder to censor than real-life organisation of movements. Ethan Zuckerman advanced the [[Cute cat theory of digital activism|Cute Cat Theory of Digital Activism]], which explains the relative lack of censorship online.

Still, these activists are able to hide behind the largely mundane uses of the internet, since censorship by governments would appear especially draconian. For instance, the Twitter ban in Turkey by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who intended to \u201cwipe out\u201d the social media platform was met with furious outrage from the population, experts and the global community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-election-idUSBREA2K0NK20140321|title=Furious reaction, political split after Turkey bans Twitter|date=2014-03-21|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en}}</ref> Similarly when ex-Tunisian President Ben Ali attempted to ban Facebook in 2010, his move backfired because so many Tunisians used Facebook to connect with family, friends and acquaintances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/12/the-limits-of-silencing-tunisia/|title=The limits of silencing Tunisia|last=Bounenni|first=Bassam|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Detriments ===\n\nNevertheless, there are numerous critiques posed against online social movements.\n\nMost frequently, the limited capacity for tangible change is often raised. For social movements to be successful, there need to be network internalities, which are durable networks ideal for organised action.<ref name=\":2\" /> These networks are the result of long-term challenges that are collectively overcome, which supports trust building. This process requires the investment of time and energy in order for members of a social movement to learn how to cooperate to achieve their goals.\n\nZeynep Tufekci introduces the Mount Everest metaphor in her comparison of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]\u2019s achievements with the [[Arab Spring]]\u2019s relative limited scope of change, especially in Egypt.<ref name=\":2\" /> Zeynep draws a comparison between social media and Sherpas. Previously, climbing Mount Everest was a challenging task. However, with Sherpas, more people were capable of doing so, and this led to a spike in mountaineering tourism. Nevertheless, these individuals remained unprepared for the reality of scaling the mountain, resulting in a spike in deaths. Similarly, social media has enabled more social movements to spread and enter the public sphere. However, there has not been long-term training and building of network internalities which is necessary to sustain these movements.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Civil Rights Movement had undergone strenuous planning and organisation, which has resulted in leaders who were able to represent the cause, such as Martin Luther King. In contrast, online social movements tend to be more short-lived. For instance, [[Kony 2012]] brought attention to child soldiers being forced into Joseph Kony\u2019s [[Lord\u2019s Resistance Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/problem-stop-kony/330661/|title=The Problems with 'Stop Kony'|last=Abad-Santos|first=Alexander|date=2012-03-08|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, the small organisation that directed the video, Invisible Children, was incapable of managing the sheer volume of attention received. Without the network internalities present in the Civil Rights Movement, the director [[Jason Russell]] had a major breakdown and the social movement dissipated.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Curtis|first=Polly|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/kony-2012-nirvana-missed-chance|title=Kony 2012: nirvana of online campaigning or missed chance?|date=2012-04-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the concern of a lack of clear leadership in online social movements. This means that there might be a challenge in finding representatives to negotiate within the movement and with adversaries. These individuals might have little in common beyond the initial movement. For instance, [[Tahrir Square]] protesters could not deviate tactically from their initial demand, which was to overthrow the Hosni Mubarak regime. Hence, there was a tactical freeze, where tactics could not be adjusted and new demands were not articulated by the social movement. Even the creator of \u201cWe are All Khaled Said\u201d, the main Facebook page of the Egyptian Revolution, Wael Ghonim was in no position to concede anything. Ghonim was neither an elected leader, nor an informal one, which denied him legitimacy to engage in negotiations.<ref name=\":2\" /> Similarly, in the [[Occupy movement]], there was an attempt to empower all protestors to be leaders of the movement. However, as a \u201cleaderful\u201d movement, there was a lack of ability to identify a clear representative to negotiate since there were too many perspectives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Costanza-Chock|first=Sasha|date=2012-08-01|title=Mic Check! Media Cultures and the Occupy Movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=375\u2013385|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|issn=1474-2837}}</ref>\n\nOnline social movements, while effective in unifying people, might also amplify the tendency to tribalism. In particular, more people having access to social media might democratise the risk of promoting violence, especially where institutions are not stable and there can be large amounts of distrust and disinformation. For instance, while social media had helped Sri Lanka ease the path to its first democratic elections in 2015 after years of civil war, communal hatreds began to overrun the news feeds, which are the primary portal of news and information for many users.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taub|first=Amanda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html|title=Where Countries Are Tinderboxes and Facebook Is a Match|date=2018-04-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Fisher|first2=Max|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== The Future ==\n\nAlthough the future of online movements is hard to predict, there are some clear directions where they could certainly lead towards. [[Vanessa DiMauro]], a community builder and researcher in decision-making, believes that the biggest trend concerning online communities in the near future is private online communities. While these large networks that we encounter and use on a daily basis have provided us with a productive and collaborative experience, they have also increased to unmanageable sizes. To become a learning environment, these groups need to be much smaller and manageable. This is where the idea and trend of private online communities could potentially be the future of online communities.<ref>[[Vanessa DiMauro|DiMauro, V.]] (2011). The Future Of Online Community. Retrieved from http://www.leadernetworks.com/2011/10/future-of-online-community.html</ref>\n\n== Online Social Movements and Commercial Social Media Platforms ==\nSince the late 2000s, increased use of commercial social media platforms by social movements has been reported. According to Lopes, \"Social Media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the various online blogs have arguably given a voice to individuals that otherwise would not be heard.\" [https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/departments/PoliticalScience/Journal_of_Political_Research__JPR_/2014_JSP_papers/Lopes_JPR.pdf] However, the adoption of these commercial platforms has concerned analysts as they highlighted asymmetrical relationships between the for-profit aims of social media and the copy-left values that drive many online movements. According to Fenton, \"Claims for the extension and re-invention of activism need to be considered in the context of the material social and political world of inequality, injustice and corporate dominance.\"[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1742766507086852] For example, \"in his analysis of the Purple Movement (Popolo Viola) in Italy and its extensive use of Facebook, [http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/14714/ Coretti (2014)] demonstrates that, while the myth of the network as open and inclusive persists, it acts as a disguise for the communication protocols of commercial social networking platforms that may well enable large-scale mobilization but ultimately, through their very functionality, encourage organizational centralization and fragmentation in social movements\" (Fenton, 2016, p.&nbsp;184).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Misunderstanding-the-Internet-2nd-Edition/Curran-Fenton-Freedman/p/book/9781138906228|title=Misunderstanding the Internet: 2nd Edition (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> The proprietary nature of the design of platforms such as Facebook pages fails to provide movements with the necessary instruments in terms of a shared democratic management of their resources. Moreover, the inability to manage Facebook pages and groups according to commonly agreed values promotes vertical power structures within movements, contributing to controversial management of Facebook pages and to internal divisions that significantly hinder the potential of protest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coretti|first=Lorenzo|date=June 2015|title=The rise and fall of collective identity in networked movements: communication protocols, Facebook, and the anti-Berlusconi protest|journal=Information, Communication & Society|volume=18|issue=8|pages=951\u2013967|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1043317}}</ref>\n\n== Important figures ==\n* [[Shaun King]]; a Twitter-based civil rights activist. \n* [[DeRay Mckesson|DeRay McKesson]]; Twitter- and Instagram-based civil rights activist, known for his involvement in the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.\n* [[Colin Kaepernick]]; American football quarterback known for his involvement in the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement and causing controversy for kneeling rather than standing for the national anthem, a symbolic act in protest of the unjust and oppressive treatment of people of color in the United States.\n* [[Rachel Dolezal]]; civil rights activist that caused controversy after her Caucasian parents disclosed that she was a Caucasian woman passing as black.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/us/rachel-dolezal-naacp-president-accused-of-lying-about-her-race.html|title=Black or White?

With access to the internet and the fast-growing [[World Wide Web]], online social movements brought awareness to issues both political and social. Online social movements have been praised and criticized; the former for its ability to raise awareness to important causes, and the latter for its ability to perpetuate problems like [[slacktivism]]. Although online activism has received criticism, it has had real impacts on social movements.\n\n====== History of Online Social Movements ======\nThe earliest social movements were minimally related to the internet. For instance, Charles Tilly recognizes the first social movements in Britain and the US in the 1750s and 1760s, after the 7 Years War. [[John Wilkes]] led the \"Wilkes and Liberty\" movement to achieve legal and parliamentary reform. Across the Atlantic, the Boston merchants and the activists in the [[Sons of Liberty]] initiated the opposition to the British that eventually lead to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tilly, Charles 1929-2008 Verfasser.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1126812829|title=Social movements, 1768-2018|isbn=978-0-367-07607-8|oclc=1126812829}}</ref>\n\nThe mentality behind these was spurred on by sovereignty within British politics through the Reformation and informed John Wilkes and his followers about alternative societal rule. Thus, in 1768, members of the English lower class began to mobilize underneath Wilkes\u2019 movement against the sovereignty of the ruling class.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Cash, Arthur.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/952732211|title=John Wilkes : the Scandalous Father of Civil Liberty.|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-10871-0|oclc=952732211}}</ref> On May 10, 1768, Wilkes\u2019 supporters and the king\u2019s soldiers at St. George\u2019s field began fighting, resulting in about six to eleven protesters dead.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Rudbeck|first=Jens|date=2012-10-05|title=Popular sovereignty and the historical origin of the social movement|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|journal=Theory and Society|volume=41|issue=6|pages=581\u2013601|doi=10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x|issn=0304-2421}}</ref> This event sparked speculation about where sovereignty lies. The rise of the Wilkes movement marked the beginning of a new phase in British politics where the notion of popular sovereignty became dominant.<ref name=\":7\" /> Wilkes and his followers consistently challenged the leading authority through actions taken outside of parliament and on the basis of contesting laws. They created something that was so new that it laid the groundwork for political struggles to come: social movements.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThese situations, while different in nature from social movements we experience today, started the idea of mass-gathering to contest an issue. Modern examples of social movements include the Movement of the Unemployed in the 1930s, the Free Speech and Civil Rights Movements in the 1960s, the lower-profile 1990s movements and the many movements in the 21st century.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nSocial movements have evolved to a more dynamic, organized, effective, and prominent state than ever before, in part due to social movements presence on social media. The earliest online social movements began right after the Internet revolution. While the Arab Springs are commonly associated with the earliest online movements, in reality, social movements began through email. In 1990, software company Lotus and credit bureau Equifax gained access to names, addresses and purchasing behavior of 120 million Americans in CD-ROM format. In response, nearly 30,000 consumers organised through emails and message boards in protest, halting the release of the database by 1991.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gurak, Laura J.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/40927039|title=Persuasion and privacy in cyberspace : the online protests over Lotus Marketplace and the Clipper Chip.|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07864-1|oclc=40927039}}</ref>\n\nMany people have conflicting views on social media and its effectiveness when put to the task of activism. Interestingly, Pew Research Centre found that some 64% of Americans feel that the statement \u2018social media help give a voice to underrepresented groups\u2019 describes these sites very or somewhat well. But a larger share say social networking sites distract people from issues that are truly important (77% feel this way), and 71% agree with the assertion that \u2018social media makes people believe they\u2019re making a difference even when they really are not really making change.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/07/11/activism-in-the-social-media-age/|title=Activism in the Social Media Age|last=NW|first=1615 L.

movements has been substantial since the introduction of the internet. With the ever-growing medium of social media, internet activism has reached the forefront of the internet. Through the use of social networking sites such as [[Facebook]] and content-sharing sites as [[YouTube]], the opportunity for wide-scale, online social participation has increased.<ref>Rotman, D., Preece, J., Vieweg, S., Shneiderman, B., Yardi, S., Pirolli, P., Chi, E.H., Glaisyer, T. (2011). From Slacktivism to Activism: Participatory Culture in the Age of Social Media</ref>\n\n=== Benefits ===\n\nOnline social movements have been celebrated for their ability to amass large amounts of success. The online world provides the power to organise without any formal organisations, which speeds up the process of mobilisation and allows for greater scale in rapid time frames.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shirky, Clay.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/883359654|title=Here comes everybody : the power of organizing without organizations|date=2014|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-1-4406-3224-2|oclc=883359654}}</ref> This can be understood as New Power, which supports informal leadership and radical transparency, conducive for large amounts of participation by people on social media.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Heimans|first=Jeremy|url=https://hbr.org/2014/12/understanding-new-power|title=Understanding \"New Power\"|date=2014-12-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Timms|first2=Henry|issue=December 2014|issn=0017-8012}}</ref> Previously, the dominant form of old power limited participation in movements and leadership to a small group.<ref name=\":0\" /> Rapid mobilisation helps people overcome pluralistic ignorance, where individuals believe that they are the only person with a particular view. Instead, the online networked sphere helps reveal otherwise preferences to each other in order to discover common ground.<ref>{{Cite book|last=TUFEKCI, ZEYNEP.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1002689516|title=TWITTER AND TEAR GAS : the power and fragility of networked protest.|date=2018|publisher=YALE University Press|isbn=0-300-23417-1|oclc=1002689516}}</ref>\u00a0 The increased visibility of a movement on the internet supports a sense of camaraderie, setting and maintaining a cause, even if it is otherwise decentralised. Social media can overcome pluralistic ignorance,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Mina, An Xiao, 1983-|title=Memes to movements : how the world's most viral media is changing social protest and power|date=8 January 2019|isbn=978-0-8070-5658-5|location=Boston|oclc=1039236703}}</ref> which is the belief that your opinions are not shared by others, when in reality, they tend to be. The online world enables the synchronisation of opinions across disparate geographies, creating new norms of behavior and belief through regular repetition and affirmation of messages.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the political sphere, active online groups increase political participation by providing a framework for discussion, leading petitions, and collecting donations in order to further a political agenda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-social-movements-are-using-internet-change-politics|title=How Social Movements are Using the Internet to Change Politics {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref> This alignment of values has often results in the potential to organise, such as fund raising in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that raised $100 million in just 30 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-082914.html|title=The ALS Association Expresses Sincere Gratitude to Over Three Million Donors|website=ALSA.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}</ref>\nOnline movements are able to sustain attention across boundaries, physical and temporal. For instance, during the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, Facebook\u2019s event function allowed for people to organise protests, which would then be acted out upon in real-life. Similarly, the Occupy movement was able to gather an online following around the world through the Tumblr blog, titled \u201cWe are the 99%\u201d. The function of being able to post on a shared website supported the gathering of different narratives, unifying people. In fact, online social movements epitomises the notion of \u201cmany yeses, one no\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> This motto highlights how the online world brings together diverse voices against something they all feel strongly about, by acting as integrating screens since people use these devices to connect with others, rather than to isolate themselves. In many ways, social media has created networks conducive for unification across different identities, supporting intersectional approaches to fighting injustice. For instance, the [[Zapatistas]] attempted to emphasise their inclusivity of the movement, which had begun as somewhat of a peasants revolt. The leader of the movement, Marcos, was famously presented in numerous identities, of different exploited and marginalised minorities who are saying \u201cEnough\u201d to their situation:<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Marcos|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/professionals-of-hope-the-selected-writings-of-subcomandante-marcos/oclc/1004260843|title=Professionals of hope: the selected writings of Subcomandante Marcos|last2=Jauregui|first2=Gabriela|date=2017|isbn=978-0-9967786-5-7|oclc=1004260843}}</ref><blockquote>\u201cYes, Marcos is gay. Marcos is gay in San Francisco, black in South Africa, an Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in Israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a single woman on the subway at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a Zapatista in the mountains. Marcos is all the exploited, marginalised, oppressed minorities resisting and saying 'Enough.' He is every minority who is now beginning to speak, and every majority that must shut up and listen. He is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak. Everything that makes power and the good consciences of those in power uncomfortable\u2014this is Marcos.\u201d -Subcommandant Marcos, from Social Justice E-Zine #27 <ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>Social media is also able to provide a creative milieu that is conducive for narrative building. Memes, in particular, have proven to be a useful tool when it comes to repeat certain ideas so that they enter the public consciousness and are able to retain attention. Often, the large numbers of people online allow for intentional overproduction.<ref name=\":2\" /> Amanda D. Lotz noted that this is a key strategy, where multiple shows and commercials are created in order to compete, so that the most effective version can succeed, while the others disappear.<ref name=\":2\" /> In online social movements, hashtag culture functions by having many people copy each other and come up with new permutations, allowing for the most successful version to spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSocial media platforms are harder to censor than real-life organisation of movements. Ethan Zuckerman advanced the [[Cute cat theory of digital activism|Cute Cat Theory of Digital Activism]], which explains the relative lack of censorship online. Zuckerman posits that the web is used primarily for innocuous purposes, such as connecting with families and friends and posting pictures of cats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/12/03/cute-cat-theory-the-china-corollary/|title=Cute Cat Theory: The China Corollary {{!}} \u2026 My heart\u2019s in Accra|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, the affordances that social media provides activists nurtures a community that engages in political criticism. Still, these activists are able to hide behind the largely mundane uses of the internet, since censorship by governments would appear especially draconian. For instance, the Twitter ban in Turkey by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who intended to \u201cwipe out\u201d the social media platform was met with furious outrage from the population, experts and the global community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-election-idUSBREA2K0NK20140321|title=Furious reaction, political split after Turkey bans Twitter|date=2014-03-21|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en}}</ref> Similarly when ex-Tunisian President Ben Ali attempted to ban Facebook in 2010, his move backfired because so many Tunisians used Facebook to connect with family, friends and acquaintances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/12/the-limits-of-silencing-tunisia/|title=The limits of silencing Tunisia|last=Bounenni|first=Bassam|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Detriments ===\n\nNevertheless, there are numerous critiques posed against online social movements.\n\nMost frequently, the limited capacity for tangible change is often raised. For social movements to be successful, there need to be network internalities, which are durable networks ideal for organised action.<ref name=\":2\" /> These networks are the result of long-term challenges that are collectively overcome, which supports trust building. This process requires the investment of time and energy in order for members of a social movement to learn how to cooperate to achieve their goals.\n\nZeynep Tufekci introduces the Mount Everest metaphor in her comparison of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]\u2019s achievements with the [[Arab Spring]]\u2019s relative limited scope of change, especially in Egypt.<ref name=\":2\" /> Zeynep draws a comparison between social media and Sherpas. Previously, climbing Mount Everest was a challenging task. However, with Sherpas, more people were capable of doing so, and this led to a spike in mountaineering tourism. Nevertheless, these individuals remained unprepared for the reality of scaling the mountain, resulting in a spike in deaths. Similarly, social media has enabled more social movements to spread and enter the public sphere. However, there has not been long-term training and building of network internalities which is necessary to sustain these movements.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Civil Rights Movement had undergone strenuous planning and organisation, which has resulted in leaders who were able to represent the cause, such as Martin Luther King. In contrast, online social movements tend to be more short-lived. For instance, [[Kony 2012]] brought attention to child soldiers being forced into Joseph Kony\u2019s [[Lord\u2019s Resistance Army]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/problem-stop-kony/330661/|title=The Problems with 'Stop Kony'|last=Abad-Santos|first=Alexander|date=2012-03-08|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, the small organisation that directed the video, Invisible Children, was incapable of managing the sheer volume of attention received. Without the network internalities present in the Civil Rights Movement, the director [[Jason Russell]] had a major breakdown and the social movement dissipated.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Curtis|first=Polly|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/kony-2012-nirvana-missed-chance|title=Kony 2012: nirvana of online campaigning or missed chance?|date=2012-04-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the concern of a lack of clear leadership in online social movements. This means that there might be a challenge in finding representatives to negotiate within the movement and with adversaries. These individuals might have little in common beyond the initial movement. For instance, [[Tahrir Square]] protesters could not deviate tactically from their initial demand, which was to overthrow the Hosni Mubarak regime. Hence, there was a tactical freeze, where tactics could not be adjusted and new demands were not articulated by the social movement. Even the creator of \u201cWe are All Khaled Said\u201d, the main Facebook page of the Egyptian Revolution, Wael Ghonim was in no position to concede anything. Ghonim was neither an elected leader, nor an informal one, which denied him legitimacy to engage in negotiations.<ref name=\":2\" /> Similarly, in the [[Occupy movement]], there was an attempt to empower all protestors to be leaders of the movement. However, as a \u201cleaderful\u201d movement, there was a lack of ability to identify a clear representative to negotiate since there were too many perspectives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Costanza-Chock|first=Sasha|date=2012-08-01|title=Mic Check! Media Cultures and the Occupy Movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=375\u2013385|doi=10.1080/14742837.2012.710746|issn=1474-2837}}</ref>\n\nOnline social movements, while effective in unifying people, might also amplify the tendency to tribalism. In particular, more people having access to social media might democratise the risk of promoting violence, especially where institutions are not stable and there can be large amounts of distrust and disinformation. For instance, while social media had helped Sri Lanka ease the path to its first democratic elections in 2015 after years of civil war, communal hatreds began to overrun the news feeds, which are the primary portal of news and information for many users.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taub|first=Amanda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html|title=Where Countries Are Tinderboxes and Facebook Is a Match|date=2018-04-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Fisher|first2=Max|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== The Future ==\n\nThe future of online movements is hard to predict. However, there are some clear directions where they could certainly lead towards. [[Vanessa DiMauro]] believes the biggest trend concerning online communities in the near future is private online communities. While these large networks that we encounter and use on a day-to-day basis have provided us with a productive and collaborative experience they have also increased to unmanageable sizes. To become a learning environment these groups need to be much smaller and manageable. This is where the idea and trend of private online communities could potentially be the future of online communities.<ref>[[Vanessa DiMauro|DiMauro, V.]] (2011). The Future Of Online Community. Retrieved from http://www.leadernetworks.com/2011/10/future-of-online-community.html</ref>\n\n== Online Social Movements and Commercial Social Media Platforms ==\nSince the late 2000s, increased use of commercial social media platforms by social movements has been reported. According to Lopes, \"Social Media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the various online blogs have arguably given a voice to individuals that otherwise would not be heard.\" [https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/departments/PoliticalScience/Journal_of_Political_Research__JPR_/2014_JSP_papers/Lopes_JPR.pdf] However, the adoption of these commercial platforms has concerned analysts as they highlighted asymmetrical relationships between the for-profit aims of social media and the copy-left values that drive many online movements. According to Fenton, \"Claims for the extension and re-invention of activism need to be considered in the context of the material social and political world of inequality, injustice and corporate dominance.\"[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1742766507086852] For example, \"in his analysis of the Purple Movement (Popolo Viola) in Italy and its extensive use of Facebook, [http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/14714/ Coretti (2014)] demonstrates that, while the myth of the network as open and inclusive persists, it acts as a disguise for the communication protocols of commercial social networking platforms that may well enable large-scale mobilization but ultimately, through their very functionality, encourage organizational centralization and fragmentation in social movements\" (Fenton, 2016, p.&nbsp;184).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Misunderstanding-the-Internet-2nd-Edition/Curran-Fenton-Freedman/p/book/9781138906228|title=Misunderstanding the Internet: 2nd Edition (Paperback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> The proprietary nature of the design of platforms such as Facebook pages fails to provide movements with the necessary instruments in terms of a shared democratic management of their resources. Moreover, the inability to manage Facebook pages and groups according to commonly agreed values promotes vertical power structures within movements, contributing to controversial management of Facebook pages and to internal divisions that significantly hinder the potential of protest.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coretti|first=Lorenzo|date=June 2015|title=The rise and fall of collective identity in networked movements: communication protocols, Facebook, and the anti-Berlusconi protest|journal=Information, Communication & Society|volume=18|issue=8|pages=951\u2013967|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1043317}}</ref>\n\n== Important figures ==\n* [[Shaun King]]; a Twitter-based civil rights activist. \n* [[DeRay Mckesson|DeRay McKesson]]; Twitter- and Instagram-based civil rights activist, known for his involvement in the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.\n* [[Colin Kaepernick]]; American football quarterback known for his involvement in the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement and causing controversy for kneeling rather than standing for the national anthem, a symbolic act in protest of the unjust and oppressive treatment of people of color in the United States.\n* [[Rachel Dolezal]]; civil rights activist that caused controversy after her Caucasian parents disclosed that she was a Caucasian woman passing as black.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/us/rachel-dolezal-naacp-president-accused-of-lying-about-her-race.html|title=Black or White?

directly to the [[President of the European Commission]]. The last Chief Scientific Advisor, serving from 2012 to 2014, was [[Anne Glover (biologist)|Dame Anne Glover]].\n\nOn 1 November 2014, European Commission President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] asked [[Carlos Moedas]], Commissioner for [[European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science|Research, Innovation and Science]] in his mission letter to \"make sure that Commission proposals and activities are based on sound scientific evidence and contribute best to our jobs and growth agenda\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/sites/cwt/files/commissioner_mission_letters/moedas_en.pdf|title=Mission letter to Commissioner Moedas|last=Juncker|first=Jean-Claude|date=2014-11-01|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Following this, on 13 May 2015, Juncker announced the establishment of the Scientific Advice Mechanism. The first seven members of the Advisors were identified, following a European call for nominations, in January 2016.\n\nIn December 2016, SAPEA was officially launched to support the Advisors by providing scientific evidence review reports.\n\n==Structure==\n===Group of Chief Scientific Advisors===\nThe core of the Scientific Advice Mechanism is the European Commission's Group of Chief Scientific Advisors, an expert group consisting of up to seven leading scientists, selected by the European Commission assisted by an independent identification committee. The Advisors are supported by a dedicated secretariat, known as the SAM Unit, staffed by the [[Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Research and Innovation]] and [[Joint Research Centre]].\n\nThe Group of Chief Scientific Advisors currently consists of the following seven members:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:#555;\"\n|-\n!

Each cookie contains only 40 calories; they are 66% thinner than the original version.\n* ''Chocolate Oreo'' \u2013 Simply an Oreo cookie with chocolate cr\u00e8me filling instead of the original vanilla flavored white cr\u00e8me filling.<!--Introduced 2011-->\n* ''Mint Oreo'' \u2013 A variety of Oreo with two chocolate wafers separated by a mint flavored cr\u00e8me filling.<!--Introduced when?-->\n* ''The Most Stuf'' \u2013 Introduced in January 2019, a limited edition Oreo with approximately four times the amount of cr\u00e8me filling of a standard Oreo.\n\nSpecial edition ''Double Stuf Oreo'' cookies are produced during springtime, and around [[Halloween]] and [[Christmas]]. These have colored frosting reflecting the current holiday: blue or yellow for springtime; orange for Halloween; and red or green for the Christmas holiday. One side of each seasonal cookie is stamped with an appropriate design; the spring cookies feature flowers, butterflies, etc., while the Halloween editions feature a jack o'lantern, ghost, cat, flock of bats, or broom-riding witch.<!--What designs are featured on the Christmas ones?--> The 2017 ''Halloween Oreo'' broke with this tradition, having orange-colored cr\u00e8me filling (albeit with classic vanilla flavor) but carrying no seasonal designs.\n\nIn some countries, Oreos come in a variety of flavors that are not familiar to the U.S. market. For example, ''Green Tea Oreos'' are only available in China and Japan, while ''Lemon Ice Oreos'' were only ever introduced in Japan.\n\n=== Limited editions ===\n[[File:Mr. Christie, you definitely make good cookies! (2523264708).jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a golden Oreo cookie wafer]]\nBeginning in the early 2010s, Oreo began releasing [[Limited edition candy|limited edition]] runs of cookies with more exotic flavors. These \"limited editions\" typically appear in stores for a short period and are then discontinued, although some varieties have since resurfaced, for example: ''Reese's Oreos'' returned for a second limited run after they were first introduced for a limited period in 2014; and ''Birthday Cake Oreos'', originally introduced in 2012, have since become permanently available.<ref name=\"List\">{{cite web |url=http://www.glamour.com/story/special-oreos-flavors-limited-edition |title=A Comprehensive List of Every Special Oreo Flavor, Ever |last=Clinton |first=Leah Melby |date=June 17, 2015 |publisher=Glamour |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Some limited editions are only made available at certain retailers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foodbeast.com/news/blueberry-oreos-fruity-crisps/ |title=NEW OREO FLAVORS: Blueberry Pie & Fruity Crisps |last=Ayerouth |first=Elie |date=May 26, 2016 |publisher=foodbeast.com |access-date=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLimited edition runs usually feature a cr\u00e8me filling that has been flavored to replicate the taste of a specific fruit or dessert, from familiar flavors such as [[lemon]] or [[Mentha|mint]], to the more specific and unusual flavors of [[blueberry pie]] or [[red velvet cake]]. They may also incorporate different varieties of cookie wafer, for example ''Cinnamon-Bun Oreos'' featured [[cinnamon]] flavored cookies and \"frosting flavored cr\u00e8me\". In recent years, some limited editions have paired Oreos with other recognizable [[confectionery]] brands, including [[Reese's Peanut Butter Cups|Reese's]], [[Swedish Fish]], and [[Peeps]].\n\nSome examples of limited edition Oreos are:\n* ''Birthday Cake Oreo'' \u2013 A limited edition, available from February to July 2012, to celebrate Oreo's 100th birthday.
