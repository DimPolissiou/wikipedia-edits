In the 16th century, Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] \u2013 one of the most influential [[royal house|royal dynasties]] in history. As an archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Early in the 19th century, Austria established [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]] but pursued its own course independently of the other German states. Following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|compromise]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was established.\n\nAustria was involved in [[World War I]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] following the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne. After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy, the [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed with the intent of the union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], which eventually failed because of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and the state remained unrecognized. In 1919 the [[First Austrian Republic]] became the legal successor of [[Cisleithania|Austria]]. In 1938, the Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], who became the [[German Chancellor|Chancellor]] of the [[German Reich]], achieved the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by the [[Anschluss]]. Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945 and an extended period of Allied occupation, Austria was re-established as a sovereign and self-governing democratic nation known as the Second Republic.\n\nAustria is a [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a directly elected Federal [[President of Austria|President]] as head of state and a [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] as head of the federal government. Major [[List of cities and towns in Austria|urban areas of Austria]] include [[Graz]], [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]]. Austria is consistently ranked in the top 20 [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|richest countries in the world]] by GDP per capita terms. The country has achieved a [[list of countries by Human Development Index|high standard of living]] and in 2018 was ranked 20th in the world for its [[Human Development Index]].

Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Austrian\u2013Prussian dualism]] began in Germany.

The same year, the [[German Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria.

As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866.

The system came to be characterised by ''[[Proporz]]'', meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6) and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP).<ref>Lonnie Johnson 139</ref> Interest group \"chambers\" with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, business people, farmers) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 165</ref>\n\nSince 1945, governing via a single-party government has occurred twice: 1966\u20131970 (\u00d6VP) and 1970\u20131983 (SP\u00d6). During all other legislative periods, either a [[grand coalition]] of SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP or a \"small coalition\" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.\n\n[[Kurt Waldheim]], a Wehrmacht officer in the Second World War [[Austria \u2014 the Nazis' first victim#Waldheim Affair|accused of war crimes]], was elected President of Austria from 1986 to 1992.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kurt Waldheim {{!}} president of Austria and secretary-general of the United Nations |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Waldheim |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926052356/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Waldheim |archive-date=26 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[1994 Austrian European Union membership referendum|referendum in 1994]], at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995.<ref>Brook-Shepherd 447,449</ref>\n\nThe major parties SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military nonalignment: While the SP\u00d6 in public supports a neutral role, the \u00d6VP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some \u00d6VP politicians (ex. Dr Werner Fasslabend (\u00d6VP) in 1997). In reality, Austria is taking part in the EU's [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], participates in [[peacekeeping]] and peace creating tasks, and has become a member of [[NATO]]'s \"Partnership for Peace\"; the constitution has been amended accordingly.

Austria became a [[Federation|federal]], [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its [[States of Austria|nine states]] is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 17, 142</ref>\n\nThe [[head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] (''Bundespr\u00e4sident''), who is directly elected by popular majority vote, with a run-off between the top-scoring candidates, if necessary. The head of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]] (''Bundeskanzler''), who is selected by the President and tasked with forming a government based on the partisan composition of the lower house of parliament.\n\nThe government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]]. Voting for the Federal President and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103221527/http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archivedate=3 November 2007|title=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Inneres \u2013 Elections Compulsory voting|publisher=Bmi.gv.at|accessdate=3 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nAustria's parliament consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over the age of 16 has the [[Suffrage|right to vote]]. The voting age was lowered from 18 in 2007.\n\nWhile there is a general threshold of 4% of the vote for all parties in federal elections (Nationalratswahlen) to participate in the proportional allocation of seats, there remains the possibility of being elected to a seat directly in one of the 43 regional electoral districts ({{lang|de|Direktmandat}}).\n\nThe Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the legislative process in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]], has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can\u2014in almost all cases\u2014ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as ''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. \"vote of persistence\").

The Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') exerts considerable influence on the political system because of its power to invalidate legislation and ordinances that are not in compliance with the constitution. Since 1995, the [[European Court of Justice]] may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union. Austria also implements the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], since the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] is part of the Austrian constitution.\n\n===Since 2006===\n[[File:Wien - Bundeskanzleramt1.JPG|thumb|The Federal Chancellery on Ballhausplatz]]\nAfter general elections held in October 2006, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SP\u00d6) emerged as the strongest party, and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) came in second, having lost about 8% of its previous polling.<ref name=\"Election2002\">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|title=24 November 2002 General Election Results \u2013 Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707185433/http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|archive-date=7 July 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Election2006\">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|title=October&nbsp;1st,&nbsp;2006 General Election Results \u2013 Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707185102/http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|archive-date=7 July 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and SP\u00d6 formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.\n\nElections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party. They formed a coalition with [[Werner Faymann]] from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FP\u00d6 and the deceased [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.\n\nIn the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|legislative elections of 2013]], the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.\n\nAfter the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was proclaimed for [[2017 Austrian legislative election|October 2017]]. The Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) with its new young leader [[Sebastian Kurz]] emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6), which received 51 seats and 26%. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3 percent of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats. The \u00d6VP decided to form a coalition with the FP\u00d6. The new government between the centre-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December 2017, but the coalition government later collapsed and [[2019 Austrian legislative election|new elections]] were called for 29 September 2019. The elections lead to another landslide victory (37.5%) of the  Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) who formed a coalition-government with the reinvigorated (13.9%) Greens, which was sworn in with Kurz as chancellor on January 7 2020.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Austria}}\n\n[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement europ\u00e9en Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]]: Austria is one of the 28 EU members.]]\n\nThe 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality\". The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory\". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.\n\nAustria began to reassess its definition of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] (although it was careful to do so only after Russia joined) and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is to not allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Austria signed the UN's [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=2019-07-06 }}</ref> which was opposed by all NATO members.<ref>{{cite news |title=122 countries adopt 'historic' UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-treaty-ban-nuclear-weapons-1.4192761 |work=CBC News |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAustria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE).

This assistance came to an end when Hungary and [[Slovakia]] joined the EU [[Schengen Area]] in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing \"internal\" border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria 1920 (reinst. 1945, rev. 2013)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155729/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.\n\nWithin its [[Declaration of Neutrality|self-declared status of permanent neutrality]], Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions.

Vienna is unique in that it is both a city and a state.\n\nAustria's constituent states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social welfare, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances.

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the [[Central European mixed forests]], Pannonian mixed forests, Alps conifer and mixed forests and Western European broadleaf forests.\n<gallery heights=\"120px\" widths=\"160px\">\nFile:1 hallstatt austria.jpg|View of [[Hallstatt]]\nFile:Krems and mautern from ferdinandswarte.jpg|View of [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]] at the end of [[Wachau|Wachau valley]]\nFile:Vorderhopfreben \u00dcntschenspitze 1.jpg|Austrian rural area of [[Schoppernau]] in summer\nFile:Donau Linz Abend.jpg|The [[Danube]] at [[Linz]] with cruise ships\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map AUT present.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification]] map for Austria<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Hylke E. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=Niklaus E. |last3=McVicar |first3=Tim R. |last4=Vergopolan |first4=Noemi |last5=Berg |first5=Alexis |last6=Wood |first6=Eric F. |title=Present and future K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution |journal=Scientific Data |date=30 October 2018 |volume=5 |pages=180214 |doi=10.1038/sdata.2018.214|pmid=30375988 |pmc=6207062 |bibcode=2018NatSD...580214B }}</ref>]]\n\nThe greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]], where humid westerly winds predominate.

In the east\u2014in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the [[Danube|Danube valley]]\u2014the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas.

It is important to note though that Austria may experience very cold, severe winters, but most of the time they are only around as cold as those in somewhat comparable climate zones, for example Southern Scandinavia or Eastern Europe. As well, at higher altitudes, summers are usually considerably cooler than in the valleys/lower altitudes. The subarctic and tundra climates seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere due in part to the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.<ref name=\"ZAMG\"/><ref>{{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/country/4/|title= Climate-Data.org|access-date= 15 April 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170415201756/https://en.climate-data.org/country/4/|archive-date= 15 April 2017|url-status=live|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title= Atlantic influence on the Alps|journal= Environmental Research Letters|volume= 8|issue= 3|pages= 034026|doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|year= 2013|last1= Zampieri|first1= Matteo|last2= Scoccimarro|first2= Enrico|last3= Gualdi|first3= Silvio}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| collapsed=collapsed\n|location = Lech, Vorarlberg (1440 m; average temperatures 1982 \u2013 2012) Dfc, bordering on Dfb.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n<!--Average high temperatures-->\n|Jan high C = -0.7\n|Feb high C = 0.3\n|Mar high C = 3.5\n|Apr high C = 7.1\n|May high C = 11.8\n|Jun high C = 17.4\n|Jul high C = 16.8\n|Aug high C = 14.3\n|Sep high C = 15.1\n|Oct high C = 9.7\n|Nov high C = 3.7\n|Dec high C = 0.1\n|Average high C =\n|Jan mean C = -4.5\n|Feb mean C = -3.7\n|Mar mean C = -0.6\n|Apr mean C = 2.9\n|May mean C = 7.3\n|Jun mean C = 10.6\n|Jul mean C = 12.7\n|Aug mean C = 12.2\n|Sep mean C = 9.9\n|Oct mean C = 5.6\n|Nov mean C = 0.4\n|Dec mean C = -3.3\n|year mean C =\n|Jan low C = -8.2\n|Feb low C = -7.6\n|Mar low C = -4.7\n|Apr low C = -1.3\n|May low C = 2.8\n|Jun low C = 6.0\n|Jul low C = 8.0\n|Aug low C = 7.7\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = 1.6\n|Nov low C = -2.9\n|Dec low C = -6.6\n|Average low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 59\n|Feb precipitation mm = 54\n|Mar precipitation mm = 56\n|Apr precipitation mm = 70\n|May precipitation mm = 103\n|Jun precipitation mm = 113\n|Jul precipitation mm = 133\n|Aug precipitation mm = 136\n|Sep precipitation mm = 95\n|Oct precipitation mm = 67\n|Nov precipitation mm = 78\n|Dec precipitation mm = 66\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1= <ref name=ZAMG />\n|source 2= {{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/location/117363/|title= Lech climate data}}\n}}\n{{Weather box\n|collapsed=collapsed\n|location = K\u00fchtai, Tyrol(2060 m; average temperatures 1982 \u2013 2012) ET, somewhat close to Dfc.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n<!--Average high temperatures-->\n|Jan high C = -3.3\n|Feb high C = -3.2\n|Mar high C = -0.9\n|Apr high C = 2.3\n|May high C = 7.0\n|Jun high C = 10.4\n|Jul high C = 12.7\n|Aug high C = 12.3\n|Sep high C = 9.6\n|Oct high C = 6.3\n|Nov high C = 0.5\n|Dec high C = -2.4\n|Average high C =\n|Jan mean C = -6.6\n|Feb mean C = -6.5\n|Mar mean C = -4.2\n|Apr mean C = -1.1\n|May mean C = 3.4\n|Jun mean C = 6.6\n|Jul mean C = 8.8\n|Aug mean C = 8.6\n|Sep mean C = 6.4\n|Oct mean C = 2.9\n|Nov mean C = -2.4\n|Dec mean C = -5.4\n|year mean C =\n|Jan low C = -9.9\n|Feb low C = -9.8\n|Mar low C = -7.5\n|Apr low C = -4.4\n|May low C = -0.2\n|Jun low C = 2.9\n|Jul low C = 4.9\n|Aug low C = 4.9\n|Sep low C = 3.3\n|Oct low C = -0.5\n|Nov low C = -5.2\n|Dec low C = -8.4\n|Average low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 73\n|Feb precipitation mm = 66\n|Mar precipitation mm = 80\n|Apr precipitation mm = 87\n|May precipitation mm = 115\n|Jun precipitation mm = 126\n|Jul precipitation mm = 148\n|Aug precipitation mm = 138\n|Sep precipitation mm = 96\n|Oct precipitation mm = 74\n|Nov precipitation mm = 83\n|Dec precipitation mm = 72\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1= <ref name=ZAMG />\n|source 2= {{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/location/111749/|title= K\u00fchtai climate data}}\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Austria}}\n[[File:13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-123.jpg|thumb|[[Vienna International Centre]] with the [[United Nations Office at Vienna]] and the [[DC Towers|DC Tower 1]]]]\n\nAustria consistently ranks high in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]],<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&ey=2012&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=122&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=37&pr.y=14|title=Austria|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=17 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125152140/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&ey=2012&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=122&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=37&pr.y=14|archive-date=25 November 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> due to its highly industrialized economy, and well-developed [[social market economy]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.

Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two [[World war|World Wars]] and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, [[J\u00f6rg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the K\u00e4rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is the so-called \"[[:de:Windischen-Theorie|Windischen-Theorie]]\" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction.

School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.\n\n[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.\n\nPrimary education, or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The [[The three Rs|3Rs]] (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].\n\nStandard attendance times are 8&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm or 1&nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.\n\nAs in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[H\u00f6here Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.\n\n[[File:Wien - Universit\u00e4t (3).JPG|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Wien 02 Campus WU a.jpg|thumb| The campus of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]]]\nAs at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report (\"Zeugnis\") are a prerequisite for moving up (\"aufsteigen\") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year (\"sitzenbleiben\").\n\nIt is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as \"Gymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or \"Realgymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.\n\nThe Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee (\"''Studienbeitrag''\") of \u20ac363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. There are some non-state exceptions to this, where students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the [[English Teacher Training College]]. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).<ref name=\"Tuition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|website=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501221940/http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|archive-date=1 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around \u20ac363.36 per term is charged.

In all cases, an obligatory fee of \u20ac20.20 is charged for the student union and insurance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oeh.ac.at/service/oeh-beitrag|website=www.oeh.ac.at|title=H\u00d6HE DES \u00d6H-BEITRAGES?|lang=de|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Austria}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Austria}}\n[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756\u20131791)]]\n\nAustria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria was the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.\n\nVienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the [[Baroque period]], Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.\n\n[[File:StateOperaViennaNightBackside.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vienna State Opera]]]]\n\nVienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the [[lute]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the [[Sei gesegnet ohne Ende|traditional Austrian anthem]] by Joseph Haydn.\n\nAustrian [[Herbert von Karajan]] was principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for 35 years. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|title=Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist was 81|pages=A1|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Rockwell|date=17 July 1989|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712135148/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|archive-date=12 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nInternational pop super star Johann H\u00f6lzel, also known by his stage name [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was born in [[Vienna]], Austria 19 February 1957.\n\n[[Conchita Wurst]] is also a renowned singer from the Austrian stock.\n\n===Art and architecture===\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Architecture of Austria\"; if the section heading changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\n{{Further|List of Austrian artists and architects}}\n[[File:Botanischer Garten Der Universit\u00e4t, Wenen, Oostenrijk Aug 02, 2019 04-27-11 PM.jpeg|thumb|The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere Palace]], an example of [[Baroque]] architecture]]\n\nAmong Austrian Artists and architects one can find the painters [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Hans Makart]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Carl Moll]], and [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], the photographers [[Inge Morath]] and [[Ernst Haas]], and architects like [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], [[Otto Wagner]], [[Adolf Loos]], and [[Hans Hollein]] (recipient of the 1985 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]]). Contemporary artist Herbert Brandl.\n\n===Cinema and theatre===\n[[File:Michael Haneke 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Haneke]]]]\n[[Sascha Kolowrat]] was an Austrian pioneer of filmmaking. [[Billy Wilder]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Josef von Sternberg]], and [[Fred Zinnemann]] originally came from Austria before establishing themselves as internationally relevant movie makers. [[Willi Forst]], [[Ernst Marischka]], or [[Franz Antel]] enriched the popular cinema in German language speaking countries. [[Michael Haneke]] became internationally known for his disturbing cinematic studies, before receiving a [[Golden Globe]] for his critically acclaimed film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' in 2010.\n\nThe first Austrian film director to receive an [[Academy Award]] was [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]]. A number of Austrian actors were able to pursue a career, the impact of which was sensed beyond national borders. Among them were [[Peter Lorre]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Oskar Werner]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]. [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became American as well as international movie stars. The latter also became the 38th Governor of California. [[Christoph Waltz]] rose to international fame with his performances in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' and ''[[Django Unchained]]'', earning him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 2010 and 2012. [[Max Reinhardt]] was a master of spectacular and astute theatre productions. [[Otto Schenk]] not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.\n\n===Science and philosophy===\n{{Further|Austrian School|Vienna circle|List of Austrian scientists}}\n[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Karl Popper]]]]\nAustria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputation. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the 19th century. In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].\n\nIn addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.\n\nA focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th-century Vienna School of Medicine. Austria was home to [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Alfred Adler]], founder of [[Individual psychology]], psychologists [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].\n\nThe [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9s include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].\n[[File:Stefan Zweig2.png|thumb|right|[[Stefan Zweig]]]]\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}\nComplementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].\n\nFamous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].\n\n===Food and beverages===\n{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}\n\nAustria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (\"Hofk\u00fcche\") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the \"Mehlspeisen\" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, \"Krapfen\" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and \"Strudel\" such as \"[[Apfelstrudel]]\" filled with apple, \"Topfenstrudel\" filled with a type of cheese curd called \"topfen\", and \"[[Millirahmstrudel]]\" (milk-cream strudel).\n\nIn addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Bohemia [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], Italian, [[Balkan]] and French cuisine, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.\n\n[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|[[Wiener Schnitzel]], a traditional Austrian dish]]\n\nTypical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], Schweinsbraten, [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Kn\u00f6del]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also K\u00e4rntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner (confectionary)|Mannerschnitten]]. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition. With over 8&nbsp;kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613115037/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBeer is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Kr\u00fcgerl'' or ''gro\u00dfes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures.

However, recently Austrian football has not been internationally successful. It also co-hosted the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].\n\nBesides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[\u00d6sterreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for basketball. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed [[Spanish Riding School of Vienna]] is located in Vienna.\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] is a former [[Formula One]] driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers are for example [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. Austria also hosts F1 races ([[Austrian Grand Prix]]); now held at [[Red Bull Ring]], in the past also at [[\u00d6sterreichring]] and [[Zeltweg Airfield]].\n\n[[Thomas Muster]] is a former [[tennis]] player and one of the greatest clay courters of all time. He won the [[1995 French Open]] and in 1996 he was ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|number 1]] in the [[ATP Rankings|ATP Ranking]]. Other known Austrian tennis players are for example [[Horst Skoff]], [[J\u00fcrgen Melzer]] and [[Dominic Thiem]].\n\nSport played a significant role in developing national consciousness and boosting national self-confidence in the early years of the Second Republic after World War II, through events such as the [[Tour of Austria]] cycle race and through sporting successes such as the national football team's run to third at the 1954 World Cup and the performances of Toni Sailer and the rest of the \"Kitzb\u00fchel Miracle Team\" in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marschick |first=Matthias |date=Summer 2011 |title=Austrian Sport and the Challenges of Its Recent Historiography |jstor=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189 |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013198 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Norden |first=Gilbert |date=Spring 2001 |title=Austrian Sport Museums |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801h.pdf |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=87\u2013107 |access-date=3 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114031850/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801h.pdf |archive-date=14 January 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Austria|Tyrol}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Austria}}\n* [[Index of Austria-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Austria]]\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | title=The Austrians: a thousand-year odyssey | last=Brook-Shepherd | first=Gordon | publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-7867-0520-7| location=New York}}\n* {{Cite book | title=Modern Austria: empire and republic 1815\u20131986 | last=Jelavich | first=Barbara | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1987 | isbn=978-0-521-31625-5 | location=Cambridge | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/modernaustria00barb }}\n* {{Cite book | title=Introducing Austria: a short history | last=Johnson | first=Lonnie | publisher=Ariadne Press | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-929497-03-7| location=Riverside, Calif.}}\n* Rathkolb, Oliver.

In the 16th century, Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] \u2013 one of the most influential [[royal house|royal dynasties]] in history. As an archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Early in the 19th century, Austria established [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]] but pursued its own course independently of the other German states. Following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|compromise]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was established.\n\nAustria was involved in [[World War I]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] following the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne. After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy, the [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed with the intent of the union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], which eventually failed because of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and the state remained unrecognized. In 1919 the [[First Austrian Republic]] became the legal successor of [[Cisleithania|Austria]]. In 1938, the Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], who became the [[German Chancellor|Chancellor]] of the [[German Reich]], achieved the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by the [[Anschluss]].

Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Austrian\u2013Prussian dualism]] began in Germany.

The same year, the [[German Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political, and national conflicts, the German lands were shaken by the [[1848 revolutions]] aiming to create a unified Germany.<ref name=\"johnson 36\">Johnson 36</ref>\n\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|Map of the [[German Confederation]] (1815-1836) with its 39 member states]]\n\nThe various different possibilities for a united Germany were: a [[Kleindeutschland and Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Greater Germany]], or a [[United States of Greater Austria|Greater Austria]] or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866.

Austria became a [[Federation|federal]], [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its [[States of Austria|nine states]] is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 17, 142</ref>\n\nThe [[head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] (''Bundespr\u00e4sident''), who is directly elected by popular majority vote, with a run-off between the top-scoring candidates, if necessary. The head of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]] (''Bundeskanzler''), who is selected by the President and tasked with forming a government based on the partisan composition of the lower house of parliament.\n\nThe government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]]. Voting for the Federal President and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103221527/http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archivedate=3 November 2007|title=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Inneres \u2013 Elections Compulsory voting|publisher=Bmi.gv.at|accessdate=3 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nAustria's parliament consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over the age of 16 has the [[Suffrage|right to vote]]. The voting age was lowered from 18 in 2007.\n\nWhile there is a general threshold of 4% of the vote for all parties in federal elections (Nationalratswahlen) to participate in the proportional allocation of seats, there remains the possibility of being elected to a seat directly in one of the 43 regional electoral districts ({{lang|de|Direktmandat}}).\n\nThe Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the legislative process in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]], has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can\u2014in almost all cases\u2014ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as ''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. \"vote of persistence\").

The Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') exerts considerable influence on the political system because of its power to invalidate legislation and ordinances that are not in compliance with the constitution. Since 1995, the [[European Court of Justice]] may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union.

In January 2007 the People's Party and SP\u00d6 formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.\n\nElections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party. They formed a coalition with [[Werner Faymann]] from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FP\u00d6 and the deceased [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.\n\nIn the [[2013 Austrian legislative election|legislative elections of 2013]], the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.\n\nAfter the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was proclaimed for [[2017 Austrian legislative election|October 2017]]. The Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) with its new young leader [[Sebastian Kurz]] emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6), which received 51 seats and 26%. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3 percent of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats. The \u00d6VP decided to form a coalition with the FP\u00d6. The new government between the centre-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December 2017, but the coalition government later collapsed and [[2019 Austrian legislative election|new elections]] were called for 29 September 2019. The elections lead to another landslide victory (37.5%) of the  Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) who formed a coalition-government with the reinvigorated (13.9%) Greens, which was sworn in with Kurz as chancellor on January 7 2020.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Austria}}\n\n[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement europ\u00e9en Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]]: Austria is one of the 28 EU members.]]\n\nThe 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality\". The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory\". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.\n\nAustria began to reassess its definition of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined NATO's [[Partnership for Peace]] (although it was careful to do so only after Russia joined) and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is to not allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Austria signed the UN's [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=2019-07-06 }}</ref> which was opposed by all NATO members.<ref>{{cite news |title=122 countries adopt 'historic' UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-treaty-ban-nuclear-weapons-1.4192761 |work=CBC News |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAustria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE).

Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria 1920 (reinst. 1945, rev. 2013)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155729/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.\n\nWithin its [[Declaration of Neutrality|self-declared status of permanent neutrality]], Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]].\n\n===Administrative divisions=== <!---\"Administrative divisions of Austria\" redirects here--->\n{{main|States of Austria}}\nAustria is a [[federal republic]] consisting of [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}).<ref name=\"CIA\" /> The states are sub-divided into [[Districts of Austria|districts]] ({{lang|de|[[Bezirke]]}}) and statutory cities ({{lang|de|[[Statutarstadt|Statutarst\u00e4dte]]}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|Gemeinden}}). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. Vienna is unique in that it is both a city and a state.\n\nAustria's constituent states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social welfare, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been questioned whether a small country should maintain ten subnational legislatures.{{citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=[need source if this claim is legit]}} Consolidation of local governments has already been undertaken at the ''Gemeinde'' level for purposes of administrative efficiency and cost savings (''[[:de:Gemeindefusion|Gemeindezusammenlegung]]).''\n\n{{Austrian Federal States|options=float:left; font-size:100%; border:3px; max-width:480px; width:50%}}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%\"\n|- style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right\"\n!

The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.\n\nAustria lies between latitudes [[46th parallel north|46\u00b0]] and [[49th parallel north|49\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[9th meridian east|9\u00b0]] and [[18th meridian east|18\u00b0 E]].\n\nIt can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the [[Eastern Alps]], which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] makes up the remaining 4%.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the [[Central European mixed forests]], Pannonian mixed forests, Alps conifer and mixed forests and Western European broadleaf forests.\n<gallery heights=\"120px\" widths=\"160px\">\nFile:1 hallstatt austria.jpg|View of [[Hallstatt]]\nFile:Krems and mautern from ferdinandswarte.jpg|View of [[Krems an der Donau|Krems]] at the end of [[Wachau|Wachau valley]]\nFile:Vorderhopfreben \u00dcntschenspitze 1.jpg|Austrian rural area of [[Schoppernau]] in summer\nFile:Donau Linz Abend.jpg|The [[Danube]] at [[Linz]] with cruise ships\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map AUT present.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification]] map for Austria<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Hylke E. |last2=Zimmermann |first2=Niklaus E. |last3=McVicar |first3=Tim R. |last4=Vergopolan |first4=Noemi |last5=Berg |first5=Alexis |last6=Wood |first6=Eric F. |title=Present and future K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution |journal=Scientific Data |date=30 October 2018 |volume=5 |pages=180214 |doi=10.1038/sdata.2018.214|pmid=30375988 |pmc=6207062 |bibcode=2018NatSD...580214B }}</ref>]]\n\nThe greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]], where humid westerly winds predominate.

It is important to note though that Austria may experience very cold, severe winters, but most of the time they are only around as cold as those in somewhat comparable climate zones, for example Southern Scandinavia or Eastern Europe. As well, at higher altitudes, summers are usually considerably cooler than in the valleys/lower altitudes.

Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two [[World war|World Wars]] and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, [[J\u00f6rg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the K\u00e4rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is the so-called \"[[:de:Windischen-Theorie|Windischen-Theorie]]\" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the \"loyal Windische\" and the \"national Slovenes\", was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Austria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Austria (2017)<ref name=\"wienerzeitung\">WZ-Recherche 2016.

School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.\n\n[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.\n\nPrimary education, or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The [[The three Rs|3Rs]] (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].\n\nStandard attendance times are 8&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm or 1&nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.\n\nAs in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[H\u00f6here Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.\n\n[[File:Wien - Universit\u00e4t (3).JPG|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Wien 02 Campus WU a.jpg|thumb| The campus of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]]]\nAs at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report (\"Zeugnis\") are a prerequisite for moving up (\"aufsteigen\") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year (\"sitzenbleiben\").\n\nIt is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as \"Gymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or \"Realgymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.\n\nThe Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee (\"''Studienbeitrag''\") of \u20ac363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. There are some non-state exceptions to this, where students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the [[English Teacher Training College]]. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).<ref name=\"Tuition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|website=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501221940/http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|archive-date=1 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around \u20ac363.36 per term is charged.

Austria was the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.\n\nVienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the [[Baroque period]], Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.\n\n[[File:StateOperaViennaNightBackside.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Vienna State Opera]]]]\n\nVienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the [[lute]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the [[Sei gesegnet ohne Ende|traditional Austrian anthem]] by Joseph Haydn.\n\nAustrian [[Herbert von Karajan]] was principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for 35 years. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|title=Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist was 81|pages=A1|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Rockwell|date=17 July 1989|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712135148/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|archive-date=12 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nInternational pop super star Johann H\u00f6lzel, also known by his stage name [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was born in [[Vienna]], Austria 19 February 1957.\n\n[[Conchita Wurst]] is also a renowned singer from the Austrian stock.\n\n===Art and architecture===\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Architecture of Austria\"; if the section heading changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\n{{Further|List of Austrian artists and architects}}\n[[File:Botanischer Garten Der Universit\u00e4t, Wenen, Oostenrijk Aug 02, 2019 04-27-11 PM.jpeg|thumb|The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere Palace]], an example of [[Baroque]] architecture]]\n\nAmong Austrian Artists and architects one can find the painters [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Hans Makart]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Carl Moll]], and [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], the photographers [[Inge Morath]] and [[Ernst Haas]], and architects like [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], [[Otto Wagner]], [[Adolf Loos]], and [[Hans Hollein]] (recipient of the 1985 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]]).

Among them were [[Peter Lorre]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Oskar Werner]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]. [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became American as well as international movie stars. The latter also became the 38th Governor of California. [[Christoph Waltz]] rose to international fame with his performances in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' and ''[[Django Unchained]]'', earning him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 2010 and 2012.

In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].\n\nIn addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.\n\nA focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th-century Vienna School of Medicine. Austria was home to [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Alfred Adler]], founder of [[Individual psychology]], psychologists [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].\n\nThe [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9s include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].\n[[File:Stefan Zweig2.png|thumb|right|[[Stefan Zweig]]]]\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}\nComplementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].\n\nFamous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].\n\n===Food and beverages===\n{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}\n\nAustria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (\"Hofk\u00fcche\") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the \"Mehlspeisen\" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, \"Krapfen\" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and \"Strudel\" such as \"[[Apfelstrudel]]\" filled with apple, \"Topfenstrudel\" filled with a type of cheese curd called \"topfen\", and \"[[Millirahmstrudel]]\" (milk-cream strudel).\n\nIn addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Bohemia [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], Italian, [[Balkan]] and French cuisine, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.\n\n[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|[[Wiener Schnitzel]], a traditional Austrian dish]]\n\nTypical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], Schweinsbraten, [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Kn\u00f6del]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also K\u00e4rntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner (confectionary)|Mannerschnitten]]. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition. With over 8&nbsp;kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613115037/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBeer is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Kr\u00fcgerl'' or ''gro\u00dfes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures. At festivals one litre ''Ma\u00df'' and two litre ''Doppelma\u00df'' in the [[Bavaria]]n style are also dispensed. The most popular types of beer are [[lager]] (known as ''M\u00e4rzen'' in Austria), naturally cloudy ''Zwicklbier'' and [[wheat beer]]. At holidays like Christmas and Easter [[bock]] beer is also available.\n\nThe most important wine-producing areas are in [[Lower Austria]], [[Burgenland]], [[Styria]] and Vienna.

The produce of small private schnapps [[distillery|distilleries]], of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as ''Selbstgebrannter'' or ''Hausbrand''.\n\nLocal soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages. Another popular drink is the so-called \"Spezi\", a mix between Coca-Cola and the original formula of [[Fanta|Orange Fanta]] or the more locally renowned [[Frucade]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Red Bull]], the highest-selling energy drink in the world, was introduced by [[Dietrich Mateschitz]], an Austrian entrepreneur.\n\n===Sports===\n{{main|Sport in Austria}}\n[[File:Bergisel.jpg|thumb|[[Innsbruck]] hosted the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]], as well as the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics]], the first in history.]]\n\nDue to the mountainous terrain, [[alpine skiing]] is a prominent sport in Austria and is extremely valuable in the promotion and economic growth of the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horak|first=Roman|last2=Spitaler|first2=Georg|year=2003|title=Sport, Space and National Identity: Soccer and Skiing as Formative Forces: On the Austrian Example|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=46|issue=11|pages=1508\u201318|doi=10.1177/0002764203046011004}}</ref> Similar sports such as [[snowboarding]] or [[ski-jumping]] are also widely popular.

However, recently Austrian football has not been internationally successful. It also co-hosted the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].\n\nBesides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[\u00d6sterreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for basketball. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed [[Spanish Riding School of Vienna]] is located in Vienna.\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] is a former [[Formula One]] driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers are for example [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. Austria also hosts F1 races ([[Austrian Grand Prix]]); now held at [[Red Bull Ring]], in the past also at [[\u00d6sterreichring]] and [[Zeltweg Airfield]].\n\n[[Thomas Muster]] is a former [[tennis]] player and one of the greatest clay courters of all time. He won the [[1995 French Open]] and in 1996 he was ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|number 1]] in the [[ATP Rankings|ATP Ranking]].

the '''[[2004 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation's fifteenth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.\n\n[[Puerto Rico Olympic Committee]] sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games since [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] due to the presence of the men's basketball team. A total of 43 athletes, 32 men and 11 women, had competed in 15 sports, roughly larger by two thirds of the nation's team size from the previous Games. Five Puerto Rican athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including four-time Olympian and Tornado sailor [[Enrique Figueroa]] and freestyle swimmer and two-time Olympic finalist [[Ricardo Busquets]]. [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's basketball]] was the only team-based sport in which Puerto Rico had its representation at these Games. Because of the nation's emerging presence to the team sport, team captain and NBA's [[Utah Jazz]] player [[Carlos Arroyo]] was appointed by the committee to carry the Puerto Rican flag in the opening ceremony.<ref name=cararroyo>{{cite news|title=Jugador Carlos Arroyo ser\u00e1 el abanderado en Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos|trans-title=Player Carlos Arroyo will be the flag bearer at the Olympics|language=Spanish|url=http://www.terra.com/deportes/articulo/html/fox112853.htm|publisher=[[Terra Networks]]|date=1 July 2004|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> Puerto Rico also marked its Olympic debut in synchronized [[Synchronised swimming|swimming]] and taekwondo.\n\nPuerto Rico left Athens without receiving a single Olympic medal for the second consecutive time. Figueroa and his new partner Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez achieved the nation's highest placement at these Games after finishing seventh in the Tornado class. Meanwhile, [[Mabel Fonseca]] originally claimed the fifth position in women's wrestling, but she committed an anti-doping violation, as she was tested positive for the steroid [[stanozolol]].<ref

The oldest derivation of the word Andorra is from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'' III, 35, 1) who describes the Andosins, an [[Iberians|Iberian]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Pre-Roman tribe]], as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the [[Punic Wars]]. The word Andosini or Andosins (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is \"big\" or \"giant\".<ref name=\"Diccionari\">''Diccionari d'Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; {{ISBN|84-297-3521-6}}; p. 42; entrada \"Andorra\"</ref> The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of Basque language in the area.

When the [[Arabs]] and [[Moors]] conquered the Iberian Peninsula, the valleys of the High Pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest, and most of the regions that were not administered by Muslims, because of the geographical difficulty that was presented, received this designation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaston|first=L.

This peculiarity makes the president of France, in his capacity as [[prince of Andorra]], an elected monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|head of government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.\n\nThe current head of government is [[Xavier Espot Zamora]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors. The councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.\n\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, the historical and ceremonial Andorran Parliament]]\n\nCandidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government. The Syndic General then notifies the co-princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall, Andorra la Vieja, Andorra, 2013-12-30, DD 03.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Parliament of Andorra]], headquarters of the [[General Council of Andorra|General Council]] since 2011, next to [[Casa de la Vall]]]]\n\nThe Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.\n\n[[File:Els 7 poetes, Casa de la Vall, Consell General.JPG|thumb|The centre of government in [[Andorra la Vella]]]]\n\nIf the head of government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the head of government is removed.\n\n==Law and criminal justice==\n{{Main|Law of Andorra}}\nThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the head of government, one each by the co-princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the judges and magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.\n\nThe magistrates and judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the president of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the co-princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.\n\n==Foreign relations, defence, and security==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}\n[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]]]]\nAndorra does not have its own armed forces,<ref name=\"cia\"/> although there is a small ceremonial army.

Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer. The diversity of landmarks, the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the [[Mediterranean climate]]s make the country have a great diversity of [[microclimate]]s that hinder the general dominance of the [[Mountain climate|high mountain climate]]. The great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points, together with the influence of a Mediterranean climate, develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees.\n\nWhen in precipitation, a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer, which can last until autumn (May, June and August are usually the rainiest months); In winter, however, it is less rainy, except in the highlands, subject to the influence of fronts from the [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic]], which explains the great amount of snowfall in the Andorran mountains.

The word Andosini or Andosins (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is \"big\" or \"giant\".<ref name=\"Diccionari\">''Diccionari d'Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; {{ISBN|84-297-3521-6}}; p. 42; entrada \"Andorra\"</ref> The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of Basque language in the area.

This peculiarity makes the president of France, in his capacity as [[prince of Andorra]], an elected monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|head of government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.\n\nThe current head of government is [[Xavier Espot Zamora]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors. The councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.\n\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, the historical and ceremonial Andorran Parliament]]\n\nCandidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government. The Syndic General then notifies the co-princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall, Andorra la Vieja, Andorra, 2013-12-30, DD 03.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Parliament of Andorra]], headquarters of the [[General Council of Andorra|General Council]] since 2011, next to [[Casa de la Vall]]]]\n\nThe Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.\n\n[[File:Els 7 poetes, Casa de la Vall, Consell General.JPG|thumb|The centre of government in [[Andorra la Vella]]]]\n\nIf the head of government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the head of government is removed.\n\n==Law and criminal justice==\n{{Main|Law of Andorra}}\nThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the head of government, one each by the co-princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the judges and magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.\n\nThe magistrates and judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the president of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the co-princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.\n\n==Foreign relations, defence, and security==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}\n[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]]]]\nAndorra does not have its own armed forces,<ref name=\"cia\"/> although there is a small ceremonial army.

Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.\n\n===Climate===\nAndorra has [[alpine climate|alpine]], [[continental climate|continental]] and [[oceanic climate]]s, depending on altitude. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer. The diversity of landmarks, the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the [[Mediterranean climate]]s make the country have a great diversity of [[microclimate]]s that hinder the general dominance of the [[Mountain climate|high mountain climate]]. The great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points, together with the influence of a Mediterranean climate, develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees.\n\nWhen in precipitation, a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer, which can last until autumn (May, June and August are usually the rainiest months); In winter, however, it is less rainy, except in the highlands, subject to the influence of fronts from the [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic]], which explains the great amount of snowfall in the Andorran mountains.

Portuguese athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era since [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]]. The [[Olympic Committee of Portugal]] sent the nation's second-largest team to the Games. A total of 81 athletes, 64 men and 17 women, were selected by the committee to participate in 15 sports. [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's football]] was the only team-based sport in which Portugal had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in badminton, canoeing, equestrian, artistic and trampoline gymnastics, triathlon, and wrestling, which made its official Olympic comeback after an eight-year absence.\n\nTwenty-four Portuguese athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including two returning Olympic medalists: long-distance runner and former champion [[Fernanda Ribeiro]] and lightweight judoka [[Nuno Delgado]], who later became the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.<ref name=delgado>{{cite news|title=Ribatejano Nuno Delgado ser\u00e1 porta-estandarte portugu\u00eas em Atenas|trans-title=Ribatejano Nuno Delgado will be Portugal's flag bearer in Athens|url=http://semanal.omirante.pt/index_access.asp?idEdicao=140&id=11699&idSeccao=1661&Action=noticia|publisher=[[O Mirante]]|date=12 August 2004|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> Mistral windsurfer and multiple-time European champion [[Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues (sailor)|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues]] and middle-distance runner [[Carla Sacramento]] shared their experiences at these Games as the only athletes who made their fourth Olympic appearance. Equestrian rider Carlos Grave, aged 46, was the oldest athlete of the team, while breaststroke swimmer [[Diana Gomes]] was the youngest at age 15. Among the Portuguese athletes of the team, two of them had acquired a dual citizenship to compete for Portugal: former hurdler [[Naide Gomes]] from [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] in the women's heptathlon, and sprinter [[Francis Obikwelu]] on his third Olympic bid after he previously joined the Nigerian squad in Atlanta and Sydney.<ref>{{cite news|last=Plummer|first=David|title=Obikwelu puts dampener on Greene's birthday celebrations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jul/24/athletics|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 July 2004|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nPortugal left Athens with only three Olympic medals, two silver and one bronze, improving the nation's stark medal tally from Sydney four years earlier. The highlight of the Games for the Portuguese team came on the first day with a historic milestone for [[S\u00e9rgio Paulinho]], as the nation's first ever cyclist to claim a silver medal in the men's road race.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bettini battles to gold|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/cycling/3564290.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=14 August 2004|date=4 May 2014}}</ref> The remaining medals were awarded to the athletes in the track and field.
