The term International Driving Permit was first mentioned in the document prescribed in the International Convention relative to Motor Traffic that was signed at Paris in 1926. In most countries, IDPs are issued by [[automobile associations]], such as [[American Automobile Association]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html|title=AAA IDP International Driving Permit|website=www.aaa.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> in the [[United States|USA]], [[Norwegian Automobile Federation]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naf.no/tjenester/internasjonalt-forerkort/|title=Internasjonalt f\u00f8rerkort|website=NAF|language=no|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> in [[Norway]] and [[Motorm\u00e4nnens riksf\u00f6rbund|Riksf\u00f6rbundet M Sverige]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msverige.se/resa-med-bil/internationellt-koerkort/|title=Best\u00e4ll ditt internationella k\u00f6rkort av M Sverige!|website=msverige.se|language=sv|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> in [[Sweden]]. \n\nInternational Driving Permits are governed by three international conventions: the 1926 Paris International Convention relative to Motor Traffic, the 1949 [[Geneva Convention on Road Traffic]], and the 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]]. When a state is contracting to more than one convention, the newest one terminate and replace previous ones.  \n\nThe IDP, whose A6 size (148 \u00d7 105 mm) is slightly larger than a [[passport]], has a grey cover and white inside pages. The outside and inside of the front cover shall be printed in (at least one of) the national language(s) of the issuing State. The last two inside pages shall be printed in French, and pages preceding those two pages shall repeat the first of them in several languages, which must include English, Russian and Spanish.  \n\nTo be valid, the IDP must be accompanied by a valid [[driving licence]] issued in the applicant's country of residence. An IDP is not required if the driver's domestic licence meets the requirements of the 1949 or 1968 convention; the domestic licence can be used directly in a foreign jurisdiction that is a party to that convention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegvesen.no/en/driving-licences/driving-licence-holders/foreign-driving-licences-in-norway/issued-outside-the-eu-eea/driving-in-norway|title=Driving with driving licences issued in non-EU/EEA countries|website=Statens vegvesen|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> In addition, other arrangements eliminates the need of an IDP in some countries, such as the [[European driving licence|European driving license]] valid within the [[European Economic Area]] or holders of an [[Inter-American Driving Permit]] driving in participating [[American countries]]. \n\n== Driver information ==\n\n=== 1968 convention (as amended in 2011) ===\n[[File:Fahrerlaubnisklassen.png|240px|right]]\nThe main regulations about driving licences are in Annex 6 (domestic driving permit) and Annex 7 (International Driving Permit).

According to the 1968 Vienna Convention, an IDP must have an expiration date of no more than three years from its issue date or until the expiration date of national driving permit, whichever is earlier, and it is valid for a period of one year upon the arrival in the foreign country. \n\nArticle 41 of the convention describes requirements for [[driving licences]]. Key of those are:\n* every driver of a motor vehicle must hold a driving licence;\n* driving licences can be issued only after passing theoretical and practical exams, which are regulated by each country or jurisdiction;\n* Contracting parties shall recognize as valid for driving in their territories:\n** domestic driving licence conforms to the provisions of annex 6 to the convention;\n** International Driving Permit conforms to the provisions of annex 7 to the convention, on condition that it is presented with the corresponding domestic driving licence;\n* driving licences issued by a contracting party shall be recognised in the territory of another contracting party until this territory becomes the place of normal residence of their holder;\n* all of the above does not apply to learner-driver licences;\n* the period of validity of an international driving permit shall be either no more than three years after the date of issue or until the date of expiry of the domestic driving licence, whichever is earlier;\n* Contracting parties may refuse to recognise the validity of driving licences for persons under eighteen or, for categories C, D, CE and DE, under twenty-one;\n* an international driving permit shall only be issued by the contracting party in whose territory the holder has their normal residence and that issued the domestic driving licence or that recognised the driving licence issued by another contracting party;

that allows the holder to drive a private [[motor vehicle]] in any country or jurisdiction that recognises the document. The term International Driving Permit was first mentioned in the document prescribed in the International Convention relative to Motor Traffic that was signed at Paris in 1926. In most countries, IDPs are issued by [[automobile associations]], such as [[American Automobile Association]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html|title=AAA IDP International Driving Permit|website=www.aaa.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> in the [[United States|USA]], [[Norwegian Automobile Federation]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naf.no/tjenester/internasjonalt-forerkort/|title=Internasjonalt f\u00f8rerkort|website=NAF|language=no|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> in [[Norway]] and [[Motorm\u00e4nnens riksf\u00f6rbund|Riksf\u00f6rbundet M Sverige]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msverige.se/resa-med-bil/internationellt-koerkort/|title=Best\u00e4ll ditt internationella k\u00f6rkort av M Sverige!|website=msverige.se|language=sv|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> in [[Sweden]]. \n\nInternational Driving Permits are governed by three international conventions: the 1926 Paris International Convention relative to Motor Traffic, the 1949 [[Geneva Convention on Road Traffic]], and the 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]]. When a state is contracting to more than one convention, the newest one terminate and replace previous ones.  \n\nThe IDP, whose A6 size (148 \u00d7 105 mm) is slightly larger than a [[passport]], has a grey cover and white inside pages. The outside and inside of the front cover shall be printed in (at least one of) the national language(s) of the issuing State.

According to the 1968 Vienna Convention, an IDP must have an expiration date of no more than three years from its issue date or until the expiration date of national driving permit, whichever is earlier, and it is valid for a period of one year upon the arrival in the foreign country. \n\nArticle 41 of the convention describes requirements for [[driving licences]]. Key of those are:\n* every driver of a motor vehicle must hold a driving licence;\n* driving licences can be issued only after passing theoretical and practical exams, which are regulated by each country or jurisdiction;\n* Contracting parties shall recognize as valid for driving in their territories:\n** domestic driving licence conforms to the provisions of annex 6 to the convention;\n** International Driving Permit conforms to the provisions of annex 7 to the convention, on condition that it is presented with the corresponding domestic driving licence;\n* driving licences issued by a contracting party shall be recognised in the territory of another contracting party until this territory becomes the place of normal residence of their holder;\n* all of the above does not apply to learner-driver licences;\n* the period of validity of an international driving permit shall be either no more than three years after the date of issue or until the date of expiry of the domestic driving licence, whichever is earlier;\n* Contracting parties may refuse to recognise the validity of driving licences for persons under eighteen or, for categories C, D, CE and DE, under twenty-one;\n* an international driving permit shall only be issued by the contracting party in whose territory the holder has their normal residence and that issued the domestic driving licence or that recognised the driving licence issued by another contracting party;
