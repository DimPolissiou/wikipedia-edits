It has its seat in [[Trnava]]. In 2013 [[Pope Francis]] appointed Auxiliary Bishop J\u00e1n Orosch as the next Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Trnava.\n\n==History==\nThe diocese was first created as Apostolic Administration of Trnava on 29 May 1922, subordinate to the [[Holy See]], on the territory of [[Archdiocese of Esztergom]] which became part of the [[Czechoslovakia]] after 1918. On the order of [[Pope Paul VI]] on 30 December 1977, it was elevated to the status of metropolitan archdiocese and renamed to the Archdiocese of Trnava, and it had at first [[suffragan]]s of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nitra|Nitra]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica|Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ro\u017e\u0148ava|Ro\u017e\u0148ava]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ko\u0161ice|Ko\u0161ice]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Spi\u0161|Spi\u0161]]. On 31 March 1995, the archdiocese was renamed to Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava, and since then it had only suffragans of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and Nitra.  Its territory covered Bratislava, Trnava, [[Nitra Region|Nitra]] (except the city of [[Nitra]] and the strip connecting it with the main part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nitra|Diocese of Nitra]]), small part of the [[Tren\u010d\u00edn Region|Tren\u010d\u00edn]] and south-western part of the [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region|Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]] regions. As of 2004, it covered an area of approximately 14,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 with a population of 1,930,000 people of which around 70% were of Catholic faith.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbrtr.html Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava at catholic-hierarchy.org]</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 2008, the archdiocese was split between several dioceses. Trnava became seat of the newly created Archdiocese of Trnava, which, despite being an archdiocese, belongs to the ecclesiastical province of [[Archdiocese of Bratislava|Bratislava]] as its suffragan.  Other parts of the former diocese have been split between the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nitra|Nitra]] and [[Diocese of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica|Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]] (see e.g. [http://www.kbs.sk/images/site_content/provincie_n.gif this map (in Slovak)].\n\n[[R\u00f3bert Bez\u00e1k]], C.SS.R.

It has its seat in [[Trnava]]. In 2013 [[Pope Francis]] appointed Auxiliary Bishop J\u00e1n Orosch as the next Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Trnava.\n\n==History==\nThe diocese was first created as Apostolic Administration of Trnava on 29 May 1922, subordinate to the [[Holy See]], on the territory of [[Archdiocese of Esztergom]] which became part of the [[Czechoslovakia]] after 1918. On the order of [[Pope Paul VI]] on 30 December 1977, it was elevated to the status of metropolitan archdiocese and renamed to the Archdiocese of Trnava, and it had at first [[suffragan]]s of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nitra|Nitra]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica|Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ro\u017e\u0148ava|Ro\u017e\u0148ava]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ko\u0161ice|Ko\u0161ice]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Spi\u0161|Spi\u0161]]. On 31 March 1995, the archdiocese was renamed to Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava, and since then it had only suffragans of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and Nitra.  Its territory covered Bratislava, Trnava, [[Nitra Region|Nitra]] (except the city of [[Nitra]] and the strip connecting it with the main part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nitra|Diocese of Nitra]]), small part of the [[Tren\u010d\u00edn Region|Tren\u010d\u00edn]] and south-western part of the [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region|Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]] regions. As of 2004, it covered an area of approximately 14,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 with a population of 1,930,000 people of which around 70% were of Catholic faith.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbrtr.html Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava at catholic-hierarchy.org]</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 2008, the archdiocese was split between several dioceses. Trnava became seat of the newly created Archdiocese of Trnava, which, despite being an archdiocese, belongs to the ecclesiastical province of [[Archdiocese of Bratislava|Bratislava]] as its suffragan.  Other parts of the former diocese have been split between the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nitra|Nitra]] and [[Diocese of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica|Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]] (see e.g. [http://www.kbs.sk/images/site_content/provincie_n.gif this map (in Slovak)].\n\n[[R\u00f3bert Bez\u00e1k]], C.SS.R.

It has several facilities spread across India including [[Bengaluru]], [[Ozar Airport|Nasik]], [[Korwa, Uttar Pradesh|Korwa]], [[Kanpur]], [[Koraput]], [[Lucknow]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Kasaragod]].

The companies office was opened at a bungalow called \"Eventide\" on [[Domlur]] Road.\n\nThe organisation and equipment for the factory at Bangalore was set up by [[William D. Pawley]] of the Intercontinental Aircraft Corporation of New York. Pawley obtained a large number of machine-tools and equipment from the United States.\n\nThe [[Indian Government]] bought a one-third stake in the company and by April 1941 by investing 25 lakhs as it believed this to be a strategic imperative. The decision by the government was primarily motivated to boost British military hardware supplies in Asia to counter the increasing threat posed by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[Second World War]]. The Kingdom of Mysore supplied two directors, Air Marshal [[John Frederick Andrews Higgins|John Higgins]] was resident director. The first aircraft built was a [[Harlow PC-5]]<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF \"Hindustan Aircraft Ltd\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094328/http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF |date=10 May 2013 }} ''Flight'' 27 August 1954 p. 296.</ref> On 2 April 1942, the government announced that the company had been nationalised when it had bought out the stakes of Seth Walchand Hirachand and other promoters so that it could act freely. The Mysore Kingdom refused to sell its stake in the company but yielded the management control over to the Indian Government.\n\nIn 1943 the Bangalore factory was handed over to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] but still using Hindustan Aircraft management. The factory expanded rapidly and became the centre for major overhaul and repair of American aircraft and was known as the 84th Air Depot. The first aircraft to be overhauled was a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] followed by every type of aircraft operated in India and Burma. When returned to Indian control two years later the factory had become one of the largest overhaul and repair organisations in the East. In the post war reorganisation the company built railway carriages as an interim activity.\n\n[[File:IJT Prototype in hangar.jpg|thumb|IJT prototype in its hangar]]\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the management of the company was passed over to the [[Government of India]].\n\nHindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was formed on 1 October 1964 when Hindustan Aircraft Limited joined the consortium formed in June by the IAF Aircraft Manufacturing Depot, Kanpur (at the time manufacturing HS748 under licence) and the group recently set up to manufacture MiG-21 under licence, with its new factories planned in Koraput, Nasik and Hyderabad.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html HAL Preserved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309050659/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html |date=9 March 2012 }} ''Flight International'' 1964</ref> Though HAL was not used actively for developing newer models of fighter jets, except for the [[HF-24 Marut]], the company has played a crucial role in modernisation of the [[Indian Air Force]]. In 1957 company started manufacturing [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus]] jet engines under licence at new factory located in Bangalore.\n\nDuring the 1980s, HAL's operations saw a rapid increase which resulted in the development of new indigenous aircraft such as the [[HAL Tejas]] and [[HAL Dhruv]]. HAL also developed an advanced version of the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], known as MiG-21 ''Bison'', which increased its life-span by more than 20 years. HAL has also obtained several multimillion-dollar contracts from leading international aerospace firms such as [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]] and [[Honeywell]] to manufacture aircraft spare parts and engines.\n\nBy 2012, HAL was reportedly bogged down in the details of production and has been slipping on its schedules.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece \"HAL slipping up on deliveries as it handles too many projects.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307001016/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece |date=7 March 2012 }} ''The Hindu Business Line'', 3 March 2012.</ref> On 1 April 2015, HAL reconstituted its Board with Mr. TS Raju as CMD, Mr. S Subrahmanyan as Director (Operations), Mr. VM Chamola as Director (HR), CA Ramana Rao as Director (Finance) and Mr. D K Venkatesh as Director (Engineering & R&D). There are two Govt. nominees in the Board and six independent Directors.\n\nIn March 2017, HAL Chairman and Managing Director T Suvarna Raju announced that the company had finalised plans for an indigenisation drive. The company plans to produce nearly 1,000 military helicopters, including Kamov 226, LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter), and over 100 planes over the next 10 years. HAL will manufacture the Kamov 226T helicopter under a joint venture agreement with Russian defence manufacturers. The Kamov 226T will replace the country's fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. Over the next 5 years, HAL will carry out major upgrade of almost the entire fighter fleet of Indian Air Force including Su-30MKI, Jaguars, Mirage and Hawk jets to make them \"more lethal\". The company will also deliver 123 Tejas Light Combat Aircraft to the IAF from 2018\u201319, at a rate of 16 jets per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Narendra Modi powers-up HAL's indigenisation drive, India's military may get 100 planes, 1,000 helicopters soon|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|website=The Financial Express|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327165630/http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref> [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter|LCH]] production will now take place in a newly built Light Combat Helicopter Production Hangar at Helicopter Division in HAL Complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-inaugurates-hals-lch-production-hangar|title=Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurates HAL\u2019s LCH production Hangar at Bengaluru|last=World|first=Republic|website=Republic World|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nIn view of [[Make in India]] policy and to increase the share of defence exports to achieve the target of $5 billion dollars by 2025, HAL is planning to setup logistic bases in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Vietnam]] with priority target for [[Southeast Asia]], [[Western Asia|West Asia]] and [[North Africa]]n markets.

It is governed under the management of the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Indian Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe [[government-owned corporation]] is primarily involved in the operations of the aerospace and is currently involved in the design, fabrication and assembly of [[aircraft]], [[jet engine]]s, [[helicopter]]s and their spare parts. It has several facilities spread across India including [[Bengaluru]], [[Ozar Airport|Nasik]], [[Korwa, Uttar Pradesh|Korwa]], [[Kanpur]], [[Koraput]], [[Lucknow]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Kasaragod]].  The [[Hindustan Marut|HAL HF-24 Marut]] fighter-bomber was the first fighter aircraft made in India.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:HAL Dhruv production line.JPG|thumb|Production line of the [[HAL Dhruv]] at [[Bangalore]]]]\n\nHAL was established as '''Hindustan Aircraft Limited''' in Bangalore on 23 December 1940 by [[Walchand Hirachand]] who became Chairman of the company. The companies office was opened at a bungalow called \"Eventide\" on [[Domlur]] Road.\n\nThe organisation and equipment for the factory at Bangalore was set up by [[William D. Pawley]] of the Intercontinental Aircraft Corporation of New York. Pawley obtained a large number of machine-tools and equipment from the United States.\n\nThe [[Indian Government]] bought a one-third stake in the company and by April 1941 by investing 25 lakhs as it believed this to be a strategic imperative. The decision by the government was primarily motivated to boost British military hardware supplies in Asia to counter the increasing threat posed by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[Second World War]]. The Kingdom of Mysore supplied two directors, Air Marshal [[John Frederick Andrews Higgins|John Higgins]] was resident director. The first aircraft built was a [[Harlow PC-5]]<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF \"Hindustan Aircraft Ltd\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094328/http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF |date=10 May 2013 }} ''Flight'' 27 August 1954 p. 296.</ref> On 2 April 1942, the government announced that the company had been nationalised when it had bought out the stakes of Seth Walchand Hirachand and other promoters so that it could act freely. The Mysore Kingdom refused to sell its stake in the company but yielded the management control over to the Indian Government.\n\nIn 1943 the Bangalore factory was handed over to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] but still using Hindustan Aircraft management. The factory expanded rapidly and became the centre for major overhaul and repair of American aircraft and was known as the 84th Air Depot. The first aircraft to be overhauled was a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] followed by every type of aircraft operated in India and Burma. When returned to Indian control two years later the factory had become one of the largest overhaul and repair organisations in the East. In the post war reorganisation the company built railway carriages as an interim activity.\n\n[[File:IJT Prototype in hangar.jpg|thumb|IJT prototype in its hangar]]\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the management of the company was passed over to the [[Government of India]].\n\nHindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was formed on 1 October 1964 when Hindustan Aircraft Limited joined the consortium formed in June by the IAF Aircraft Manufacturing Depot, Kanpur (at the time manufacturing HS748 under licence) and the group recently set up to manufacture MiG-21 under licence, with its new factories planned in Koraput, Nasik and Hyderabad.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html HAL Preserved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309050659/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html |date=9 March 2012 }} ''Flight International'' 1964</ref> Though HAL was not used actively for developing newer models of fighter jets, except for the [[HF-24 Marut]], the company has played a crucial role in modernisation of the [[Indian Air Force]]. In 1957 company started manufacturing [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus]] jet engines under licence at new factory located in Bangalore.\n\nDuring the 1980s, HAL's operations saw a rapid increase which resulted in the development of new indigenous aircraft such as the [[HAL Tejas]] and [[HAL Dhruv]]. HAL also developed an advanced version of the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], known as MiG-21 ''Bison'', which increased its life-span by more than 20 years. HAL has also obtained several multimillion-dollar contracts from leading international aerospace firms such as [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]] and [[Honeywell]] to manufacture aircraft spare parts and engines.\n\nBy 2012, HAL was reportedly bogged down in the details of production and has been slipping on its schedules.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece \"HAL slipping up on deliveries as it handles too many projects.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307001016/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece |date=7 March 2012 }} ''The Hindu Business Line'', 3 March 2012.</ref> On 1 April 2015, HAL reconstituted its Board with Mr. TS Raju as CMD, Mr. S Subrahmanyan as Director (Operations), Mr. VM Chamola as Director (HR), CA Ramana Rao as Director (Finance) and Mr. D K Venkatesh as Director (Engineering & R&D). There are two Govt. nominees in the Board and six independent Directors.\n\nIn March 2017, HAL Chairman and Managing Director T Suvarna Raju announced that the company had finalised plans for an indigenisation drive. The company plans to produce nearly 1,000 military helicopters, including Kamov 226, LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter), and over 100 planes over the next 10 years. HAL will manufacture the Kamov 226T helicopter under a joint venture agreement with Russian defence manufacturers. The Kamov 226T will replace the country's fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. Over the next 5 years, HAL will carry out major upgrade of almost the entire fighter fleet of Indian Air Force including Su-30MKI, Jaguars, Mirage and Hawk jets to make them \"more lethal\". The company will also deliver 123 Tejas Light Combat Aircraft to the IAF from 2018\u201319, at a rate of 16 jets per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Narendra Modi powers-up HAL's indigenisation drive, India's military may get 100 planes, 1,000 helicopters soon|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|website=The Financial Express|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327165630/http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref> [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter|LCH]] production will now take place in a newly built Light Combat Helicopter Production Hangar at Helicopter Division in HAL Complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-inaugurates-hals-lch-production-hangar|title=Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurates HAL\u2019s LCH production Hangar at Bengaluru|last=World|first=Republic|website=Republic World|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nIn view of [[Make in India]] policy and to increase the share of defence exports to achieve the target of $5 billion dollars by 2025, HAL is planning to setup logistic bases in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Vietnam]] with priority target for [[Southeast Asia]], [[Western Asia|West Asia]] and [[North Africa]]n markets.

We define the '''sum-product function''' for base <math>b > 1</math> <math>F_{b} : \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}</math> to be the following:\n: <math>F_{b}(n) = \\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^l d_i\\right)\\left(\\prod_{j = 1}^l d_j\\right)</math>\nwhere <math>k = \\lfloor \\log_{b}{n} \\rfloor + 1</math> is the number of digits in the number in base <math>b</math>, and \n: <math>d_i = \\frac{n \\bmod{b^{i+1}} - n \\bmod b^i}{b^i}</math>\nis the value of each digit of the number. A natural number <math>n</math> is a '''sum-product number''' if it is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] for <math>F_{b}</math>, which occurs if <math>F_{b}(n) = n</math>. The natural numbers 0 and 1 are '''trivial sum-product numbers''' for all <math>b</math>, and all other sum-product numbers are '''nontrivial sum-product numbers'''.\n\nFor example, the number 144 in [[base 10]] is a sum-product number, because <math>1 + 4 + 4 = 9</math>, <math>(1)(4)(4) = 16</math>, and <math>(9)(16) = 144</math>.\n\nA natural number <math>n</math> is a '''sociable sum-product number''' if it is a [[periodic point]] for <math>F_{b}</math>, where <math>F_{b}^p(n) = n</math> for a positive integer <math>p</math>, and forms a [[Periodic sequence|cycle]] of period <math>p</math>. A sum-product number is a sociable sum-product number with <math>p = 1</math>, and a '''amicable sum-product number''' is a sociable sum-product number with <math>p = 2</math>.\n\nAll natural numbers <math>n</math> are [[periodic point#iterated function|preperiodic points]] for <math>F_{b}</math>, regardless of the base. This is because for any given digit count <math>k</math>, the minimum possible value of <math>n</math> is <math>b^{k - 1}</math> and the maximum possible value of <math>n</math> is <math>b^{k} - 1 = \\sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} (b - 1)^k</math>. The maximum possible digit sum is therefore <math>k(b - 1)</math> and the maximum possible digit product is <math>(b - 1)^k</math>. Thus, the sum-product function value is <math>F_{b}(n) = k(b-1)^{k + 1}</math>. This suggests that <math>k(b - 1)^{k + 1} \\geq n \\geq b^{k - 1}</math>, or dividing both sides by <math>{(b - 1)}^{k - 1}</math>, <math>k(b - 1)^2 \\geq {\\left(\\frac{b}{b - 1}\\right)}^{k - 1}</math>. Since <math>\\frac{b}{b - 1} \\geq 1</math>, this means that there will be a maximum value <math>k</math> where <math>{\\left(\\frac{b}{b - 1}\\right)}^{k} \\leq k(b - 1)^2</math>, because of the [[Exponential function|exponential]] nature of <math>{\\left(\\frac{b}{b - 1}\\right)}^{k}</math> and the [[Linear function (calculus)|linearity]] of <math>k(b - 1)^2</math>. Beyond this value <math>k</math>, <math>F_{b}(n) \\leq n</math> always. Thus, there are a finite number of sum-product numbers,<ref name=\"planetmath\" /> and any natural number is guaranteed to reach a periodic point or a fixed point less than <math>b^{k} - 1</math>, making it a preperiodic point. \n\nThe number of iterations <math>i</math> needed for <math>F_{b}^{i}(n)</math> to reach a fixed point is the sum-product function's [[persistence of a number|persistence]] of <math>n</math>, and undefined if it never reaches a fixed point.\n\nAny integer shown to be a sum-product number in a given base must, by definition, also be a [[Harshad number]] in that base.\n\n==Sum-product numbers and cycles of ''F''<sub>''b''</sub> for specific ''b''==\nAll numbers are represented in base <math>b</math>. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
