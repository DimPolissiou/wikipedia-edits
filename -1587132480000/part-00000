Formed in New York City in 1999, the group consists of singer [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. The Strokes [[discography]] consists of six [[studio album]]s, two [[extended play]]s (EP), twelve [[single (music)|single]]s, one video album and eighteen [[music video]]s.\n\nIn January 2001, the Strokes released a [[Demo (music)|demo]] EP, ''[[The Modern Age]]'', on [[independent record label]] [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]. The large amount of hype generated by the record, especially among the British music press, led to a bidding war among [[major record label]]s.<ref>Phares, Heather. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p478260/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Strokes Biography]. [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on May 21, 2008.</ref> The band signed with [[RCA Records]], and released its debut LP ''[[Is This It]]'' in October 2001. Helped by lead single \"[[Hard to Explain]]\", the album debuted at number two in the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]] and number 33 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Highly acclaimed by critics, ''Is This It'' was certified platinum in the US and UK, selling over two million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"pitchfork\">Deusner, Stephen M. (January 3, 2006).

The album did well on the charts, reaching number two and going platinum in the UK, while peaking at the fourth spot in the US. Three singles were released from the album, the highest-charting of which was \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which reached number seven in the UK. The band's third album ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' was released in December 2005 in Germany and January 2006 elsewhere. Although critics suggested the post-Christmas release date was an indication of the band's lower expectations of the record, it was the first Strokes album to top the UK charts.<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/> \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\" became the first single by the group to break into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was its highest-charting effort in Britain, where it reached number five.\n\nReleased after a long hiatus, The Strokes' fourth album ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' (2011) became their third consecutive LP to chart at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200. Its 2013 follow-up ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' reached number ten on both the U.S. and British charts. In 2016 the Strokes released their second EP, ''[[Future Present Past]]''.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:19em;\" | Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\" | Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Sales\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13em;\" | [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-strokes/chart-history/TLP |title=The Strokes Chart History: Billboard 200 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=February 18, 2020}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br /><ref name=\"AUS\">Peaks in Australia:\n* All except noted: {{cite web| url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=The+Strokes| title=The Strokes Australia album chart history| publisher=australian-charts.com| accessdate=May 3, 2017}}\n* \"Hard to Explain\" and \"You Only Live Once\": {{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988\u20132010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.

The Strokes [[discography]] consists of six [[studio album]]s, two [[extended play]]s (EP), twelve [[single (music)|single]]s, one video album and eighteen [[music video]]s.\n\nIn January 2001, the Strokes released a [[Demo (music)|demo]] EP, ''[[The Modern Age]]'', on [[independent record label]] [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]. The large amount of hype generated by the record, especially among the British music press, led to a bidding war among [[major record label]]s.<ref>Phares, Heather.

The band's third album ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' was released in December 2005 in Germany and January 2006 elsewhere.

The station depot on Main Avenue was an Erie Type IV wooden frame depot that was shaped 24.5' x 50' x 17'. The site also included a watchman's shanty along Main Avenue and a [[Railway Express Agency]] building to the west of the station depot. The station also boasted a [[gauntlet track]], that ran from milepost 53.12 to 53.67 (track miles from [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|Cleveland]]), which ran trains at a maximum of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}.\n\nHowever, during the 1950s, congestion on South Street began, due to the short, two-lane length of the roadway, along with the disruption of freight and passenger trains along the street.

The Railway Express Agency building was demolished, and new rails were installed on the opposite side of the station depot. By 1966, the new two-track main line was in place, and the gauntlet track was being torn up. The station depot, constructed in 1884, was closed and demolished by the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]], while remaining passenger service was redirected to the freight depot on Pine Avenue, which was reformatted into a combined passenger/freight station.\n\nPassenger service to Warren on the main line was terminated on January 4, 1970, with the final passing of the [[Lake Cities (train)|''Lake Cities'']],<ref name=timetable61569>{{cite web|title=Erie Lackawanna Timetables - Effective June 15, 1969|url=http://www.jon-n-bevliles.net/RAILROAD/PTTs/el061569.pdf|work=[[Erie Lackawanna Railway]]|publisher=Erie Lackawanna Railway|accessdate=May 6, 2012|location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]]|pages=2|date=June 15, 1969}}</ref>  while service on the subdivision was terminated on January 14, 1977, by the [[Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail).\n\n== Station layout and design ==\nThe passenger station at Warren was located at the junction of South Street ([[U.S. Route 422 in Ohio|U.S. Route&nbsp;422]] / [[Ohio State Route 169|State Route 169]]) and Main Avenue in the downtown of the city of [[Warren, Ohio]]. The depot, which ran alongside Main Avenue, was an Erie Railroad Type IV (types were determined in a 1918&ndash;1920 report to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]), with dimensions of {{convert|24.5|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|50|ft|m}} long, {{convert|17|ft|m}} high. The station depot was built out of wood, similar to a nearby watchman's shanty. The station location was home to a [[Railway Express Agency]] building constructed just to the west of the passenger station. The freight station was constructed several blocks to the east, constructed out of full brick.\n\nThe station boasted two passenger tracks, along with a gauntlet track, which served from mileposts 53.12 to 53.67 (which ran alongside the depot, with track miles from the [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|station]] at [[Cleveland, Ohio]], which served as the western terminus of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Atlantic & Great Western Railroad ===\nThe alignment that the Warren station was situated at was first started in July 1853, constructing the Franklin and Warren Railroad. This railroad changed names to the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] (A&GW) two months later. After connecting to the [[Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad]] in 1856, the railroads soon became part of the same system. The new A&GW opened complete passenger service in 1864, after being connected to the rest of the [[Erie Railroad|New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad]]. After becoming the [[New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad]] (NYPANO), the railroad soon changed hands again to the [[Erie Railroad]], which took over in 1896, and after being bought out by the railroad.{{sfn|Camp|2006|p=33}}\n\nDuring this time, a new Type IV station depot was opened in Warren,<ref name=\"iccreport\">{{Cite report\n | author     = Various officials\n | date       = 1918\u201320\n | title      = Valuation Report to the Interstate Commerce Commission\n | publisher  = [[Erie Railroad]]\n | location   = [[Cleveland, Ohio]]\n | section    = \n | page       =\n}}</ref> twenty years after the inaugural service. In the early 1900s, a new brick freight station was constructed at Pine Street, further down the line. This was due to the growth of freight throughout Trumbull County, necessitating a new depot being constructed.{{sfn|Camp|2006|p=48}}\n\n=== South Street widening ===\n{{see also|U.S. Route 422 in Ohio|Ohio State Route 169}}\nIn the 1950s, traffic within Warren was beginning to because more congested, and a study was conducted in 1951 by a professor at [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]]. The study concluded that were two types of problems in the city, geographic and mixture of different kinds of traffic. Warren suffered from factors of problematic locations for the commercial core, schools, churches, industries, along with various classes of people. However, a main problem stemmed from the lack of roadways. Warren boasted an insufficient number of alternate routes through the city. South Street (US&nbsp;422 / OH&nbsp;169) had considerable problems in terms of traffic due to the fact that between Main Avenue and Pine Avenue, the Erie Railroad ran down the center of the street. The north side of the street was for moving traffic, but the southern side was purely for parking. The trains running down the track was a hazard to the pedestrians and automobiles, but otherwise posed no serious threat. In 1947, South Street recorded 12.5% of the accidents within the city of Warren, and by 1948, this had been reduced by 24%. This was due to reduction of speed limits and a city campaign to slow down.<ref name=widening1951 />\n\nThe professor proposed nine solutions to solving the issues of congestion within the city of Warren. The first proposed rerouting trucks out of the city's downtown, however it was dismissed due to the fact that the time lost in bypassing would equal time lost in congestion. Other proposals included turning Warren's downtown into a maze of one-way streets, upgrading South Street with traffic-based green lights, police supervision, radio campaigns and razing a \"slum\" neighborhood for parking. Two options however, called for the widening of streets, including South Street, which would require the upgrade along the stretch that the railroad shares between Main and Pine.<ref name=widening1951 /> \n[[File:Warren Erie Railroad station site (post-1966).jpg|left|thumb|Warren station post-1966 site in August 2012]]\nIn the later months of 1965, widening of South Street through the center of Warren began. As a result, the Railway Express Agency building next to the depot was demolished for construction of a new right-of-way on the parking side of South Street. The new right-of-way would leave South Street just east of the current depot site, which required the demolition. The first rails were placed in December 1965,{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=38}} and by January 1966, the new two track-main had been installed and put into use.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=39}} At that time, the old gauntlet track through Warren was being dismantled along South Street, which would be required to allow widening of South Street. It was at that point that the old station depot was closed by the Erie Lackawanna. The railroad did not put up proper signage for the change, deciding it was easier to scratch the notice of the station depot closing in the wood of the door. The freight depot located at the Pine Avenue crossing near South Street was renovated to allow a passenger depot area to be constructed within the building. The station depot back on South Street at Main Avenue was dismantled.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=39}}\n\n=== Closure ===\nDuring the later years of the Erie Railroad, Warren station had been served by twelve trains daily, including the ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]]''  which ran between [[Dearborn Station]] in Chicago and [[Hoboken Terminal]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], and local commuter runs from [[Youngstown (Erie Railroad station)|Youngstown]] to [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|Cleveland Union Terminal]] on the Mahoning first-subdivision.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=38}} In the late 1960s, the Erie Lackawanna was cutting several long distance trains from its schedule, including the ''[[Phoebe Snow (passenger train)|Phoebe Snow]]'' in November 1966.{{sfn|Taber|Taber|1980|p=146-148}} By June 1969, the Erie Lackawanna had applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to discontinue service of the ''Lake Cities'',<ref name=timetable61569 /> citing that is not worth the money being expedited combined with the railroad's financial status. On December 25, 1969 (Christmas Day), the ICC approved it, and the Erie Lackawanna promised to keep it running through the holiday season, with the last trains to run on January 4, 1970 out of Hoboken Terminal.<ref name=LCabandoned>{{cite news|title=Rail Line Will Abandon Chicago-Hoboken Run|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 25, 1969|location=[[New York, New York]]|pages=58}}</ref> On the evening of January 4, 1970, the last ''Lake Cities'' left Hoboken Terminal, guided by locomotive No. 826, marking the final through passenger train passing through Warren.<ref name=lc010670>{{cite news|title='Lake Cities Makes Last Run'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19700106&id=RNoxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_eQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3420,3068845|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|accessdate=May 8, 2012|date=January 6, 1970|location=[[Reading, Pennsylvania]]|pages=6}}</ref>\n[[File:Warren Erie Railroad station (pre-1966).jpg|right|thumb|The station site of the 1884&nbsp;depot, seen in August 2012]]\nAfter the discontinuing of the ''Lake Cities'', the Erie Lackawanna maintained one passenger service west of the New York Division, and that was the commuter rail line from Youngstown to Cleveland. After [[Hurricane Agnes]] destroyed a lot of the right-of-way in 1972, and a [[Marion Yard]] in [[Marion, Ohio]] rebuild did not get the approved permits in 1975, the Erie Lackawanna agreed to merge with several other companies, including [[Penn Central]] to join a new government run railroad. On April 1, 1976, the merger went into effect and became the [[Conrail|Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail).<ref>{{cite news|title=ConRail Begins an Expensive Trip|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uGkaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HikEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5770,201221&dq=conrail&hl=en|accessdate=May 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|date=April 1, 1976|agency=[[Associated Press]]|location=[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]}}</ref>\n\nConrail agreed to maintain the commuter line, but after six month test run by Conrail, the agency officially ended service from Cleveland Union Terminal to Youngstown, due to loss of money.

People crammed themselves into the three cars attached with Engine 4014, playing games, talking and having refreshments as Train&nbsp;28 left the Union Terminal at 5:24. The train made stops along the line to Youngstown including East 55th Street, Lee Road, North Randall, Solon, Geauga Lake, [[Aurora (Erie Railroad station)|Aurora]], Mantua, Jeddoe, Garrettsville&ndash;Hiram, Warren, Niles and into Youngstown. At the end of the ride in Youngstown, the train stayed for twenty minutes while the train got photographed by the railfans of the Railroad Enthusiasts. After that, the train deadheaded into [[Brier Hill]] Yard for the passenger cars to be detached, while  the locomotive, 4014, was converted for use to freight service.<ref name=endservice>{{cite news|last=Reiss|first=George R.|title=Cleveland Commuter Dies With Fanfare|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ES1JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xYMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4824,4650331&dq=cleveland+youngstown+commuter+service&hl=en|accessdate=May 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Youngstown Vindicator]]|date=January 15, 1977|location=[[Youngstown, Ohio]]|pages=1, 15}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book|last=Camp|first=Mark|title=Images of Rail: Railroad Depots of Northeast Ohio|year=2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=9780738551159|ref=harv}}\n*{{Taber-DLW-20th-1|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Yanosey|first=Robert|title=Erie Railroad Facilities (In Color)|publisher=Morning Sun Books Inc.|location=[[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]]|year=2007|volume=3|isbn=158248208X|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{commons category|Warren (Erie Railroad station)}}\n\n[[Category:Former Erie Railroad stations]]\n[[Category:Trumbull County, Ohio]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|former station for the Erie Railroad}}\n{{Infobox station\n | name=WARREN\n | style=Erie Railroad\n | image=Train Depot, Warren Ohio, circa 1960s.jpg\n | image_caption=The 1884 station depot in Warren, Ohio as seen in the 1965, a few years before demolition. \n | address=South Street ([[U.S. Route 422 in Ohio|US&nbsp;422]] / [[Ohio State Route 169|OH&nbsp;169]]) at Main Avenue, [[Warren, Ohio]] 44483 (before 1966)<hr>Pine Avenue, Warren, Ohio 44483 (after 1966)\n | coordinates=\n | line=Main Line (Mahoning Division)<br>Mahoning Division First Sub-Division\n | other=\n | platform=1 side platform\n | levels=\n | tracks=2\n | parking=\n | bicycle=\n | opened={{start date and age|1864}}\n | closed={{start date and age|January 14, 1977}}\n | rebuilt={{start date and age|1884}}<br>{{start date and age|1966}}\n | electrified=Not electrified\n | ADA=\n | code=5315 (Main Line)<br>5565 (Subdivision)<ref name=\"codes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jon-n-bevliles.net/RAILROAD/erie_docs/erie-losn16.html|title=List of Station Names and Numbers|date=May 1, 1916|publisher=[[Erie Railroad]]|work=Baggage Department|location=[[Jersey City, New Jersey]]|accessdate=May 6, 2012}}</ref>\n | owned=[[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] (1864&ndash;1880)<hr>[[New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad]] (1880&ndash;1905)<hr>[[Erie Railroad]] (1905&ndash;1960)<hr>[[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]] (1960&ndash;1976)<hr>[[Conrail]] (1976&ndash;1977)\n | former=\n | services=\n | other_services_header = Former services\n | other_services = {{Adjacent stations|system2=Erie Railroad\n|line2=Main Line|left2=Barberton|right2=Cambridge Springs\n|line3=Main Line|left3=Leavittsburg|right3=Niles\n|line4=Cleveland-Youngstown|left4=Leavittsburg|right4=Niles\n}}\n | mpassengers=\n}}\n\n'''Warren''' was a former station for the [[Erie Railroad]] on its main line (Mahoning Division) and on the Mahoning Division's first subdivision between [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|Cleveland]] and [[Pymatuning (Erie Railroad station)|Pymatuning station]].

The station depot, constructed in 1884, was closed and demolished by the [[Erie Lackawanna Railroad]], while remaining passenger service was redirected to the freight depot on Pine Avenue, which was reformatted into a combined passenger/freight station.\n\nPassenger service to Warren on the main line was terminated on January 4, 1970, with the final passing of the [[Lake Cities (train)|''Lake Cities'']],<ref name=timetable61569>{{cite web|title=Erie Lackawanna Timetables - Effective June 15, 1969|url=http://www.jon-n-bevliles.net/RAILROAD/PTTs/el061569.pdf|work=[[Erie Lackawanna Railway]]|publisher=Erie Lackawanna Railway|accessdate=May 6, 2012|location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]]|pages=2|date=June 15, 1969}}</ref>  while service on the subdivision was terminated on January 14, 1977 by the [[Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail).\n\n== Station layout and design ==\nThe passenger station at Warren was located at the junction of South Street ([[U.S. Route 422 in Ohio|U.S. Route&nbsp;422]] / [[Ohio State Route 169|State Route 169]]) and Main Avenue in the downtown of the city of [[Warren, Ohio]]. The depot, which ran alongside Main Avenue, was an Erie Railroad Type IV (types were determined in a 1918&ndash;1920 report to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]), with dimensions of {{convert|24.5|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|50|ft|m}} long, {{convert|17|ft|m}} high. The station depot was built out of wood, similar to a nearby watchman's shanty. The station location was home to a [[Railway Express Agency]] building constructed just to the west of the passenger station. The freight station was constructed several blocks to the east, constructed out of full brick.\n\nThe station boasted two passenger tracks, along with a gauntlet track, which served from mileposts 53.12 to 53.67 (which ran alongside the depot, with track miles from the [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|station]] at [[Cleveland, Ohio]], which served as the western terminus of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Atlantic & Great Western Railroad ===\nThe alignment that the Warren station was situated at was first started in July 1853, constructing the Franklin and Warren Railroad. This railroad changed names to the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] (A&GW) two months later. After connecting to the [[Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad]] in 1856, the railroads soon became part of the same system. The new A&GW opened complete passenger service in 1864, after being connected to the rest of the [[Erie Railroad|New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad]]. After becoming the [[New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad]] (NYPANO), the railroad soon changed hands again to the [[Erie Railroad]], which took over in 1896, and after being bought out by the railroad.{{sfn|Camp|2006|p=33}}\n\nDuring this time, a new Type IV station depot was opened in Warren,<ref name=\"iccreport\">{{Cite report\n | author     = Various officials\n | date       = 1918\u201320\n | title      = Valuation Report to the Interstate Commerce Commission\n | publisher  = [[Erie Railroad]]\n | location   = [[Cleveland, Ohio]]\n | section    = \n | page       =\n}}</ref> twenty years after the inaugural service. In the early 1900s, a new brick freight station was constructed at Pine Street, further down the line. This was due to the growth of freight throughout Trumbull County, necessitating a new depot being constructed.{{sfn|Camp|2006|p=48}}\n\n=== South Street widening ===\n{{see also|U.S. Route 422 in Ohio|Ohio State Route 169}}\nIn the 1950s, traffic within Warren was beginning to because more congested, and a study was conducted in 1951 by a professor at [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]]. The study concluded that were two types of problems in the city, geographic and mixture of different kinds of traffic. Warren suffered from factors of problematic locations for the commercial core, schools, churches, industries, along with various classes of people. However, a main problem stemmed from the lack of roadways. Warren boasted an insufficient number of alternate routes through the city. South Street (US&nbsp;422 / OH&nbsp;169) had considerable problems in terms of traffic due to the fact that between Main Avenue and Pine Avenue, the Erie Railroad ran down the center of the street. The north side of the street was for moving traffic, but the southern side was purely for parking. The trains running down the track was a hazard to the pedestrians and automobiles, but otherwise posed no serious threat. In 1947, South Street recorded 12.5% of the accidents within the city of Warren, and by 1948, this had been reduced by 24%. This was due to reduction of speed limits and a city campaign to slow down.<ref name=widening1951 />\n\nThe professor proposed nine solutions to solving the issues of congestion within the city of Warren. The first proposed rerouting trucks out of the city's downtown, however it was dismissed due to the fact that the time lost in bypassing would equal time lost in congestion. Other proposals included turning Warren's downtown into a maze of one-way streets, upgrading South Street with traffic-based green lights, police supervision, radio campaigns and razing a \"slum\" neighborhood for parking. Two options however, called for the widening of streets, including South Street, which would require the upgrade along the stretch that the railroad shares between Main and Pine.<ref name=widening1951 /> \n[[File:Warren Erie Railroad station site (post-1966).jpg|left|thumb|Warren station post-1966 site in August 2012]]\nIn the later months of 1965, widening of South Street through the center of Warren began. As a result, the Railway Express Agency building next to the depot was demolished for construction of a new right-of-way on the parking side of South Street. The new right-of-way would leave South Street just east of the current depot site, which required the demolition. The first rails were placed in December 1965,{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=38}} and by January 1966, the new two track-main had been installed and put into use.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=39}} At that time, the old gauntlet track through Warren was being dismantled along South Street, which would be required to allow widening of South Street. It was at that point that the old station depot was closed by the Erie Lackawanna. The railroad did not put up proper signage for the change, deciding it was easier to scratch the notice of the station depot closing in the wood of the door. The freight depot located at the Pine Avenue crossing near South Street was renovated to allow a passenger depot area to be constructed within the building. The station depot back on South Street at Main Avenue was dismantled.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=39}}\n\n=== Closure ===\nDuring the later years of the Erie Railroad, Warren station had been served by twelve trains daily, including the ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]]''  which ran between [[Dearborn Station]] in Chicago and [[Hoboken Terminal]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], and local commuter runs from [[Youngstown (Erie Railroad station)|Youngstown]] to [[Cleveland (Erie Railroad station)|Cleveland Union Terminal]] on the Mahoning first-subdivision.{{sfn|Yanosey|2007|p=38}} In the late 1960s, the Erie Lackawanna was cutting several long distance trains from its schedule, including the ''[[Phoebe Snow (passenger train)|Phoebe Snow]]'' in November 1966.{{sfn|Taber|Taber|1980|p=146-148}} By June 1969, the Erie Lackawanna had applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to discontinue service of the ''Lake Cities'',<ref name=timetable61569 /> citing that is not worth the money being expedited combined with the railroad's financial status.

After [[Hurricane Agnes]] destroyed a lot of the right-of-way in 1972, and a [[Marion Yard]] in [[Marion, Ohio]] rebuild did not get the approved permits in 1975, the Erie Lackawanna agreed to merge with several other companies, including [[Penn Central]] to join a new government run railroad. On April 1, 1976, the merger went into effect and became the [[Conrail|Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail).<ref>{{cite news|title=ConRail Begins an Expensive Trip|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uGkaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HikEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5770,201221&dq=conrail&hl=en|accessdate=May 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]|date=April 1, 1976|agency=[[Associated Press]]|location=[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]}}</ref>\n\nConrail agreed to maintain the commuter line, but after six month test run by Conrail, the agency officially ended service from Cleveland Union Terminal to Youngstown, due to loss of money.

The train made stops along the line to Youngstown including East 55th Street, Lee Road, North Randall, Solon, Geauga Lake, [[Aurora (Erie Railroad station)|Aurora]], Mantua, Jeddoe, Garrettsville&ndash;Hiram, Warren, Niles and into Youngstown. At the end of the ride in Youngstown, the train stayed for twenty minutes while the train got photographed by the railfans of the Railroad Enthusiasts. After that, the train deadheaded into [[Brier Hill]] Yard for the passenger cars to be detached, while  the locomotive, 4014, was converted for use to freight service.<ref name=endservice>{{cite news|last=Reiss|first=George R.|title=Cleveland Commuter Dies With Fanfare|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ES1JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xYMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4824,4650331&dq=cleveland+youngstown+commuter+service&hl=en|accessdate=May 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Youngstown Vindicator]]|date=January 15, 1977|location=[[Youngstown, Ohio]]|pages=1, 15}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book|last=Camp|first=Mark|title=Images of Rail: Railroad Depots of Northeast Ohio|year=2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=9780738551159|ref=harv}}\n*{{Taber-DLW-20th-1|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Yanosey|first=Robert|title=Erie Railroad Facilities (In Color)|publisher=Morning Sun Books Inc.|location=[[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]]|year=2007|volume=3|isbn=158248208X|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{commons category|Warren (Erie Railroad station)}}\n\n[[Category:Former Erie Railroad stations]]\n[[Category:Trumbull County, Ohio]]\n", "name_user": "Slambo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:MOS:DATECOMMAfix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_station_(Erie_Railroad)"}

The club has held [[first-class cricket|first-class status]] since it was founded in 1864. Lancashire's home is [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]], although the team also play matches at other grounds around the county. Lancashire was a founder member of the [[County Championship]] in 1890 and have won the competition nine times, most recently in 2011. The club's limited overs team is called '''Lancashire Lightning'''.\n\nLancashire were widely recognised as the [[Champion County]] four times between 1879 and 1889. They won their first two County Championship titles in the [[1897 English cricket season|1897]] and [[1904 English cricket season|1904 seasons]]. Between 1926 and 1934, they won the championship five times. Throughout most of the inter-war period, Lancashire and their neighbours [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] had the best two teams in England and the [[Roses Match]]es between them were usually the highlight of the domestic season. In 1950, Lancashire shared the title with [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. The County Championship was restructured [[2000 English cricket season|in 2000]] with Lancashire in the first division. They won the [[2011 County Championship]], a gap of 77 years since the club's last outright title in 1934. \n\nIn 1895, [[Archie MacLaren]] scored 424 in an innings for Lancashire, which remains the highest score by an Englishman in first-class cricket. [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], whose career lasted from 1879 to 1900, was the first player to score 10,000&nbsp;runs and take 1,000&nbsp;wickets for Lancashire. [[Ernest Tyldesley]], younger brother of [[Johnny Tyldesley]], is the club's leading run-scorer with 34,222&nbsp;runs in 573&nbsp;matches for Lancashire between 1909 and 1936. Fast bowler [[Brian Statham]] took a club record 1,816&nbsp;wickets in 430&nbsp;first-class matches between 1950 and 1968.

Thirteen local clubs were represented: Broughton, Longsight, Manchester and Western from the Manchester area; Huyton, Liverpool and Northern from Merseyside; Accrington, Ashton, Blackburn, Oldham, Whalley and Wigan from other towns. Lancashire County Cricket Club was founded with the object of, it was said, \"spreading a thorough knowledge and appreciation of the game throughout Lancashire\".<ref name=\"LCCCearly\"/> It was intended to stage home matches alternately at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], [[Aigburth Cricket Ground, Liverpool|Aigburth]], Preston, Blackburn and at \"other places to help introduce good cricket throughout the county\".<ref name=\"LCCCearly\">[https://cricket.lancashirecricket.co.uk/club/history-of-the-club/the-early-years/ LCCC: The Early Years (1864&ndash;1883)].

During the early 1870s, the team was dominated by [[A. N. Hornby]]\u2019s batting. The team's standard of cricket improved with the arrival of two professional players, [[Dick Barlow]] and [[Alexander Watson (cricketer, born 1844)|Alex Watson]]. The impact of Barlow and Hornby was such that their batting partnership was immortalised in the poem ''At Lord\u2019s '' by [[Francis Thompson]]. The team was further enhanced by [[A. G. Steel]], an amateur sometimes considered second only to [[W. G. Grace]] as the country's best all rounder; [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], a professional from [[Sutton-in-Ashfield]] and the only player to score 10,000&nbsp;runs and take 1,000&nbsp;wickets for Lancashire; and [[wicket-keeper]] [[Dick Pilling]], who in 1891 was rated by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' as the second-best wicket-keeper in the world behind [[Jack Blackham]]. As Lancashire's consistency improved, so did their support: in 1878, 28,000 over three days watched Lancashire play [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]].<ref name=\"Early Years\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lccc.co.uk/index.php?p=news&id=28 |title=LCCC Early Years 1865\u20131879 |publisher=Lancashire CCC.co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925062651/http://lccc.co.uk/index.php?p=news&id=28 |archivedate=25 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 20&nbsp;October 2007.</ref>\n\nThe club's first success came in 1879, when the majority of the cricket press&nbsp;\u2013 except for Wisden&nbsp;\u2013 agreed that Lancashire and [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] were joint champions.

Lancashire won its second championship title in 1904, going undefeated throughout the season; Wisden described the season as \u201cthe brightest in the history of Lancashire cricket\u201d. That season, [[James Hallows]] completed the feat of 1,000&nbsp;runs and 100&nbsp;wickets in the season. During the late 1900s and early 1910s, players such as [[Walter Brearley]], [[Harry Dean (cricketer)|Harry Dean]], and Bill Huddleston were the mainstays of Lancashire bowling. The club began to experience financial problems during this same period; the increased popularity of other sports was blamed for the dip in attendances.

In 1947 Cyril Washbrook and [[Winston Place]] both scored over 2,500&nbsp;runs and scored 19&nbsp;centuries between them.

Lancashire came close to reclaiming the county championship in 1960 under a new captain, [[Bob Barber (cricketer)|Bob Barber]]. Five batsmen scored more than 1,000&nbsp;runs in the season, and Statham, Higgs and Greenhough all took over 100&nbsp;wickets; Lancashire finished runner up due to a poor run of form towards the end of the season: losing four and drawing two of the last six matches after topping the table in August. The following year, however, Lancashire dropped to 13th, due in part to Barber's inexperience and Statham's and Geoff Pullar's England commitments. Things declined further in 1962, under the leadership of [[Joe Blackledge]], who had had no previous first-class experience, as Lancashire dropped to second last, winning only two matches.

[[Farokh Engineer]] joined Lancashire in 1968, and [[Clive Lloyd]] joined in 1969; together Lloyd and Engineer helped establish Lancashire as one of the best one day sides in England.

Towards the end of the 1980s, Lancashire's side began to develop, with [[Graeme Fowler]] and [[Gehan Mendis]] building a productive opening partnership, while David Hughes and [[Neil Fairbrother]] provided support in the middle order.

This was the first time any county had won both competitions in the same year; Lancashire narrowly missed out on a treble, finishing runners-up in the Sunday League. Lancashire's consistency continued, and the team finished second in the Sunday League and B&H Cup. Paul Allott and Graeme Fowler were released at the end of the 1992 season. The team lost the B&H final to [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] in 1993. In 1994, young bowlers [[Peter Martin (cricketer)|Peter Martin]] and [[Glen Chapple]] took 50&nbsp;wickets each. The batting too looked promising, with [[John Crawley]] scoring two double centuries and [[Jason Gallian]] steadily improving. In 1995, Lancashire again won the Benson & Hedges Cup.

in [[Cricket in England|English cricket]]. The club has held [[first-class cricket|first-class status]] since it was founded in 1864. Lancashire's home is [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]], although the team also play matches at other grounds around the county. Lancashire was a founder member of the [[County Championship]] in 1890 and have won the competition nine times, most recently in 2011. The club's limited overs team is called '''Lancashire Lightning'''.\n\nLancashire were widely recognised as the [[Champion County]] four times between 1879 and 1889. They won their first two County Championship titles in the [[1897 English cricket season|1897]] and [[1904 English cricket season|1904 seasons]]. Between 1926 and 1934, they won the championship five times. Throughout most of the inter-war period, Lancashire and their neighbours [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] had the best two teams in England and the [[Roses Match]]es between them were usually the highlight of the domestic season. In 1950, Lancashire shared the title with [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. The County Championship was restructured [[2000 English cricket season|in 2000]] with Lancashire in the first division.

[[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], whose career lasted from 1879 to 1900, was the first player to score 10,000&nbsp;runs and take 1,000&nbsp;wickets for Lancashire.

Thirteen local clubs were represented: Broughton, Longsight, Manchester and Western from the Manchester area; Huyton, Liverpool and Northern from Merseyside; Accrington, Ashton, Blackburn, Oldham, Whalley and Wigan from other towns. Lancashire County Cricket Club was founded with the object of, it was said, \"spreading a thorough knowledge and appreciation of the game throughout Lancashire\".<ref name=\"LCCCearly\"/> It was intended to stage home matches alternately at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], [[Aigburth Cricket Ground, Liverpool|Aigburth]], Preston, Blackburn and at \"other places to help introduce good cricket throughout the county\".<ref name=\"LCCCearly\">[https://cricket.lancashirecricket.co.uk/club/history-of-the-club/the-early-years/ LCCC: The Early Years (1864&ndash;1883)].

During the early 1870s, the team was dominated by [[A. N. Hornby]]\u2019s batting. The team's standard of cricket improved with the arrival of two professional players, [[Dick Barlow]] and [[Alexander Watson (cricketer, born 1844)|Alex Watson]]. The impact of Barlow and Hornby was such that their batting partnership was immortalised in the poem ''At Lord\u2019s '' by [[Francis Thompson]]. The team was further enhanced by [[A. G. Steel]], an amateur sometimes considered second only to [[W. G. Grace]] as the country's best all rounder; [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], a professional from [[Sutton-in-Ashfield]] and the only player to score 10,000&nbsp;runs and take 1,000&nbsp;wickets for Lancashire; and [[wicket-keeper]] [[Dick Pilling]], who in 1891 was rated by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' as the second-best wicket-keeper in the world behind [[Jack Blackham]]. As Lancashire's consistency improved, so did their support: in 1878, 28,000 over three days watched Lancashire play [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]].<ref name=\"Early Years\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lccc.co.uk/index.php?p=news&id=28 |title=LCCC Early Years 1865\u20131879 |publisher=Lancashire CCC.co.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925062651/http://lccc.co.uk/index.php?p=news&id=28 |archivedate=25 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 20&nbsp;October 2007.</ref>\n\nThe club's first success came in 1879, when the majority of the cricket press&nbsp;\u2013 except for Wisden&nbsp;\u2013 agreed that Lancashire and [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] were joint champions.

Lancashire won its second championship title in 1904, going undefeated throughout the season; Wisden described the season as \u201cthe brightest in the history of Lancashire cricket\u201d. That season, [[James Hallows]] completed the feat of 1,000&nbsp;runs and 100&nbsp;wickets in the season. During the late 1900s and early 1910s, players such as [[Walter Brearley]], [[Harry Dean (cricketer)|Harry Dean]], and Bill Huddleston were the mainstays of Lancashire bowling. The club began to experience financial problems during this same period; the increased popularity of other sports was blamed for the dip in attendances.

Lancashire came close to reclaiming the county championship in 1960 under a new captain, [[Bob Barber (cricketer)|Bob Barber]]. Five batsmen scored more than 1,000&nbsp;runs in the season, and Statham, Higgs and Greenhough all took over 100&nbsp;wickets; Lancashire finished runner up due to a poor run of form towards the end of the season: losing four and drawing two of the last six matches after topping the table in August. The following year, however, Lancashire dropped to 13th, due in part to Barber's inexperience and Statham's and Geoff Pullar's England commitments. Things declined further in 1962, under the leadership of [[Joe Blackledge]], who had had no previous first-class experience, as Lancashire dropped to second last, winning only two matches.

Towards the end of the 1980s, Lancashire's side began to develop, with [[Graeme Fowler]] and [[Gehan Mendis]] building a productive opening partnership, while David Hughes and [[Neil Fairbrother]] provided support in the middle order.

This was the first time any county had won both competitions in the same year; Lancashire narrowly missed out on a treble, finishing runners-up in the Sunday League. Lancashire's consistency continued, and the team finished second in the Sunday League and B&H Cup. Paul Allott and Graeme Fowler were released at the end of the 1992 season. The team lost the B&H final to [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] in 1993. In 1994, young bowlers [[Peter Martin (cricketer)|Peter Martin]] and [[Glen Chapple]] took 50&nbsp;wickets each.
