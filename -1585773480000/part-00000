{"title_page": "The Forest Minstrel", "text_new": "'''The Forest Minstrel''' (1810) is an anthology of 83 songs, assembled by  [[James Hogg]], divided into four sections: 'Pathetic Songs', 'Love Songs', 'Humorous Songs', and 'National Songs'. Hogg himself is the author of 56 items. There are also 15 by [[Thomas Mounsey Cunningham]], 5 by [[John Grieve]], 3 by [[William Laidlaw]], 3 by [[James Gray]], and one perhaps by [[John Ballantyne (publisher)|John Ballantyne]].\n\n==Background==\nIn February 1810 Hogg exchanged life as a shepherd in the south of Scotland to pursue a literary career in Edinburgh. Within weeks of his arrival he persuaded [[Archibald Constable]] to publish ''The Forest Minstrel''. The words 'Printed for the Editor' on the title-page suggest that the publication involved a degree of authorial subsidy.<ref> Gillian Hughes, ''James Hogg: A Life'' (Edinburgh, 2007), 89.</ref> Of the 56 songs by Hogg himself nearly one-third had appeared in ''[[The Scots Magazine]]'' between 1803 and 1808.<ref>Of the 15 pieces by Cunningham at least 14 had also appeared in ''The Scots Magazine'': James Hogg, ''The Forest Minstrel'', ed. P. D. Garside and Richard D. Jackson (Edinburgh, 2006), xlii.</ref> Most of these were revised for the new publication, with a tendency to tone down their rural localism, colloquialism, and earthiness to make them more acceptable for polite readers and performers: '''The Forest Minstrel'' is meant for the young lady at her piano'.<ref>Hughes, ''op. cit.'', 90.</ref> \n\n==Editions==\nUntil 2006 the only edition of ''The Forest Minstrel'' as a collected set of songs was that published in Edinburgh on 4 August 1810<ref>Garside and Jackson, ''op. cit.'', xlvii</ref> by Archibald Constable and Co. with the title ''The Forest Minstrel; A Selection of Songs, adapted to the most favourite Scottish airs. Few of them ever before published. By James Hogg The Ettrick Shepherd, and others.''

It was a field in which \"the physicist has so far played little part\" and in which the practitioner \"gropes dimly in the fog\" relying mostly on empirical methods supplemented by elementary [[trigonometry]] and algebra that tended to give a deceptive authority to what was often little more than educated guesswork.

It was a field in which \"the physicist has so far played little part\" and in which the practitioner \"gropes dimly in the fog\" relying mostly on empirical methods supplemented by elementary [[trigonometry]] and algebra that tended to give a deceptive authority to what was often little more than educated guesswork. By the time of the third edition of ''Gears'' in 1954, knowledge had moved on somewhat but Merritt was obliged to admit that empiricism still ruled and \"the behaviour of mating tooth surfaces and their lubricant still awaits a full understanding.\"<ref>Merritt, H.
