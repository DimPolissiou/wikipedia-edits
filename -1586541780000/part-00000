Many white Southerners who came to California during the [[Gold Rush]] brought with them racist attitudes and ideals. In 1850, there were twelve black people registered as residents of Los Angeles. Because many blacks were enslaved until abolition in 1865, few blacks migrated to Los Angeles before then. Due to the construction of the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] and a settlement increase in 1880, increasing numbers of blacks came to Los Angeles.

The folds have developed [[cleavage (geology)|cleavage]] in the [[slate]] and in the [[siltstone]]s and [[sandstone]]s, although it is more widely spaced throughout the silt and sandstones. To the south, the cleavage dips at moderate low angles and the [[stratum|strata]], which become overturned in places, dip steeply. The original direction of the strata can be established using the graded and cross-bedding of sedimentary structures. It demonstrates that the section is situated on the overturned, steep or northern limb of the Dartmouth [[Anticline|Antiform]], which can be traced from [[Newquay]] to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].<ref name=\"en\"/> This is evidence a period of tectonic plate collision between 330 and 300 million years ago, which exerted pressure on the rock.<ref name=\"devon\"/> Folds of three generations with cleavages are visible through the section in Bovisand Bay. Generally, the first generation folds have gently southern dipping limbs which are overturned or steep. The cleavage consistently dips about 40 degrees south.

To the south, the cleavage dips at moderate low angles and the [[stratum|strata]], which become overturned in places, dip steeply. The original direction of the strata can be established using the graded and cross-bedding of sedimentary structures. It demonstrates that the section is situated on the overturned, steep or northern limb of the Dartmouth [[Anticline|Antiform]], which can be traced from [[Newquay]] to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].<ref name=\"en\"/> This is evidence a period of tectonic plate collision between 330 and 300 million years ago, which exerted pressure on the rock.<ref name=\"devon\"/> Folds of three generations with cleavages are visible through the section in Bovisand Bay.

The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, performed by the characters with original choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Any speculation about the character's species will be removed. -->\n* Uniqua is a curious, self-confident, and high-spirited, pink, spotted character. The series uses the name \"Uniqua\" for both the character and her species. She wears pink, polka-dotted [[overalls]] and has a pair of swirled [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] on top of her head. Uniqua is sweet and friendly, though her strong opinions and occasional stubbornness get in the way of her relationships. While imagining herself having the roles that require brains and fortitude (such as a scientist or pirate captain) and despite her love of books (as seen in episodes such as \"The Masked Retriever\"). Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow worm. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, performed by the characters with original choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Any speculation about the character's species will be removed. -->\n* Uniqua is a curious, self-confident, and high-spirited, pink, spotted character. The series uses the name \"Uniqua\" for both the character and her species. She wears pink, polka-dotted [[overalls]] and has a pair of swirled [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] on top of her head. Uniqua is sweet and friendly, though her strong opinions and occasional stubbornness get in the way of her relationships. While imagining herself having the roles that require brains and fortitude (such as a scientist or pirate captain) and despite her love of books (as seen in episodes such as \"The Masked Retriever\"). Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow worm. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

The team adopted the name '''The Revival''' in 2016, referencing \"reviving\" the classic tag team wrestling style of the 1980s, which has led to the two being compared favorably to [[The Brain Busters]] ([[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]])\u2014one of the top teams of the 1980s. The team uses the phrase \"No flips, just fists\" to convey their more traditional, mat based in-ring style in contrast to the more high flying style of some contemporary teams.\n\n==History==\n\n===WWE===\n====NXT debut (2014\u20132015)====\nIn 2014, after returning from injury, [[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] teamed up with a debuting [[Dash Wilder]] with the two performing extensively at [[House show|live events]] under the [[ring name]] The Mechanics. The two made their debut on the July 17, 2014, episode of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'', losing to [[Bull Dempsey]] and [[Mojo Rawley]]. They made only one further televised appearance in 2014, losing to [[Enzo and Cass|Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady]] on the October 23 episode of ''NXT'', but continued to wrestle extensively at live events.\n\nThe duo resurfaced and picked up their first televised win on the July 29, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', defeating Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady. At [[NXT TakeOver: Respect]], The Mechanics were defeated in the semi-finals of the ''[[Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic]]'' by eventual winners [[Finn B\u00e1lor]] and [[Samoa Joe]]. In the following weeks, the team name was changed to \"Dash and Dawson\". On the October 28 episode of ''NXT'', Dash and Dawson would attack Amore and Cassady before their match, completely laying out Amore while decimating Cass' knee, leaving him unable to compete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/node/28113820/wwe-nxt-results-2015-10-28-28119619|title=WWE NXT: October 28, 2015 | website=WWE}}</ref> \n\n====NXT Tag Team Champions (2015\u20132017)====\n[[File:The Revival - 2016-09-17 - 01.jpg|thumb|left|The Revival (Scott Dawson on the left, Dash Wilder on the right), as [[NXT Tag Team Championship|NXT Tag Team Champions]] in 2016]]\nDue to an earlier non-title victory over [[NXT Tag Team Championship|NXT Tag Team Champions]] [[The Vaudevillains]], Dash and Dawson earned a title match on the November 11 episode of ''NXT'', and won the match to become the NXT Tag Team Champions for the first time.<ref name=NXTTag1>{{cite web | last=Twiss | first=Andrew | title=Complete WWE NX spoilers from Full Sail University  | url=http://pwinsider.com/article/97378/complete-wwe-nxt-spoilers-from-full-sail-university.html | website=PWInsider.com | accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref> They made their first successful title defense two weeks later, defeating The Vaudevillians in a rematch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/node/28188540/wwe-nxt-results-2015-11-11-28192814|title=WWE NXT: November 11, 2015|website=WWE}}</ref> Afterwards, they successfully defended their titles against Amore and Cassady at [[NXT TakeOver: London]].
