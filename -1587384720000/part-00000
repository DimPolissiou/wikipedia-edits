That was the same day as other [[2019 United Kingdom local elections|United Kingdom local elections]] in order to elect members of [[Wokingham (borough)|Wokingham]] [[Unitary authority|Unitary]] Council in [[Berkshire]], England.

Richard Dolinski resigned from the Conservative Party to sit as an independent as a result of an internal vote of no confidence being put forward and subsequently passed against Cllr Charlotte Haitham-Taylor which led to her resignation as the Leader of the Council<ref>https://www.inyourarea.co.uk/news/wokingham-councillor-resigns-as-tories-turmoil-continues/</ref>\n\nThe composition of the

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nHe was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal Quebec]].  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.  Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at [[Library and Archives Canada]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Lowell|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Death_in_October.html?id=vDEJuHHU0GUC&redir_esc=y|title=Death in October|date=|publisher=eBookIt.com|year=|isbn=978-1-4566-1102-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted ''The Lowell Green Show'' until his official retirement on 4 January 2016.  He continued contributing to the station's weekly ''midday program News and Views with Rob Snow'' until a [[Bell Media]] restructuring in mid-November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/im-not-mad-im-not-bitter-host-rob-snow-let-go-from-cfra/|title=Host Rob Snow let go from CFRA|last=|first=|date=|website=ottawacitizen.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>  On occasion, he can be heard calling into ''The Rob Snow Show'', now airing on [[CIWW]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/rob-snow-to-host-new-show-on-1310-news-in-2020/|title=Rob Snow to host new show on 1310 NEWS in 2020|last=|first=|date=|website=ottawacitizen.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 December 2019, in an emotional farewell, Lowell Green ended his sixty-year career on CFRA with the following final words:<blockquote>\u201c''I believe, that we all have a responsibility, more than that, we have a duty, to do whatever we can, in whatever fashion we can, to make a better world for our children.\u00a0 And CFRA Nation, you have done your duty, and I hope and pray that you'll continue to do so.

There were so many bottles and containers of polluted water shipped, [[Canada Post]] objected and stopped accepting them.  According to Green, the uproar led to the creation of the [[Rideau Valley Conservation Authority]] and the clean-up of both the Rideau River and the [[Ottawa River]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWith his 1967 S''ave The Centennial Flame'' Campaign, a month of relentless broadcasts, and over three-thousand petitions from listeners, the iconic [[Centennial Flame]] remains and continues to shine on [[Parliament Hill]].<ref name=\":1\" />   \n\nIn 1975, after the school shooting that occurred at the [[St. Pius X High School (Ottawa)|St. Pius X High School]] in Ottawa, Lowell Green and thousands of his supporters joined his ''Fire Arms Safety Association''.  It lobbied and petitioned [[Parliament of Canada|Members of Parliament]], while he appeared before parliamentary and senate committees tasked with the process of making policy and enacting new gun law legislation in Canada.<ref name=\":3\" />  In order to encourage Quebecers to vote \"No\" in the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 Quebec Independence referendum]], he promoted and helped organize a political [[Unity Rally|''Unity Rally'']] which was held in [[Place du Canada]] in Montreal Quebec.<ref name=\":0\">[[Talk:Lowell Green#your lowell green story is badly outdated and totally negative.|Lowell Green:Talk | Lowell Green responds on 16 October 2017]]</ref>\n\nAlong with the [[Operation Come Home|Reverend Norman Johnston]], he founded the Ottawa chapter of the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada|''Big Brothers'']] and was founder of the ''Help Santa Toy Parade'' in Ottawa.  He has contributed to ongoing efforts to help modernize and renovate the ''Saint Vincent Hospital'' and the ''\u00c9lisabeth Bruy\u00e8re Hospital'' in Ottawa.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC).

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nHe was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal Quebec]].  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.  Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at [[Library and Archives Canada]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Lowell|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Death_in_October.html?id=vDEJuHHU0GUC&redir_esc=y|title=Death in October|date=|publisher=eBookIt.com|year=|isbn=978-1-4566-1102-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted ''The Lowell Green Show'' until his official retirement on 4 January 2016.

There were so many bottles and containers of polluted water that [[Canada Post]] objected and did not want to deliver them all.  According to Green, the uproar led to the creation of the [[Rideau Valley Conservation Authority]] and the clean-up of both the Rideau River and the [[Ottawa River]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWith his 1967 S''ave The Centennial Flame'' Campaign, a month of relentless broadcasts, and over three-thousand petitions from listeners, the iconic [[Centennial Flame]] continues to shine on [[Parliament Hill]].<ref name=\":1\" />   \n\nIn 1975, after the school shooting that occurred at the [[St. Pius X High School (Ottawa)|St. Pius X High School]] in Ottawa, Lowell Green and thousands of his supporters joined his ''Fire Arms Safety Association''.

He became increasingly disturbed by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]], which began in 1936. He was also fearful for his own life, having noted the murder in Switzerland of [[Ignace Reiss]], a high-ranking Soviet spy who had broken with Stalin, and the disappearance of Chambers's friend and fellow spy [[Juliet Stuart Poyntz]] in the United States. Poyntz had vanished in 1937, shortly after she had visited Moscow and returned disillusioned with the Communist cause due to the Stalinist Purges.<ref>\n{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nChambers ignored several orders that he travel to Moscow, worried that he might be \"purged.\" He also started concealing some of the documents he collected from his sources.

Berle]]. Levine had introduced Chambers to [[Walter Krivitsky]], who was already informing American and British authorities about Soviet agents who held posts in both governments. Krivitsky told Chambers it was their duty to inform.  Chambers agreed to reveal what he knew on the condition of immunity from prosecution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weinstein|1997|p=292}}</ref> During the meeting, which took place at Berle's home, [[Woodley Mansion]] in Washington, Chambers named 18 current and former government employees as spies or Communist sympathizers. Many names mentioned held relatively minor posts or were already under suspicion. Some names, however, were more significant and surprising: Alger Hiss, his brother Donald Hiss, and Laurence Duggan\u2014who were all respected, mid-level officials in the State Department\u2014and [[Lauchlin Currie]], a special assistant to [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Another person named had worked on a top secret bombsight project at the [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nBerle found Chambers' information tentative, unclear, and uncorroborated. He took the information to the White House, but the President dismissed it, to which Berle made little if any objection.

In February 1941, Krivitsky was found dead in his hotel room. While police ruled the death a suicide, it was widely speculated that Krivitsky had been killed by Soviet intelligence. Worried that the Soviets might try to kill Chambers too, Berle again told the FBI about his interview with Chambers. The FBI interviewed Chambers in May 1942 and June 1945, but took no immediate action, in line with the political orientation of the United States, which viewed the potential threat from the [[USSR]] as minor, when compared to that of [[Nazi Germany]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Only in November 1945, when [[Elizabeth Bentley]] defected and corroborated much of Chambers's story, did the FBI begin to take Chambers seriously.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Olmsted\n  | first = Kathryn S.\n  | title = Red Spy Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth Bentley\n  | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press\n  | year = 2002\n  | page = 32\n  | isbn = 0-8078-2739-8}}</ref>\n\n===''Time''===\n[[File:Clare Boothe Luce and Henry Luce NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Luce]] and [[Clare Boothe Luce]] (here circa 1954) valued Chambers's writing]]\n\nBy the time of the Berle meeting, Chambers had come out of hiding after a year and joined the staff of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (April 1939).

There he gave the names of individuals he said were part of the underground \"[[Ware group]]\" in the late 1930s, including [[Alger Hiss]]. He thus once again named Hiss as a member of the Communist Party, but did not yet make any accusations of espionage. In subsequent HUAC sessions, Hiss testified and initially denied that he knew anyone by the name of Chambers, but on seeing him in person (and after it became clear that Chambers knew details about Hiss's life), said that he had known Chambers under the name \"George Crosley\". Hiss denied that he had ever been a Communist, however. Since Chambers still presented no evidence, the committee had initially been inclined to take the word of Hiss on the matter. However, committee member [[Richard Nixon]] received secret information from the FBI which had led him to pursue the issue. When it issued its report, HUAC described Hiss's testimony as \"vague and evasive\".\n<!-- breaks put in order to pop \"red herring\" section title to a better place.

Many liberals, in turn, saw the Hiss case as part of the desperation of the Republican party to regain the office of president, having been out of power for 16 years. Truman also issued [[Executive Order 9835]], which initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://trumanlibrary.org/executiveorders/index.php?pid=502 | title = Executive Order 9835 Prescribing Procedures For The Administration Of An Employees Loyalty Program In The Executive Branch Of The Government | last = Truman | first = Harry | date = 21 March 1947 | website = The Harry S.

Under pressure from Hiss's lawyers, Chambers finally retrieved his envelope of evidence and presented it to the HUAC after they subpoenaed them. It contained four notes in Alger Hiss's handwriting, sixty-five typewritten copies of State Department documents and five strips of microfilm, some of which contained photographs of State Department documents. The press came to call these the \"Pumpkin Papers\" referring to the fact that Chambers had briefly hidden the microfilm in a hollowed-out pumpkin. These documents indicated that Hiss knew Chambers long after mid-1936, when Hiss said he had last seen \"Crosley,\" and also that Hiss had engaged in espionage with Chambers. Chambers explained his delay in producing this evidence as an effort to spare an old friend from more trouble than necessary. Until October 1948, Chambers had repeatedly stated that Hiss had ''not'' engaged in espionage, even when Chambers testified under oath. Chambers was forced to testify at the Hiss trials that he had committed perjury several times, which reduced his credibility in the eyes of his critics.\n\nThe five rolls of 35&nbsp;mm film known as the \"pumpkin papers\" were thought until late 1974 to be locked in HUAC files. Independent researcher [[Stephen Salant|Stephen W. Salant]], an economist at the University of Michigan, sued the U.S. Justice Department in 1975 when his request for access to them under the Freedom of Information Act was denied. On July 31, 1975, as a result of this lawsuit and follow-on suits filed by Peter Irons and by Alger Hiss and William Reuben, the Justice Department released copies of the \"pumpkin papers\" that had been used to implicate Hiss. One roll of film turned out to be totally blank due to overexposure, two others are faintly legible copies of nonclassified Navy Department documents relating to such subjects as life rafts and fire extinguishers, and the remaining two are photographs of the State Department documents introduced by the prosecution at the two Hiss trials, relating to U.S./German relations in the late 1930s.<ref>\n{{cite news\n  | first = Tom\n  | last = Gold\n  | title = U.S. Releases Copies Of 'Pumpkin Papers'\n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/01/archives/us-releases-copies-of-pumpkinpapers-copies-of-pumpkin-papers.html\n  | newspaper=New York Times\n  | date = 1 August 1975\n  | accessdate = 31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis story, however, as reported by the ''New York Times'' in the 1970s, contains only a partial truth.

Instead, Hiss was indicted for two counts of [[perjury]] relating to testimony he had given before a [[Grand jury|federal grand jury]] the previous December. There he had denied giving any documents to Whittaker Chambers, and testified he had not seen Chambers after mid-1936.\n\nHiss was tried twice for perjury. The first trial, in June 1949, ended with the jury deadlocked eight to four for conviction. In addition to Chambers's testimony, a government expert testified that other papers typed on a typewriter belonging to the Hiss family matched the secret papers produced by Chambers. An impressive array of [[Character evidence|character witnesses]]<nowiki/> appeared on behalf of Hiss: two U.S. Supreme Court justices, [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], former Democratic presidential nominee [[John W. Davis]] and future Democratic presidential nominee [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].

He became increasingly disturbed by [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]], which began in 1936. He was also fearful for his own life, having noted the murder in Switzerland of [[Ignace Reiss]], a high-ranking Soviet spy who had broken with Stalin, and the disappearance of Chambers's friend and fellow spy [[Juliet Stuart Poyntz]] in the United States. Poyntz had vanished in 1937, shortly after she had visited Moscow and returned disillusioned with the Communist cause due to the Stalinist Purges.<ref>\n{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref>\n\nChambers ignored several orders that he travel to Moscow, worried that he might be \"purged.\" He also started concealing some of the documents he collected from his sources. He planned to use these, along with several rolls of microfilm photographs of documents, as a \"life preserver\" to prevent the Soviets from killing him and his family.<ref name=\"Witness\" />\n\nIn 1938, Chambers broke with Communism and took his family into hiding, storing the \"life preserver\" at the home of his nephew and his parents.

Berle]]. Levine had introduced Chambers to [[Walter Krivitsky]], who was already informing American and British authorities about Soviet agents who held posts in both governments. Krivitsky told Chambers it was their duty to inform.  Chambers agreed to reveal what he knew on the condition of immunity from prosecution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Weinstein|1997|p=292}}</ref> During the meeting, which took place at Berle's home, [[Woodley Mansion]] in Washington, Chambers named 18 current and former government employees as spies or Communist sympathizers. Many names mentioned held relatively minor posts or were already under suspicion. Some names, however, were more significant and surprising: Alger Hiss, his brother Donald Hiss, and Laurence Duggan\u2014who were all respected, mid-level officials in the State Department\u2014and [[Lauchlin Currie]], a special assistant to [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Another person named had worked on a top secret bombsight project at the [[Aberdeen Proving Grounds]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nBerle found Chambers' information tentative, unclear, and uncorroborated. He took the information to the White House, but the President dismissed it, to which Berle made little if any objection. Berle kept his notes, however (later, evidence during Hiss's perjury trials).<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanenhaus|1998|pp=163, 203\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nBerle notified the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) of Chambers's information in March 1940. In February 1941, Krivitsky was found dead in his hotel room. While police ruled the death a suicide, it was widely speculated that Krivitsky had been killed by Soviet intelligence. Worried that the Soviets might try to kill Chambers too, Berle again told the FBI about his interview with Chambers. The FBI interviewed Chambers in May 1942 and June 1945, but took no immediate action, in line with the political orientation of the United States, which viewed the potential threat from the [[USSR]] as minor, when compared to that of [[Nazi Germany]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Only in November 1945, when [[Elizabeth Bentley]] defected and corroborated much of Chambers's story, did the FBI begin to take Chambers seriously.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Olmsted\n  | first = Kathryn S.\n  | title = Red Spy Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth Bentley\n  | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press\n  | year = 2002\n  | page = 32\n  | isbn = 0-8078-2739-8}}</ref>\n\n===''Time''===\n[[File:Clare Boothe Luce and Henry Luce NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Luce]] and [[Clare Boothe Luce]] (here circa 1954) valued Chambers's writing]]\n\nBy the time of the Berle meeting, Chambers had come out of hiding after a year and joined the staff of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (April 1939).

There he gave the names of individuals he said were part of the underground \"[[Ware group]]\" in the late 1930s, including [[Alger Hiss]]. He thus once again named Hiss as a member of the Communist Party, but did not yet make any accusations of espionage. In subsequent HUAC sessions, Hiss testified and initially denied that he knew anyone by the name of Chambers, but on seeing him in person (and after it became clear that Chambers knew details about Hiss's life), said that he had known Chambers under the name \"George Crosley\". Hiss denied that he had ever been a Communist, however. Since Chambers still presented no evidence, the committee had initially been inclined to take the word of Hiss on the matter. However, committee member [[Richard Nixon]] received secret information from the FBI which had led him to pursue the issue.

Under pressure from Hiss's lawyers, Chambers finally retrieved his envelope of evidence and presented it to the HUAC after they subpoenaed them. It contained four notes in Alger Hiss's handwriting, sixty-five typewritten copies of State Department documents and five strips of microfilm, some of which contained photographs of State Department documents. The press came to call these the \"Pumpkin Papers\" referring to the fact that Chambers had briefly hidden the microfilm in a hollowed-out pumpkin. These documents indicated that Hiss knew Chambers long after mid-1936, when Hiss said he had last seen \"Crosley,\" and also that Hiss had engaged in espionage with Chambers. Chambers explained his delay in producing this evidence as an effort to spare an old friend from more trouble than necessary. Until October 1948, Chambers had repeatedly stated that Hiss had ''not'' engaged in espionage, even when Chambers testified under oath. Chambers was forced to testify at the Hiss trials that he had committed perjury several times, which reduced his credibility in the eyes of his critics.\n\nThe five rolls of 35&nbsp;mm film known as the \"pumpkin papers\" were thought until late 1974 to be locked in HUAC files. Independent researcher [[Stephen Salant|Stephen W. Salant]], an economist at the University of Michigan, sued the U.S. Justice Department in 1975 when his request for access to them under the Freedom of Information Act was denied. On July 31, 1975, as a result of this lawsuit and follow-on suits filed by Peter Irons and by Alger Hiss and William Reuben, the Justice Department released copies of the \"pumpkin papers\" that had been used to implicate Hiss. One roll of film turned out to be totally blank due to overexposure, two others are faintly legible copies of nonclassified Navy Department documents relating to such subjects as life rafts and fire extinguishers, and the remaining two are photographs of the State Department documents introduced by the prosecution at the two Hiss trials, relating to U.S./German relations in the late 1930s.<ref>\n{{cite news\n  | first = Tom\n  | last = Gold\n  | title = U.S. Releases Copies Of 'Pumpkin Papers'\n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/01/archives/us-releases-copies-of-pumpkinpapers-copies-of-pumpkin-papers.html\n  | newspaper=New York Times\n  | date = 1 August 1975\n  | accessdate = 31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis story, however, as reported by the ''New York Times'' in the 1970s, contains only a partial truth.

Instead, Hiss was indicted for two counts of [[perjury]] relating to testimony he had given before a [[Grand jury|federal grand jury]] the previous December. There he had denied giving any documents to Whittaker Chambers, and testified he had not seen Chambers after mid-1936.\n\nHiss was tried twice for perjury. The first trial, in June 1949, ended with the jury deadlocked eight to four for conviction. In addition to Chambers's testimony, a government expert testified that other papers typed on a typewriter belonging to the Hiss family matched the secret papers produced by Chambers. An impressive array of [[Character evidence|character witnesses]]<nowiki/> appeared on behalf of Hiss: two U.S. Supreme Court justices, [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], former Democratic presidential nominee [[John W. Davis]] and future Democratic presidential nominee [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. Chambers, on the other hand, was attacked by Hiss's attorneys as \"an enemy of the Republic, a blasphemer of Christ, a disbeliever in God, with no respect for matrimony or motherhood\".<ref name=Linder/> In the second trial, Hiss's defense produced a psychiatrist who characterized Chambers as a \"[[psychopath]]ic<nowiki/> personality\" and \"a [[pathological liar]]\".<ref>\n{{Harvnb|Weinstein|1997|pp=487, 493}}</ref>\n\nThe second trial ended in January 1950 with Hiss found guilty on both counts of perjury. He was sentenced to [[Alger Hiss#Incarceration|five years in prison]].\n\nChambers had resigned from ''Time'' in December 1948.

A moult in June changes the bird's plumage to an eclipse pattern, which lasts through October.

The film was followed by a spin-off [[Clueless (TV series)|television sitcom]], [[Clueless (novels)|series of books]], and Paramount Studios has announced that they are producing a remake.\n\n==Plot==\nCher Horowitz lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a $500-an-hour [[litigator]]; her mother died during a routine [[liposuction]] procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher is attractive, popular, and wealthy. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend, Dionne Davenport, who is also wealthy and beautiful. Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray; Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor for Dionne.\n\nJosh, Cher's socially conscious ex-stepbrother, visits her during a break from college. They spar continually but playfully. She mocks his idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain and superficial, saying that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\". Cher plays matchmaker for two hard-grading teachers at her school, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She facilitates the relationship between the teachers to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad grade on her report card. After she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. She then decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"tragically [[Hip (slang)|unhip]]\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover, which gives Tai confidence and a sense of style. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her towards Elton, a popular and wealthy student.\n\nElton rejects Tai and fails to seduce Cher. A handsome new student at their school named Christian becomes Cher's target boyfriend. Murray explains to Cher and Dionne that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on friendly terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Tai's newfound popularity strains her relationship with Cher. Cher's frustration escalates when she fails her driving test and cannot change the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confesses her feelings for Josh and wants Cher's help in pursuing him. Cher says Tai is not right for Josh and they quarrel. Their disagreement ends with Tai calling Cher a \"virgin who can't drive\". Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.\n\nAfter thinking about why she is bothered by Tai's interest in Josh, Cher realizes that she loves him. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort. Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss. Ultimately, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love and Cher catches the wedding bouquet, helping Josh win a $200 bet. She embraces Josh and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{See also|List of Clueless characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Cher Horowitz\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne Davenport\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Tai Frasier\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Josh Lucas\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Melvin \"Mel\" Horowitz (\"Hamilton\" in the credits)\n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n* [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]] as Christian Stovitz\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Wendell Hall\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Ms. Toby Geist\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Stoeger\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall, Dionne's long-term boyfriend\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Travis Birkenstock\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Elton Tiscia\n*[[Nicole Bilderback]] as Summer Han\n*Sean Holland as Lawrence\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to the special feature titled \"''Creative Writing''\", Heckerling describes the origins of ''Clueless'' as follows:\n{{quote|I went to [[20th Century Fox]] and they said \"We want you to do something about teenagers.\" And I thought \"I'm so tired about doing stuff about teenagers.\" But they said, \"We want you to do something about the 'in' crowd.\" I thought \"I'll do it if I can make fun of them.\" So, we developed this script. It was a pilot for a TV show. And it was about this girl that was completely happy, no matter what happened. And I was really getting into that kind of character. But nothing happened with it. They passed on it, they didn't get it. And a number of things were sort of falling through. I was just getting very frustrated. So I switched agents and when I had my new agent, they said: \"What have you been working on?\" So I showed Ken Stovitz, one of the agents there, this pilot. And he said, \"This is too good for TV. You should make this into a feature.\"<ref name=\"Creative\">{{cite news|url=https://vimeo.com/343465997|title=''Clueless'' - Creative Writing|publisher=[[Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>}}\n\nShe follows up on the connections to the [[Jane Austen]] novel, ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'':\n{{quote|I started to think, \"What's the larger context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through rose colored glasses' kind of girl?\" And I remembered ''Emma'', which I'd read in college. So, I took it out and reread it, and I said: \"Unconsciously, I've been writing an Emma-like character.\" Because I've always loved it and part of it had sort of stored it away in my brain... So I really related to her and got into it. And the plot was so brilliantly laid out in ''Emma''. So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"Creative\" />}} \n\nAssociate producer [[Twink Caplan]] recalls what the proposed TV show's initial title:\n{{quote|''No Worries'' was the original television script that Amy wrote. Then, we went to ''I Was a Teenage Teenager'' because with every new draft that Amy writes, she picks a whole new title.<ref name=\"Creative\" />}}\n\nFox picked up the picture, but put the film in a [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. The male studio heads wanted Heckerling to rewrite the script so that fewer women would feature. Six months later, the script made its way to producer [[Scott Rudin]]. Rudin like the script and it was the subject of a bidding war, with [[Paramount Pictures]] beating out the other studios. Heckerling was excited, as Paramount owned several major youth-centered channels, such as [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]], which was suited to the film's target demographic.<ref name=\"Creative\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Westfield Fashion Square.JPG|Westfield Fashion Square|thumb|150px|The Westfield Fashion Square]]\nPrincipal photography for the film took place between November 21 and December 31, 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alicia Silverstone Stars in 'Clueless,' A Romantic Comedy Written and Directed by Amy Heckelilng|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ALICIA+SILVERSTONE+STARS+IN+'CLUELESS,'+A+ROMANTIC+COMEDY+WRITTEN+AND...-a015982332|website = thefreelibrary.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}</ref> The film had a 40-day filming schedule.

This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school's Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of their actions nor their feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightly until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.\n\n'''Josh/Mr. Knightley''' \u2013 Cher's stepbrother, who she finds utterly repulsive. She states at the beginning of the movie that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker on a near constant basis. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and life choices. It is not until the end of the movie it is revealed that Josh is in love with Cher and the two share a passionate kiss. \n\n'''Miss Geist/Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston''' \u2013 Target of Cher's matchmaking.\n\n'''Tai/Harriet Smith''' \u2013 Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, much to Cher's jealousy. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard riding, pot smoker social recluse though is encouraged by Cher to strive for someone more socially well off, as Travis is not considered to be a socially acceptable partner. Following this advice, Tai then falls for Josh, much to even more of Cher's Jealousy.\n\n'''Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse''' \u2013 Just as in the book, Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a [[valetudinarian]]. Both characters are shown to love their daughter greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.\n\n'''Travis/Robert Martin''' \u2013 A stoner and a skater who falls for Tai by the end of the film; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher's attempts to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, constantly late for class and often receiving poor grades.\n\n'''Elton Tascia/Philip Elton''' \u2013 Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.\n\n'''Christian/Frank Churchill''' \u2013 The initially appealing love interest of Cher with whom she convinces herself she must be in love (just like the Frank Churchill character in the book). In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.\n\n==Home media==\n''Clueless'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on December 19, 1995 by [[Paramount Home Video]]. It was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 19, 1999.

The film was followed by a spin-off [[Clueless (TV series)|television sitcom]], [[Clueless (novels)|series of books]], and Paramount Studios has announced that they are producing a remake.\n\n==Plot==\nCher Horowitz lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a $500-an-hour [[litigator]]; her mother died during a routine [[liposuction]] procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher is attractive, popular, and wealthy. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend, Dionne Davenport, who is also wealthy and beautiful. Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray; Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor for Dionne.\n\nJosh, Cher's socially conscious ex-stepbrother, visits her during a break from college. They spar continually but playfully. She mocks his idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain and superficial, saying that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\". Cher plays matchmaker for two hard-grading teachers at her school, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She facilitates the relationship between the teachers to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad grade on her report card. After she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. She then decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"tragically [[Hip (slang)|unhip]]\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover, which gives Tai confidence and a sense of style. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her towards Elton, a popular and wealthy student.\n\nElton rejects Tai and fails to seduce Cher. A handsome new student at their school named Christian becomes Cher's target boyfriend. Murray explains to Cher and Dionne that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on friendly terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Tai's newfound popularity strains her relationship with Cher. Cher's frustration escalates when she fails her driving test and cannot change the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confesses her feelings for Josh and wants Cher's help in pursuing him. Cher says Tai is not right for Josh and they quarrel. Their disagreement ends with Tai calling Cher a \"virgin who can't drive\". Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.\n\nAfter thinking about why she is bothered by Tai's interest in Josh, Cher realizes that she loves him. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort. Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss. Ultimately, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love and Cher catches the wedding bouquet, helping Josh win a $200 bet. She embraces Josh and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{See also|List of Clueless characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Cher Horowitz\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne Davenport\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Tai Frasier\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Josh Lucas\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Melvin \"Mel\" Horowitz (\"Hamilton\" in the credits)\n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n* [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]] as Christian Stovitz\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Wendell Hall\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Ms. Toby Geist\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Stoeger\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall, Dionne's long-term boyfriend\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Travis Birkenstock\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Elton Tiscia\n*[[Nicole Bilderback]] as Summer Han\n*Sean Holland as Lawrence\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to the special feature titled \"''Creative Writing''\", Heckerling describes the origins of ''Clueless'' as follows:\n{{quote|I went to [[20th Century Fox]] and they said \"We want you to do something about teenagers.\" And I thought \"I'm so tired about doing stuff about teenagers.\" But they said, \"We want you to do something about the 'in' crowd.\" I thought \"I'll do it if I can make fun of them.\" So, we developed this script. It was a pilot for a TV show. And it was about this girl that was completely happy, no matter what happened. And I was really getting into that kind of character. But nothing happened with it. They passed on it, they didn't get it. And a number of things were sort of falling through. I was just getting very frustrated. So I switched agents and when I had my new agent, they said: \"What have you been working on?\" So I showed Ken Stovitz, one of the agents there, this pilot. And he said, \"This is too good for TV. You should make this into a feature.\"<ref name=\"Creative\">{{cite news|url=https://vimeo.com/343465997|title=''Clueless'' - Creative Writing|publisher=[[Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>}}\n\nShe follows up on the connections to the [[Jane Austen]] novel, ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'':\n{{quote|I started to think, \"What's the larger context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through rose colored glasses' kind of girl?\" And I remembered ''Emma'', which I'd read in college. So, I took it out and reread it, and I said: \"Unconsciously, I've been writing an Emma-like character.\" Because I've always loved it and part of it had sort of stored it away in my brain... So I really related to her and got into it. And the plot was so brilliantly laid out in ''Emma''. So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"Creative\" />}} \n\nAssociate producer [[Twink Caplan]] recalls what the proposed TV show's initial title:\n{{quote|''No Worries'' was the original television script that Amy wrote. Then, we went to ''I Was a Teenage Teenager'' because with every new draft that Amy writes, she picks a whole new title.<ref name=\"Creative\" />}}\n\nFox picked up the picture, but put the film in a [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. The male studio heads wanted Heckerling to rewrite the script so that fewer women would feature. Six months later, the script made its way to producer [[Scott Rudin]]. Rudin like the script and it was the subject of a bidding war, with [[Paramount Pictures]] beating out the other studios. Heckerling was excited, as Paramount owned several major youth-centered channels, such as [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]], which was suited to the film's target demographic.<ref name=\"Creative\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Westfield Fashion Square.JPG|Westfield Fashion Square|thumb|150px|The Westfield Fashion Square]]\nPrincipal photography for the film took place between November 21 and December 31, 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alicia Silverstone Stars in 'Clueless,' A Romantic Comedy Written and Directed by Amy Heckelilng|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ALICIA+SILVERSTONE+STARS+IN+'CLUELESS,'+A+ROMANTIC+COMEDY+WRITTEN+AND...-a015982332|website = thefreelibrary.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}</ref> The film had a 40-day filming schedule.

This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school's Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of their actions nor their feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightly until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.\n\n'''Josh/Mr. Knightley''' \u2013 Cher's stepbrother, who she finds utterly repulsive. She states at the beginning of the movie that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker on a near constant basis. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and life choices. It is not until the end of the movie it is revealed that Josh is in love with Cher and the two share a passionate kiss. \n\n'''Miss Geist/Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston''' \u2013 Target of Cher's matchmaking.\n\n'''Tai/Harriet Smith''' \u2013 Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, much to Cher's jealousy. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard riding, pot smoker social recluse though is encouraged by Cher to strive for someone more socially well off, as Travis is not considered to be a socially acceptable partner. Following this advice, Tai then falls for Josh, much to even more of Cher's Jealousy.\n\n'''Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse''' \u2013 Just as in the book, Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a [[valetudinarian]]. Both characters are shown to love their daughter greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.\n\n'''Travis/Robert Martin''' \u2013 A stoner and a skater who falls for Tai by the end of the film; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher's attempts to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, constantly late for class and often receiving poor grades.\n\n'''Elton Tascia/Philip Elton''' \u2013 Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.\n\n'''Christian/Frank Churchill''' \u2013 The initially appealing love interest of Cher with whom she convinces herself she must be in love (just like the Frank Churchill character in the book). In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.\n\n==Home media==\n''Clueless'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on December 19, 1995 by [[Paramount Home Video]]. It was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 19, 1999.
